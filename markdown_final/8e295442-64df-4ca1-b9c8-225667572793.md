## Question

What does a high T4 but low T3 mean in a patient on levothyroxine post thyroidectomy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a high free T4 with low free T3 means in a post-thyroidectomy patient on levothyroxine, and how to interpret that pattern clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the expected biochemical pattern after total thyroidectomy and LT4 monotherapy. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology explaining high T4 with low T3 despite a normal TSH. Next, I will review the clinical significance, including symptoms and metabolic markers. After that, I need to check guideline positions and the strength of evidence for LT4+LT3 combination therapy. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise management plan and monitoring strategy, making sure I confirm adherence, absorption, and confounders before escalating therapy [^113Fad1b].

> Let me first confirm the typical biochemical pattern in athyreotic patients on LT4. In the absence of thyroidal T3 production, patients rely on peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion; when TSH is normalized with LT4, FT4 is often higher than pre-thyroidectomy levels while FT3 is relatively lower, yielding a higher T4:T3 ratio and, in a subset, FT3 at the low end or below the reference interval despite a normal TSH, which is a recognized phenomenon in LT4-treated hypothyroidism [^112LyXKu] [^114wGc2M] [^111MZC9u].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism before drawing conclusions. The thyroid normally secretes about 20% of circulating T3, so after thyroidectomy that source is lost; LT4 monotherapy increases serum T4, which can downregulate type 2 deiodinase (D2) in peripheral tissues, thereby reducing local T3 generation and contributing to a relative T3 deficiency at the tissue level even when serum TSH is normal, a concept supported by animal and human data and by observations that higher FT4 levels show diminishing returns in raising serum T3 [^114shraW] [^114z2paj] [^111MZC9u].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical impact. I should confirm how often this biochemical discordance correlates with symptoms and metabolic changes. Studies suggest that 10–20% of LT4-treated patients remain symptomatic with normal TSH, and in athyreotic cohorts, low FT3 with normal TSH has been associated with unfavorable lipid profiles and bone turnover markers, implying tissue-level underexposure to T3 in some patients, although causality and assay variability remain debated [^111jJi9V] [^111k1xKs] [^114shraW].

> I need to check guideline positions carefully. The ATA advises that TSH normalization is the primary target for LT4 therapy and states there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine targeting of T3 or routine combination therapy; however, a weak recommendation allows considering a monitored trial of LT4+LT3 in select symptomatic patients after excluding other causes, and ETA guidance emphasizes maintaining the same LT4 brand and reassessing if formulations change, which can materially affect TSH and interpretation of labs [^112nS3BQ] [^112JaoNb] [^111wnznq] [^113YhKa3].

> Let me consider the evidence for combination therapy before proposing it. Randomized trials have not consistently shown superiority of LT4+LT3 over LT4 alone for quality of life or psychometric outcomes, though some patients report preference for regimens containing T3; mechanistic and small studies suggest potential benefit in those with impaired deiodination or persistent symptoms, but high-quality, long-term data are lacking and T3's short half-life complicates physiologic replacement, so shared decision-making is essential [^114JbqvH] [^114PQwXT] [^111jJi9V] [^115izZ2e].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise approach. First, I need to ensure adherence and proper administration (fasting, consistent brand, separated from calcium/iron/food), then recheck TSH, FT4, and FT3 after 6–8 weeks; if FT4 is high and FT3 low with normal TSH, I should consider modestly reducing LT4 to mitigate T4-driven D2 suppression and reassess symptoms and FT3, recognizing that only about one-third of patients are euthyroid at first follow-up after thyroidectomy regardless of initial dosing strategy, so iterative adjustments are expected [^111wnznq] [^115VXdZg] [^117Cbnhv].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite optimized LT4 and confirmed adherence. In that scenario, after excluding alternative etiologies (sleep, mood, nutrition, cardiopulmonary, adrenal, sex steroids, GI disease), a time-limited, carefully monitored trial of LT4+LT3 can be considered; typical ratios range from about 10:1 to 14:1 (T4:T3), with small LT3 doses (for example, 5–10 mcg/day) and a compensatory reduction in LT4 to avoid overtreatment, with close follow-up of symptoms, TSH, FT4, and FT3, and discontinuation if no clear benefit emerges [^112nS3BQ] [^112cFLZw] [^115a2k8B].

> I should double-check special contexts that can worsen this pattern. Obesity, certain medications, and genetic variation in deiodinases may blunt T4-to-T3 conversion; in obesity, dose per lean body mass may better predict requirements, and in selected cases of impaired conversion (for example, during TKI therapy), intentionally lowering LT4 while adding a small amount of LT3 has been used to normalize the FT3:FT4 ratio while keeping TSH at target, though this is hypothesis-driven and requires caution [^115WZHmC] [^117Tg8uj] [^113TkG8G].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line. High FT4 with low FT3 on LT4 after thyroidectomy reflects the loss of thyroidal T3 and T4-driven downregulation of peripheral D2, producing a higher T4:T3 ratio and, in some, relative T3 deficiency; most patients are clinically fine with TSH-guided LT4, but a minority have persistent symptoms or adverse metabolic markers, and after verifying adherence and absorption, a cautious, time-limited trial of LT4+LT3 may be reasonable in shared decision-making, with prompt cessation if ineffective [^112LyXKu] [^114wGc2M] [^112nS3BQ] [^111jJi9V].

High T4 with low T3 on levothyroxine after thyroidectomy reflects **impaired peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion** [^114shraW] due to absent thyroidal T3, downregulation of type 2 deiodinase by high T4 [^114shraW], and altered deiodinase activity [^115WHe6n]. This pattern is common in athyreotic patients [^111mJoA2] and can cause persistent symptoms despite normal TSH [^111MZC9u]. Management should **confirm adherence and absorption** [^115tZkxQ], consider switching to liquid LT4 [^115tZkxQ], and, if symptoms persist, trial low-dose LT3 (5–10 mcg/day) with reduced LT4 [^notfound] to normalize T3:T4 ratio and improve symptoms [^114jLber].

## Physiological basis of high T4 and low T3 levels

### Absence of thyroidal T3 production

After total thyroidectomy, the thyroid gland is removed, eliminating its contribution to circulating T3. Normally, about **20% of T3 is secreted directly by the thyroid gland** [^111mJoA2], while the remaining 80% is produced by peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. In athyreotic patients, all T3 must be generated peripherally from exogenous T4, which can lead to relative T3 deficiency if peripheral conversion is impaired [^112LyXKu].

---

### Impaired peripheral conversion of T4 to T3

Peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 is catalyzed by type 1 (D1) and type 2 (D2) deiodinase enzymes. High levels of exogenous T4 from levothyroxine therapy can suppress D2 activity through negative feedback, **reducing T3 production** and contributing to a high T4 and low T3 profile [^114shraW] [^114z2paj].

---

### Altered deiodinase activity

Recent studies have demonstrated that **altered deiodinase activity**, particularly decreased D2 activity, is common in athyreotic patients on levothyroxine therapy [^115WHe6n]. This alteration further impairs peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion, exacerbating the discrepancy between high T4 and low T3 levels [^114z2paj].

---

## Clinical significance of high T4 and low T3 levels

### Persistent hypothyroid symptoms

Despite normalization of TSH levels, many patients on levothyroxine monotherapy continue to experience hypothyroid symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive impairment, and mood disturbances [^111MZC9u]. This phenomenon is often attributed to the **relative T3 deficiency** resulting from impaired peripheral conversion [^114shraW].

---

### Metabolic implications

High T4 and low T3 levels have been associated with altered lipid metabolism, including elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and may contribute to increased cardiovascular risk [^1146tgfJ]. Additionally, this biochemical pattern may affect bone metabolism, potentially increasing the risk of osteoporosis [^114shraW].

---

## Management strategies

### Confirm adherence and absorption

Before considering changes in therapy, it is essential to confirm patient adherence to levothyroxine therapy and evaluate potential absorption issues. Factors such as **interactions with calcium or iron supplements**, gastrointestinal disorders, and inconsistent medication timing can significantly affect levothyroxine absorption and efficacy [^115tZkxQ].

---

### Adjust levothyroxine formulation and timing

Switching from tablet to liquid levothyroxine formulation can improve absorption and bioavailability, potentially normalizing thyroid hormone levels without increasing the dose [^115tZkxQ]. Additionally, **consistent timing of levothyroxine administration**, preferably on an empty stomach, can enhance absorption and stability of thyroid hormone levels [^111VuVb1].

---

### Consider combination therapy with liothyronine (T3)

For patients with persistent symptoms despite normalized TSH, combination therapy with **levothyroxine and liothyronine (T3)** may be considered [^114PQwXT]. Clinical trials have demonstrated that adding a small dose of T3 (**5–10 mcg/day**) to levothyroxine therapy can improve symptoms and quality of life in a subset of patients [^notfound]. However, combination therapy requires careful monitoring due to the risk of overtreatment and potential adverse effects, particularly **cardiovascular risks** associated with supraphysiological T3 levels [^notfound].

---

### Monitor thyroid function tests regularly

Regular monitoring of thyroid function tests, including TSH, free T4, and free T3, is essential to ensure optimal hormone replacement therapy. Adjustments to levothyroxine or combination therapy should be based on **both biochemical parameters and clinical symptoms** [^113Fad1b].

---

## Conclusion

High T4 and low T3 levels in patients on **levothyroxine** after thyroidectomy are primarily due to the absence of thyroidal T3 production, impaired peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, and altered deiodinase activity [^112LyXKu] [^114z2paj] [^114shraW]. This biochemical pattern can lead to persistent **hypothyroid symptoms** and metabolic disturbances despite normalized TSH levels. Management strategies include confirming adherence and absorption, adjusting levothyroxine formulation and timing, and considering **combination therapy with liothyronine (T3)** for select patients [^113TfG7K] [^113YhKa3] [^111VuVb1] [^112nS3BQ]. Regular monitoring of thyroid function tests and clinical symptoms is essential to optimize therapy and improve patient outcomes [^112UcR3F].

Context

It is well recognized that some hypothyroid patients on levothyroxine (LT4) remain symptomatic, but why patients are susceptible to this condition, why symptoms persist, and what is the role of combination therapy with LT4 and liothyronine (LT3), are questions that remain unclear. Here we explore evidence of abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) metabolism in LT4-treated patients, and offer a rationale for why some patients perceive LT4 therapy as a failure.

Evidence Acquisition

This review is based on a collection of primary and review literature gathered from a PubMed search of "hypothyroidism", "levothyroxine", "liothyronine", and "desiccated thyroid extract", among other keywords. PubMed searches were supplemented by Google Scholar and the authors' prior knowledge of the subject.

Evidence Synthesis

In most LT4-treated patients, normalization of serum thyrotropin levels results in decreased serum T3/T4 ratio, with relatively lower serum T3 levels; in at least 15% of the cases, serum T3 levels are below normal. These changes can lead to a reduction in TH action, which would explain the slower rate of metabolism and elevated serum cholesterol levels. A small percentage of patients might also experience persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism, with impaired cognition and tiredness. We propose that such patients carry a key clinical factor, for example, specific genetic and/or immunologic makeup, that is well compensated while the thyroid function is normal but might become apparent when compounded with relatively lower serum T3 levels.

Conclusions

After excluding other explanations, physicians should openly discuss and consider therapy with LT4 and LT3 with those hypothyroid patients who have persistent symptoms or metabolic abnormalities despite normalization of serum thyrotropin level. New clinical trials focused on symptomatic patients, genetic makeup, and comorbidities, with the statistical power to identify differences between monotherapy and combination therapy, are needed.

Levothyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations — clinical significance of within‑reference‑range T3 changes: The significance of perturbations in serum triiodothyronine concentrations within the reference range or of mildly low serum triiodothyronine concentrations is unknown. According to the current model, normalizing serum thyroid‑stimulating hormone (TSH) is generally considered the target of therapy, and serum T3 is typically not measured or monitored, and direct evidence on whether small decrements in plasma T3 have clinically important sequelae is lacking. Some data in humans suggest maintenance of serum T3 concentrations is clinically important; for example, in one study of 15 athyreotic patients taking LT4, a progressive 50% fall in T3 induced by PTU over 8 days led to a doubling of TSH even though T4 was constant.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^1156ZVou]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Total thyroidectomy requires lifelong replacement therapy with levothyroxine (LT4). Achieving optimal thyroid hormones replacement promptly after surgery is important but somehow challenging. Indeed, previous studies addressing this topic clearly indicate that a significant proportion of patients who are started on LT4 therapy for postthyroidectomy hypothyroidism require multiple dose adjustments over time. The clinical scenario is thus how we should choose the starting LT4 dose in patients just after total thyroidectomy to warrant the highest rate of euthyroidism at the first postsurgery evaluation. While initial investigations used fixed LT4 doses, revised and eventually adjusted at early follow-up, more recent studies propose potential tailored approaches to more precisely estimate the optimal LT4 dose. Current clinical guidelines on the treatment of primary hypothyroidism recommend that when choosing a starting dose of LT4, several factors including patient's weight, lean body mass, etiology of hypothyroidism, degree of thyrotropin elevation, age, and comorbidities (ie, particularly cardiac diseases) should all be taken into account. Most papers suggest that in athyreotic patients, a starting LT4 dose of 1.6 to 1.8 mcg/kg of body weight would be adequate, even though other authors have advocated for a higher starting dose of 2.0 to 2.1 mcg/kg, at least in selected settings.

There is general agreement that the etiology sustaining hypothyroidism impacts on the optimal LT4 dose, making athyreotic patients, owing to the lack of residual functional thyroid tissue, more likely to require a higher LT4 dose as compared to patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Furthermore, the therapeutic target of TSH may vary in relation to the underlying condition, such as in patients with thyroid cancer who may require higher LT4 doses (ie, TSH-suppressive therapy). In addition, from the patient's standpoint, promptly achieving euthyroidism can provide clinical benefits in terms of both well-being and reduction of further clinical consultations. Although the number of studies in this field is significant, no clear and solid information is available about the optimal LT4 starting dose to be used in athyreotic subjects with no (or at least minor) need for further adjustment over time.

This study was undertaken to systematically review the literature for achieving more robust evidence on the optimal LT4 dose to be prescribed to athyreotic patients just after total thyroidectomy. The primary outcome was to assess the proportion of patients who achieve euthyroidism under the initial LT4 dose. Secondary outcomes include comparing different dose-choosing methods and stratifying results by patient setting, which may require specific TSH targets.

Hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine (LT4) — serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels relative to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) normalization are described as follows: Patients with hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine to achieve normal serum TSH values may have serum triiodothyronine concentrations that are at the lower end of the reference range, or even below the reference range, and the clinical significance of this is unknown. LT4 is an effective, convenient, and cost-effective treatment for hypothyroidism. The evidence base includes at least eight studies examining serum T3 levels in humans being treated with LT4, although only two were prospective. In cross-sectional comparisons, despite similar TSH values, LT4-treated patients had significantly lower T3 concentrations than controls.

Abstract

Background

Total thyroidectomy requires lifelong levothyroxine (LT4) therapy. Achieving optimal thyroid hormone replacement at the first postoperative follow-up might be harder than expected. Despite the various LT4 dose-choosing strategies tested, there is no consensus on the most effective approach to achieve early euthyroidism.

Materials and Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, including studies published between 2000 and 2024 that reported the proportion of patients achieving euthyroidism at first follow-up after total thyroidectomy. Data from 11 studies comprising 2577 patients were analyzed. LT4 dosing strategies included fixed-dose, weight-based (dose/kg), and individualized algorithm-based methods. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were used to explore sources of heterogeneity.

Results

The pooled euthyroidism rate at first follow-up was 33.9%, with high heterogeneity across studies (I 2 = 82.68%). No dosing strategy consistently outperformed others: dose/kg methods achieved 29% euthyroidism, while fixed or algorithm-based approaches achieved 40%, though without statistical significance. Meta-regression analysis did not identify any statistically significant predictor. No significant differences emerged between patients treated for benign or malignant thyroid diseases or between retrospective and prospective study designs.

Conclusion

Only about one-third of patients achieve euthyroidism at first follow-up after thyroidectomy, regardless of LT4 dosing strategy. The current guidelines recommendation of applying a pro/kg dose may not be adequate, and even personalized algorithms yield inconsistent results. Future prospective studies are needed to refine individualized dosing protocols and identify additional factors influencing LT4 requirements.

Study Quality Assessment

The risk of bias in included studies was independently assessed by 2 authors (I.C. and P.C.) according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Studies. Each domain was assigned a low, high, not applicable, or not reported score.

Statistical Analysis

Proportion meta-analyses from at least 4 study series were performed to calculate the pooled proportion of patients with "at target TSH" among those initially enrolled with the same LT4 starting dose strategy. The proportion calculation was repeated considering specific subgroups. Heterogeneity was assessed by using I 2, and a value ≥ 50% defined the presence of heterogeneity. A random-effects model was used. Pooled data were reported with 95% confidence intervals. When heterogeneity was found, it was explored by subgroup and meta-regression analyses using several covariates. In subgroup analyses, a significant difference was defined when the 95% confidence interval of the 2 groups did not overlap. Statistical significance was set at P < .05. Statistical analyses were performed using Open Meta [Analyst] software (open-source software developed by the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health, Brown University).

1 INTRODUCTION

Levothyroxine (L‐T4) therapy has a long record in clinical use, with a defined pharmacological profile and safety in hypothyroidism management. Obesity and thyroid disorders are common among the general population and may be associated with both clinical and molecular aspects. This relationship has become epidemiologically relevant in the context of the significantly increased prevalence of obesity worldwide. However, treatment for obese patients with subclinical or overt hypothyroidism is still under definition regarding both the threshold and modality (liquid L‐T4 vs. pills; L‐T4 monotherapy vs. liothyronine [L‐T3]/L‐T4 combinations). The prerequisite for treatment with L‐T4 is the presence of hypothyroidism, and the goal is restoration of euthyroidism. Achievement of a thyrotropin‐stimulating hormone (TSH) value within the age‐adjusted euthyroid range is the accepted therapeutic target, as several studies indicate improvement in symptoms, quality of life and cardiovascular risk. However, among euthyroid subjects, TSH levels usually correlate with body mass index (BMI), being higher in obese than in normal subjects.TSH elevation in obese euthyroid people may be a compensatory mechanism in the pituitary‐thyroid axis aimed at increasing energy expenditure. At variance with TSH, the correlation between BMI and thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) is not clear, as several studies obtained conflicting results. Some studies indicate that BMI is negatively related to FT4 and positively related to FT3. Another study, by contrast, indicated hyperactivation of the pituitary‐thyroid axis with increased FT4 levels in obese patients. Other studies describe a decreased FT4/FT3 ratio in obese patients. This adaptation of thyroid hormone homeostasis in obese subjects has been attributed to leptin and insulin actions. The observation of higher TSH and lower FT4 in obese euthyroid people is in accordance with increased L‐thyroxine replacement dose in hypothyroid obese patients. L‐T4 replacement therapy is approximately 1.6 μg/kg in hypothyroid patients with any functional thyroid tissue, while in obese patients, the correct T4 replacement dose is more variable. Recently, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) task force identified obesity as a morbid condition implying an increase in the L‐T4 replacement dose because of reduced thyroid hormone absorption. This observation is reinforced by the evidence that in obese subjects, acute overload of L‐T4 administration takes longer to achieve a plasmatic concentration peak in comparison with nonobese people. However, a recent study indicated that in obese thyroidectomized patients, the L‐T4 replacement dose is positively related to lean body mass. Indeed, the ideal body weight (IBW) should be preferred to real body weight (RBW) for L‐T4 dose titration because lean body mass results in a better predictor of T4 requirement than fat mass. Because of these controversial issues about the optimal T4 replacement dose in obese hypothyroid subjects and the great importance of thyroid hormones in energy homeostasis, glucose and lipid metabolism, body composition and resting energy expenditure (REE), we compared the correlation between L‐T4‐administered dose, thyroid hormone levels and TSH secretion with estimated basal metabolic rate (BMR) and total deiodinase activity (GD) in obese and nonobese athyreotic subjects. Moreover, we aimed to define individualized set points that might provide appropriate therapeutic and biochemical targets to be clinically tested in obese and nonobese patients.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, ETA 2018 guidelines recommend to suspect levothyroxine overtreatment in patients with CeH when serum fT4 concentrations are above or close to the ULN (provided that levothyroxine is taken after blood withdrawal), particularly when associated with clinical thyrotoxic manifestations or high T3 concentrations.

It is also important to note that there were studies we had to exclude from the analysis, such as those by Zaborek et al and Valenzuela et al, which proposed algorithms based on a retrospective analysis of their findings and hypothesized that these algorithms could bear favorable results. However, they examined a putative population without subsequent real-world testing.

Currently available literature data suggests that several patient-specific factors (ie, body weight, BMI, LBM, age, and sex) impact LT4 dose needs. However, the absence of a statistically significant association between BMI or age and target achievement in the meta-regression [Supplementary Material 4] highlights that BMI-based and age-based LT4 dosing alone is insufficient to warrant higher rates of euthyroidism, reinforcing the idea that multiple factors contribute to dosing variability. Furthermore, the present analysis included populations treated for both benign and malignant thyroid conditions. Although one might assume that different TSH targets could influence achievement rates, our analysis found no significant differences between patients treated for benign or malignant thyroid diseases, suggesting that even with lower TSH targets, achieving optimal levels remains challenging.

Postoperative thyroid hormone management — For patients rendered euthyroid preoperatively based on free T4 and T3 levels, antithyroid drugs (ATDs) should be discontinued after surgery and weight-based levothyroxine should be started; for patients hyperthyroid at the time of surgery, ATDs should be discontinued postoperatively and levothyroxine typically started 1 week after surgery; beta blockers, if used, should be weaned over several days.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^117E6WpG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

By trying to translate into real-world clinical practice the results of the present meta-analysis, the following points appear of potential relevance:

The rate of patients achieving euthyroidism at the first postsurgery evaluation is rather low (mean 33.9%), independently from the specific LT4 dose-choosing strategy.
Great heterogeneity was found across the included studies, in terms of study design, study population, and therapeutic intervention. However, rather than a limitation, this should be regarded as a strength for the meta-analytic approach, since it underscores the need for more standardized and well-designed studies. Furthermore, this approach allowed us to not only synthesize the current body of evidence but also highlight the great heterogeneities among studies, supporting the final message that there are currently no LT4 dose-choosing strategies that perform better than others.
The included studies lacked, in most cases, detailed information as to potential confounders including comorbidities, concomitant medications, patient's compliance, malabsorption, and genetic polymorphisms affecting thyroid hormone transporters or deiodinases. This might represent a limitation, but it should be highlighted that, due to the following considerations, this has not played a major confounder role. Indeed, included studies took into account general populations of thyroidectomized patients, which would translate into the fact that potentially "confounding conditions" would be equally represented in all the case series included and likely equally represented in studies adopting different strategies. Furthermore, it could be reasonably assumed that the vast majority of patients included in all of the studies would actually be free of potential confounders. Thus we could conclude that these confounding factors would not impact the overall final outcome.

### Serum thyroid hormone balance in levothyroxine monotherapy-treated patients with atrophic thyroid after radioiodine treatment for Graves' disease [^114shraW]. Thyroid (2019). Medium credibility.

In athyreotic or atrophic thyroid patients on LT4 after thyroidectomy or radioiodine treatment, patients with normal TSH levels had relatively low serum fT3 levels, whereas patients with mildly suppressed TSH levels had normal serum fT3 levels. The question arises as to which of such two patient groups is in a euthyroid condition. The extensive literature on "subclinical hyperthyroidism" has demonstrated an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, as well as low bone density and fractures in patients who have low TSH levels while receiving LT4. Moreover, in the athyreotic patients with normal TSH and low T3 levels, the relatively higher serum T4 levels that accompany LT4 monotherapy seem to result in normal T3 receptor occupancy and TSH in pituitary thyrotrophs. On the other hand, in peripheral tissues, the relatively higher serum T4 levels could impair intracellular T3 production via downregulation of D2. In fact, an animal study has shown that LT4 alone administered to thyroidectomized rats at doses to normalize plasma TSH levels does not normalize T3 contents in some tissues. In another study of rats, Werneck et al. reported that a combination of high serum T4 and low serum T3 levels during T4 monotherapy rats had consequences for thyroid hormone action, as reflected in the brain, liver, and skeletal muscle, all of which exhibited indications of hypothyroidism despite normal serum TSH levels. In a previous study conducted in humans, we compared serum levels of lipoproteins, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and bone metabolic markers before and after thyroidectomy. The postoperative serum SHBG and bone alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly increased in the patients with strongly suppressed TSH levels. The postoperative serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly increased and the serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b levels were significantly decreased in patients with normal TSH levels. In patients with mildly suppressed TSH and fT3 levels equivalent to their preoperative levels, all metabolic markers remained equivalent to their preoperative levels. Recently, in a large LT4-treated population with normal serum TSH, participants exhibited lower serum T3 levels and differed in terms of both objective and subjective measures. In addition, a meta-analysis performed by McAninch et al. showed that serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels remain high in LT4-treated euthyroid patients. Overall, the presence of biochemical markers of thyroid function in animal and human studies of LT4-treated athyreotic conditions suggests that patients with normal TSH might not be euthyroid in all tissues, whereas patients with a low TSH are less likely to have hyperthyroid symptoms.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^113NknJQ]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine targeting of triiodothyronine or thyrotropin levels: There is insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend that treatment with levothyroxine be targeted to achieve low-normal thyrotropin values or high-normal triiodothyronine values in patients with hypothyroidism who are overweight, those who have depression or dyslipidemia, or those who are athyreotic. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality of evidence. Supporting data include a 1-year study in which hypothyroid patients maintained low-normal or high-normal triiodothyronine (T3) had resultant T3 levels of 123 and 113 ng/dL with no decrement in cholesterol, BMI, or percentage body fat associated with the higher LT4, and a cross-over trial of 56 patients with primary hypothyroidism treated for 8-week periods with three doses of LT4 that achieved TSH values of 2.8, 1, and 0.3 mIU/L and free T3 values of 2.5, 2.7, and 3.1 pg/mL, in which psychologic well-being, treatment satisfaction, and body weight did not change across the three different groups; although there was progressive lowering of total cholesterol with higher free T3 values, the significance of this reduction seemed to be due to lowering of cholesterol in the group that included many long-term patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, and retrospective data found no significant weight changes after LT4 replacement or suppressive doses in postsurgical hypothyroidism.

### Does combination T4 and T3 therapy make sense? [^114JbMTU]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the existing evidence regarding the combined use of levothyroxine and liothyronine to treat hypothyroidism.

Methods

Eleven published randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of combined levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy for hypothyroidism were reviewed and summarized. Related basic and clinical research findings were also incorporated for perspective.

Results

An initial randomized controlled trial reported symptomatic improvement in hypothyroid patients taking combined levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy compared with those taking levothyroxine therapy alone. Subsequently, multiple relatively small randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate any subjective or objective benefit from combined levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy. A polymorphism (Thr92Ala) in the gene encoding the deiodinase 2 (D2) enzyme that converts thyroxine to triiodothyronine in the brain was later identified in about 16% of hypothyroid persons. This polymorphism may impair brain deiodinase activity in the presence of low brain thyroxine levels. One randomized controlled trial found that patients with the D2 Thr92Ala polymorphism had more baseline symptoms than those with the wild type D2 and experienced significantly greater symptomatic improvement in response to combined levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy.

Conclusions

Most hypothyroid patients experience rapid symptomatic relief after institution of levothyroxine replacement therapy, but persistent symptoms remain in some despite what appears to be adequate levothyroxine therapy with normalization of the serum thyrotropin level. A thorough investigation is warranted in these patients to detect and treat other responsible lifestyle issues, medical conditions, and endocrine conditions. A subset of hypothyroid patients has a polymorphism in the gene encoding the D2 enzyme that may prevent full resolution of symptoms with levothyroxine therapy alone; these patients may benefit from combination levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy.

### Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the combined preparation of levothyroxine plus sustained-release liothyronine; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^115bXReC]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Levothyroxine monotherapy is considered the standard of care for hypothyroidism by professional organizations, whereby the patients achieve the state of euthyroidism through the normalization of TSH, a reliable proxy of euthyroidism. In euthyroid individuals, 80% of T3 (25 µg) is generated from T4 to T3 conversion in kidney and liver cells and 20% (5 µg) is secreted from the thyroid gland. Using levothyroxine (L-T4) alone is expected to be a suitable strategy owing to the peripheral conversion of the pro-hormone T4 into the hormonally active T3 by the deiodinase. Of interest, while this treatment modality is safe, well-tolerated, and extremely effective in normalizing TSH, it may not be sufficient to account for the normal thyroidal secretion of T3 and T4. Approximately 10% lower serum T3 levels in LT4-treated patients compared to euthyroid individuals with similar serum TSH values have been reported previously, leading to the skewed T3:T4 ratio toward an increase of T4, while serum T3 levels are normal to low. The clinical significance of these deviations in thyroid hormones in LT4-treated patients is not clear.

Clinically, a sizable minority of patients adequately treated with LT4 complain of residual symptoms. Higher T4 and lower T3 serum levels reflect a relative imbalance in the thyroid hormone axis homeostasis may be responsible for the persistence of hypothyroid symptoms in some patients. It is unclear to what extent lower serum T3 levels may contribute to the persistent symptoms in hypothyroid patients; however, in an experimental study on thyroidectomized rats with evident tissue hypothyroidism in peripheral cells, tissue euthyroidism occurred only following normalization of serum T3.

The above-mentioned evidence led to the growing interest in combination therapy with LT4 plus liothyronine(LT3); however, multiple randomized controlled clinical trials addressing objective and subjective clinical outcomes did not provide conclusive results. The non-conclusive results, besides heterogeneity in the study population, design, and dosage, may be attributed to the concerns and challenges regarding available oral T3 preparations stemming from the short half-life of T3 with rapid T3 absorption followed by fast metabolization. Despite the lack of definite evidence for the superiority of combination therapy, this strategy remains a common practice in hypothyroid patients who remained dissatisfied with LT4 monotherapy, while the use of LT4 + SR-T3 was suggested.

### Triiodothyronine levels in athyreotic individuals during levothyroxine therapy [^112LyXKu]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Thyroidal production of triiodothyronine (T3) is absent in athyreotic patients, leading to the suggestion that T3 deficiency may be unavoidable during levothyroxine (LT4) therapy. However, trials evaluating therapy with combined LT4 and T3 have failed to demonstrate any consistent advantage of combination therapy.

Objective

To determine whether T3 levels in patients treated with LT4 therapy were truly lower than in the same patients with native thyroid function.

Design, Setting, and Patients

A prospective study conducted in the General Clinical Research Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, between January 30, 2004, and June 20, 2007, of 50 euthyroid study participants aged 18 to 65 years who were scheduled for total thyroidectomy for goiter, benign nodular disease, suspected thyroid cancer, or known thyroid cancer. Following thyroidectomy, patients were prescribed LT4. Patients with benign thyroid disease and thyroid cancer were treated to achieve a normal and suppressed serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, respectively. The LT4 dose was adjusted as necessary postoperatively to achieve the desired TSH goal.

Main Outcome Measure

Thyroxine (tetraiodothyronine [T4]), T3, and TSH levels were measured twice preoperatively and twice postoperatively.

Results

By the end of the study, there were no significant decreases in T3 concentrations in patients receiving LT4 therapy compared with their prethyroidectomy T3 levels (mean, 127.2 ng/dL; 95% confidence interval, 119.5–134.9 ng/dL vs 129.3 ng/dL; 95% CI, 121.9–136.7 ng/dL; p = 0.64). However, free T4 concentrations were significantly higher in patients treated with LT(4) therapy (mean, 1.41 ng/dL; 95% CI, 1.33–1.49 ng/dL) compared with their native free T4 levels (1.05 ng/dL; 95% CI, 1.00–1.10 ng/dL; P < .001). Serum TSH values of 4.5 mIU/L or less were achieved in 94% of patients by the end of the study. The T3 concentrations were lower in the subgroup of patients whose therapy had not resulted in a TSH level of 4.5 mIU/L or less (P < .001).

Conclusion

In our study, normal T3 levels were achieved with traditional LT4 therapy alone in patients who had undergone near-total or total thyroidectomy, which suggests that T3 administration is not necessary to maintain serum T3 values at their endogenous prethyroidectomy levels.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114xGMQD]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Graves' disease postoperative thyroid hormone replacement (Recommendation 31) states that following thyroidectomy for GD, L-thyroxine should be started at a daily dose appropriate for the patient's weight (0.8 μg/lb or 1.6 μg/kg), with elderly patients needing somewhat less, and serum TSH measured 6–8 weeks postoperatively; this is a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks add that if TSH was suppressed preoperatively, free T4 and TSH should be measured 6–8 weeks postoperatively, and once stable and normal, TSH should be measured annually or more frequently; dosing will vary with patient body mass index and the percentage of levothyroxine absorbed from the gut.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^117Tv9cU]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine dosing frequency and adherence — once-weekly and twice-weekly regimens: A randomized cross-over trial of once weekly oral administration of 7 times the usual daily levothyroxine (LT4) dose versus daily dosing found weekly therapy produced supratherapeutic T4 for about 24 hours while T3 remained within the reference range, and over 6 weeks other biochemical and clinical markers, including patient symptoms, did not differ from daily therapy. A second similar 6-week cross-over trial showed greater increases in T4 after weekly dosing than daily dosing without symptoms or echocardiographic evidence of hyperthyroidism. For patients in whom daily LT4 intake is unsuccessful, options include observed therapy or reducing the frequency of LT4 ingestion to twice weekly or weekly with a starting dose equal to the weight‑adjusted daily regimen (i.e., 7 times the daily dose); parenteral LT4 is also possible, although no trials were identified.

### 2025 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^111tMw1W]. Thyroid (2025). High credibility.

ATA differentiated thyroid cancer — postoperative thyroglobulin measurement and early assessment: Measuring a postoperative serum Tg level 6–12 weeks after total thyroidectomy while on thyroid hormone therapy or after TSH stimulation is recommended, and such measurements may guide additional decision-making regarding clinical management (Strong recommendation, Low certainty evidence). The authors propose that the first assessment following initial therapy should occur within 3 months after resection, with an example that a patient at high risk of recurrence may be treated with a lower dose if the serum Tg is not detectable on a highly sensitive assay (e.g., lower limit of detection 0.1 ng/mL), in the absence of TgAb during levothyroxine (LT4) administration, and if neck ultrasonography does not reveal residual disease after operation; conversely, an elevated Tg level might prompt chest imaging to identify metastases.

### Change in thyroid hormone metabolite concentrations across different thyroid States [^112GkH6s]. Thyroid (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: In contrast to the thyroid hormones (TH) 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), current literature on thyroid hormone metabolite concentrations in the hypothyroid and hyperthyroid states is inconclusive. It is unknown how thyroidectomy affects thyroid hormone metabolite concentrations and if levothyroxine (LT4) replacement therapy after thyroidectomy restores thyroid hormone metabolite concentrations in those without a thyroid gland. The treatment of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) covers the euthyroid, hypothyroid, and (subclinical) hyperthyroid states and therefore provides a unique model to answer this. Here, we prospectively studied nine TH and its metabolites (THM) across different thyroid states in a cohort of patients treated for DTC. Also, three potentially important determinants for THM concentrations were studied. Methods: We prospectively included patients aged 18 to 80 years who were scheduled for DTC treatment at the Erasmus MC. Peripheral blood samples were obtained before surgery (euthyroid, endogenous TH production), after surgery just before radioactive iodine therapy (hypothyroid), and six months later on LT4 therapy ([subclinically] hyperthyroid, exogenous T4 supplementation). Nine THMs were quantified in serum with an established liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method. Repeated measurement analysis was used to compare the three different thyroid states with each other for each THM, while linear regression was used to determine the association between THM concentrations and age, sex, and kidney function. Results: In total, 77 patients (mean age 49 years; 65% women) were eligible for the study. 3,5-diiodothyronine and 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acids were below the lower limit of detection. Compared with the euthyroid state, all THMs were significantly decreased in the hypothyroid state and significantly increased in the (subclinically) hyperthyroid state, with T3 concentrations remaining within the reference interval. Higher age was associated with higher 3-monoiodothyronine (3-T1) concentrations (p < 0.001). Women had higher L-thyronine concentrations than men (p = 0.003). A better kidney function was associated with lower 3-T1 concentrations (p < 0.001). Conclusions: All THMs decrease after a thyroidectomy and increase under thyrotropin (TSH)-suppressive LT4-therapy, suggesting that formation of thyroid hormone metabolites is dependent on peripheral extrathyroidal metabolism of T4. This is also reflected by T3 concentrations that remained within the reference interval in patients receiving TSH-suppressive LT4-therapy as T3 has some thyroidal origin.

### Shared decisionmaking in the treatment of hypothyroidism [^114Zoh6v]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by an underactive thyroid gland, affects millions worldwide, leading to cognitive and metabolic slowdowns. It is most prevalent in women and older adults, with causes including autoimmune thyroiditis, surgical thyroidectomy, and certain medications.

Standard Of Care and Limitations

The standard treatment involves synthetic levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, which alleviates symptoms by converting to the active hormone, T3. However, some patients continue to experience symptoms such as fatigue, mood disturbances, and poor quality of life despite normalized TSH levels. This persistence of symptoms may stem from misdiagnosis, inadequate dosing, or incomplete normalization of thyroid hormone signaling.

New Findings

Research suggests that LT4 monotherapy may not fully restore T3 levels, leading to suboptimal symptom control. Consequently, combination therapy with LT4 and liothyronine (LT3) has been proposed as an alternative, aiming to balance T4 and T3 levels more effectively. Although randomized controlled trials have not identified significant differences in patient-reported outcomes between LT4 monotherapy and combination therapy, they indicate that patients may prefer the latter.

Conclusion

Guidelines from leading endocrinology organizations now recommend considering combination therapy for patients with persistent symptoms despite adequate LT4 dosing. A patient-centered approach, emphasizing shared decision-making and individualized treatment plans, is essential for optimizing outcomes in hypothyroidism management. Further research is needed to refine dosing strategies and identify the patients who would benefit most from combination therapy.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^112JatY3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As millions of people around the world take LT4 daily and a huge number of patients with goiter or cancer undergo thyroidectomy, achieving robust data about the optimal starting LT4 dose should be important for helping the clinical practice of thyroidologists. The main goal of the present meta-analysis was to assess whether different approaches for a LT4 dose-choosing strategy would translate into a higher number of euthyroid patients at the first follow-up visit after total thyroidectomy.

The results of the present analysis show a mean percentage of euthyroid patients receiving LT4 at the first follow-up after thyroidectomy of ∼34%. This indicates that, in most patients, independently from the LT4 dose-choosing method used, TSH level was either below or above the normal range. The high heterogeneity in terms of euthyroidism rates observed across studies (ranging from 19% to 68%) using different dose-choosing strategies highlights the complexity of choosing an adequate starting LT4 replacement dose in thyroidectomized patients. We aimed to identify the primary contributors to this variability, considering methodological differences in LT4 dosing and patient characteristics by assessing whether different methods for estimating LT4 dose would lead to different results in terms of rates of euthyroidism achieved.

The studies included in our analysis employed different dosing approaches, including fixed-dose regimens, weight-based dosing (dose/kg), and individualized algorithms incorporating factors such as BMI, lean body mass (LBM), or age. We conducted mainly 2 comparative analyses: (1) dose/kg studies vs all other approaches and (2) weight-based, BMI-based, LBM-based dosing vs fixed-dose and other particular algorithm-based methods. In both analyses, the second group exhibited higher rates of euthyroidism; however, this was accompanied by greater heterogeneity and wider confidence intervals, primarily due to 1 study belonging to the second group reporting a 68% achievement rate among 31 patients. When considering how these factors were incorporated into dose-choosing algorithms, we found that only 1 study included LBM in its algorithm, yet it achieved a euthyroidism rate of just 26%, indicating no clear advantage over other methods. No study accounted for sex in the dose-choosing algorithm. Two studies included age as a variable, reporting euthyroidism rates of 67% and 58%. Three studies incorporated BMI into their algorithms. Two studies considered age and BMI, while 1 used a BMI-based approach, achieving a euthyroidism rate of 38%.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic modeling: a novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^115A3yRL]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Cost versus benefit

The average follow-up period in the study was 127 ± 6.4 days, or ∼18 weeks, ranging from 47 to 468 days. The average number of postoperative blood draws in this period was 6.6 ± 0.15, and the average number of follow-up visits was 3.6 ± 0.14 (Table 3). For goiter and cancer groups, the application of the DAT reduced the number of blood draws needed [t = 2.47, p = 0.02 and t (50) = 3.14, p = 0.003 respectively] and the number of follow-up visits [t = 2.16, p = 0.04 and t (50) = 3.15, p = 0.003] as compared with their respective controls. As our RCT did not have a control arm with an ordinary standard of care, we made a comparison with retrospective data from a similar population operated three years before the DAT study (Supplementary Table S1). Lab records from these patients showed that the average number of blood draws before the TSH targets were reached was 8.6, which is higher than for patients in the current RCT (Supplemental Data).

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^112nYLHB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Conduct of Review

The present systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (ID 1061048). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in reporting this study (Supplemental Material 1).

Search Strategy

A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases. The search aimed to identify studies reporting the proportion of "euthyroid" patients at their first follow-up after thyroidectomy and the strategy employed to estimate the LT4 starting dose. Euthyroid patients were defined as those with TSH levels within the target range specified in each article. For benign diseases, a higher TSH range was used, whereas for malignant conditions, risk-stratified TSH targets were applied. The search was restricted to articles published in English from January 1, 2000, to October 30, 2024. The online search was conducted by the following algorithm: [(levothyroxine) or (L-thyroxine) or (LT4)] and [(thyroidectomy) or (athyreotic)] and (dose). In the attempt to expand the search, references in the retrieved articles were also screened to identify additional studies.

Study Selection

The inclusion criteria were original studies reporting the number of patients achieving euthyroidism at the first postthyroidectomy evaluation and the criteria used to prescribe the initial LT4 dose. Exclusion criteria were studies lacking data on postthyroidectomy follow-up or underlying thyroid pathology, review articles, and outdated publications. Two independent researchers (I.C. P.C.) screened titles and abstracts based on these criteria. Subsequently, all authors independently reviewed the full text of eligible articles to confirm their inclusion in the final analysis.

Data Extraction

For each included study, the following information was extracted independently by 2 investigators (I.C. P.C.) in a piloted form: (1) study details (authors, publication year, and country of origin); (2) patient demographics [median age, body mass index (BMI), and sex]; (3) underlying thyroid pathology (benign or malignant); (4) LT4 dosing method; (5) follow-up data for the first and second postthyroidectomy controls. Extracted data were cross-checked for accuracy, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. When studies included 2 (or more) different populations according to the LT4 dosing strategy employed, they were reported as separate series.

### Levothyroxine monotherapy: what works better for the individual with hypothyroidism? [^114gSiVd]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

I explore objective data not supporting the addition of liothyronine (medication) (LT3) to levothyroxine (medication) (LT4) in patients with hypothyroidism. Accurate identification of patients with symptomatic (almost exclusively overt) hypothyroidism is important in evaluating clinical outcomes of therapies. Recent studies have documented that nearly a third of individuals who are offered thyroid hormone are euthyroid at the time of initiation. Additionally, others are clinically diagnosed without biochemical confirmation, so a sizable proportion of those started on LT4 are not hypothyroid. The assumption that nonhypothyroid symptoms will resolve with LT4 is problematic. The true underlying cause of these symptoms remains unidentified and untreated.

Methods

In a narrative fashion I will review the positive predictive value of and correlation of symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism and confirmed hypothyroidism likely to favorably respond to thyroid hormone replacement.

Results

Following a review of the reliability of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in predicting a euthyroid state, the correlation of circulating triiodothyronine (serum measurement) (T3) levels with symptoms and predictive value of T3 to forecast the outcome of adding LT3 to LT4 will be reviewed. The utility of striving for high, middle, or low TSH set points within the expected range to predict changes in clinical quality of life and the ability of blinded patients to sense subtle differences along this spectrum will be documented. In addition, the clinical impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the type 2 deiodinase gene will be reviewed. Finally, the overall satisfaction of selected patients with their thyroid hormone treatments will be outlined and preferences for T3-containing treatments from blinded studies will be summarized.

Conclusion

Basing thyroid hormone treatment decisions on patient symptoms likely results in missed diagnoses We should encourage primary care physicians to assess a differential diagnosis, exclude other diagnoses, and not assume a thyroid etiology when TSH is normal. Modifying treatment to a particular TSH target or adjusting based on a low T3 level does not seem to enhance patient outcomes. Finally, pending further trials of "symptomatic" participants, using sustained release LT3 to mimic normal physiology, and including monocarboxylate 10 transporter and Type 2 deiodinase polymorphisms and objective outcomes, I will continue to depend on therapy with LT4 monotherapy and seek alternative explanations for my patients' nonspecific symptoms.

### Are we restoring thyroid hormone signaling in levothyroxine-treated patients with residual symptoms of hypothyroidism? [^111jJi9V]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Levothyroxine (LT4) at doses that maintain the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels within the normal range constitutes the standard of care for the treatment of hypothyroidism. After a few months, this eliminates the signs and symptoms of overt hypothyroidism in the majority of patients, owing to the endogenous activation of thyroxine to triiodothyronine, the biologically active thyroid hormone. Still, a small percentage of the patients (10%-20%) exhibit residual symptoms, despite having normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. These symptoms include cognitive, mood, and metabolic deficits, with a significant impairment in psychological well-being and quality of life.

Objective

To provide a summary of progress in the approach of patients with hypothyroidism that exhibit residual symptoms despite treatment.

Methods

We reviewed the current literature and here we focused on the mechanisms leading to a deficiency of T3 in some LT4-treated patients, the role of residual thyroid tissue and the rationale for combination therapy with LT4 + liothyronine (LT3).

Results

A score of clinical trials comparing therapy with LT4 versus LT4 + LT3 concluded that both are safe and equally effective (neither is superior); however, these trials failed to recruit a sufficiently large number of patients with residual symptoms. New clinical trials that considered LT4-treated symptomatic patients revealed that such patients benefit from and prefer therapy containing LT4 + LT3; desiccated thyroid extract has also been used with similar results. A practical approach to patients with residual symptoms and on initiation of combination therapy with LT4 + LT3 is provided.

Conclusion

A recent joint statement of the American, British, and European Thyroid Associations recommends that a trial with combination therapy be offered to patients with hypothyroidism that do not fully benefit from therapy with LT4.

### Levothyroxine: conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^114PQwXT]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Although combined treatment sounds promising, the results from clinical trials comparing monotherapy and combined therapy are conflicting. In a previous study involving 19 patients, the TSH levels were normalized only when patients' T3 levels were not significantly different from those of controls. The results are inconsistent with those of more recent double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Four systematic reviews and meta-analyses based on RCTs failed to show any advantages in quality of life, mood states, or psychometric performance for patients receiving combination therapy. Although previous meta-analyses reported a preference for combined therapy by patients, a more recent meta-analysis based on 7 blinded RCTs did not support this conclusion, suggesting that T3 may serve as a "placebo" and raise patients' expectations in some nonblinded studies. Taken together, as recommended by the American Thyroid Association, "the use of combined replacement therapy, with the administration of both LT4 and liothyronine (LT3), is generally not recommended due to the low quality of the available evidence. A trial may be considered in those patients with normal values of serum TSH who continue to complain of symptoms of hypothyroidism. Also, in these cases, the presence of coexistent nonthyroid problems should be first ruled out". We further recommend discussing the financial burdens with these patients while addressing concomitant diseases and mitigating their unrealistic expectations.

### Biochemical markers reflecting thyroid function in athyreotic patients on levothyroxine monotherapy [^111k1xKs]. Thyroid (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, the patients with normal TSH levels had serum fT3 levels that were significantly lower than the preoperative levels. The patients with mildly suppressed TSH levels had serum fT3 levels equivalent to the preoperative levels. The patients with strongly suppressed TSH levels had significantly higher serum fT3 levels. Thus, the results obtained for the present patients who underwent a total thyroidectomy during LT4 therapy were consistent with the authors' previous studies and with those of Gullo et al. Hoermann et al. and Werneck de Castro et al. These findings suggest that the reason underlying the decreased serum T3 levels in such patients is the lack of intrathyroidal T3 production caused by the absence of the thyroid gland.

Werneck de Castro et al. reported that the serum cholesterol levels were reduced in T4-treated rats compared with those in thyroidectomized hypothyroid rats, although not to the levels observed in the euthyroid control animals. Serum triglyceride levels were also elevated in the thyroidectomized hypothyroid rats in that study, but T4 monotherapy resulted in the normalization of their levels, not different from the euthyroid control animals. In the present T4-treated human study, the postoperative serum LDL-C levels were increased in the patients with normal TSH levels, whereas the serum triglyceride levels were unchanged — findings that are in agreement with the results in thyroidectomized rats.

Thyroid hormone increases the expression of cell surface LDL-C receptors expressed in fibroblasts, the liver, and other tissues. The decrease in LDL-C receptors leads to a reduced clearance of LDL-C from the serum. Hypothyroidism may also lead to increased intestinal cholesterol absorption in the gut. The thyroid hormone effects on LDL-C receptor expression and cholesterol absorption outweigh the effects of decreased hepatic cholesterol synthesis by HMG CoA reductase, leading to a net accumulation of serum LDL-C in hypothyroidism. In addition to LDL-C, a disturbed metabolism of TG-rich lipoprotein or non-HDL-C (which includes both LDL-C and TG-rich lipoprotein) occurs in hypothyroidism, and these changes are also observed in mild hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone increases lipoprotein lipase activity. Lipoprotein lipase lowers the TG level through the hydrolysis of TG-rich lipoprotein. Higher serum TG may be observed in hypothyroid individuals because of their lower lipoprotein lipase activity. Both the authors and Werneck de Castro et al. observed a significant change in LDL-C and no significant change in TG because of differences in the mechanism of action of thyroid hormone on LDL-C and TG levels.

Small adjustments in levothyroxine (LT4) dose do not appear to provide clinical benefit despite changes in thyrotropin (TSH) levels within the reference range. We hypothesize that the accompanying changes in serum total triiodothyronine (T3) levels do not reflect the magnitude of the changes in serum TSH.

Objective

This work aims to characterize the relationships of serum free thyroxine (FT4) vs T3, FT4 vs TSH, and FT4 vs the T3/FT4 ratio.

Methods

This cross-sectional, observational study comprised 9850 participants aged 18 years and older treated with LT4 from a large clinical database from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019. Patients had been treated with LT4, subdivided by serum FT4 level. Main outcome measures included model fitting of the relationships between serum FT4 vs TSH, FT4 vs T3, and FT4 vs T3/FT4. Mean and median values of TSH, T3, and T3/FT4 were calculated.

Results

The relationships T3 vs FT4 and TSH vs FT4 were both complex and best represented by distinct, segmented regression models. Increasing FT4 levels were linearly associated with T3 levels until an inflection point at an FT4 level of 0.7 ng/dL, after which a flattening of the slope was observed following a convex quadratic curve. In contrast, increasing FT4 levels were associated with steep declines in TSH following 2 negative sigmoid curves. The FT4 vs T3/FT4 relationship was fit to an asymptotic regression curve supporting less T4 to T3 activation at higher FT4 levels.

Conclusion

In LT4-treated patients, the relationships between serum FT4 vs TSH and FT4 vs T3 across a range of FT4 levels are disproportionate. As a result, dose changes in LT4 that robustly modify serum FT4 and TSH values may only minimally affect serum T3 levels and result in no significant clinical benefit.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^112GQShE]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, ETA 2018 guidelines recommend to assess the adequacy of replacement therapy 6–8 weeks after initiation of levothyroxine therapy with concomitant free T4 and TSH measurements in patients with CeH, provided that blood is withdrawn before the morning replacement dose or at least 4 hours after the levothyroxine administration. Aim to maintain free T4 levels above the median value of the normal range.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^116o1x3e]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

Thyroid hormone replacement targets — serum thyrotropin (TSH) in primary hypothyroidism should be within the reference range and is the therapeutic target, with "a value within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) should be considered the therapeutic target". In subclinical hypothyroidism, "an increase in mortality has been observed in individuals with TSH levels > 10mIU/L, with potential effects of values > 7mIU/L", and "fewer ischemic heart disease events were associated with treatment of SCH in those under age 70 years". Aiming for "a target TSH in the lower tertile of the laboratory reference range" has been proposed, but "a randomized cross-over study of 8 weeks' duration did not show changes in well-being or quality of life with TSH titration within the normal and subnormal range". After thyroidectomy, when T3 is used as a target it "is reasonable to tailor therapy to achieve circulating levels of T3 similar to the pre-surgery values while maintaining the TSH value within the range of normal", and during LT4 therapy "Levels of FT4 above the reference range are often observed…; no evidence yet exists indicating that this condition is associated with adverse events or poor outcome".

### Levothyroxine: conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^111VuVb1]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to drug interactions, food might also impair LT4 absorption via direct complexation. Although the rule of "30 to 60 minutes before breakfast on an empty stomach" is widely recommended, it is inconvenient to follow and may cause poor compliance. The administration time remains debatable and clinical studies are emerging. Dosing before dinner slightly reduces the therapeutic efficacy of LT4, since 2 to 4 hours are usually required for the stomach to empty. Dosing at bedtime is a promising option. In 2010, a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial recruiting 90 patients examined the efficacy of taking LT4 at bedtime. Reduced TSH levels and elevated total T3 and total T4 (TT4) levels were observed in patients taking LT4 at bedtime, with no significant difference in quality of life or preference. In addition, it is estimated that fasting for at least 3 hours is required for bedtime administration. More recently, a meta-analysis including 10 prospective and randomized controlled studies revealed no significant difference in TSH and FT3 between patients who took LT4 before breakfast and at bedtime. Surprisingly, the FT4 level favored bedtime administration (P = 0.03). Eating habits and time intervals between dinner and bedtime, which may vary in different countries and cultures, affect the absorption of LT4 ingested at bedtime. Clinicians should take these factors into consideration before informing patients about the possibility of taking LT4 at bedtime.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism [^115ZzzzT]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease affects up to 0.5 percent of the population of the United States. Its prevalence is higher in women and the elderly. The management of hypothyroidism focuses on ensuring that patients receive appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitoring their response. Hormone replacement should be initiated in a low dosage, especially in the elderly and in patients prone to cardiac problems. The dosage should be increased gradually, and laboratory values should be monitored six to eight weeks after any dosage change. Once a stable dosage is achieved, annual monitoring of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is probably unnecessary, except in older patients. After full replacement of thyroxine (T4) using levothyroxine, the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) in a low dosage may be beneficial in some patients who continue to have mood or memory problems. The management of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (a high TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels) remains controversial. In these patients, physicians should weigh the benefits of replacement (e.g., improved cardiac function) against problems that can accompany the excessive use of levothyroxine (e.g., osteoporosis).

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^112nS3BQ]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Combination therapy for patients unwell on levothyroxine — For patients with primary hypothyroidism who feel unwell on levothyroxine therapy alone (in the absence of an allergy to levothyroxine constituents or an abnormal serum thyrotropin), there is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of a trial of a combination of levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy outside a formal clinical trial or N-of-1 trial, due to uncertainty in long-term risk benefit ratio of the treatment and uncertainty as to the optimal definition of a successful trial to guide clinical decision-making. The guideline rates this as 'Weak recommendation. Moderate quality evidence'. Additional research targeting those with relatively low serum triiodothyronine concentrations, but normal thyrotropin levels during monotherapy is needed to address whether there is a subgroup of patients who might benefit from combination therapy.

Thyroid carcinoma — post-lobectomy disease monitoring and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) management: Measurement of thyroglobulin (Tg) and anti-Tg antibodies may be useful for obtaining a postoperative baseline, but data to interpret these antibodies in the setting of an intact thyroid lobe are lacking. Levothyroxine therapy can be considered to maintain low or normal TSH levels. Disease monitoring is sufficient after lobectomy when all of the following are met: negative resection margins, no contralateral lesion, no suspicious lymph node(s), and small (≤ 4 cm) PTCs; levothyroxine therapy to reduce serum TSH to normal concentrations can be considered.

### Serum thyroid hormone balance in levothyroxine monotherapy-treated patients with atrophic thyroid after radioiodine treatment for Graves' disease [^112kucrd]. Thyroid (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptoms suggestive for thyroidal dysfunction in LT4-treated patients have also been reported by several prior studies. Larisch et al. conducted a retrospective longitudinal study including 319 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma on LT4. As a result, 26% of patients expressed hypothyroid and 9.7% expressed hyperthyroid complaints at any one visit. Although rates of both hypothyroid and hyperthyroid symptoms were significantly related to all three thyroid parameters, hypothyroid symptoms correlated well with fT3 levels when TSH levels were below the reference range. Hirata et al. studied patients with central hypothyroidism and athyreotic patients who underwent total thyroidectomy. In central hypothyroidism and total thyroidectomy patients, those with median-lower to normal levels of serum fT4 exhibited lower serum fT3 levels and lower body temperature. These data support an important role of serum fT3 levels in the manifestation of symptoms, which has implications for clinical decision making on dose adequacy, particularly in athyreotic patients.

There are some possible limitations in this study. First, the limited number of study patients, unequal group distribution, and assessment at a single time point reduces the internal validity of the study. Second, we did not evaluate biochemical markers and the symptoms reflecting thyroid function. Studies including measures of these clinical parameters are, thus, needed to clarify the best method of managing patients' thyroid function after radioiodine treatment.

Patients who have undergone radioiodine treatment and subsequently experience hypothyroidism live in a chronic condition of abnormal thyroid hormone status for the remainder of their lives. Therefore, even if the thyroidal dysfunction is subtle, its long-term effects cannot be ignored. The American Thyroid Association stated in its guidelines that for the treatment of hypothyroidism such as in athyreotic patients, there is insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend LT4 treatment for achieving low-normal TSH values or high-normal T3 values. The results of this study suggest that mild TSH suppression with LT4 monotherapy is needed to achieve normal fT3 levels in patients who experience an atrophic thyroid condition after having undergone radioiodine treatment. Our findings may provide novel information that could assist in the management of a large number of patients who experience hypothyroidism after having undergone radioiodine treatment for Graves' disease.

1 Introduction

Hypothyroidism is estimated to affect around 3% of the population in Europe, and is more common in certain groups such as females and older adults. Clinically, hypothyroidism presents with symptoms such as cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Biochemically, hypothyroidism is diagnosed through measurement of thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), with increased TSH and decreased FT4 the typical pattern seen in patients with overt hypothyroidism. Additionally, there exists a subset of the population with high TSH levels but normal FT4 and no or minimal symptoms; this is known as subclinical hypothyroidism.

The most prescribed treatment for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, with this medication being converted into the more metabolically active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), by deiodinases within the body. LT4 is a very widely prescribed drug, with 33.8 million prescriptions in the UK alone in 2022. Other thyroid hormone treatments, such as natural desiccated thyroid (NDT) and liothyronine (LT3) are available but are used much less commonly in modern practice.

The ideal therapeutic goal in hypothyroidism would be to restore clinical and biochemical euthyroidism via physiologic thyroid hormone replacement. This concept may seem straightforward, but there are subtleties that have only recently been recognised. In the majority of patients, LT4 treatment will both normalise TSH levels and lead to symptom resolution. However, it is estimated that around 5%–15% of patients taking LT4 still experience symptoms of hypothyroidism, even with normalised TSH levels. This may be due to LT4 monotherapy not restoring T3 levels to the normal range in a subset of patients, perhaps due to polymorphisms within the genes which encode peripheral deiodinase enzymes.

Additionally, multiple studies suggest that as many as 40% of patients taking LT4 have TSH levels outside of the normal range, indicating under‐ or over‐replacement of thyroid hormones. Certain patient factors, such as sex, age, and duration of treatment, may influence this under‐ or over‐treatment. Significantly, both under‐ and over‐treatment of hypothyroidism are associated with increased all‐cause mortality.

This study aims to investigate further the differences in thyroid hormone levels and health outcomes in people on thyroid hormone replacement therapy compared with people being screened for thyroid disorder and not taking levothyroxine. Better understanding of the relation between thyroid hormone replacement therapy and actual levels of TSH, Free T3 (FT3), and FT4 in patients could allow more tailored and effective therapy for people with hypothyroidism.

Postoperative thyroid function monitoring — testing schedule and coordination: After total thyroidectomy, testing of thyroid function should be coordinated with the patient's endocrinologist and/or primary care physician, and TSH level should be checked at 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively and T4 dose adjusted accordingly. The appropriate TSH level depends on multiple factors, including whether the patient has a diagnosis of TC of follicular cell origin and has ongoing features of hypo- or hyperthyroidism.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^117P4p5a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

All studies were conducted in referral hospital centers. The normal TSH range was reported by all studies, with most using 0.4 to 4.5, while only 1 study applied a 0.4 to 2.5 range. For tumors, different risk categories were considered: low risk (0.5–2), intermediate risk (0.1–0.5), and high risk (< 0.1). Of the 11 studies included, 7 analyzed patients using a single LT4 dosing method: 2 studies used a dose/kg approach, 3 applied a fixed-dose regimen, and 2 employed an algorithm-based method. In the remaining 4 studies, multiple groups of patients received different dosing strategies: 3 compared 2 groups (1 using a dose/kg method and the other an algorithm-based approach) and 1 examined 4 groups using a dose/kg method but with a different TSH target according to their disease.

As a result, the 11 studies yielded 17 patient groups. Among them, 3 groups followed a fixed-dose regimen [2 receiving 100 mcg, 1 receiving 150 mcg], 9 groups used a dose/kg approach, and 5 groups applied an algorithm-based calculation.

A detailed description of the algorithm-based approaches is reported in Supplemental Material 3.

All studies reported the number of euthyroid patients at the first control, which was typically conducted at 6 to 8 weeks, with the widest timeframe being 4 to 15 weeks.

Quantitative Analysis (Meta-analysis)

The pooled proportion of patients achieving target thyroid hormone levels at the first postthyroidectomy follow-up was 33.9% (803/2577 patients), with a confidence interval from 29.3% to 38.5% (Fig. 2). The analysis included 17 different study populations, demonstrating substantial heterogeneity (I 2 = 82.68%). A comparative analysis based on key study characteristics was performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity (Table 2).

T3 measurement and therapy in biochemically euthyroid but symptomatic patients — A survey found that 22% of clinicians would measure serum T3 levels when faced with a biochemically euthyroid patient with persistent symptoms, yet no published studies have demonstrated that relatively low T3 levels have negative consequences for patients with normal serum TSH values, so this remains an untested hypothesis. Although there has been an increase in the use of LT3 therapy in the United States over the last 10 years, a 2011 survey reported that 3.6% of physicians would consider prescribing LT3 in such circumstances. An individual trial of T3 therapy to normalize serum T3 without lowering TSH below normal is unsupported by data and is an unproven approach; some task force members thought it could be considered on individual basis as innovative therapy, but when such treatments are used repeatedly they should become the object of formal research to determine safety and effectiveness, and outside a trial it is difficult to assess desired response and uncontrolled experience does not establish effectiveness.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112Qfy9c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to laboratory follow-up, ES 2016 guidelines recommend to monitor free T4 levels at least 6 weeks after starting an antiepileptic drug and increase levothyroxine doses if free T4 levels decrease below the target range.

### FT3 and FT3 / FT4 ratio are decreased and not compensated by levothyroxine treatment in TKI-treated thyroid cancer patients [^113TkG8G]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Increasing the dose of LT4 was effective in restoring both TSH and FT4 to pre-TKI levels in all patients. This indicates that additional doses of LT4 are able to overcome the TKI-induced mechanism underlying the reduction of FT4. However, increasing LT4 doses did not restore FT3 level and FT3/FT4 ratio to baseline levels in 55% of patients. The FT3/FT4 ratio – especially in thyroidectomised patients treated with LT4 – reliably reflects the thyroid status and is the best indicator of the amount of T4 that is converted to T3 by peripheral D2 deiodination. Thus, the return of TSH to its pre-treatment levels does not necessarily correspond to rebalancing the thyroid axis. TSH is effectively inhibited by increasing doses of LT4. However, while the hypothalamic D2 is relatively insensitive to the T4-induced degradation, the peripheral D2 is highly sensitive to T4, which activates its degradation. As a consequence, the excess of T4 needed to suppress TSH secretion may reduce peripheral D2, thus the proportion of tissue conversion of T4 into T3. This may occur and further potentiate the inhibitory effect of the TKI on T3 production.

For this reasoning, in three consecutive patients treated with selpercatinib who showed a treatment-dependent reduction in total T3 and FT3 levels associated with increased TSH levels, we chose to reduce the dose of LT4 and to administer LT3 at an LT4/LT3 ratio of 11:1, lower than what is recommended in the context of hypothyroidism replacement therapy (i.e. 15:1), based on the hypothesis of an altered function of D2 caused by the TKI. This strategy normalised TSH while maintaining an FT3/FT4 ratio similar to baseline thanks to the increase in FT3 levels. In addition, the presence of normal/elevated total serum T4 level even after the reduction of LT4 dose suggests a serum T4 accumulation – probably due to a marked selpercatinib-dependent block in the T4-to-T3 or rT3 conversion. The small number of patients under study does not allow statistical significance to be reached, but these data provide a clear indication of the ability of LT4 + LT3 combination therapy to normalise the FT3/FT4 ratio while maintaining serum TSH levels at target.

### Biochemical markers reflecting thyroid function in athyreotic patients on levothyroxine monotherapy [^111mJoA2]. Thyroid (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

T: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). T3 is the biologically active thyroid hormone. In normal subjects, 100% of T4 is secreted by the thyroid, approximately 20% of T3 is secreted from the thyroid gland, and approximately 80% of T3 derives from the conversion of T4 to T3 in extrathyroidal peripheral tissues. A relative T3 deficiency may thus be present in athyreotic patients during T4 monotherapy. The authors and other investigators compared postoperative T3 levels in patients on levothyroxine (LT4) therapy with their own preoperative levels or those in euthyroid controls. These studies indicate that in the athyreotic condition after the total thyroidectomy during LT4 therapy, patients with normal serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels had mildly low serum free T3 (fT3) levels, and patients with suppressed serum TSH levels had normal serum fT3 levels. The question arises over which of these two patient groups is in a euthyroid condition.

An animal study has shown that LT4 alone administered to thyroidectomized rats at doses to normalize plasma TSH levels does not normalize T3 content in some tissues. A recent study reported that the combination of high serum T4 and low serum T3 levels in rats on T4 monotherapy suggested that brain, liver, and skeletal muscle had some alterations consistent with hypothyroidism, despite normal serum TSH levels. However, in humans, it is unclear whether such mild T3 deficiency affects the thyroid hormone action in postoperative athyreotic patients on LT4 therapy.

The objective of the present study was to compare, among patients who underwent total thyroidectomy, serum levels of peripheral markers of thyroid function (i.e. serum levels of lipoproteins, bone metabolic markers, and sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG]) measured preoperatively with the levels in the same individuals after LT4 therapy in order to clarify whether a mild T3 deficiency affects thyroid function in postoperative athyreotic patients on LT4 therapy. Only patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma, which should not have an impact on conversion of T4 to T3 by thyroid tissue, were selected for the present study.

### Biochemical markers reflecting thyroid function in athyreotic patients on levothyroxine monotherapy [^1118RgRX]. Thyroid (2017). Low credibility.

The SHBG level is considered a sensitive marker of thyroid action in liver cells, and increased SHBG levels have been reported in hyperthyroidism, whereas normal or lower levels have been observed in hypothyroidism. Alevizaki et al. reported that athyreotic patients with T4-treated hypothyroidism and normal TSH levels had lower T3 and lower SHBG levels compared with controls. In the present study, a decrease in SHBG levels was not seen in the patients with normal TSH and decreased T3 levels.

In the present investigation of bone metabolism, the patients with strongly suppressed TSH levels and those with normal TSH levels had serum calcium and intact PTH levels that were significantly lower than their preoperative levels, suggesting that there is a certain effect on parathyroid function due to total thyroidectomy in these two patients groups. The postoperative serum BAP levels were increased in the patients with strongly suppressed TSH levels, even though the serum calcium and intact PTH levels were decreased, suggesting that the effect of thyrotoxicosis on bone overcomes the effect of the decrease of PTH, and therefore that these patients have thyrotoxicosis. The postoperative serum TRACP-5b levels were decreased in the patients with normal TSH and low T3 levels. It is unclear whether this decrease is due to the deficiency of thyroid hormone and/or the deficiency of PTH because these patients' serum calcium and intact PTH levels were decreased postoperatively.

On the other hand, the patients with mildly suppressed TSH levels had serum calcium and intact PTH levels equivalent to their preoperative levels, suggesting that the parathyroid function of these patient groups is less affected by a total thyroidectomy. Since changes in bone metabolic markers were not observed in this situation, it is suggested that patients with mildly suppressed TSH levels were close to preoperative euthyroidism from the viewpoint of bone metabolism.

Thyrotoxicosis results in a state of high bone turnover with increased bone resorption and formation rates. Accordingly, biochemical markers of bone formation such as serum BAP levels and those of resorption such as serum TRACP-5b levels are all elevated in hyperthyroidism and generally correlate with disease severity. Although several studies of patients with TSH-suppressive LT4 therapy for postoperative differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) have been reported, there is no uniform answer to this suspicion. In general, it appears that TSH-suppressive LT4 therapy for postoperative DTC accelerates bone turnover but only in premenopausal women. Moreover, the degree of serum TSH suppression required to avoid this effect is unknown.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

If L‑T4 is not started preoperatively or continued postoperatively, clinicians should evaluate for CH by measuring fT4 levels 6–8 weeks after surgery because the serum half-life of T4 is 7 days.

2 PATIENTS AND METHODS

2.1 Patients

We retrospectively evaluated 1150 thyroidectomized patients referred to our outpatient thyroid clinic between 2010 and 2015 who were also subjected to 131 I ablation because of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). In all patients, thyroglobulin levels were between 0.01 and 0.5 ng/ml, and antithyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) was negative. In this cohort, devoid of functional thyroid tissue, all circulating T4 levels originated from levothyroxine replacement therapy. These patients obtain circulating T3 from the conversion of exogenous T4 and represent an ideal model to study peripheral tissue ability to generate biologically active hormones. We excluded from the analysis patients with hypothalamic/pituitary, gastric, intestinal or neurological diseases and pregnant women (n = 72) and those who were taking combined T3/T4 thyroid replacement therapy and/or other drugs interfering with thyroid hormone homeostasis (n = 198). Patients with variations in L‐T4 daily dose, body weight and thyroid hormone level fluctuations within 3 months before the start of the study were also excluded (n = 720). Finally, 160 athyreotic patients under L‐T4 therapy were included in the analysis (Figure 1). All patients were euthyroid on the basis of their TSH, FT4 and FT3 levels within the normal range.

2.2 Phenotypic evaluation of the study patients

Clinical records included a detailed history, physical examination, standardized questionnaire documenting sex, age, height, weight and BMI. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres (kg/m 2) and considered a categorical variable according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 30, which is an adequate indicator of obesity and is associated with increased body fat mass. In our study, 120 patients had a BMI ≥ 30, while 40 had a BMI < 30.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^113kfzJN]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Functional thyroid cancer metastases — management relies on radioiodine and avoidance of recombinant human TSH, with targeted monitoring for T3-predominant thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis due to functional metastases in patients with thyroid cancer has been described in a handful of cases; typically, patients have either a very large primary follicular cancer or widely metastatic follicular thyroid cancer, and they may have coexisting TRAb as the proximate cause of the thyrotoxicosis or activating mutations in the TSH receptor. In general, functioning metastases are treated with RAI with the addition of ATDs as needed for persistent hyperthyroidism, and recombinant human TSH should be avoided in these patients. Patients with massive metastatic follicular thyroid cancer may also exhibit T3 thyrotoxicosis, most likely due to increased conversion of T4 to T3 by tumor expressing high type 1 and type 2 deiodinase activities, and thus occasional measurement of serum T3 in addition to FT4 and TSH is recommended in patients with a large metastatic tumor burden, particularly if FT4 decreases on fixed doses of levothyroxine.

### Thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer: the role for a combined T3 / T4 approach [^114Zy4mD]. Head & Neck (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In the management of differentiated thyroid carcinoma, surgery with or without postoperative radioiodine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression is the standard of care in most patients. Levothyroxine is recommended for long-term TSH suppression. For some patients, this may be difficult to tolerate due to adverse effects, such as impaired cognitive function.

Methods

This article reviews the evidence for the role of combination treatment with triiodothyronine (T3) and levothyroxine (T4) in these patients.

Results

The evidence for combination T3 and T4 treatment comes mainly from studies on hypothyroidism, and research into its use for TSH suppression is limited.

Conclusion

Although the evidence base is not strong, there is a small group of patients who may benefit from combination T3 and T4 treatment due to difficulty tolerating thyroxine. Until further evidence is available, a case-by-case approach is recommended.

### Levothyroxine: conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^115tZkxQ]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Essential Points

Levothyroxine (LT4) is the mainstay therapy for hypothyroidism, but its bioavailability can be hampered by many conditions, such as concomitant diseases, interfering medications and foods, switch of brands, and noncompliance
A comprehensive medical history taking with necessary examinations is required to find the cause of persistent hypothyroidism
Discontinuation of interferants, administration separation, addressing the concomitant diseases, and close monitoring are generally recommended to eliminate persistent hypothyroidism
Liquid solutions and soft gel capsules are recommended to be used in those with hampered LT4 absorption and who do not allow sufficient time before or after meals for LT4 replacement; liquid solutions can also be used in those with difficulty in swallowing
Intramuscular and subcutaneous injection can serve as sustained-release systems for levothyroxine, especially for noncompliant patients
Subcutaneous implants with nanomaterials can serve as sustained-release platforms for LT4 and thus improve patient compliance
Novel drug delivery systems with larger loads, stable release profile and safety are expected to be developed in the future

The prevalence of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to be 3% to 7% in the general population. Hypothyroidism is mainly induced by autoimmune thyroid diseases and thyroidectomy. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of hypothyroidism is based on laboratory tests of serum thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3) levels. Since the 1980s, along with the discovery of T4 deiodination to T3, synthesized levothyroxine (LT4) has gradually replaced desiccated thyroid extracts (DTEs) and has become the mainstay therapy for hypothyroidism. LT4 is among the most frequently prescribed medications in the United States and its indications include hypothyroidism and myxedema. It is also used off-label to treat other diseases, such as female infertility with elevated thyroid antibodies, obesity, and depression (Table 1).

### FT3 and FT3 / FT4 ratio are decreased and not compensated by levothyroxine treatment in TKI-treated thyroid cancer patients [^114fF4kv]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

It is unclear whether all TKIs share a common pattern in altering the serum thyroid hormone profile. Importantly, assuming that the alterations which occur in LT4-treated patients during a TKI treatment are mostly due to defects in LT4 deiodination, there is a lack of knowledge on which thyroid hormone treatment is the most appropriate. Here, we investigated the changes in circulating T3 and T4 levels in patients with a TKI-related increase in TSH level, and their modifications following an increasing dose of LT4. To this aim, we retrospectively analysed circulating thyroid hormone levels in a series of 45 consecutive thyroidectomised patients treated with various TKIs for metastatic and progressive thyroid cancer. In addition, we explored the possibility of using a combination therapy of LT4 + liothyronine (LT3) instead of increasing the dose of LT4 in three patients with increased TSH during TKI treatment.

### Defending plasma T3 is a biological priority [^112YExLJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Triiodothyronine (T3), the active form of thyroid hormone is produced predominantly outside the thyroid parenchyma secondary to peripheral tissue deiodination of thyroxine (T4), with < 20% being secreted directly from the thyroid. In healthy individuals, plasma T3 is regulated by the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis and by homoeostatic changes in deiodinase expression. Therefore, with the exception of a minimal circadian rhythmicity, serum T3 levels are stable over long periods of time. Studies in rodents indicate that different levels of genetic disruption of the feedback mechanism and deiodinase system are met with increase in serum T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, while serum T3 levels remain stable. These findings have focused attention on serum T3 levels in patients with thyroid disease, with important clinical implications affecting therapeutic goals and choice of therapy for patients with hypothyroidism. Although monotherapy with levothyroxine is the standard of care for hypothyroidism, not all patients normalize serum T3 levels with many advocating for combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. The latter could be relevant for a significant number of patients that remain symptomatic on monotherapy with levothyroxine, despite normalization of serum TSH levels.

Endocrine Society guideline — central hypothyroidism diagnosis and initial management: We recommend measuring serum free T4 (fT4) and TSH to evaluate central hypothyroidism, noting that an fT4 level below the laboratory reference range with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting levothyroxine (L-T4) if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114JbqvH]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

DTE, commonly known as Nature Thyroid, presents a distinct biochemical profile compared to synthetic levothyroxine (LT4), containing not only T4 and T3 but also additional thyroid hormones like T2 and calcitonin. This comprehensive hormonal composition may more closely mimic the natural output of the thyroid gland, potentially leading to improved symptom management for some patients. Many patients report a preference for DTE over LT4, often due to better relief from symptoms such as fatigue, mental fog, and difficulties with weight management, which are not as effectively addressed by LT4 alone. Additionally, genetic variations that impair the conversion of T4 to the more active T3 may make DTE, which directly supplies both hormones, particularly beneficial for these individuals. Furthermore, some studies suggest that DTE may promote weight loss and improve metabolic parameters, possibly due to the direct metabolic effects of T3. While DTE may offer advantages for certain subgroups of patients, especially those who do not achieve optimal results with LT4, it should be used cautiously, tailored to individual needs, and supported by more definitive, large-scale clinical trials to fully understand its long-term efficacy compared to LT4.

Our metanalysis does not suggest any clinical benefits of DTE or combined T4 and T3 supplementation over T4 therapy alone in the broader population.

These results highlight the complexity of thyroid hormone replacement therapy and the need for individualized treatment approaches. While combined T4 + T3 therapy offers distinct biochemical changes, these do not translate into significant clinical differences in lipid profiles, heart rate, or most quality-of-life measures. However, the observed improvement in mental well-being with combined therapy could be a potential area for further exploration.

There are several strengths alongside notable weaknesses. Among its strengths is the study's comprehensive literature search across multiple databases using a Boolean approach and specific keywords, which ensures a thorough collection of relevant studies. This is further enhanced by the exclusive focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), adhering to the highest standards of scientific evidence and significantly bolstering the reliability and validity of the findings. The rigorous data extraction process, conducted independently by multiple investigators and utilizing the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2), adds to the study's thoroughness and accuracy, minimizing potential biases in the included clinical trials. The detailed statistical analysis using Review Manager (RevMan) software, mean differences, standardized mean differences, and forest plots provides a robust and clear statistical framework, enhancing the study's credibility.

### Levothyroxine therapy, calculated deiodinases activity and basal metabolic rate in obese or nonobese patients after total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer, results of a retrospective observational study [^115WHe6n]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Several lines of evidence indicate that hypothyroid patients under levothyroxine replacement therapy may present impaired T3 production and a reduced T3/T4 ratio. The T3 pool derived from intrathyroidal conversion is absent and fails to maintain normal FT3 levels. As a consequence, their peripheral tissues may be underexposed to circulating T3. Our previous data indicate that 29.6% of levothyroxine‐treated athyreotic patients have a reduced FT3/FT4 ratio, and this percentage may progressively increase with increasing replacement levothyroxine dose. These changes may be due to an imbalance between central and peripheral deiodinase activity that may disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis in this subset of hypothyroid patients. In our study, we evaluated the total deiodinase activity (GD) by the SPINA cybernetic model. We found that our athyreotic patients with impaired GD received a larger dose of LT‐4 and had increased FT4 and TSHI levels, while the FT3/FT4 ratio and FT3 levels were reduced (all < 0.0001). GD was reduced in 31.2% of study patients, confirming our previous report since GD is well correlated with the FT3/FT4 ratio(Table 2). To better evaluate the interplay between GD, BMR and LT‐4 weekly cumulative dose (LT‐4 × week), we evaluated the ratio between LT‐4 × week and basal metabolic rate (LT‐4 × week/BMR) calculated by the formula of Mifflin St.‐Jeor. By this tool largely used to evaluate BMR in obese patients, we demonstrated that total GD activity was independently and inversely related to LT‐4 × week/BMR. According to this view, we analysed a subgroup of 45 patients with a stable LT‐4 dose, caloric intake and level of thyroid hormones for almost six months, and we found that a LT‐4 × week/BMR value of 0.56 mcg × week/Kcal can predict the impairment of GD (< 21 nmol/s) with good sensitivity and specificity (p = .01). To our knowledge, this is a new finding with a possible clinical implication in athyreotic patients receiving LT‐4 substitutive therapy. Interestingly, estimated BMR, BMI, age and sex were similar between the patients with normal or reduced GD, suggesting that LT‐4 dose and FT3 production are the two independent stronger predictors of GD. Cross‐sectional and longitudinal studies comparing post‐ and presurgical levels of L‐T4 prove that higher L‐T4 doses are associated with the suppression of deiodinase activity.FT4 and FT3 were higher in our obese (BMI ≥ 30) than in nonobese patients (BMI < 30) (p = .01, p = .07), and TSHI was positively related to BMI and LT‐4 × week/BMR and inversely related to GD. However, GD and LT‐4 × week/BRM were not different between obese and nonobese patients, suggesting that BMI is not an independent determinant of GD. The pituitary thyrotropic activity, expressed by the relationship between TSHI and thyroid hormone levels, was different between nonobese and obese patients. TSHI suppression was constantly exerted by increasing levels of FT4 in nonobese patients, while this suppression was significantly attenuated at higher levels of FT4 in obese patients, suggesting increased hypothalamic–pituitary resistance in response to increased T4 levels. The increment of FT4 for each unit of TSHI increment was significantly higher in obese patients than in nonobese patients (p = .04) (Figure 3). However, in accordance with the FT4 results, increasing levels of FT3 constantly suppressed TSHI in nonobese patients, while this suppression was increased at increasing levels of FT3 in obese patients (Figure 4). This T4 to T3 shunt, in terms of TSHI suppression observed in obese patients, suggests a defective hypothalamic pituitary T4 to T3 conversion. Moreover, FT4 levels were positively related to BMI as well as to T4 dose but only partially and inversely related to BMR when BMI effect was subtracted (Pearson, p = .01). Considering that FT4 levels in athyreotic patients are entirely dependent on LT‐4 adsorbed dose and on the extent of T4 degradation, this finding unravels a role of BMR on the modulation of FT4 bioavailability both in nonobese and in obese patients, those with greater lean body mass that leads to increased BMR. Differently than some recent studies, we did not evidence a statistically significant correlation of GD with BMR, however differently than the others studies we evaluated patients athyreotic by total thyroidectomy and 131 I ablation, this might contribute to increase the severity of suppression of the feedback loop and the ability to relay type 1 and type 2 allostatic load to T3 production. Moreover, we did not evaluate separately free fat mass and lean body mass. Under normal conditions, thyroid hormones and TSH are inversely correlated, while in patients with resistance to thyroid hormone, higher thyroid hormone levels correspond to high TSH levels due to a possible condition of resistance to FT4, such as in obese patients. One study demonstrated that deiodinase ubiquitination was an important factor in restoring euthyroidism. Indeed, the ubiquitin proteasome system in the hypothalamus of obese mice fails to maintain adequate function. Hence, a defective function of the ubiquitin proteasome system, resulting in deiodinase imbalance, might play a major role in the regulation of the response to thyroid hormones in obese subjects. Thyroid hormone action is modulated by the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid axis, and cell membrane transport, tissue deiodination and degradation and thyroid hormone metabolism in the liver may play an important role. Metabolism of exogenous substrates in the liver occurs by enzymes that either modify and/or conjugate the functional groups to endogenous substrates to increase their solubility to be readily eliminated. Approximately half of obese subjects display several abnormalities in liver enzymatic activity due to steatosis. In particular, increasing BMI and thyroid hormone receptor β are inversely correlated with different stages of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which, in turn, is related to decreased multidrug resistance protein (MRP2) activity in the liver. This condition is associated with alterations in the expression and function of enzymes and transporters resulting in an altered glucuronoconjugation of thyroid hormones. However, our study is descriptive and does not allow any direct evaluation of mechanistic insights related to T4 activation, degradation and stability.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^116nNBTv]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism treatment — future research priorities include strategies to avoid iatrogenic thyroid disease in treated individuals and to aid compliance with levothyroxine (LT4) therapy, and a better understanding of maternal-fetal physiology during pregnancy with development of improved titration of LT4 for hypothyroid pregnant patients. Additional needs are further studies of soft gel LT4 capsules; further study and improved standardization of compounded formulations of LT4 and/or liothyronine (LT3); development of additional biomarkers of euthyroidism, which may supplement the use of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as a biomarker; and improved understanding of how triiodothyronine (T3) levels are affected by age and disease status with reference ranges indexed to age and health status, including clarification of the relative importance of maintaining specific serum T3 concentrations. Research is encouraged into the relationship between serum T3 and T3 concentrations in specific tissues; development of more accurate assays to measure serum concentrations of free triiodothyronine (FT3), total T3, and free thyroxine (FT4); development of a sustained release T3 preparation that can be prospectively tested in clinical trials, e.g., in combination with LT4 in a physiologic ratio of about 14:1; and, if such a preparation is unavailable, studying when, if ever, the use of LT3 would be beneficial in selected patients with apparent decreased T4 to T3 conversion and disproportionately low serum T3 levels. Long-term outcome research using thyroid extracts that includes documentation of the consequences of excursions in serum T3 concentrations, development of thyroid hormone (TH) analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile, and pursuit of research into developing thyroid stem cells as a potential avenue for understanding thyrocyte physiology and as a possible future treatment for hypothyroidism are also identified.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^111i5KXh]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis factitia — diagnosis hinges on evidence of exogenous hormone ingestion with characteristic laboratory and imaging patterns, and management options in overdose have been described. Thyrotoxicosis factitia includes all causes of thyrotoxicosis due to the ingestion of thyroid hormone; clues to this diagnosis are an absence of goiter, a suppressed serum thyroglobulin level, and a decreased RAIU, though in the presence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies the distinction from painless thyroiditis can be difficult. In both situations there will be elevated levels of T4, a high T3 to T4 ratio (with exogenous levothyroxine), a small thyroid, and a low thyroidal RAIU, and thyroid ultrasound may be helpful because the thyroid has a heterogeneous echotexture and is normal size or slightly enlarged in painless thyroiditis, while is small with a normal echotexture in an otherwise normal individual who is ingesting thyroid hormone surreptitiously. Fecal levothyroxine has been measured as a means of distinguishing surreptitious use of thyroid hormone from painless thyroiditis, and a disproportionately elevated T3 level suggests that the patient may be ingesting liothyronine or a combination T4/T3 preparation; severe thyrotoxicosis and rarely, thyroid storm, have been reported after overdose or poisoning, and treatment with cholestyramine and charcoal hemoperfusion have been used in this circumstance.

### Biochemical markers reflecting thyroid function in athyreotic patients on levothyroxine monotherapy [^1141ywjm]. Thyroid (2017). Low credibility.

In addition, few studies of the effects of thyroid hormone on biochemical markers of bone turnover or bone mineral density (BMD) according to the presence of both latent hypoparathyroidism and subclinical thyrotoxicosis have been reported. The authors and other investigators studied the BMD in patients who underwent total thyroidectomy, and the results revealed that BMD values were higher in the patients with latent or overt hypoparathyroidism than they were in the patients without hypoparathyroidism. Thus, the reason why the effect of the TSH-suppressive treatment by LT4 on bone metabolism in patients who underwent total thyroidectomy is unclear may be that such patients not only have mildly decreased PTH levels but also have normal serum T3 levels. As a factor that reflects bone metabolism in patients who have undergone a thyroidectomy, it has been proposed that TSH may be a direct negative regulator of bone turnover acting via the TSH receptor on both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. However, the existing data on the potential role of TSH on bone remodeling are conflicting.

Athyreotic patients who have undergone a total thyroidectomy live in a chronic condition of abnormal thyroid hormone status for the remainder of their lives. Therefore, even though the thyroidal dysfunction may be subtle, its long-term effects cannot be overlooked. The ATA states in its guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism that there is insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend that treatment with LT4 be targeted to achieve low-normal TSH values or high-normal T3 values in patients with hypothyroidism who are athyreotic. The results of the present study suggest that a mildly TSH suppression of LT4 can be recommended to achieve preoperative native fT3 levels and euthyroid status in athyreotic patients who have undergone a total thyroidectomy. The ATA guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and DTC state that the serum TSH should be maintained < 0.1 mIU/L indefinitely in the absence of specific contraindications in patients with persistent disease in the long-term follow-up of DTC. The present findings suggest that a mildly TSH-suppressive treatment (approximately 0.1 mIU/L by LT4) may not necessarily cause thyrotoxicosis. Rather, it may result in euthyroidism in patients who have undergone a total thyroidectomy for DTC.

### The pharmacodynamic equivalence of levothyroxine and liothyronine: a randomized, double blind, cross-over study in thyroidectomized patients [^112FF1a2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

The substitution of liothyronine (L-T3) for levothyroxine (L-T4) is commonly employed during thyroid hormone (TH) withdrawal in preparation for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on thyroid cancer patients. Presently, only limited data are available on the L-T3 for L-T4 therapeutic substitution. Objective To characterize the pharmcodynamic equivalence of L-T3 and L-T4.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, cross-over intervention study.

Setting

NIH clinical center.

Patients

Ten thyroidectomized patients.

Interventions

Study participants were treated with L-T3 or L-T4 with a target TSH ≥ 0.5 ≤ 1.5 mU/l for at least 30 days before undergoing inpatient testing. Following testing, subjects crossed-over according to the same scheme.

Main Outcome Measures

Area under the serum concentration-time curve of TSH from 0 to 60 min (AUC(0–60)) and peak TSH serum concentration (C(max)) following thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test, total L-T4 and L-T3 dose (mcg/kg), and L-T4/L-T3 ratio.

Results

No difference was observed for time 0 TSH values between L-T3 and L-T4 replacement phases (1.48 ± 0.77 vs. 1.21 ± 0.62 mU/l, P = 0.293) at average daily doses of 40.3 ± 11.3 mcg L-T3 and 115.2 ± 38.5 mcg L-T4, L-T3: L-T4 ratio 0.36 ± 0.06. TRH stimulation test resulted in similar L-T3 vs. L-T4 TSH responses with AUC(0–60) of 326.1 (95% CI 232.6–457.1) and 247.1 (95% CI 153.8–397.1) mU* min/l (P = 0.285); and C(max) of 6.83 (95% CI 4.88–9.55) and 5.23 (95% CI 3.31–8.3) mU/l (P = 0.383).

Conclusions

This is the first study addressing the equivalency between L-T3 and L-T4 therapy measured by baseline and TRH-stimulated TSH. The therapeutic substitution of L-T3 for L-T4 was achieved at approximately 1:3 ratio.

### Effects of thyrotropin on peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism and serum lipids [^1146tgfJ]. Thyroid (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Whether these effects are in part mediated via direct effects of thyrotropin (TSH) on peripheral thyroid hormone (TH) metabolism and/or concentrations of serum lipids is not clear.

Objective

This study examined whether TSH has direct effects on peripheral TH metabolism and serum lipids.

Methods

Eighty-two patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had undergone total thyroidectomy and 131 I remnant ablation. During follow-up, two successive injections of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) were administered to patients on a stable dose of levothyroxine. In all patients, TSH, thyroxine (T4), free T4 (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), reverse T3 (rT3), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein(a), and triglyceride levels were measured immediately before the first and approximately 72 hours after the second injection of rhTSH.

Results

After rhTSH stimulation, T3 values decreased (from 1.91 to 1.81nmol/L; p < 0.001). T4, fT4, and rT3 did not change. After rhTSH, median apolipoprotein B increased from 0.90 to 0.92g/L (p = 0.03), lipoprotein(a) from 0.21 to 0.24g/L (p < 0.001), and triglycerides from 1.98 to 2.50mmol/L (p < 0.001). Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased from 0.98 to 0.81mmol/L (p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that the changes in lipids were most closely associated with the decrease in T3 levels.

Conclusions

TSH has direct effects on peripheral TH metabolism by decreasing T3 levels in levothyroxine-treated thyroidectomized patients. This decrease in T3 levels is accompanied by unfavorable changes in serum lipids.

### Serum thyroid hormone balance in levothyroxine monotherapy-treated patients with atrophic thyroid after radioiodine treatment for Graves' disease [^116pxr21]. Thyroid (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There are two thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). T3 is the biologically active thyroid hormone. In normal subjects, 100% of T4 is secreted by the thyroid, ∼20% of T3 is secreted from the thyroid gland, and ∼80% of T3 is derived from the conversion of T4 to T3 in extra-thyroidal peripheral tissues. A relative T3 deficiency may, thus, be present in athyreotic patients during levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy. We and other investigators compared postoperative T3 levels in patients on LT4 therapy with their own preoperative levels or with those in controls. These studies indicate that in the athyreotic condition after total thyroidectomy during LT4 therapy, patients with normal serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels had mildly low serum free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels, and patients with suppressed serum TSH levels had normal serum fT3 levels.

Radioiodine (131 I) is used as the definitive treatment in many patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. Of the patients who receive radioiodine treatment for Graves' disease, most eventually develop hypothyroidism after radioiodine treatment and require thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Biological effects of 131 I include necrosis and impaired replication of follicular cells, fibrosis, and a chronic inflammatory response, which, ultimately, result in permanent atrophic changes of the thyroid gland. Although reduction of the thyroid volume (TV) after radioiodine treatment by using ultrasonography has been reported, a few studies have evaluated thyroidal function including serum T3 levels of hypothyroid patients on LT4 after radioiodine treatment, because patients who had normal serum TSH and fT4 levels were generally considered to have euthyroidism.

In this study, we compared serum fT4 and fT3 levels in hypothyroid patients on LT4 who presented atrophic thyroid changes after radioiodine treatment with those in a healthy control group to evaluate the effect of the reduction of the TV after radioiodine treatment for serum thyroid hormone balance. We also evaluated serum thyroid hormone levels in groups of patients who were stratified according to their TVs.

### Comparative effectiveness of levothyroxine, desiccated thyroid extract, and levothyroxine + liothyronine in hypothyroidism [^1116fwMY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The rationale behind thyroid hormone replacement therapy is to administer thyroid hormone in a way that restores thyroid hormone signaling in all tissues. Serum TSH has traditionally been used to adjust the dose of levothyroxine that presumably achieves this goal. However, normalization of serum TSH is achieved through a slightly elevated serum T4 and reduced serum T3 levels. TSH was higher in the DTE arm but still within the normal range. It was difficult to make DTE and LT4 doses bioequivalent. It is not known whether these small changes in serum T3 and T4 modify thyroid hormone signaling. The observation in the present investigation that replacement therapy containing T3 or DTE (which also contains T3) slightly elevates serum T3 and reduces serum T4, whereas mitigating the residual symptoms of hypothyroidism suggests a causal relationship. Nonetheless, our findings are clear that no correlation between serum T3 and outcomes could be established in the present investigation, not even in the subanalyses. This apparent conundrum suggests that intracellular T3 levels, which are affected by both serum T3 and locally generated T3, might be playing a role.

It is well known that thyroid hormone plays a role in the development of an adult brain, as documented by the modifications in mood, behavior, and cognition observed during the transition from hypo- to euthyroidism and to hyperthyroidism. In fact, the human temporal pole responds promptly to minimal changes in thyroid hormone signaling. Unique about the brain is that thyroid hormone signaling exhibits additional layers of complexity; thus, there are multiple mechanisms that can fail and compromise thyroid hormone signaling. Although plasma T3 can be taken up by the brain, most T3 molecules in the brain are produced locally in the glial cells through deiodination of T4 via DIO2. T3 exits the glial cells and subsequently functions in a paracrine fashion to activate neuronal gene expression. That some patients on LT4 monotherapy remain symptomatic and prefer therapy containing T3 suggests that therapy with LT4 might not restore cerebral thyroid hormone in all patients. Hypothetically, this could be explained by defects in thyroid hormone transporters, the DIO2 pathway, or by the relatively low serum T3 levels seen in LT4-treated patients, but none of these factors segregated in the most symptomatic LT4-treated patients. The possibility that the relatively higher plasma T4 levels seen in LT4-treated patients might play a role remains to be investigated.

### Does a combination regimen of thyroxine (T4) and 3, 5, 3'-triiodothyronine improve depressive symptoms better than T4 alone in patients with hypothyroidism? Results of a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial [^1114yr6n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Some hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine replacement therapy complain of depressive symptoms despite normal TSH measurements. It is not known whether adding T(3) can reverse such symptoms. We randomized 40 individuals with depressive symptoms who were taking a stable dose of levothyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism (excluding those who underwent thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid) to receive T(4) plus placebo or the combination of T(4) plus T(3) in a double-blind manner for 15 wk. Participants receiving combination therapy had their prestudy dose of T(4) dropped by 50%, and T(3) was started at a dose of 12.5 micro g, twice daily. T(4) and T(3) doses were adjusted to keep goal TSH concentrations within the normal range. Compared with the group taking T(4) alone, the group taking both T(4) plus T(3) did not report any improvement in self-rated mood and well-being scores that included all subscales of the Symptom Check-List-90, the Comprehensive Epidemiological Screen for Depression, and the Multiple Outcome Study (P > 0.05 for all indexes). In conclusion, the current data do not support the routine use of combined T(3) and T(4) therapy in hypothyroid patients with depressive symptoms.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^115HDbf5]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Thyroid extracts versus levothyroxine in adults with primary hypothyroidism — recommendation: We recommend that levothyroxine be considered as routine care for patients with primary hypothyroidism, in preference to use of thyroid extracts. Although there is preliminary evidence from a short-duration study that some patients may prefer treatment using thyroid extracts, high-quality controlled long-term outcome data are lacking to document superiority of this treatment compared to levothyroxine therapy. Furthermore, there are safety concerns related to the use of thyroid extracts, such as the presence of supraphysiologic serum triiodothyronine levels and a paucity of long-term safety outcome data. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic modeling: a novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^117MxN5T]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

The consequences of efficient dosage adjustments after thyroidectomy in terms of work capacity, sick leave, quality of life, or other patient-reported outcomes have to be determined before we know whether a minimum of five postoperative blood draws is acceptable. The number is comparable with routine follow-up in the first author's clinic before development of the DAT (Supplemental Data). There is, however large variation in the reported number of necessary dosage adjustments after thyroidectomy, probably reflecting that optimal care is yet to be established. We believe that the advantages of the DAT outweigh the extra cost of early blood samples, for example by reducing the number of follow-up visits and shortening the dosage adjustment period. In addition, further refinement of our model could lower the number of needed samples.

The failure of the simplified DAT to improve dosage for thyrotoxic patients suggests that individual fT4-TSH estimations are necessary to achieve successful dosage with our model. The majority of the patients in the thyrotoxicosis group had a totally suppressed TSH before surgery and were still on anti-thyroid hormone drugs. Slow recovery of normal TSH dynamics after prolonged suppression made our model vulnerable to mistakes, as it relied heavily on initial blood samples. In addition, our assumption that a log-linear relationship exists between TSH and fT4 may not be valid for this group. The overall altered metabolism in patients with Graves' disease could also be changing during the course of follow-up, making initial estimations invalid later on.

In conclusion, application of the DAT for LT4 dosage was superior to clinician dosage adjustment in patients who were euthyroid before total thyroidectomy. Further studies should include patient-reported outcome measures and investigate whether faster dosage adjustment has direct implications for health or quality of life.

Combined Therapy of T4 and T3

Although the predominant treatment of thyroxine supplementation is LT4 monotherapy, 10% to 15% of patients have persistent or recurrent hypothyroid symptoms (weight gain, fatigue, memory loss, etc.) despite normal TH levels and medical adhesion. This phenomenon is assumed to be attributed to a low level of circulating T3, which plays a superior role to T4 in the feedback of the hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid axis. A previous study showed a 10% to 20% reduction in serum T3 levels in ∼1.8 thousand LT4-treated hypothyroid patients compared with the healthy population. Similar phenomena were also observed in thyroidectomized rats, which reached euthyroidism only after normalization of serum T3 levels.

Based on the theory above, clinicians have returned to combined therapy of T4 plus T3 to eliminate hypothyroid symptoms, with strict indications. Clinicians supported that only hypothyroid patients treated with a stable dose of LT4 for at least 6 months, who had experienced persistent symptoms and had a normal serum TSH level, should receive T4 plus T3 combination therapy. However, those with associated comorbidities (eg, autoimmune diseases and psychological dysfunctions) or unrealistic expectations should not receive combination therapy. The dose ratio of T3 to T4 in combination therapy is a controversial area. Ratios ranging from 1:3 to 1:17 have been reported in several articles. Considering that the physiological ratio of T3:T4 secreted by the thyroid gland is approximately 1:14 and the residual thyroid has secretory function, a ratio between 1:8 and 1:13 may be more appropriate. Animal-derived DTE has also been introduced to treat refractory hypothyroidism due to combinations of T3 and T4 in a 1:4.22 ratio. Animal-derived DTE contains a supraphysiological amount of T3, and cardiac complications should be monitored with caution.

### A new strategy to estimate levothyroxine requirement after total thyroidectomy for benign thyroid disease [^116E5xgF]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The current approach for calculating the starting dose of levothyroxine (LT4) after total thyroidectomy is based on the patient's body weight (BW). The aim of the study was to identify the major predictive factors of LT4 requirement and to elaborate a new method to improve the accuracy of the LT4 starting dose after total thyroidectomy.

Methods

The study consists of two parts. The first part consisted of the retrospective identification of 92 adult patients (retrospective cohort) who had undergone a total thyroidectomy for benign disease and who had begun LT4 treatment at a dose of 1.6μg/kg/day. Adjustments to optimize the LT4 dose were then performed at the post-surgery follow-up on the basis of serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. The results of this retrospective analysis were used to formulate a nomogram for a proper calculation of the LT4 starting dose that was then used prospectively in the second part of the study on 31 consecutive patients (prospective cohort).

Results

At the first follow-up, 37 (40%) patients from the retrospective cohort were euthyroid. Univariate analysis indicated significant correlations between the optimal dose of LT4 and BW, body mass index (BMI), age, preoperative mean corpuscular volume, and free triiodothyronine (fT3). The optimal dose of LT4, analyzed for BMI and age, showed an inverse relationship with these two parameters, and ranged from 1.4 to 1.8μg/kg/day. In the prospective cohort, the use of an age- and BMI-related nomogram improved the prediction of the optimal LT4 starting dose, with 68% of patients being euthyroid at the first follow-up compared to 41% of patients reported to have reached euthyroid state using the best strategy proposed in the literature.

Conclusions

This study confirms that BW is not the only variable for predicting LT4 requirement, as it decreases with the increase in age and BMI, probably due to the relative decrease of lean body mass. A new correlation between optimal dose and presurgical levels of fT3 and mean corpuscular volume was observed. We propose an easy and more efficient method of calculating LT4 starting dose after total thyroidectomy for benign disease.

### Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the combined preparation of levothyroxine plus sustained-release liothyronine; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^114jLber]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Nineteen hypothyroid patients adhered to the allocated therapy until the end of the study. The baseline characteristics of the intervention and control groups were presented in Table 1. The mean age of the study population was 59.1 ± 7.8 y. of whom 13 patients (68.4%) were women. The mean BMI value was 28.2 ± 4.5 kg/m 2. There was no difference in age, sex, BMI, and serum concentrations of thyroid hormones among trial groups at baseline.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of the intervention and control groups at baseline

* values are based onmean ± SD; Group A (9 µg SR-T3 + 68.5 µg LT4), Group B (12 µg SR-T3 + 60 µg LT4), Group C (LT4 monotherapy)

Two combined preparations of LT4 + SR-T3 did not have enough potency to attain normal TSH values; however, after increasing the dosage, serum TSH concentrations reached values within the normal ranges. Table 2 compares serum TSH, TT3, TT4, FT3, and FT4 concentrations and T3/T4 ratios between the intervention (A, B and A + B) and control groups at the baseline and follow-ups before and after 12 weeks of intervention. Non-significant increase was observed in serum TSH values in group A (from 0.8 ± 1.08 to 5.4 ± 4.7 mU/L), and B (from 0.8 ± 0.7 to 3.2 ± 1.5 mU/L). After intervention, serum free and total T4 concentrations decreased in the intervention groups (A&B) with a significant reduction only in group B (10.1 ± 1.05 to 7.5 ± 0.3 µg/dL). Serum T3 concentration increased only in group B after intervention, however, the before-after difference was not significant. Serum T3/T4 ratio increased significantly in both groups A and B after intervention, with the highest increase in group B (from 8.6 ± 2.03 to 12.2 ± 1.6 ng/µg). Although there was significant decrease in serum T4 values and increase in T3\T4 ratio within the intervention groups, no differences were observed in serum concentrations of TSH, T4, T3 and T3/T4 ratio among different groups at follow-up (Supplement 1).

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^115izZ2e]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism therapy — biomarkers, tissue euthyroidism, and combination therapy uncertainties note that replication of the endogenous circadian rhythm in T3 may also optimize therapy, but current exogenous therapies do not reproduce endogenous serum T3 excursions or serum T3 rhythms. LT4 therapy results in a higher serum T4/T3 ratio than in the nonthyroidic state, and it is not known whether there is a detrimental effect of this abnormal serum T4/T3 ratio. Serum TSH is considered to be the best marker currently available, yet normal serum TSH may be documented despite biochemical parameters indicating tissue hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and the biologic activity of serum TSH is not always concordant with its measured concentrations. Animal studies show that a normal serum T3 is not necessarily accompanied by a normal T3 concentration in all tissues, and commercially available tests to indicate tissue status in humans are not available. In combination therapy studies, a study that appeared to show a benefit at 3 months no longer showed maintenance of this benefit at 12 months, and the serum T3 response has not been rigorously assessed in many trials with restoration of serum T3 to "normal" generally not an endpoint.

Discussion

Decreased serum T4 concentrations and increased serum T3 concentration in treatment with 12 µg SR-T3 plus 60 µg LT4 led to a significant increase in serum T3/T4 ratio after intervention; however, serum T3/T4 ratio was lower than the normal serum T3/T4 ratio in euthyroid subjects (~ 1:14–15) and no difference was observed in serum T3, T4 and T3/T4 ratio after intervention between CBT (combination therapy) and LT4 monotherapy groups. Single dose administration of LT4 + SR-T3 was associated with more improved T3-derived Tmax(~ 4–5 h) and Cmax (~ 105 ng/dl) while serum T3 concentration remained within normal ranges with no fluctuation for 24 h after achieving maximum level.

The only study by Hennemann et al. with randomized crossover design on fifteen patients (mean age of 50 y.) with primary hypothyroidism showed that T4 plus sustained-release T3 (1:20 ratio) improved serum TSH, T4, and T3 concentrations and the T4/T3 ratio compared to treatment with LT4 alone, while non-physiologic T3 peaks were avoided. In the current survey, despite a significant increase in serum T3/T4 ratio in intervention groups, no difference was observed in serum thyroid hormone profile and T3/T4 ratio between CBT and LT4 monotherapy groups at follow-up, however similar to the Hennemann study sustained-release T3 did not indicate serum T3 peaks during 24 h. Our study had the preference of using more appropriate SR-T3 dosage and including only patients in whom thyroid gland was ablated by radioactive iodine; while in the study by Hennemann, hypothyroid patients with heterogeneous etiology, e.g. Hashimoto thyroiditis, were included in whom endogenous thyroid hormone might interfere with the results. In both study despite normal serum TSH concentration achieved, mean serum T3/T4 ratio did not reach mean values of euthyroid subjects. To address the issue, either we should increase the ratio of LT4 or slightly increase SR-T3. Increase LT4 values besides reducing the ratio of T3/T4, may inactivate type 2 deiodinase and reduce active T3 in peripheral tissues. Therefore, it seems that combination therapy with higher T3/T4 ratio might be beneficial.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^113Fad1b]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^113yC48n]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the current standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

Methods

Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed, using the American College of Physicians system. The final document was organized so that each topic is introduced with a question, followed by a formal clinical recommendation. Stakeholder input was received at a national meeting, with some subsequent refinement of the clinical questions addressed in the document. Consensus was achieved for all recommendations by the task force.

Results

We reviewed the following therapeutic categories: (i) levothyroxine therapy, (ii) non-levothyroxine-based thyroid hormone therapies, and (iii) use of thyroid hormone analogs. The second category included thyroid extracts, synthetic combination therapy, triiodothyronine therapy, and compounded thyroid hormones.

Conclusions

We concluded that levothyroxine should remain the standard of care for treating hypothyroidism. We found no consistently strong evidence for the superiority of alternative preparations (e.g., levothyroxine-liothyronine combination therapy, or thyroid extract therapy, or others) over monotherapy with levothyroxine, in improving health outcomes. Some examples of future research needs include the development of superior biomarkers of euthyroidism to supplement thyrotropin measurements, mechanistic research on serum triiodothyronine levels (including effects of age and disease status, relationship with tissue concentrations, as well as potential therapeutic targeting), and long-term outcome clinical trials testing combination therapy or thyroid extracts (including subgroup effects). Additional research is also needed to develop thyroid hormone analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^1179LeJB]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Myxedema coma — therapeutic endpoints and monitoring with LT4: intravenous levothyroxine treatment may lead to improvement in cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, and metabolic parameters within a week, with serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations increasing or normalizing within a similar time frame and more gradual serum TSH improvement; therapeutic endpoints should be improved mental status, improved cardiac function, and improved pulmonary function, and measurement of thyroid hormones every 1–2 days is reasonable to ensure a favorable trajectory; failure of TSH to trend down or of thyroid hormone levels to improve could be considered indications to increase levothyroxine therapy and/or add liothyronine therapy, whereas high serum triiodothyronine should be considered an indication to decrease therapy. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism… [^1173f16L]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

8 of four levothyroxine preparations, including two brand-name products and two generic preparations, demonstrated relative bioequivalence. Patients switched from any one of the four preparations to another showed insignificant variations in their thyroid function tests. Among the four products, the only difference noted was that Synthroid produced a more rapid and higher rise in the T 3 level after administration. However, the difference was not statistically significant and is of questionable clinical importance. INITIATING TREATMENT Most otherwise healthy adult patients with hypothyroidism require thyroid hormone replacement in a dosage of 1. 7 μg per kg per day, with requirements falling to 1 μg per kg per day in the elderly. Thus, levothyroxine in a dosage of 0. 10 to
0. 15 mg per day is needed to achieve euthyroid status. For full replacement, children may require up to 4 μg per kg per day.

Levothyroxine should be initiated in a low dosage in older patients and those at risk for the cardiovascular compromise that could occur with a rapid increase in resting heart rate and blood pressure. 9 In these patients, the usual starting dosage is 0. 025 mg per day. This dosage can be increased in increments of 0. 025 to
0. 050 mg every four to six weeks until the TSH level returns to normal. In a study 11 of 33 middle-aged patients with stable hypothyroidism who were already receiving levothyroxine, small improvements in mood, memory and cold tolerance occurred after triiodothyronine was added, in a dosage of 0. 0125 mg per day, with a concomitant
0. 05-mg decrease in the usual levothyroxine dosage. 16 SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM The TSH level can be mildly elevated when the free T. With conditions that cause an increase in serum binding proteins, such as high estrogen states, oral contraceptive use or postmenopausal estrogen replacement, the dosage of levothyroxine must be increased. In contrast, androgens decrease levels of thyroid binding proteins, necessitating a reduction in the dosage. Older patients also have lower serum protein levels and may require reductions in their maintenance dosage over time. Nephrosis, protein-losing enteropathies and cirrhosis are other conditions that require a reduced thyroid hormone dosage.

### Hypothyroidism: diagnosis and treatment… [^112wUhU4]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone has known inotropic effects on cardiac tissue and can increase myocardial oxygen demand. For older patients or those with coronary artery disease, levothyroxine therapy should be started at 25 to 50 mcg per day, with titration of 25 mcg every three to four weeks until a target dosage is achieved to decrease the potential for adverse effects from thyroid excess. Adding T 3 to levothyroxine does not additionally alleviate symptoms of hypothyroidism. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials found no difference in symptoms or quality of life in patients treated with levothyroxine monotherapy vs. levothyroxine plus combination therapy. 32 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists does not recommend desiccated thyroid hormone and finds insufficient evidence to recommend combination levothyroxine/T 3 therapy over levothyroxine monotherapy. 3, or both.

25 Levothyroxine should be given as a slow intravenous bolus of 200 to 400 mcg initially, followed by 50 to 100 mcg orally per day. Reduce dosing by 75% if it is being administered intravenously. For combination treatment, T 3 is given at the same time as levothyroxine and dosed at 5 to 20 mcg, then 2. 5 to 10 mcg every eight hours until clinical improvement. Lower dosages are appropriate in older adults and patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. Stress-dose glucocorticoids should be administered until adrenal insufficiency is ruled out. Serum FT 4 and T 3 should be monitored every one to two days, with samples drawn at least one hour after dosing T 3. The TSH level should drop by 50% per week on adequate treatment. After clinical improvement, the patient may transition to oral levothyroxine monotherapy. 21, 25.

16 In nonpregnant patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, levothyroxine therapy should be considered when the TSH level is greater than 10 mIU per L or the TPO antibody level is elevated. 16, 17, 34 The benefits of treating women with subclinical hypothyroidism who are pregnant or attempting to conceive are unclear. 17.
