## Question

What are the risks of rubella infection to the fetus at 12 weeks gestation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks to the fetus if a pregnant person contracts rubella at 12 weeks' gestation, specifically regarding the likelihood of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and how to interpret and counsel on that risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the timing-specific risk estimates for CRS by gestational week. Then, I should verify how 12 weeks fits within those windows and whether it is still "early first trimester" for teratogenic risk. Next, I will review the spectrum of CRS defects and their likelihood at this timing. After that, I should consider pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage and stillbirth. Finally, I will synthesize a practical risk estimate and outline counseling, testing, and follow-up steps, including vaccine safety context and prenatal diagnostics where appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the timing-specific risk data. Multiple sources converge on a steep decline in CRS risk after the earliest weeks: risk is highest at ≤ 9 weeks, about 85%, then falls to roughly 52% between 9 and 12 weeks, and continues to decline thereafter, becoming minimal after about 16–20 weeks. Some summaries still cite up to 90% risk in the very early first trimester, which aligns with the steep early risk gradient [^114Nv9r6] [^113Y3zmt] [^112YVmDs].

> Wait, let me verify where 12 weeks sits in those windows. At exactly 12 weeks, the fetus is at the very end of the 9–12 week interval, so the best point estimate from the cited data is approximately 52% risk of CRS if maternal infection occurred at 12 weeks. Importantly, this is not a binary cliff, and the risk begins to fall further after 12 weeks, but it remains substantial through the end of the first trimester before tapering off in the second trimester [^114Nv9r6] [^116u7Eq4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity without reviewing the defect spectrum. CRS classically involves the triad of sensorineural deafness, congenital cataracts, and congenital heart disease, with additional findings such as microcephaly, developmental delay, and thrombocytopenia; at 12 weeks, organogenesis of the heart, eyes, and inner ear is ongoing, so the risk of these defects remains clinically meaningful, and contemporary series continue to document high burdens of cardiac and auditory defects in CRS, consistent with historical pathophysiology [^11672iCU] [^11655Hc7] [^112vBAMb].

> I need to check pregnancy outcomes beyond CRS. Early first-trimester rubella is associated with increased risks of miscarriage and stillbirth; while precise week-specific risks vary by cohort and ascertainment, the direction is consistent across epidemiologic and clinical reports, and the risk remains elevated in the first trimester even if the CRS risk declines after 12 weeks [^112YVmDs] [^116u7Eq4].

> Let me synthesize a practical estimate for counseling. For infection at 12 weeks, the most defensible point estimate is about a 50% chance of CRS, acknowledging that some sources still cite up to 90% risk very early and that the risk falls progressively after 12 weeks. I should emphasize that this is a population estimate and individual outcomes are binary, so counseling should remain cautious and scenario-based [^114Nv9r6] [^113Y3zmt] [^112YVmDs].

> Next, I should review immediate clinical steps. I should confirm maternal infection with acute-phase serology (IgM and IgG with avidity) and coordinate with obstetrics and infectious diseases. If infection is confirmed, discuss the risks of CRS and miscarriage, consider detailed early anatomy ultrasound and fetal echocardiography given the cardiac risk, and, where available and acceptable, discuss prenatal diagnostic options such as amniocentesis with PCR for rubella RNA and/or fetal blood sampling for rubella-specific IgM, recognizing that detection in fetal blood may be more sensitive than amniotic fluid in some contexts [^114axebi] [^11727nWK].

> I should double-check vaccine safety context because families often ask. MMR is contraindicated in pregnancy, but inadvertent vaccination during pregnancy has not been associated with CRS in large series and programmatic follow-ups. Nonetheless, standard practice remains to avoid pregnancy for about 4 weeks after MMR and to vaccinate postpartum if nonimmune, which supports counseling that prior missed vaccination is not an indication to terminate a current pregnancy [^111NGtoP] [^111AU1f1] [^113UfSHK].

> But wait, what about prevention for future pregnancies and public health implications. Ensuring rubella immunity before conception is the most effective strategy to prevent CRS; prenatal screening for rubella immunity is standard, and nonimmune patients should be vaccinated postpartum with contraception for one month, while maintaining vigilance for imported cases where maternal travel or exposure history may be the key clue in otherwise low-incidence settings [^113xvG9N] [^114VJgaz].

> In summary, I should confirm that at 12 weeks' gestation, the estimated CRS risk is approximately 50% if maternal rubella infection is confirmed, with additional risks of miscarriage and stillbirth. Counseling should be explicit about the timing-dependent nature of risk, the classic CRS phenotype, and the options for prenatal diagnosis and serial fetal surveillance, while coordinating care with maternal-fetal medicine and pediatric specialists for anticipatory guidance and postnatal planning [^114Nv9r6] [^112YVmDs].

Rubella infection at 12 weeks' gestation carries a **high risk of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)** [^114Nv9r6], with approximately 52% of fetuses affected [^114Nv9r6]. The risk is highest in the first trimester and declines after 16 weeks, but at 12 weeks the fetus remains vulnerable to severe defects, including congenital heart disease, sensorineural deafness, cataracts, and developmental delay [^114Nv9r6] [^112YVmDs]. Miscarriage and stillbirth are also increased [^1117YScz]. There is no safe or effective treatment during pregnancy [^notfound]; prevention through preconception vaccination is essential [^111NGtoP] [^114s56R9]. If infection occurs, offer detailed ultrasound and fetal echocardiography, and provide counseling on risks and options, including pregnancy termination [^114axebi] [^116bu7n3].

## Maternal and pregnancy complications

Maternal complications are typically mild, including low-grade fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy [^114pMo7Y]. Pregnancy complications include an **increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth**, particularly with first-trimester infection [^1117YScz] [^112YVmDs].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Maternal serology**: Rubella-specific IgM and IgG to confirm acute infection [^11727nWK].
- **Ultrasound**: Detailed anomaly scan and fetal echocardiography to assess structural defects [^114axebi].
- **Prenatal diagnosis**: Amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling for viral detection (PCR) may be considered [^11727nWK].

---

## Management and prevention strategies

- **No treatment**: There is no safe or effective treatment for rubella in pregnancy [^notfound].
- **Supportive care**: Symptomatic management for maternal illness [^notfound].
- **Counseling**: Discuss risks, options, and consider pregnancy termination where legally permissible [^116bu7n3].
- **Prevention**: Preconception vaccination with MMR is essential; vaccination during pregnancy is contraindicated [^111NGtoP] [^114s56R9].

## Long-term implications for the child

Long-term implications include **permanent disabilities** — sensorineural deafness, congenital heart disease, cataracts, and developmental delay [^11655Hc7] — as well as chronic infections with persistent rubella virus shedding, requiring isolation and infection control [^116u7Eq4]. These children also face increased healthcare needs and educational support requirements [^notfound].

Rubella and CRS surveillance are necessary to assess disease burden before RCV introduction, to monitor disease burden and epidemiology after introduction, to identify pregnant women infected with rubella virus who require follow-up to assess pregnancy outcomes, and to identify, diagnose, and manage CRS-affected infants. Countries report information on immunization schedules, vaccination campaigns, number of vaccine doses administered through routine immunization services, and other WHO monitoring data to WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) each year using the Joint Reporting Form (JRF). Surveillance data, including number of cases of rubella and CRS, are also reported to WHO and UNICEF through the JRF using standard case definitions. For this report, JRF data from the period 2000–2016 were analyzed; analyses focused on data from 2000 (initiation of accelerated measles control activities), 2012 (the new phase of rubella elimination), 2014 (the last worldwide update), and 2016 (the most recent data available).

Congenital heart defect (CHD) environmental causes — risk window, risk factors, and counseling actions are outlined: Environmental causes could explain approximately 2% of CHDs; the exposure window has been defined as three months prior to conception extending through the first trimester of pregnancy, with special attention to the first 2–6 weeks of gestation; given uncertainties, genetic counselors should exercise caution in excluding a genetic etiology, even when a teratogenic cause is plausible; obtaining information from the history about the possible presence of external risk factors can be valuable and should be considered; across all CHDs, one of the strongest environmental risk factors was pre-gestational diabetes, with additional risk factors including first-trimester maternal rubella infection, maternal phenylketonuria (hyperphenylalaninemia), exposure to particular classes of medications, and advanced maternal age; and, given this, we recommend assessing for the following prenatal history: dosage and timing of any maternal medication exposure, maternal A1c levels (both pre-pregnancy and during pregnancy), level of gestational or pre-gestational diabetes control in mothers with diabetes, and the timing and diagnosis (if known) of any maternal illness.

### Pregnancy outcomes following rubella vaccination: a prospective study in the state of rio de janeiro, Brazil, 2001–2002 [^113tpPzR]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A rubella mass vaccination campaign targeting 15–29-year-old women was performed in Brazil in 2001–2002. Rubella vaccination was contraindicated during pregnancy. A follow-up protocol was implemented for pregnant women who were vaccinated as well as their newborns. The risks of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and congenital rubella infection (CRI) after vaccination were assessed according to the pregnant women's immune status.

Methods

This was a prospective, noncontrolled study of pregnancy outcomes in women vaccinated against rubella in the state of Rio de Janeiro, including clinical and laboratory evaluations.

Results

Of 2292 reported pregnant women who were vaccinated, 1636 had known outcomes: there were 1577 newborns (96.4%), 52 miscarriages (3.2%), and 7 stillbirths (0.4%). Gestational age at vaccination was ≤ 5 weeks in 75% of the susceptible, vaccinated pregnant women. Nine newborns were positive for immunoglobulin M; 4 were born to susceptible pregnant women, for a 2.0% CRI rate (95% confidence interval, .5%-4.9%); 4 were born to vaccinated pregnant women with indeterminate or unknown status; and 1 had CRS, with a wild-type virus infection.

Conclusions

The absence of vaccine-related CRS cases further supports recommendations to not interrupt a pregnancy exposed to rubella vaccine virus. Monitoring pregnancy outcomes and CRI with vaccine virus can distinguish between wild-type and vaccine virus infections, especially in situations of viral circulation.

The importance of high MMR vaccination rates

Another important reason for maintaining high MMR vaccination rates in the population is for protection against mumps and rubella. The latter is particularly important for pregnant women because of congenital rubella syndrome which is now extremely rare because of widespread MMR vaccination worldwide. It has been however previously associated with high rates of congenital defects, miscarriage and fetal death in the pre-vaccine era, especially if infection occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy. In England, 0–3 cases of congenital rubella syndrome were reported annually before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Much of the national and international effort is rightly targeted towards improving vaccine uptake in young children eligible for MMR vaccination through the national immunisation programme, alongside mass immunisation campaigns, catch-up programmes and opportunistic vaccination of unvaccinated older children and young adults. However, little attention is focussed on the risks and complications of measles infection in pregnancy. In the current environment of high measles transmission in many countries, healthcare professionals in the community and hospitals should take every opportunity to ascertain a clear and detailed immunisation history, establish a dialogue, address concerns, and offer vaccination to those who remain unimmunised, especially against measles and rubella among adolescents and women of childbearing age, with the aim of reducing their risk of acquiring measles infection during pregnancy.

Key points
- Most children and adults who get rubella usually have mild illness with a rash starting on the face.
- Up to 70% of women who get rubella may experience arthritis.
- The most serious complication from rubella infection is the harm it can cause a developing baby. Signs and symptoms Rubella is usually mild, with few noticeable symptoms. In children For children who do have symptoms, a red rash is typically the first sign. The rash generally first appears on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body, lasting about 3 days. Other symptoms that may occur 1 to 5 days before the rash appears include:

- Low-grade fever
- Headache
- Mild pink eye
- General discomfort
- Swollen and enlarged lymph nodes
- Cough
- Runny nose.

In adults Most adults who get rubella usually have a mild illness, with:

- Low-grade fever
- Sore throat
- A rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body Some adults may also have a headache, pink eye, and general discomfort before the rash appears. Complications Up to 70% of women who get rubella may experience arthritis. This is rare in children and men. In rare cases, rubella can cause serious problems, including brain infections and bleeding problems. In pregnant women and newborns The most serious complication from rubella infection is the harm it can cause a developing baby. This can happen in the womb and after birth. If an unvaccinated person gets infected with rubella during pregnancy they can have a miscarriage; or the baby can die just after birth. They can pass the virus to the developing baby who can develop serious birth defects, such as:

- Heart problems
- Loss of hearing and eyesight
- Intellectual disability
- Liver or spleen damage Serious birth defects are more common if a woman is infected early in her pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. These severe birth defects are known as congenital rubella syndrome. Keep Reading: Pregnancy and Rubella.

### Progress toward rubella elimination-World Health Organization south-east Asia region, 2013–2021 [^114EgNQV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Rubella is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects. Rubella infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, or CRS, a constellation of congenital malformations, frequently including visual, auditory, or cardiac defects. CRS is a cause of mortality among infants and children and a shortened lifespan among adults. Rubella and measles elimination activities are programmatically linked because RCV is administered as a combined measles and rubella vaccine, and rubella cases are detected through case-based surveillance for measles or fever and rash illness. The WHO SEAR-recommended strategies to achieve rubella elimination include 1) achieving and maintaining ≥ 95% coverage with 2 doses of measles- and rubella-containing vaccine in every district through routine immunization or SIAs; 2) developing and sustaining a sensitive and timely case-based surveillance system for rubella and sentinel site surveillance for CRS that meets recommended performance indicators; 3) developing and maintaining an accredited laboratory network; 4) achieving timely identification, investigation, and response to rubella outbreaks; and 5) linking with other public health initiatives to achieve the first four strategies.

### Prevention of measles, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome, and mumps, 2013: summary recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^112oDf7Q]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Low credibility.

This report is a compendium of all current recommendations for the prevention of measles, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), and mumps. The report presents the recent revisions adopted by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on October 24, 2012, and also summarizes all existing ACIP recommendations that have been published previously during 1998–2011 (CDC. Measles, mumps, and rubella — vaccine use and strategies for elimination of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome and control of mumps: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 1998;47[No. RR-8]; CDC. Revised ACIP recommendation for avoiding pregnancy after receiving a rubellacontaining vaccine. MMWR 2001;50:1117; CDC. Updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] for the control and elimination of mumps. MMWR 2006;55:629–30; and, CDC. Immunization of healthcare personnel: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR 2011;60[No. RR-7]). Currently, ACIP recommends 2 doses of MMR vaccine routinely for children with the first dose administered at age 12 through 15 months and the second dose administered at age 4 through 6 years before school entry. Two doses are recommended for adults at high risk for exposure and transmission (e.g., students attending colleges or other post-high school educational institutions, healthcare personnel, and international travelers) and 1 dose for other adults aged ≥ 18 years. For prevention of rubella, 1 dose of MMR vaccine is recommended for persons aged ≥ 12 months. At the October 24, 2012 meeting, ACIP adopted the following revisions, which are published here for the first time. These included:

- For acceptable evidence of immunity, removing documentation of physician diagnosed disease as an acceptable criterion for evidence of immunity for measles and mumps, and including laboratory confirmation of disease as a criterion for acceptable evidence of immunity for measles, rubella, and mumps.
- For persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, expanding recommendations for vaccination to all persons aged ≥ 12 months with HIV infection who do not have evidence of current severe immunosuppression; recommending revaccination of persons with perinatal HIV infection who were vaccinated before establishment of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) with 2 appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine once effective ART has been established; and changing the recommended timing of the 2 doses of MMR vaccine for HIV-infected persons to age 12 through 15 months and 4 through 6 years.
- For measles postexposure prophylaxis, expanding recommendations for use of immune globulin administered intramuscularly (IGIM) to include infants aged birth to 6 months exposed to measles; increasing the recommended dose of IGIM for immunocompetent persons; and recommending use of immune globulin administered intravenously (IGIV) for severely immunocompromised persons and pregnant women without evidence of measles immunity who are exposed to measles. As a compendium of all current recommendations for the prevention of measles, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), and mumps, the information in this report is intended for use by clinicians as baseline guidance for scheduling of vaccinations for these conditions and considerations regarding vaccination of special populations. ACIP recommendations are reviewed periodically and are revised as indicated when new information becomes available.

### Rubella vaccination of unknowingly pregnant women during mass campaigns for rubella and congenital rubella syndrome elimination, the americas 2001–2008 [^113UfSHK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Due to the significant teratogenicity of rubella virus and the use of a live-attentuated vaccine, pregnancy is a contraindication of receipt of rubella vaccine (RCV). Data collected from several countries that have observed susceptible women who had received RCV during pregnancy documented that no infant with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) has been born, so the risk is theoretical. As part of the regional initiative to eliminate rubella and CRS in the Americas, one of the key strategies was the vaccination of women of childbearing age. The implementation of mass vaccination campaigns targeting women of childbearing age in Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Paraguay provided an opportunity to further increase the body of knowledge on the safety of rubella vaccine if an unknowingly pregnant woman is vaccinated in early pregnancy.

Methods

Using a standard protocol, women who were unknowingly pregnant or become pregnant ≤ 30 days after receiving RCV were evaluated to determine immunity status (eg, susceptible, immune, and unknown) at the time of vaccination. Susceptible pregnant women were observed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. For pregnancies that resulted in live births, serum samples were obtained from the newborn for rubella immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibody testing. If the newborn's serum sample was IgM positive, the infant was evaluated for manifestations of CRS.

Results

During the period 2001–2008, 48748253 women of childbearing age were vaccinated in the region of the Americas, 39542253 (81%) of whom were vaccinated in the 6 selected countries. Of these women, 30139 (0.07%) were pregnant or became pregnant ≤ 1 month after receiving vaccine and were followed up. On the basis of serological evaluation, 2894 (10%) women were classified as susceptible at the time of vaccination; of their pregnancies, 1980 (90%) resulted in a live birth. Sera from 70 (3.5%) of these infants were rubella IgM antibody positive, but none of the infants had features of CRS as a result of rubella vaccination. The maximum theoretical risk for CRS following rubella vaccination of susceptible pregnant women was 0.2%. Conclusions. The results of these studies from 6 select countries provides additional evidence showing an absence of risk of CRS associated with administering rubella vaccine shortly before or during pregnancy.

### Synopsis of the 2023 U.S. department of VA and U.S. DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnancy [^1155z7UC]. Military Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy — infectious disease screening: Screening for infectious diseases, listed below, during pregnancy per current guidance from the CDC is recommended, with appropriate follow-up treatment, prophylaxis treatment, or both depending on the history, known exposure, and symptoms of infectious disease. Conditions listed for screening include Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Syphilis, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Rubella, Varicella, Human papillomavirus (HPV) (if the patient has a history of an abnormal cervical screen), Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Asymptomatic bacteriuria, Tuberculosis, and Group B streptococcus (GBS). Infectious diseases during pregnancy can cause significant morbidity and mortality in both the pregnant patient and the fetus, screening for infectious diseases, counseling, and treatment can improve maternal and fetal outcomes, and Group B streptococcus infections are the leading cause of serious neonatal infections (e.g., sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia) within the first 7 days of life (early-onset infection).

### Projecting month of birth for at-risk infants after zika virus disease outbreaks [^112Uqu91]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our projections, based on ecologic data, indicate that in Bahia State, Brazil, Zika virus infection during the first trimester or early in the second trimester of pregnancy is temporally associated with the observed increase in infants born with microcephaly; this projection is consistent with the observed reported decline for January and February 2016. This finding adds to pathologic findings documenting Zika virus infection in several infants with microcephaly. To create a more precise projection of when to expect the first full-term births to mothers who were infected during their second trimester of pregnancy, readers can refine our model by using our modified spreadsheet tool (Technical Appendix) and local data from countries in which Zika virus is transmitted.

Understanding the timing of Zika virus infection of pregnant women is key because the effects of infection on pregnancy and fetal and infant outcomes is likely to vary by gestational timing, as has been demonstrated for other congenital infections such as rubella and cytomegalovirus; transmission risk may also vary according to gestational timing. For rubella, risk for adverse fetal effects is highest during the first trimester; for cytomegalovirus, risk is highest during the first trimester but is also present after exposure during the second or third trimesters. For countries currently experiencing Zika disease outbreaks, it will be several months before the first pregnancies during which exposure could have occurred will reach term, particularly if the critical period of pregnancy is in the first or second trimester, as our data suggest.

### Rubella [^11655Hc7]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Rubella is an acute illness caused by rubella virus and characterised by fever and rash. Although rubella is a clinically mild illness, primary rubella virus infection in early pregnancy can result in congenital rubella syndrome, which has serious medical and public health consequences. WHO estimates that approximately 100000 congenital rubella syndrome cases occur per year. Rubella virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and direct contact. 25–50% of people infected with rubella virus are asymptomatic. Clinical disease often results in mild, self-limited illness characterised by fever, a generalised erythematous maculopapular rash, and lymphadenopathy. Complications include arthralgia, arthritis, thrombocytopenic purpura, and encephalitis. Common presenting signs and symptoms of congenital rubella syndrome include cataracts, sensorineural hearing impairment, congenital heart disease, jaundice, purpura, hepatosplenomegaly, and microcephaly. Rubella and congenital rubella syndrome can be prevented by rubella-containing vaccines, which are commonly administered in combination with measles vaccine. Although global rubella vaccine coverage reached only 70% in 2020 global rubella eradiation remains an ambitious but achievable goal.

Infection — stillbirth association and testing: Infection is associated with approximately 10–20% of stillbirths in developed countries, and in developed countries infection accounts for a greater percentage of preterm stillbirths than term stillbirths. Placental and fetal infections originate from either ascending pathogens (for example, group B streptococcus or Escherichia coli) or hematogenous spread such as Listeria monocytogenes or syphilis, and viral infections associated with stillbirth include cytomegalovirus, parvovirus, and Zika. Serology for toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus are not included because they are of unproven benefit and not recommended.

### Rubella and pregnancy: diagnosis, management and outcomes [^11672iCU]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2014). Low credibility.

Rubella is a mild viral disease that typically occurs in childhood. Rubella infection during pregnancy causes congenital rubella syndrome, including the classic triad of cataracts, cardiac abnormalities and sensorineural deafness. Highly effective vaccines have been developed since 1969, and vaccination campaigns have been established in many countries. Although there has been progress, the prevention and diagnosis of rubella remain problematic. This article reviews the implications and management of rubella during pregnancy.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy and infant outcomes in the first year of life: a retrospective cohort study [^111J9Efo]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, continues to affect individuals worldwide, and while scientific knowledge of the illness has grown exponentially since it was first described in late 2019, questions remain regarding long-term repercussions of infection. In particular, the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in pregnancy has been explored through large cohort studies and systematic reviews, but postnatal effects on infants exposed in utero are not well-described.

The risks of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death are increased in those who are pregnant and infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to those who are not pregnant and infected. Pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2 infection are also reported to have an increased risk of preeclampsia, preterm birth, and stillbirth. Evidence to date regarding offspring outcomes is limited to the immediate neonatal period, with one study demonstrating an increased risk of admission to higher-level NICU, longer length of hospital stay, and greater need for ventilatory support in infants born to individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy. Beyond the early neonatal period, there is a paucity of evidence on the offspring effects.

As is observed for other pathogens, there may be long-term repercussions of maternal infection in pregnancy for the offspring. It is well established that some infections in pregnancy are teratogenic, producing profound congenital effects in offspring, for example as seen with 'ToRCH' infections (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes virus, syphilis). Others pose a risk of vertical transmission and lifelong offspring infection, for example HIV and hepatitis B. Fortunately, most evidence indicates that the risks of vertical transmission and congenital anomalies attributable to SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are low.

Other offspring effects of maternal infection may be possible, with one study suggesting there is an increased risk of offspring hospitalization following urinary tract infections in pregnancy. Recent studies of influenza in pregnancy have suggested a link with febrile seizures in early childhood.

The objective of this study is to explore whether the impacts of SARS-CoV2 exposure in utero extend beyond the early neonatal period into the first year of life. We hypothesize that fetal exposure to SARS-CoV2 virus in pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of all-cause hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visits in children up to 1 year of age, compared to children who have not been exposed in utero. Secondarily, we hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 exposure may be associated with an increased risk of infant infection in the same time frame.

### Progress toward rubella and congenital rubella syndrome elimination-worldwide, 2012–2022 [^113Ypzaz]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Rubella virus is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects. Infection during pregnancy can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or a constellation of birth defects, including cataracts, deafness, heart defects, and developmental delay, known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). A single dose of rubella-containing vaccine can provide lifelong protection against rubella. The Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011–2020 included a target to achieve elimination of rubella in at least five of the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions by 2020, and rubella elimination is a critical goal of the Immunization Agenda 2030. This report updates a previous report and describes progress toward rubella and CRS elimination during 2012–2022. During 2012–2022, among 194 WHO countries, the number that included rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) in their immunization schedules increased from 132 (68%) to 175 (90%) and the percentage of the world's infants vaccinated against rubella increased from 40% to 68%. Reported rubella cases declined 81%, from 93,816 in 2012 to 17,407 in 2022. Verification of rubella elimination was achieved in 98 (51%) of 194 countries by 2022, an increase from 84 (43%) countries in 2019. Despite significant progress in the introduction of RCV into routine immunization programs worldwide, approximately 25 million infants annually still do not have access to RCV. Nevertheless, even in complex settings, the increasing number of countries that have achieved and sustained rubella elimination demonstrates progress toward global rubella elimination.

### Congenital zika virus syndrome… what else? Two case reports of severe combined fetal pathologies [^115XBWMn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

2016 has seen the emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, as a teratogenic agent associated with severe fetal malformations. Several other microorganisms, grouped under the TORCH acronym (Toxoplasmosis, Others [Syphilis, Parvovirus B19, Varicella zoster, HIV], Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes), as well as genetic disorders and toxic agents may lead to similar anomalies.

Martinique is a French Caribbean Island that was affected by the ZIKV epidemic at the end of 2015, and presented one of the largest incidence rate among the Caribbean, with an estimated 36,590 potential cases during the epidemic. To overcome the unknown risks of fetal anomalies associated with maternal infection, the French government implemented an active surveillance of all pregnant women during the epidemic, with monthly ultrasound examinations. In France, prenatal screening for aneuploidy and serological screening are offered to all pregnant patients during the first trimester. Screening for congenital infections (i.e. TORCH screening) is proposed in cases of suspected maternal/fetal infection. Blood was stored to allow retrospective serologic analyses. We present here two cases of severe fetal pathologies resulting from a combination of ZIKV congenital infection and either a genetic disorder or co-infection with Parvovirus B19, monitored in our reference center, and highlight the need to obtain an exact diagnosis in case of suspected ZIKV congenital syndrome.

### Estimated current and future congenital rubella syndrome incidence with and without rubella vaccine introduction-19 countries, 2019–2055 [^111j62Hr]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Rubella is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects. Rubella virus infection during early pregnancy can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or a constellation of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). This report describes current and future estimated CRS incidence in countries that have not yet introduced rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) into their national childhood immunization schedules and the estimated effect of implementing a recent recommendation to introduce RCV into these programs even if population coverage with measles-containing vaccine is < 80%. During 2000–2022, the number of countries that introduced RCV increased from 99 (52%) of 191 in 2000 to 175 (90%) of 194 in 2022. By the end of 2023, 19 lower- and middle-income countries had not yet introduced RCV. In 2019, an estimated 24,000 CRS cases occurred in these countries, representing 75% of the estimated 32,000 cases worldwide. In a modeling study estimating the effect of RCV introduction in these countries during 2025–2055, an estimated 1.03 million CRS cases are projected to occur without RCV. In contrast, fewer than 60,000 cases are estimated if RCV is introduced with catch-up and follow-up supplementary immunization activities, averting more than an estimated 986,000 CRS cases over 30 years. Based in part on these estimates, in September 2024, the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization recommended removing the ≥ 80% coverage threshold and instituting universal RCV introduction in these countries. RCV introduction in these 19 countries during 2025–2030 could rapidly accelerate progress toward rubella and CRS elimination worldwide.

### Global progress toward rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control and elimination-2000–2014 [^1175vjRV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Rubella virus usually causes a mild fever and rash in children and adults. However, infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or a constellation of congenital malformations known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated guidance on the preferred strategy for introduction of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) into national routine immunization schedules, including an initial vaccination campaign usually targeting children aged 9 months-15 years. The Global Vaccine Action Plan endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2012 and the Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan (2012–2020) published by Measles and Rubella Initiative partners in 2012 both include goals to eliminate rubella and CRS in at least two WHO regions by 2015, and at least five WHO regions by 2020 (2,3). This report updates a previous report and summarizes global progress toward rubella and CRS control and elimination during 2000–2014. As of December 2014, RCV had been introduced in 140 (72%) countries, an increase from 99 (51%) countries in 2000 (for this report, WHO member states are referred to as countries). Reported rubella cases declined 95%, from 670,894 cases in 102 countries in 2000 to 33,068 cases in 162 countries in 2014, although reporting is inconsistent. To achieve the 2020 Global Vaccine Action Plan rubella and CRS elimination goals, RCV introduction needs to continue as country criteria indicating readiness are met, and rubella and CRS surveillance need to be strengthened to ensure that progress toward elimination can be measured.

### Profile of cardiac lesions among laboratory confirmed congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) infants: a nationwide sentinel surveillance, India, 2016–22 [^112vBAMb]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Rubella (German Measles) is a vaccine-preventable disease manifesting with fever, maculopapular rash, and lymphadenopathy predominantly involving posterior auricular or suboccipital nodes. Although postnatally acquired rubella infections are generally mild and self-limiting, the public health importance of rubella is due to the teratogenic effects of the virus leading to congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Infections during the first trimester of pregnancy can severely affect fetus, resulting in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or an infant born with a combination of birth defects.

Rubella infection within the first 12 weeks of gestation results in approximately 85% risk for major defects.CRS is the leading cause of vaccine preventable birth defects in countries where rubella is endemic. It has been estimated that annually about 105,000 infants with CRS were born globally in 2010, 38% of whom were from India. The South-East Asia Region (SEAR) has set a goal to eliminate measles and rubella by 2023 by achieving and maintaining high population immunity, developing and sustaining case-based surveillance for measles, rubella and CRS, maintaining network of accredited laboratories for measles and rubella and ensuring adequate outbreak preparedness and promptly responding to measles and rubella outbreaks. Towards achieving this goal, India developed and implemented the national strategic plan for measles and rubella elimination. This included a nationwide supplementary immunization activity using measles-rubella containing vaccine (MRCV) targeting children aged 9 months to 14 years and introducing the vaccine (MRCV) in the routine immunization program. India also transitioned from outbreak-based surveillance to case-based acute fever and rash surveillance, strengthened the measles-rubella laboratory network, and initiated a sentinel surveillance for CRS.

The common clinical features of CRS include sensorineural deafness, ocular and cardiovascular defects, with most studies reporting hearing impairment as the commonest manifestation. Among the cardiac defects, pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and ventricular septal defects (VSD) were the most reported cardiac defects. The phenotypical profile of cardiovascular malformations in CRS cases in India is understudiedand underscores the need for multicentric studies. The current study aimed to estimate the proportion of congenital heart defects (CHD) among laboratory confirmed CRS cases and describe the spectrum of cardiac defects.

### Congenital rubella syndrome following rubella vaccination during pregnancy [^112BTiwL]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Rubella vaccine is usually given in combination with measles and mumps vaccines as a measles-mumps-rubella vaccination. Because it contains live attenuated virus, its use is contraindicated during pregnancy. However, since the introduction of rubella vaccine, no cases of congenital rubella syndrome have been reported following vaccination during pregnancy. We report a case of a female infant, born to a woman inadvertently vaccinated with measles-mumps-rubella vaccination early in pregnancy, who manifested a phenotype of cardiac and neurologic defects, neurodevelopmental delay, and lymphocytopenia consistent with congenital rubella syndrome.

### Post-exposure passive immunisation for preventing rubella and congenital rubella syndrome [^115mz6ot]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Control of rubella is desired because infection in early pregnancy can result in miscarriage, foetal death or congenital abnormality. Primary studies examining the effectiveness of immunoglobulins for post-exposure prophylaxis of rubella have small sample sizes and varying results. National public health recommendations suggest a degree of effectiveness.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion of polyclonal immunoglobulins of human sera or plasma origin for preventing rubella and congenital rubella syndrome when administered to exposed susceptible people before the onset of disease.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to August week 2, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to August 2014), CINAHL (1981 to August 2014), LILACS (1982 to August 2014) and Web of Science (1955 to August 2014). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry on 16 October 2014. We searched the reference lists of relevant retrieved reviews and studies and identified national public health guidelines.

Selection Criteria

For the outcome 'preventing cases of rubella', we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. We found several studies addressing this outcome where the design was a controlled clinical trial (CCT) (with exposure to rubella virus controlled by the investigators) but the method of allocation of participants to groups was not reported. We found an alternative report of one of these studies that indicated participants were assigned to groups randomly. We therefore included such studies as meeting criteria for RCTs or quasi-RCTs and undertook sensitivity analyses. For the outcomes, 'congenital rubella infection' and 'congenital rubella syndrome', we included RCTs, quasi-RCTs and prospective controlled (cohort) studies. Participants were necessarily susceptible and exposed to rubella. Polyclonal immunoglobulins derived from human sera or plasma must have been administered intramuscularly or intravenously as the only intervention in at least one group.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 12 studies (430 participants) in the review: seven RCTs and five CCTs where it was not clear whether participants were randomly allocated to groups. We did not include any unpublished studies. Participants included children and adults of both sexes. Only one study included pregnant women. All studies were conducted in high-income countries. The quality of the 11 studies in the initial meta-analysis was moderate, although we classified no study as having a low risk of bias on all criteria. We included 11 studies in the initial meta-analysis of gamma-globulin (concentrated polyclonal immunoglobulins) versus control (saline or no treatment) for rubella cases. The result favoured the intervention group (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.83) but was heterogenous (Chi² test = 36.59, df = 10 (P value < 0.0001); I² statistic = 73%). Heterogeneity was explained by subgrouping studies according to the estimated volume of gamma-globulin administered per pound of bodyweight and then removing those studies where the intervention was administered more than five days after participant exposure to rubella (post hoc analysis). The test of subgroup differences demonstrated heterogeneity between subgroups according to our protocol definition (P value < 0.1; I² statistic > 60%) and there appeared to be greater effectiveness of the intervention when a greater volume of gamma-globulin was administered ('0.027 to 0.037 ml/lb' RR 1.60 (95% CI 0.57 to 4.52); '0.1 to 0.15 ml/lb' RR 0.53 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.99); '0.2 to 0.5 ml/lb' RR 0.20 (95% CI 0.04 to 1.00)). None of the studies reported the outcome 'congenital rubella infection'. One included study reported on congenital rubella syndrome, with no cases among participants who were fewer than nine weeks pregnant at enrolment and who were randomised to one of two gamma-globulin groups ('high' or 'low' rubella titre). However, the study did not report how congenital rubella syndrome was measured and did not report the length of follow-up according to intervention group. This study did not include a non-treatment group. No included study measured adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to no treatment, polyclonal immunoglobulins seem to be of benefit for preventing rubella. The available evidence suggests that this intervention may be of benefit up to five days after exposure, and that effectiveness is dependent on dose. Considering the attack rate for rubella cases in the control group of the highest volume gamma-globulin subgroup (333 per 1000), the absolute risk reduction (calculated from the RR) for this volume of gamma-globulin was 266 (95% CI 0 to 320) and the number needed to treat to benefit is four (95% CI 3 to incalculable). The included studies did not measure rubella-specific antibodies in the immunoglobulin products used in a standard way and thus estimation of the dose of rubella-specific antibodies in international units administered was not possible. As the concentration of rubella-specific antibodies in today's polyclonal immunoglobulin products may vary from those products used in the studies in the review, the volume required per pound of bodyweight to produce similar results may also vary. There is insufficient evidence to make direct conclusions about the effectiveness of polyclonal immunoglobulins for preventing congenital rubella syndrome. This is an area requiring further research.

### Prenatal care: an evidence-based approach [^113xvG9N]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Well-coordinated prenatal care that follows an evidence-based, informed process results in fewer hospital admissions, improved education, greater satisfaction, and lower pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality. Care initiated at 10 weeks or earlier improves outcomes. Identification and treatment of periodontal disease decreases preterm delivery risk. A prepregnancy body mass index greater than 25 kg per m2 is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertension, miscarriage, and stillbirth. Advanced maternal and paternal age (35 years or older) is associated with gestational diabetes, hypertension, miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, aneuploidy, birth defects, and stillbirth. Rho(D) immune globulin decreases alloimmunization risk in a patient who is RhD-negative carrying a fetus who is RhD-positive. Treatment of iron deficiency anemia decreases the risk of preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal depression. Ancestry-based genetic risk stratification using family history can inform genetic screening. Folic acid supplementation (400 to 800 mcg daily) decreases the risk of neural tube defects. All pregnant patients should be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria, sexually transmitted infections, and immunity against rubella and varicella and should receive tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), influenza, and COVID-19 vaccines. Testing for group B Streptococcus should be performed between 36 and 37 weeks, and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis should be initiated to decrease the risk of neonatal infection. Because of the impact of social determinants of health on outcomes, universal screening for depression, anxiety, intimate partner violence, substance use, and food insecurity is recommended early in pregnancy. Screening for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks is recommended for all patients. People at risk of preeclampsia, including those diagnosed with COVID-19 in pregnancy, should be offered 81 mg of aspirin daily starting at 12 weeks. Chronic hypertension should be treated to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg.

### Sex-specific neurodevelopmental outcomes among offspring of mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy [^111kLdUp]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

We did detect an increase in the risk for neurodevelopmental diagnoses, more modest in magnitude and similar among male and female offspring, associated with pandemic-era deliveries compared with 2018 (a prepandemic cohort with all offspring having 12-month follow-up prior to the COVID-19 pandemic) and 2019 (a prepandemic-born cohort with all offspring having at least some follow-up during the COVID-19 pandemic). The increased odds of any neurodevelopmental diagnosis at 12 months in pandemic-born children was statistically significant in a pooled analysis of both sexes, in comparison with the prepandemic 2019 cohort. These comparisons with historical controls suggest that any secular trends (reflecting birth during the pandemic itself) are likely to have a more modest impact on observed neurodevelopmental risk in offspring than does maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection itself.

Overall, our results are consistent with abundant evidence that exposure to infection during pregnancy — including viral infections such as influenza — is associated with an increased risk for neurodevelopmental morbidity in offspring. Such risk was initially detected as an increase in schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder diagnoses following influenza and rubella pandemics, was recapitulated in animal models, and was more recently directly tested in large registry studies. Risk of behavioral dysfunction in offspring after maternal prenatal exposures also has been reported to be greater in male offspring in rodent models. Because the neurodevelopmental risk in offspring is thought to be mediated in large part through maternal and placental immune activation, and has been observed in other viral infections that, similar to SARS-CoV-2, are not thought to directly infect fetal brain tissue, it is biologically plausible that SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy could impact offspring risk for neurodevelopmental disorders.

### Progress toward rubella elimination-World Health Organization European region, 2005–2019 [^116bEeNq]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2005, the Regional Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region (EUR) passed a resolution calling for the regional elimination of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) (1). In 2010, all 53 countries in EUR* reaffirmed their commitment to eliminating measles, rubella, and CRS (2); this goal was included in the European Vaccine Action Plan 2015–2020 (3,4). Rubella, which typically manifests as a mild febrile rash illness, is the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects. Rubella infection during pregnancy can result in miscarriage, fetal death, or a constellation of malformations known as CRS, which usually includes one or more visual, auditory, or cardiac defects (5). The WHO-recommended measles and rubella elimination strategies in EUR include 1) achieving and maintaining ≥ 95% coverage with 2 doses of measles- and rubella-containing vaccine (MRCV) through routine immunization services; 2) providing measles and rubella vaccination opportunities, including supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), to populations susceptible to measles or rubella; 3) strengthening surveillance by conducting case investigations and confirming suspected cases and outbreaks with laboratory results; and 4) improving the availability and use of evidence to clearly communicate the benefits and risks of preventing these diseases through vaccination to health professionals and the public (6). This report updates a previous report and describes progress toward rubella and CRS elimination in EUR during 2005–2019 (7). In 2000, estimated coverage with the first dose of a rubella-containing vaccine (RCV1) in EUR was 60%, and 621,039 rubella cases were reported (incidence = 716.9 per 1 million population). During 2005–2019, estimated regional coverage with RCV1 was 93%-95%, and in 2019, 31 (58%) countries achieved ≥ 95% coverage with the RCV1. During 2005–2019, approximately 38 million persons received an RCV during SIAs in 20 (37%) countries. Rubella incidence declined by > 99%, from 234.9 cases per 1 million population (206,359 cases) in 2005 to 0.67 cases per 1 million population (620 cases) by 2019. CRS cases declined by 50%, from 16 cases in 2005 to eight cases in 2019. For rubella and CRS elimination in EUR to be achieved and maintained, measures are needed to strengthen immunization programs by ensuring high coverage with an RCV in every district of each country, offering supplementary rubella vaccination to susceptible adults, maintaining high-quality surveillance for rapid case detection and confirmation, and ensuring effective outbreak preparedness and response.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^111tGcpf]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Rubella exposure during pregnancy — transmission, immunity documentation, and staffing precautions are specified: Rubella is spread via respiratory droplets, or (in the case of infants with congenital rubella) by contact, and patients with rubella should be cared for by vaccinated personnel under droplet and contact precautions. Rubella exposure during pregnancy may cause the rubella congenital syndrome, and women immune to rubella via vaccination are not at risk of adverse events if exposed during pregnancy. All health care personnel should have documented immunity to rubella, either via vaccination or a positive rubella IgG, and the occupational health service should be able to readily identify personnel who lack immunity and cannot receive vaccination. Non-immune pregnant health care workers should be vaccinated in the postpartum period, and non-immune pregnant personnel should not care for patients with rubella infection.

### Notes from the field: rubella infection in an unvaccinated pregnant woman-Johnson county, Kansas, December 2017 [^112gUFKQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Rubella infection in pregnancy can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which is characterized by low birthweight and birth defects including deafness, cataracts, heart defects, and intellectual disabilities. The severity and nature of defects depend upon the gestational age of the fetus at the time of infection. The risk for CRS ranges from 10%–90% and is highest when infection occurs during the first trimester. Endemic transmission of rubella was eliminated in the United States in 2004 as a result of high levels of coverage with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR).

An obstetrician specializing in high-risk pregnancies followed the patient for the remainder of her pregnancy. All follow-up testing was negative, and the patient delivered a full-term, apparently normal, infant in May. Echocardiogram, skeletal survey, head ultrasound, hearing, and eye exams were normal. The infant's initial rubella IgM was positive, and two sets of nasopharyngeal and urine specimens, obtained 30 days apart, were negative for rubella RNA by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. Until negative results for rubella virus were received, the infant was considered infectious. Based on test results and the absence of congenital defects, indications are that this infant meets the criteria for congenital rubella infection and not CRS. The infant will continue to be followed by an infectious disease specialist.

This case highlights several important points. Per the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations, health care institutions should ensure that all persons working in health care facilities have documentation of adequate vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella or evidence of immunity; the hospital staff member who was excluded received the MMR vaccine before returning to work. Health care providers should routinely assess women of childbearing age for evidence of rubella immunity (IgG antibodies) and recommend vaccination when appropriate. Pregnant women testing negative for rubella immunity should be vaccinated immediately after delivery; this case represents a missed opportunity for rubella vaccination after the birth of the patient's first child. When a pregnant woman develops a rash illness, providers should ask about international travel for both the patient and her contacts. Finally, more emphasis and education are required for health care providers on the importance of timely reporting of suspected vaccine-preventable diseases.

### Rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control and elimination-global progress, 2000–2012 [^113uSXhC]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Rubella virus usually causes a mild fever and rash in children and adults. However, infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or infants with congenital malformations, known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated guidance on the preferred strategy for introduction of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) into national routine immunization schedules with an initial wide-age-range vaccination campaign that includes children aged 9 months-15 years. WHO also urged all member states to take the opportunity offered by accelerated measles control and elimination activities as a platform to introduce RCVs. The Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan (2012–2020) published by the Measles Rubella Initiative partners in 2012 and the Global Vaccine Action Plan endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2012 include milestones to eliminate rubella and CRS in two WHO regions by 2015, and eliminate rubella in five WHO regions by 2020. This report summarizes the global progress of rubella and CRS control and elimination during 2000–2012. As of December 2012, a total of 132 (68%) WHO member states had introduced RCV, a 33% increase from 99 member states in 2000. A total of 94,030 rubella cases were reported to WHO in 2012 from 174 member states, an 86% decrease from the 670,894 cases reported in 2000 from 102 member states. The WHO Region of the Americas (AMR) and European Region (EUR) have established rubella elimination goals of 2010 and 2015, respectively. AMR has started to document the elimination of measles, rubella, and CRS; in EUR, rubella incidence has decreased significantly, although outbreaks continue to occur.

### Prenatal diagnosis of congenital rubella infection in the second trimester of pregnancy [^11727nWK]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This case report describes the clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of a case of acute rubella infection in the second trimester. The complex issues of prenatal diagnosis of a congenital rubella infection are discussed.

Methods

A 30-year-old woman presented with a fine macular rash at 15 weeks' gestation. Laboratory testing included maternal rubella-specific IgG and IgM detection (booking blood and acute-phase sample) together with measurement of IgG avidity. Prenatal diagnosis at 19 weeks (amniocentesis) and 23 weeks (amniocentesis and fetal blood) was done using a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to detect rubella-specific RNA. The fetal blood sample was also tested for rubella-specific IgM.

Results

Maternal serological results confirmed an acute rubella infection at 15 weeks' gestation. Rubella-specific RNA and IgM were detected in the fetal blood taken at 23 weeks' gestation. However, no rubella RNA was detected in either of the amniotic fluid samples collected at 19 and 23 weeks.

Conclusion

In second-trimester rubella where risk of fetal damage is low, prenatal diagnosis can identify the rubella-infected fetus, allowing the parents to make a more informed decision about their options. The optimal sample for prenatal diagnosis is fetal blood as no rubella-specific RNA was detected in the amniotic fluid.

### Progress toward control of rubella and prevention of congenital rubella syndrome-worldwide, 2009 [^1161jfvP]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2010). Low credibility.

Rubella usually is a mild, febrile rash illness in children and adults; however, infection early in a woman's pregnancy, particularly during the first 16 weeks, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, or an infant born with birth defects (i.e., congenital rubella syndrome [CRS]). In 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) published the first rubella vaccine position paper to guide introduction of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) in national childhood immunization schedules. As of December 2009, a total of 130 WHO member states have introduced RCV, a 57% increase from 83 member states in 1996. In addition, goals to eliminate rubella and CRS have been established in the WHO Region of the Americas (by 2010) and the WHO European Region (by 2015), and the WHO Western Pacific Region has established targets for accelerated rubella control and CRS prevention by 2015. During 2009, a total of 121,344 rubella cases were reported from 167 member states to WHO, an 82% decrease from 670,894 cases reported in 2000 from 102 member states. This report summarizes reported rubella and CRS cases globally and progress toward global introduction and use of RCV.

### Nationwide rubella epidemic – Japan, 2013 [^116RMByS]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Rubella usually is a mild, febrile rash illness in children and adults; however, infection early in pregnancy, particularly during the first 16 weeks, can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or an infant born with birth defects (i.e., congenital rubella syndrome [CRS]). As of 2013, goals to eliminate rubella have been established in two World Health Organization regions (the Region of the Americas by 2010 and the European Region by 2015), and targets for accelerated rubella control and CRS prevention have been established by the Western Pacific Region (WPR). In 1976, Japan introduced single-antigen rubella vaccine in its national immunization program, targeting girls in junior high school. In 1989, a measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine was introduced, targeting children aged 12–72 months. However, adult males remain susceptible to rubella. From January 1 to May 1, 2013, a total of 5,442 rubella cases were reported through the rubella surveillance system in Japan, with the majority (77%) of cases occurring among adult males. Ten infants with CRS were reported during October 2012-May 1, 2013. Countries and regions establishing a goal of accelerated control or elimination of rubella should review their previous and current immunization policies and strategies to identify and vaccinate susceptible persons and to ensure high population immunity in all cohorts, both male and female.

### Progress toward control of rubella and prevention of congenital rubella syndrome – worldwide, 2009 [^111xdFTn]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Rubella, usually a mild rash illness in children and adults, can cause serious consequences when a pregnant woman is infected, particularly in early pregnancy. These serious consequences include miscarriage, fetal death or an infant born with birth defects (i.e., congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)). The primary purpose for rubella vaccination is the prevention of congenital rubella infection including CRS. Since 1969, several rubella virus vaccines have been licensed for use; however, until the 1990s, use of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) was limited primarily to developed countries. In 1996, it was estimated that 110,000 infants with CRS were born annually in developing countries. In 2000, the first World Health Organization rubella vaccine position paper was published to guide introduction of RCV in national childhood immunization schedules. From 1996 to 2009, the number of countries that introduced RCV into their national routine childhood immunization programs increased by 57% from 83 countries in 1996 to 130 countries in 2009. In addition, three of the six WHO regions established rubella control and CRS prevention goals: Region of the Americas and Europe rubella elimination by 2010 and 2015, respectively, and Western Pacific Region-accelerated rubella control and CRS prevention by 2015. Also, during this time period, the number of rubella cases reported decreased from 670,894 in 2000 to 121,344 in 2009. Rubella control and prevention of CRS can be accelerated by integrating with current global measles mortality reduction and regional elimination activities.

### Progress in rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control and elimination-worldwide, 2000–2016 [^113LgmzC]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Although rubella virus infection usually causes a mild fever and rash illness in children and adults, infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or infants with a constellation of congenital malformations known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) (1). Rubella is a leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects. Preventing these adverse pregnancy outcomes is the focus of rubella vaccination programs. In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated guidance on the preferred strategy for introduction of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) into national immunization schedules and recommended an initial vaccination campaign, usually targeting children aged 9 months-14 years (1). The Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011–2020 (GVAP), endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2012, includes goals to eliminate rubella in at least five of the six WHO regions by 2020 (2). This report updates a previous report (3) and summarizes global progress toward rubella and CRS control and elimination from 2000 to 2016. As of December 2016, 152 (78%) of 194 countries had introduced RCV into the national immunization schedule, representing an increase of 53 countries since 2000, including 20 countries that introduced RCV after 2012.

### Synopsis of the 2023 U.S. department of VA and U.S. DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnancy [^111fp2oZ]. Military Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Vaccination guidance following pregnancy — live or deferred vaccines are addressed for varicella, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV). For varicella, people with varicella infection during pregnancy have a 10–20% risk of developing pneumonia and maternal mortality is estimated to be as high as 40%; if non-immune, vaccination is recommended during the postpartum period, the vaccine is contraindicated during pregnancy, and patients who get the varicella vaccine may continue to breastfeed. For rubella, infection in the first 16 weeks of pregnancy can cause miscarriage or congenital rubella syndrome; the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy, patients who are not immune to rubella should be vaccinated postpartum, and MMR vaccine is safe to receive during breastfeeding. For HPV, the HPV vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy, vaccination should be delayed until after pregnancy, and the vaccine may be administered to patients who are lactating.

### Discordant cfDNA-NIPT result unraveling a trisomy 12 chronic lymphocytic leukemia in a 37 years old pregnant woman [^116BTuwt]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 MAIN TEXT

Since its implementation in 2011, Non‐Invasive Prenatal Test (NIPT) has become a reliable and sensitive method of screening to evaluate the risk for fetal chromosomal imbalances. As the number of pregnancies screened with NIPT increases, so does the number of sporadic reports of discordant results between NIPT and invasive prenatal diagnostic procedures performed to confirm pathological results. The cause of discordancy is strictly related to the nature of the sample under analysis in NIPT, that is cell free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in maternal blood. Total cfDNA is a mixture of cell‐free fetal DNA (cffDNA), originating from trophoblast cells, and maternal cfDNA (mcfDNA), mostly originating from apoptotic hematopoietic cells, particularly from white‐cell lineage (70%). The ratio between cffDNA and total cfDNA is known as fetal fraction (FF). Among maternal causes of discordancy, maternal neoplasms have been reported, due to mcfDNA originating from tumor cells. In the present report, the diagnosis of a tumor specific single chromosomal anomaly, after a discordant NIPT result, helped uncover the rare occurrence of chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) during pregnancy.

A 37‐years‐old healthy pregnant woman performed NIPT at 11 gestational weeks as a first‐tier screening for age‐related risk of fetal aneuploidies. NIPT was performed using a whole genome sequencing approach with the IONA NIPT Workflow (Yourgene Health) on S5XL sequencer (ThermoFisher) according to manufacturer's instructions. Results indicated a high risk for a female fetus with an aneuploidy of chromosome 12 (F F = 13%). At genetic counseling, the familial and personal histories of the woman and her partner were unremarkable for intellectual disability, congenital malformations, known genetic conditions, and consanguinity. Ultrasound examinations at 6 and 12 gestational weeks showed a single viable intrauterine pregnancy, biometry appropriate for gestational age, and absence of gross fetal anomalies. The only relevant clinical finding was a maternal blood count with increased lymphocytes (6.37 × 10³, normal value < 5 × 10³). Toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus infections were excluded.

### Current recommendations for vaccines for patients planning pregnancy: a committee opinion [^111NGtoP]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination — MMR vaccine is a live, attenuated virus recommended for all individuals without confirmed immunity to rubella. Vaccination should be administered before pregnancy and pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month after the last dose; there is no confirmed instance of congenital malformation or significant intrauterine infection linked to MMR, and inadvertent administration during pregnancy is not an indication for pregnancy termination.

### Current recommendations for vaccines for patients planning pregnancy: a committee opinion [^114s56R9]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Summary — vaccination for individuals planning pregnancy outlines that vaccination in individuals of reproductive age before or during pregnancy confers resistance to intrauterine infections and provides the newborn with passive immunity to neonatal infections, and immunization schedules are best completed before beginning treatment for infertility because some vaccinations should not be administered during pregnancy. Rubella, measles, and varicella immunity should be documented before pregnancy; if nonimmune, the vaccine should be administered, and pregnancy should be avoided for 4 weeks. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for individuals who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy because COVID-19 infection increases the risk of complications during pregnancy. The influenza and tetanus-diphtheria immunizations should be completed before pregnancy but can be administered during pregnancy, the inactivated influenza vaccine can be given anytime during pregnancy, and Tdap should be given preferably during the third trimester or late second trimester. Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and meningococcal vaccinations may be indicated in some circumstances during pregnancy when benefits exceed risks, and live attenuated vaccines, including MMR, varicella, and live attenuated influenza vaccines, are contraindicated during pregnancy.

### Congenital rubella syndrome in child of woman without known risk factors, new Jersey, USA [^117DQgCp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

We found no evidence of secondary rubella transmission. A model has suggested that to interrupt rubella transmission, > 87.5% of the population must be immune. On the basis of the 2010 National Immunization Survey, 86.1% (95% CI 80.4%–91.8%) of New Jersey children 19–35 months of age had received > 1 doses of MMR vaccine, and 92.6% (95% CI 89.1%–96.1%) of adolescents 13–17 years of age had received > 2 doses. Continued rubella elimination relies upon the maintenance of high levels of immunity in the population; thus, public health professionals should continue to strive to achieve high levels of rubella immunization in their communities.

Despite its elimination from the United States, rubella infection and CRS continue to occur rarely: 6 cases of CRS have been reported to CDC since 2004. Clinicians should remain vigilant to the possibility of rubella and CRS and immediately notify public health authorities when either is suspected.

### Assessing the burden of congenital rubella syndrome in China and evaluating mitigation strategies: a metapopulation modelling study [^112o68ph]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Background

A rubella vaccine was licensed in China in 1993 and added to the Expanded Programme on Immunization in 2008, but a national cross-sectional serological survey during 2014 indicates that many adolescents remain susceptible. Maternal infections during the first trimester often cause miscarriages, stillbirths, and, among livebirths, congenital rubella syndrome. We aimed to evaluate possible supplemental immunisation activities (SIAs) to accelerate elimination of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome.

Methods

We analysed residual samples from the national serological survey done in 2014, data from monthly rubella surveillance reports from 2005 and 2016, and additional publications through a systematic review. Using an age-structured population model with provincial strata, we calculated the reproduction numbers and evaluated the gradient of the metapopulation effective reproduction number with respect to potential supplemental immunisation rates. We corroborated these analytical results and estimated times-to-elimination by simulating SIAs among adolescents (ages 10–19 years) and young adults (ages 20–29 years) using a model with regional strata. We estimated the incidence of rubella and burden of congenital rubella syndrome by simulating transmission in a relatively small population lacking only spatial structure.

Findings

By 2014, childhood immunisation had reduced rubella's reproduction number from 7.6 to 1.2 and SIAs among adolescents were the optimal elimination strategy. We found that less than 10% of rubella infections were reported; that although some women with symptomatic first-trimester infections might have elected to terminate their pregnancies, 700 children could have been born with congenital rubella syndrome during 2014; and that timely SIAs would avert outbreaks that, as susceptible adolescents reached reproductive age, could greatly increase the burden of this syndrome.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that SIAs among adolescents would most effectively reduce congenital rubella syndrome as well as eliminate rubella, owing both to fewer infections in the immunised population and absence of infections that those immunised would otherwise have caused. Metapopulation models with realistic mixing are uniquely capable of assessing such indirect effects.

### Current recommendations for vaccines for patients planning pregnancy: a committee opinion [^115ax2es]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Vaccination before infertility treatment and during pregnancy — immunizations should be completed before conception because some recommended vaccinations cannot be administered during pregnancy; vaccinations before or during pregnancy protect individuals, prevent vertical transmission to the fetus, and confer passive immunity, with maternal immunoglobulin (IgG) transfer increasing markedly during the last 4–6 weeks of gestation. During pregnancy, few vaccines are contraindicated and the contraindicated vaccines include measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), varicella, and herpes zoster; vaccinations during pregnancy are indicated when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, and guidance for special indications is outlined in a committee opinion published by the CDC.

### A population-based matched cohort study of major congenital anomalies following COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection [^111DM65p]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is associated with severe COVID-19 symptoms, and adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes, yet low levels of COVID-19 vaccination uptake in pregnant women persist in many settings –. Among the barriers affecting COVID-19 vaccine uptake in pregnancy are concerns around vaccine safety. There is evidence of the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy with respect to perinatal outcomes such as stillbirth and early pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage. However, there is very limited evidence on associations between either COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy and the risk of congenital anomalies.

The few studies that have been published to date on the association between COVID-19 vaccination and the risk of congenital anomalies have found no evidence of an association –, but these all had important methodological weaknesses. Only two of these studies, for example, restricted the exposure to vaccination in the first trimester, when the baby's organs develop and hence the key risk period for teratogen exposure. Furthermore, none of the studies comprehensively captured congenital anomalies, either only documenting anomalies identified on ultrasound or only looking at live births (+/− stillbirths) thus excluding terminations of pregnancy for anomalies, which are known to account for a large number of all major congenital anomalies in Europe. The evidence on any association between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and offspring risk of congenital anomalies is also very sparse. The few published studies have shown no evidence of an association –, although they have similar methodological limitations to those looking at the impact of COVID-19 vaccination. By contrast, certain other viral infections in early pregnancy (e.g. rubella and Zika) are well-recognised causes of specific anomaly syndromes. Fever associated with infections, and medicines used to treat infections, could also be associated with anomaly risk.

### Zika virus vertical transmission in children with confirmed antenatal exposure [^113MFzAo]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The prospective nature of the cohort, with infants followed from the time of maternal infection, through birth, and onward allows us a unique opportunity for evaluation of laboratory confirmed ZIKV congenital infection rates. Sixty-five percent of children in our cohort had laboratory evidence of ZIKV infection, including a large proportion of children who were infected in the first trimester of pregnancy (78%). Interestingly, having a positive ZIKV laboratory result did not necessarily correlate with infant outcomes; this could be due to limitations of the present sample size or a real phenomenon. What we can conclude from our study is that ZIKV testing of infants does not necessarily correlate with clinical findings, particularly in asymptomatic children. Anecdotally, in our cohort and that of other Zika cohorts in Brazil, there were symptomatic children tested in the first 48 h of life who did not have detectable virus in either blood or urine. Potentially these children were infected so early during pregnancy that viral infection is gone by the time of birth and only the sequelae of infection is present. This is noted in other congenital infections such as congenital varicella syndrome. If infection is later in pregnancy, viral shedding may be more frequently seen, but the teratogenic sequelae will not be as obvious as the development of the neurologic system in the first 12 weeks of gestational age is past. So viral detection may not clearly correlate with the presence of clinical findings over time. This phenomenon is also seen in some children with congenital CMV. Children who acquire rubella after 20 weeks of gestation also do not have findings of congenital rubella syndrome. The high rate of positive laboratory results demonstrating infant ZIKV infection cannot be attributable to a high number of symptomatic children in the cohort. Eighty-five of 130 children in the study (65%) did not have any abnormal clinical manifestations at their last medical visit and did not have below average neurodevelopmental evaluations between ages 2 to 3 years. An equal proportion of children with both normal and abnormal findings tested positive (64% and 65%, respectively). We conclude that ZIKV has a very high in utero transmission rate but laboratory confirmed ZIKV infection in an infant did not equate to the presence of severe congenital abnormalities in our cohort.

### Clinical progress note: rubella [^111WwQsn]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rates of rubella infection and congenital rubella syndrome decreased significantly since the introduction of the rubella vaccine in 1969. Endemic rubella was declared eliminated in the United States in 2004, and since 2012, all rubella cases in the United States have been associated with infections acquired abroad. With vaccine rates falling worldwide and outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases increasing, it is important for clinicians to be prepared to recognize and manage diseases they may have never seen before, including rubella. This article reviews the clinical manifestations, complications, diagnosis, management, and prevention of acute rubella infection and congenital rubella syndrome.

### Past as prologue-use of rubella vaccination program lessons to inform COVID-19 vaccination [^113DFyNr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The primary goal of national rubella vaccination programs is to prevent rubella infection in pregnant women and thereby prevent the severe outcome of CRS. When rubella emerged as a nationwide threat, 2 vaccination strategies were implemented to achieve this goal: an individual protection approach that prioritized vaccinating high-risk populations (adolescent females and women of childbearing age) to prevent CRS; and a universal approach that aimed to decrease and interrupt transmission at the population level by vaccinating the age group with the highest proportion of susceptible persons: primarily, young children and those potentially at highest risk (e.g. reproductive-age women).

In 1970, the United Kingdom adopted the individual protection approach, primarily vaccinating nonpregnant women of childbearing age. This decision was informed by concerns at that time regarding unknown duration of vaccine-induced immunity in children, as well as the fact that measles vaccination coverage in the United Kingdom was low and rubella vaccine would have been given at the same time as the measles vaccine. Surveillance data showed that this approach decreased the incidence of CRS cases and termination of pregnancies associated with rubella. However, because the approach only focused on individual protection, viral transmission continued in the population at large. Unvaccinated women in the United Kingdom continued to be infected, and children continued to be born with CRS, albeit at a lower rate. Studies demonstrated that unprotected persons still posed a risk. For example, in 1 study, pregnant women with previous pregnancies had a higher risk of rubella infection than did women in their first pregnancies, suggesting that women with previous pregnancies may have been at risk of acquired rubella infection from their own children with rubella. Whereas control of rubella through individual protection was proving to be inadequate, immunization program advancements had occurred, and measles vaccination coverage had increased, which prompted UK policymakers to pivot to the universal approach: vaccinating all young children to protect the larger population.

### Estimated current and future congenital rubella syndrome incidence with and without rubella vaccine introduction-19 countries, 2019–2055 [^1141yqVR]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Rubella is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects. Rubella virus infection during early pregnancy can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or a constellation of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). This report describes current and future estimated CRS incidence in countries that have not yet introduced rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) into their national childhood immunization schedules and the estimated effect of implementing a recent recommendation to introduce RCV into these programs even if population coverage with measles-containing vaccine is < 80%. During 2000–2022, the number of countries that introduced RCV increased from 99 (52%) of 191 in 2000 to 175 (90%) of 194 in 2022. By the end of 2023, 19 lower- and middle-income countries had not yet introduced RCV. In 2019, an estimated 24,000 CRS cases occurred in these countries, representing 75% of the estimated 32,000 cases worldwide. In a modeling study estimating the effect of RCV introduction in these countries during 2025–2055, an estimated 1.03 million CRS cases are projected to occur without RCV. In contrast, fewer than 60,000 cases are estimated if RCV is introduced with catch-up and follow-up supplementary immunization activities, averting more than an estimated 986,000 CRS cases over 30 years. Based in part on these estimates, in September 2024, the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization recommended removing the ≥ 80% coverage threshold and instituting universal RCV introduction in these countries. RCV introduction in these 19 countries during 2025–2030 could rapidly accelerate progress toward rubella and CRS elimination worldwide.

### Congenital rubella syndrome in child of woman without known risk factors, new Jersey, USA [^112xsJMd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Case Report

In 2008, a full-term boy was born with microcephaly and a petechial rash. The infant's US-born mother reported no rash illness, travel history, or known contact with ill persons during the first 4 months of pregnancy. She lived with her 2 other children and the case-patient's father, who was born in Brazil and had not traveled internationally during the mother's pregnancy.

In 2002, the case-patient's mother had an equivocal rubella virus IgG titer of 5 (nonimmune < 5) and in 2003 received measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Vaccination status of the father was unknown. Maternal rubella virus IgG titer at 4 months' gestation was > 400 IU/mL (immune > 9).

The infant was delivered by urgent cesarean section because of cardiac decelerations during labor. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were 9 (of 10 total). At birth, the child weighed 2.7 kg (10th percentile), and he was 48.25 cm (15th percentile) in length and had a head circumference of 31.75 cm (< 3rd percentile). He had a petechial rash on the face, back, and upper extremities and a systolic heart murmur. No jaundice or hepatosplenomegaly was noted.

Initial tests showed a leukocyte count of 13.8 × 10⁹/L (reference 9–30) with atypical lymphocytes; a hemoglobin level of 202 g/L (reference 135−195); abnormal erythrocyte morphology, including macrocytosis, polychromasia, and poikilocytosis; and a platelet count of 98,000 × 10⁹/L (reference 140–440). Computed tomographic scan of the head revealed 2 small calcifications in the left corona radiata. Results of neonatal hearing screening were normal. Urine samples were cultured for cytomegalovirus (CMV), and serum samples were tested for toxoplasma and parvovirus IgM; all results were negative. The infant was discharged from the hospital on day 4 with a suspected congenital infection.

### Rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control and elimination-global progress, 2000–2012 [^113qT4nQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Outbreaks in EUR and WPR indicate that while control and elimination activities are ongoing, some member states within these regions are at risk for large outbreaks. Initiation of CRS control activities focused on vaccinating girls and women, which decreased rubella virus transmission but resulted in a large proportion of susceptible persons, especially males. A large population susceptible to rubella infection (primarily males) has a high risk for outbreak and transmission of rubella virus to unvaccinated pregnant women. Surveillance for rubella infection benefits from integration with measles surveillance systems, but additional effort is required to strengthen the system to ensure that febrile rash illness cases reported in pregnant women or their immediate contacts are fully investigated, including ascertaining pregnancy outcome. Surveillance to detect CRS is needed to monitor the impact of vaccination.

What is already known on this topic?

Rubella virus infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all member states introduce rubella-containing vaccines (RCVs) to control rubella and CRS. The World Health Assembly has set two goals: rubella elimination in two WHO regions by 2015 and measles and rubella elimination in five WHO regions by 2020.

What is added by this report?

The number of countries using RCVs in their immunization program and reporting rubella and CRS surveillance data has steadily increased from 2000 to 2012. As of December 2012, a total of 132 (68%) WHO member states had introduced RCV, a 33% increase from 99 member states in 2000. A total of 94,030 rubella cases were reported to WHO in 2012 from 174 member states, an 86% decrease from the 670,894 cases reported in 2000 from 102 member states.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Near elimination of rubella and CRS in the Americas proves that the tools exist to make elimination possible, and substantial progress is being made globally. However, gaps in surveillance limit the ability to monitor progress toward elimination, and recent outbreaks in Europe and Asia demonstrate the need for sustained, high-quality immunization programs.

### Progress toward rubella and congenital rubella syndrome elimination-worldwide, 2012–2022 [^112TbJj7]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Rubella virus is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects. Infection during pregnancy can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or a constellation of birth defects, including cataracts, deafness, heart defects, and developmental delay, known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). A single dose of rubella-containing vaccine can provide lifelong protection against rubella. The Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011–2020 included a target to achieve elimination of rubella in at least five of the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions by 2020, and rubella elimination is a critical goal of the Immunization Agenda 2030. This report updates a previous report and describes progress toward rubella and CRS elimination during 2012–2022. During 2012–2022, among 194 WHO countries, the number that included rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) in their immunization schedules increased from 132 (68%) to 175 (90%) and the percentage of the world's infants vaccinated against rubella increased from 40% to 68%. Reported rubella cases declined 81%, from 93,816 in 2012 to 17,407 in 2022. Verification of rubella elimination was achieved in 98 (51%) of 194 countries by 2022, an increase from 84 (43%) countries in 2019. Despite significant progress in the introduction of RCV into routine immunization programs worldwide, approximately 25 million infants annually still do not have access to RCV. Nevertheless, even in complex settings, the increasing number of countries that have achieved and sustained rubella elimination demonstrates progress toward global rubella elimination.

### A case of congenital rubella syndrome in the Netherlands: a brief report on rubella virus surveillance [^113vdhzo]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has accelerated rubella elimination since 2012 through universal introduction of a rubella vaccine in all countries. During pregnancy, primary rubella virus infection may lead to miscarriage or fetal death, or cause a variety of organ defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in live births.

By 2022, the WHO had introduced the rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) in 175 of 194 (90%) countries which has led to an increase of RCV first dose coverage in children. However, low-income countries still have the lowest coverage rates, and adults, more specifically women of childbearing age, are yet not well protected.

### Phylogenetic analysis of rubella viruses involved in congenital rubella infections in France between 1995 and 2009 [^111ogBp7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

Rubella is an acute infectious disease that normally has a mild clinical course. However, infections during pregnancy, especially before week 12 of gestation (WG), can cause severe birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The aim of this study was to perform genotyping and molecular characterization of rubella viruses involved in congenital infections in France over the past 15 years (1995 to 2009). Amniotic fluid (AF) specimens (n = 80) from pregnant women with congenital rubella infections (CRI) before week 20 of gestation, and a few other samples available from children/newborns with CRS (n = 26), were analyzed. The coding region of the rubella virus E1 gene was amplified directly from clinical specimens by reverse transcriptase PCR, and the resulting DNA fragments were sequenced. Sequences were assigned to genotypes by phylogenetic analysis with rubella virus reference sequences. Sufficient E1 gene sequences were obtained from 56 cases. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences showed that at least five different genotypes (1E, 1G, 1B, 2B, and 1h) were present in France and were involved in congenital infections, with a strong predominance of genotype 1E (87%). This is one of the very few comprehensive studies of rubella viruses involved in CRI. The results indicated that over the past 15 years, multiple introductions of the dominant genotype E caused most of the CRI cases in France. A few sporadic cases were due to other genotypes (1B, 1G, 1h, 2B).

### Imported congenital rubella syndrome, United States, 2017 [^116bu7n3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

During early pregnancy, the mother of the case-patient likely acquired acute rubella infection in Saudi Arabia, which increased its rubella vaccine program in July 2017 to meet control needs. Maternal immunization records and rubella titers were not available. The infant had positive rubella IgM, cataract, congenital heart disease, microcephaly, unilateral hearing loss, and radiolucent bone disease, meeting criteria for CRS. Screening for rubella titers in early pregnancy is standard in the United States. The presence of positive maternal rubella serology at delivery does not always reflect maternal immunization but can be the result of a rubella infection in early pregnancy. A similar scenario was misleading in a case that was recently reported and resulted in late diagnosis of CRS and subsequent multiple exposures.

Rubella-like illness in early pregnancy warrants testing for acute rubella infection, which offers parents an opportunity to decide about pregnancy outcome. For confirmed cases, maternal counseling and pregnancy termination may be considered. Testing for CRS is critical for early disease confirmation, implementation of appropriate infection control, timely reporting, and possible epidemiologic investigation. Infants with CRS shed large quantities of virus from bodily secretions for up to 1 year and can transmit rubella virus to susceptible persons. The presence of unimmunized persons in the United States (for age, personal, or medical reasons) and entry of persons from rubella-endemic countries enable potential circulation of the virus. Despite rubella elimination in the United States, the presence of birth defects compatible with CRS warrants consideration of rubella in addition to other congenital infections.

### Three cases of congenital rubella syndrome in the postelimination era – Maryland, Alabama, and Illinois, 2012 [^117APN1J]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Health-care providers should consider CRS if the mother of an infant with compatible congenital birth defects traveled during her pregnancy to an area where rubella circulates or was exposed to someone who traveled to such an area. As a nationally notifiable condition, all suspected cases of CRS should be reported immediately to the local health department, which, in turn, reports them to CDC via the state health department. Both serum and throat swab specimens should be collected as soon as CRS is suspected. Either serum positive for rubella IgM antibody or a throat swab positive for rubella RNA is confirmatory for CRS in a patient with compatible signs.

What is already known on this topic?

Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is caused by fetal infection with rubella virus from the mother and characterized by birth defects. During the 1964–1965 rubella epidemic in the United States, an estimated 12.5 million rubella cases occurred, and an estimated 20,000 infants were born with CRS. As a result of universal childhood vaccination, rubella and CRS elimination were documented in the United States in 2004; however, rubella still circulates in other areas of the world.

What is added by this report?

With the elimination of rubella, cases of CRS are a rare occurrence in the United States. This report describes three infants with CRS born in the United States in 2012; all had severe defects, and one died. In all three cases, the mother likely was exposed to rubella in Africa and had no documentation of vaccination against the virus.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Although CRS occurs infrequently in the United States, health-care providers and public health officials should consider CRS in an infant with compatible birth defects whose mother was in a rubella-endemic country during her pregnancy. Heightened awareness is critical for obtaining appropriate specimens early for laboratory confirmation of CRS and for initiation of a thorough epidemiologic investigation. In addition, health-care providers should know the vaccination status of women of childbearing age who are planning to travel internationally.

### Sentinel surveillance for congenital rubella syndrome-India, 2016–2017 [^116vpvjf]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Rubella infection during pregnancy can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or a constellation of congenital malformations known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The 11 countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region are committed to the elimination of measles and control of rubella and CRS by 2020. Until 2016, when the Government of India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Indian Council of Medical Research initiated surveillance for CRS in five sentinel sites, India did not conduct systematic surveillance for CRS. During the first 8 months of surveillance, 207 patients with suspected CRS were identified. Based on clinical details and serologic investigations, 72 (34.8%) cases were classified as laboratory-confirmed CRS, four (1.9%) as congenital rubella infection, 11 (5.3%) as clinically compatible cases, and 120 (58.0%) were excluded as noncases. The experience gained during the first phase of surveillance will be useful in expanding the surveillance network, and data from the surveillance network will be used to help monitor progress toward control of rubella and CRS in India.

Rubella is a common cause of childhood febrile rash illness in India, typically associated with mild illness; however, infection during the first trimester of pregnancy can severely affect the fetus, resulting in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or CRS. In 2010, among an estimated 103,000 infants with CRS born globally, 46% were born in the South-East Asia Region. The Government of India is committed to eliminating measles and controlling rubella and CRS by 2020. Maintaining high population immunity to rubella, creating a network of laboratories, and developing and sustaining a case-based surveillance system are the principal strategies for elimination of measles and control of rubella and CRS.

In 2017, India introduced measles-rubella vaccine nationwide and launched a mass vaccination campaign targeting children aged 9 months to 14 years in five states or union territories, with plans for phased expansion to the remaining states. Outbreak-based and laboratory-supported measles and rubella surveillance was established in the country in 2005. Although several published studies in India have examined the prevalence of CRS among different population groups, including patients with cataracts and other ocular abnormalities, hearing loss, mental retardation, cardiac defects, and other congenital anomalies, there was no systematic CRS surveillance system. To address this gap, the Indian Council of Medical Research and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare initiated laboratory-supported surveillance for CRS in five sentinel sites in five Indian states in December 2016.

### Past as prologue-use of rubella vaccination program lessons to inform COVID-19 vaccination [^111Gvv6E]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

As COVID-19 spreads throughout the world, we recall a similar experience of a swiftly spreading respiratory disease over half a century earlier. In 1963, a rubella virus epidemic spread from Europe to the United States, causing great alarm among public health officials. The New York Times reported on February 8, 1964: "GERMAN MEASLES AT EPIDEMIC RATE; City and State Affected — 2,302 Cases Reported Here Since Dec. 1; Virus Is Termed Mild; But Women Are Warned of Danger During First 3 Months of Pregnancy".

Although rubella is generally a mild disease, rubella infection during early pregnancy can be devastating. Fetal infection can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or infants born with life-threatening or disabling congenital malformations, known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). A pregnant woman infected with rubella in early pregnancy has up to a 90% chance of giving birth to an infant with CRS and that infant having > 1 malformations, such as congenital heart defect, cataracts, and hearing impairment. CRS is the most substantial public health threat of rubella infection and is associated with an infant mortality rate of 20%–40% and lifelong sequelae for many of those infants that survive.

### The geography of measles vaccination in the African great lakes region [^116C9ghw]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Spatial heterogeneity in measles vaccination coverage raises a further key public health policy issue: many of the countries investigated here will soon become eligible for Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization funding to support the introduction of rubella-containing vaccine. Rubella is a mild infection unless contracted by pregnant women during their first trimester, which can lead to the birth of a child with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). As previous work has shown, inequities in vaccination can lead to an increased risk of rubella infection in pregnant women and thus a higher burden of CRS. Since rubella-containing vaccine is usually given in conjunction with MCV, the spatial heterogeneity in measles vaccination coverage documented here could affect the dynamics of rubella in ways that might increase the burden of CRS in this region.

The considerable spatial heterogeneities and geographic clustering of low vaccine coverage areas found in our analysis suggest that countries with high levels of national coverage may still be at considerable risk for measles outbreaks. Areas where there is a confluence of high population density and low vaccination coverage (as illustrated in Fig. 3b) pose the greatest risk, and if linked, may have the potential to sustain measles transmission regionally despite robust vaccination campaigns nearly everywhere else. If countries can identify and eliminate these high-risk vaccination coldspots, they will reduce their risk of measles outbreaks and accelerate progress towards the goal of measles elimination.

### Sero-positivity rate of rubella and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care in mwanza, tanzania [^111XKyAN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

The current study indicates that a considerable number of pregnant women in Mwanza are at risk of acquiring primary infection with the rubella virus. There is no vaccination against rubella, either in the public or private sector in Mwanza, or anywhere in Tanzania. In Mwanza, 11% of the women who are becoming pregnant at an age between 15–24 are at risk of contracting the rubella virus therefore being at an increased risk of CRS. Overall, 7.3% of the women of Mwanza are at risk of acquiring primary rubella infection during pregnancy. This is higher than the figure of 7% observed in Eldoret Kenya and necessitates the introduction of prenatal screening and routine immunization of all women at risk. Both Kenya and Tanzania do not have rubella immunization programme therefore the high sero-positivity rates found in Eastern African countries might be due to high transmission rates of infection. Since there is no treatment for an active infection during pregnancy, screening and immunization of women at risk is the mainstay of preventing CRS. Policy makers should therefore consider implementing the above mentioned strategies.

In the present study, as in a South African one, it was noted that women involved in business and farming activities are a higher risk of acquiring rubella infection compared to formally employed women. A high social economic status, which implies good living conditions, has been found to be associated with a lower risk to acquire rubella i nfection. As in studies undertaken in Kenya, an increase in age was associated with an increase in rubella sero-positivity. A large proportion of women in Tanzania are involved in farming activities and reside in villages, and they also tend to have their first pregnancy at a low age (15–24). All these factors, as evidenced by this study, put them at risk of acquiring rubella infection and consequently increase the risk of developing CRS. In the current study, the third trimester was a risk of IgG sero-positivity, as demonstrated by univariate analysis. It was also noted that as GA increases the IgG sero-positivity increases. This indicates that women of this geographical area may be contracting acute rubella infection in early pregnancy. Further investigations are required to follow up these women for possible CRS.

Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design, follow-up of the participants was not undertaken. This is an important limitation. However, the study established the magnitude and some of the factors associated with rubella sero-prevalence and recommended future studies.

### Three cases of congenital rubella syndrome in the postelimination era – Maryland, Alabama, and Illinois, 2012 [^113Y3zmt]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

At this time, during maintenance of CRS elimination in the United States, confirmation at CDC of all laboratory results that support diagnoses of CRS cases is recommended. Molecular characterization of the virus is critical because the viral genotype can substantiate the suspected source of the virus or suggest one if the source is unknown, because some of the circulating genotypes are associated with specific geographic areas. Heightened awareness, gathering of pertinent information, and collection of appropriate specimens are required of the health-care provider and public health department to diagnose and investigate a case of CRS; however, these surveillance efforts are crucial to maintaining elimination in the United States.

As long as rubella remains endemic in any area of the world, imported CRS will continue to be a public health concern in the United States. Residents or foreign visitors entering the United States from rubella-endemic areas can introduce the virus. In addition, infants born with CRS can shed infectious virus for several months; therefore, care must be taken to avoid contact with others who are susceptible to rubella (e.g. unvaccinated infants in day-care settings). Although levels of vaccination with rubella-containing vaccine are high in the United States, a small proportion of persons are not vaccinated for medical or personal reasons. Those who are not vaccinated against rubella virus can become infected if exposed. If a pregnant woman is infected with rubella virus, the fetus also can become infected. Fetal infection with rubella virus, especially early during pregnancy, often leads to CRS. The risk for CRS in the unborn child of a mother with rubella infection might be as high as 90% for infections occurring through week 10 of pregnancy. Clusters of unvaccinated persons are at high risk for an outbreak, as in the Netherlands and Canada in 2009. Health-care providers and public health workers should remain vigilant for imported cases of CRS.

### Screening for potential susceptibility to rubella in an antenatal population: a multivariate analysis [^114w3pWA]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Rubella causes disease in the fetus. Immunity to rubella is therefore, routinely screened in pregnant women. In this retrospective observational study, we assessed the levels of potential susceptibility to rubella in the population of a north London antenatal clinic. Risk factors for potential susceptibility to rubella and changes in potential susceptibility to rubella over time were studied. Almost all women were screened for potential susceptibility to rubella (99.8%). The majority were predicted to be immune (96.8%). Women booking in later years within the study period showed higher levels of potential susceptibility to rubella. Booking during each subsequent year in the study gave women an odds ratio of 0.91 (CI:0.84, 0.98, P = 0.009) of being predicted to have immunity against rubella. Age was associated with predicted immunity to rubella, with a 5.1% (CI:3.3%, 6.9%, P < 0.001) increased likelihood for every year older. Previous pregnancy was predictive of immunity against rubella with an odds ratio of 1.41 (CI 1.21, 1.61, P = 0.001). Those from a non-white ethnicity were less likely to have antibodies predictive of immunity (OR: 0.730, CI: 0.581, 0.879 P < 0.001). Country of birth was associated with differences in potential susceptibility, with those being born outside of the British Isles having an odds ratio for predicted immunity of 0.63 (CI:0.35,0.91, P = 0.001). Being born in a high-risk country for rubella non-immunity was also a risk factor, giving an odds ratio of predicted immunity to rubella of 0.55 (CI:0.32, 0.77, P < 0.001).

Materials and Methods

The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article.

Data Sources and Search Strategy

We attempted to report the present systematic review and meta‐analysis by following the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analyses statement. 24 PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Libraries, and Chinese databases (including China Biology Medicine disc, Chinese Scientific Journals Fulltext Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Database) were searched through July 2018 with no restrictions, to identify studies that assessed the risk of CHD associated with maternal viral infection. The following search terms were used and combined: "(congenital heart disease OR congenital heart defect OR congenital heart malformation OR congenital heart anomalies OR congenital cardiac disease OR congenital cardiac defect OR congenital cardiac malformation OR congenital cardiac anomalies OR congenital cardiovascular disease OR cardiovascular malformation OR cardiovascular defect OR cardiovascular anomalies OR birth defect) AND (viral infection OR viral infection OR rubella virus OR cytomegalovirus OR hepatitis B virus OR coxsackie virus OR herpesvirus) AND (cohort studies OR prospective studies OR follow‐up studies OR retrospective studies OR case‐control studies)". We also performed a manual search on the reference lists of retrieved articles. Gray literature (generally refers to nonpublicly published literature) and conference abstracts were not searched. We did not contact authors of the primary studies for additional information.

Inclusion Criteria

In this review, the exposures of interest were maternal viral infections. Mothers who had a history of viral infection, such as rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, coxsackievirus, and herpesvirus, were defined as the exposed group, and those without viral infection as the unexposed group. The outcomes of interest were CHDs. We first performed an initial screening of titles or abstracts. A second screening was based on full‐text review. Studies were considered eligible if they (1) were published in Chinese or English; (2) had a cohort or case‐control design; (3) had use of maternal viral infection as the exposure of interest; (4) had use of CHDs as outcomes of interest; and (5) reported relative risks and odd ratios (ORs), with corresponding 95% CIs (or data to calculate them).

Once a main cause of congenital abnormalities, congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is now rare in the United States. However, rubella remains a common illness in countries without robust vaccination programs. Since rubella was declared eliminated in the United States in 2004, 6 cases of CRS have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); 5 were likely imported cases. We describe the sixth case.

### Nationwide rubella epidemic – Japan, 2013 [^117G6M5g]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

The primary purpose of rubella vaccination is to prevent congenital rubella virus infection, including CRS. In WPR, the Immunization Technical Advisory Group endorsed a regional accelerated rubella control and CRS prevention goal to decrease rubella incidence to < 10 cases per million population and CRS incidence to < 10 cases per million live births each year by 2015. In 2012, Japan reported 18.7 rubella cases per million population, a rate higher than the WPR annual incidence target. As of May 2013 (4 months into the year), the number of reported rubella cases is already double the total number of cases in 2012.

In 1976, Japan established a goal to prevent CRS and introduced single-antigen rubella vaccine in its national immunization program, targeting girls in junior high school. In 1989, an MMR vaccine was introduced, targeting children aged 12–72 months, but this combination vaccine was withdrawn in 1993 after reports of aseptic meningitis related to the mumps component. In 1995, vaccination policy was changed to make all vaccines strongly recommended but not mandatory, and in 2006, the MR combined vaccine was introduced, with a 2-dose schedule administered at 1–2 years and 5–7 years. After a large measles outbreak in 2007 and 2008, a catch-up MR vaccination program was implemented, targeting two age cohorts (those aged 12 years and those aged 17 years) each year during 2008–2013 to ensure high population immunity among persons aged 12–22 years in 2013.

What is already known about this topic?

Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is caused by fetal infection with rubella virus from the mother and is characterized by birth defects such as hearing impairment, heart defects, and cataracts. Several countries that initially vaccinated only adolescent or adult women, then later introduced rubella vaccine into their routine programs or conducted mass campaigns in adolescent and adult females, have experienced large rubella outbreaks among adolescent and young adult males, with a concomitant increase in infants with CRS.

What is added by this report?

In 2012, the number of rubella cases in Japan sharply increased to 2,392, with the rise in cases continuing into 2013 and resulting in a cumulative total of 5,442 cases from January 1 to May 1, 2013. Of these cases, 72% were laboratory confirmed, and 23% were in females. Since October 2012, 10 CRS cases have been reported.

### Measles in the 21st century: progress toward achieving and sustaining elimination [^115gaWQA]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

MMR vaccine is contraindicated in pregnancy owing to theoretical concerns of fetal harm including congenital rubella syndrome. Nevertheless, a systematic review of vaccines given to pregnant women found that among 4918 pregnant women who inadvertently received MMR vaccine while pregnant, no cases of congenital rubella syndrome were reported [49]. Similarly, a safety review of 131 reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System of MMR vaccine administered to pregnant women found that most vaccines were given to women early in pregnancy (when they were unaware of their pregnancy), and in the majority of reports, no adverse events were reported [50]. The highly favorable safety profile of MCV has been an essential component of the global measles eradication strategy.

### Congenital rubella syndrome in child of woman without known risk factors, new Jersey, USA [^116eLowS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Delays in diagnostic testing and reporting hindered the public health contact investigation of this case. Because the investigation began ≈1 year after the maternal exposure period, the persons involved had limited recall. Earlier diagnosis and reporting could have improved our contact investigation and provided for earlier isolation of the case-patient.

We were unable to identify a maternal rubella exposure. Given rubella's elimination from the United States, we speculate that the case-patient's mother may have had contact with an international traveler from a region with circulating rubella. In the years following documentation of rubella elimination in the United States, surveillance has identified a small number of circumstances in which foreign visitors without confirmed rubella transmitted the virus to US residents.

Several features of the laboratory testing bear further examination. The persistence of rubella IgM at 12 months has previously been reported in CRS cases. The child's rubella IgG level did not decline as would be expected as a result of the loss of maternal antibody; this lack of decline is consistent with rubella infection. In addition, the case-patient's serologic results were most consistent with CRS, given his clinical features, his low risk for postnatal rubella infection, and the fact that he was not vaccinated. When the infant was 7.5 months of age, RT-PCR was positive for 1 of 2 specimens. However, when the infant was 10 and 12 months of age, RT-PCR was negative, as were culture results when the infant was 7.5 and 10 months of age. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of CRS because for ≈50% of children with CRS, culture results are negative by 3 months of age.

### Rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)… [^112YVmDs]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance Rubella is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects. When a woman is infected with the rubella virus during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, the newborn can have birth defects, known as congenital rubella syndrome. Impacts Rubella can cause severe birth defects and death Rubella infection creates mild symptoms in most children and adults but can cause serious health problems when it happens during pregnancy. Rubella virus infection is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects, known as congenital rubella syndrome. Rubella infection during pregnancy can also lead to miscarriage and stillbirth.

When a pregnant woman is infected with rubella in early pregnancy, she has up to a 90% chance of giving birth to a baby with CRS:
- CRS can cause hearing impairment, cataracts or glaucoma, heart defects, or developmental delays
- 33% of infants born with CRS die before their first birthday
- In 2019, an estimated 32, 000 children were born with CRS. Prevention Rubella is a preventable disease The World Health Organization recommends that all countries include rubella vaccines in their national immunization programs. Rubella vaccines are safe and effective and have been used for over 50 years. One dose can provide lifelong protection. In most countries, a combined measles and rubella vaccine is used. Over half the world's countries have eliminated rubella. Most countries include rubella vaccines in their national immunization programs, but 19 countries have not introduced rubella vaccine. The majority of children born with CRS live in these countries.

### Non-malarial infectious diseases of antenatal care in pregnant women in franceville, Gabon [^1121PrP4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. In pregnant women, although 29% of congenital T. gondii infections are usually asymptomatic, the infection can be delayed or become potentially severe once it manifests. Transmission of T. gondii from mother to the fetus depends on parasitaemia, the mother's cellular immunity as well as the stage of placental development. Congenital toxoplasmosis can lead to several symptoms including mild chorioretinitis, an inflammation of the choroid (a thin pigmented vascular coat) and the eye retina, which can persist in the child many years after birth and can cause miscarriage, intellectual disability, micro cephaly, hydrocephalus and seizures.

Rubella, also known as German measles, is an infection caused by the rubella virus. In pregnancy, this infection poses a high risk for abnormal fetal formation when it occurs in the first 11 weeks of gestation. This risk seems to be nonexistent after the18th week of pregnancy. Rubella in pregnant women has been associated with spontaneous abortion and congenital abnormalities such as cataracts, heart defects and sensorineural deafness. Permanent abnormalities such as heart defects, pulmonary artery stenosis, hypoplasia, eye defects, intellectual and psychomotor disabilities, and speech defects have also been linked to rubella infection. Other outcomes of rubella during pregnancy include transient abnormalities in newborns and infants, developmental and late-onset abnormalities. Retardation of intrauterine growth seems to be the only consequence of infection in the third trimester of pregnancy.

### Estimated current and future congenital rubella syndrome incidence with and without rubella vaccine introduction-19 countries, 2019–2055 [^1153R3kt]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Modeled Estimates of Current CRS Incidence

Because routine surveillance data underestimate CRS cases, estimates of CRS incidence (cases per 100,000 live births) and the number of annual CRS cases in 2019 for the 19 countries that had not yet introduced RCV by the end of 2023 (calculated as part of published estimates of the global and regional burden of CRS during 1996–2019) were used. These published estimates were calculated using 1) previously described catalytic models to estimate the age-specific prevaccination force of infection (the rate at which susceptible persons become infected) from seroprevalence data and 2) an age-structured dynamic rubella transmission model. For each dataset and catalytic model, 95% CIs for the force of infection, and when applicable, assay sensitivity, were derived. For each country, the transmission model was run using 1,000 values for the prevaccination force of infection, vaccine efficacy, vaccination coverage, and risk that an infant would be born with CRS if the mother was infected with rubella during pregnancy. These parameters were varied in the same range as that used previously. The base case value for vaccine efficacy was 95%, with a range of 85%–99%, and the assumed risk that a child born to a mother who was infected during pregnancy would have CRS was 65% (95% CI = 47%–88%), consistent with published estimates. The model used demographic data from United Nations population sources. ††† The 95% CIs for each outcome of interest were calculated from the outcome's range across the 1,000 model runs.

### Brief report: imported case of congenital rubella syndrome – new hampshire, 2005 [^112mFD7r]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2005). Low credibility.

In 2004, an independent panel convened by CDC declared rubella no longer endemic in the United States. Nine cases of rubella were reported in 2004, and four cases of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) were reported during 2001–2004. However, worldwide, an estimated 100,000 infants are born with CRS annually. This report describes a case of imported CRS diagnosed in an infant girl aged 10 weeks born in New Hampshire to Liberian refugee parents. To prevent transmission of rubella, clinicians should consider a diagnosis of CRS in infants with compatible clinical signs, particularly those born to mothers who recently immigrated from countries without rubella control programs, and rubella vaccine should be administered to susceptible persons.

### Fetal risk associated with rubella vaccination during pregnancy [^117LZLk1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Costa Rica implemented a nationwide measles-rubella vaccination campaign among men and women (15–39 years old) in May 2001. A protocol was developed to follow-up the vaccinated women who were unknowingly pregnant, to determine the risk of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) or congenital rubella infection only associated with the administration of the rubella vaccine RA27/3 during pregnancy.

Methods

To classify the prevaccination maternal immune status, a serum sample was taken at the initial evaluation to detect IgM and IgG rubella antibodies (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). All pregnancies were followed up and all newborns were evaluated. A cord serum sample of their children was taken at birth. We calculated odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval, 95% CI) associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, prematurity, low birth weight, and the presence of defects compatible with CRS.

Results

The prevaccination immune status was established in 797 women and 1191 mother and child pairs were analyzed. Adjusted OR for miscarriage (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.26–1.39), stillbirth (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.10–16.81), prematurity (OR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.03–2.39), low birth weight (OR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.03–2.23) and defects compatible with CRS (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.34–3.54) showed no association between immune and susceptible maternal status. There were no cases of CRS and no children were IgM positive.

Conclusions

No adverse pregnancy outcome such as miscarriages or CRS was documented in women who were vaccinated and unknowingly pregnant. These results support RA27/3 rubella vaccine safety.

### Rubella [^1127MgLN]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Maternal rubella is now rare in many developed countries that have rubella vaccination programmes. However, in many developing countries congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) remains a major cause of developmental anomalies, particularly blindness and deafness. WHO have provided recommendations for prevention of CRS, and, encouragingly, the number of countries introducing rubella vaccination programmes has risen. However, declining uptake rates due to concerns about the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in the UK, and increasing numbers of cases in some European countries coupled with poor uptake rates might jeopardise this progress. Surveillance of postnatally and congenitally acquired infection is an essential component of CRS prevention since rubella is difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds alone. Laboratory differentiation of rubella from other rash-causing infections, such as measles, parvovirus B19, human herpesvirus 6, and enteroviruses in developed countries, and various endemic arboviruses is essential. Reverse transcriptase PCR and sequencing for diagnosis and molecular epidemiological investigation and detection of rubella-specific IgG and IgM salivary antibody responses in oral fluid are now available.

### Rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control and elimination-global progress, 2000–2012 [^114T6UNE]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Rubella virus usually causes a mild fever and rash in children and adults. * However, infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or infants with congenital malformations, known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated guidance on the preferred strategy for introduction of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) into national routine immunization schedules with an initial wide-age-range vaccination campaign that includes children aged 9 months–15 years. WHO also urged all member states to take the opportunity offered by accelerated measles control and elimination activities as a platform to introduce RCVs. The Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan (2012–2020) published by the Measles Rubella Initiative partners in 2012 and the Global Vaccine Action Plan endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2012 include milestones to eliminate rubella and CRS in two WHO regions by 2015, and eliminate rubella in five WHO regions by 2020. This report summarizes the global progress of rubella and CRS control and elimination during 2000–2012. As of December 2012, a total of 132 (68%) WHO member states had introduced RCV, a 33% increase from 99 member states in 2000. A total of 94,030 rubella cases were reported to WHO in 2012 from 174 member states, an 86% decrease from the 670,894 cases reported in 2000 from 102 member states. The WHO Region of the Americas (AMR) and European Region (EUR) have established rubella elimination goals of 2010 and 2015, respectively. AMR has started to document the elimination of measles, rubella, and CRS; in EUR, rubella incidence has decreased significantly, although outbreaks continue to occur.

### Chapter 15: congenital rubella syndrome… [^116u7Eq4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Disease Description Congenital rubella syndrome is an illness in infants that results from maternal infection with rubella virus during pregnancy. When rubella infection occurs during early pregnancy, serious consequences–such as miscarriages, stillbirths, and a constellation of severe birth defects in infants–can result. The risk of congenital infection and defects is highest during the first 12 weeks of gestation and decreases thereafter; defects are rare after infection in the 20th week of gestation. Women who contract rubella while pregnant should be monitored for birth outcome, and appropriate testing should be performed on the infant after birth. Healthcare providers should be advised to evaluate infants born with conditions consistent with CRS and to collect specimens for virus detection and to perform a rubella-specific IgM antibody test on infants suspected of having CRS.

Prevent Transmission from Infants with CRS Cases of US-acquired rubella have occurred among susceptible persons providing care for infants with CRS. Because infants can shed the virus for prolonged periods, infants with CRS should be considered infectious until they are at least 1 year old or until 2 clinical specimens obtained 1 month apart are negative for rubella virus by RT-PCR, either real-time or conventional; culture is also acceptable. Persons having contact with infants with CRS should have documented evidence of immunity to rubella and caregivers of infants with CRS should be aware of the potential hazard of the infants to susceptible pregnant contacts.

### Progress toward rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control and elimination-worldwide, 2012–2020 [^113HSAF4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Rubella virus is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects and can cause epidemics. Although rubella virus infection usually produces a mild febrile rash illness in children and adults, infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or an infant born with a constellation of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). A single dose of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) can provide lifelong protection against rubella. The Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011–2020 (GVAP) included a target to achieve elimination of rubella in at least five of the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions * by 2020, and WHO recommends capitalizing on the accelerated measles elimination activities as an opportunity to introduce RCV. This report updates a previous report and summarizes global progress toward control and elimination of rubella and CRS from 2012, when accelerated rubella control activities were initiated, through 2020. Among 194 WHO Member States, the number with RCV in their immunization schedules has increased from 132 (68%) in 2012 to 173 (89%) in 2020; 70% of the world's infants were vaccinated against rubella in 2020. Reported rubella cases declined by 48%, from 94,277 in 2012 to 49,136 in 2019, and decreased further to 10,194 in 2020. Rubella elimination has been verified in 93 (48%) of 194 countries including the entire Region of the Americas (AMR). To increase the equity of protection and make further progress to eliminate rubella, it is important that the 21 countries that have not yet done so should introduce RCV. Likewise, countries that have introduced RCV can achieve and maintain rubella elimination with high vaccination coverage and surveillance for rubella and CRS. Four of six WHO regions have established rubella elimination goals; the two WHO regions that have not yet established an elimination goal (the African [AFR] and Eastern Mediterranean [EMR] regions) have expressed a commitment to rubella elimination and should consider establishing a goal.

### Sero-positivity rate of rubella and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care in mwanza, tanzania [^116JsW9v]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Sero-positivity of rubella is high in the Mwanza region with a significant proportion of women at risk of contracting primary rubella infection. Advanced age and being a woman involved in farming or a business woman were independent risk factors associated with positive rubella infection. Screening for rubella infection during antenatal care and post-natal immunization of women at risk should be considered in Tanzania, as a major strategy to minimize CRS. Susceptible pregnant women should be thoroughly evaluated for possible rubella infection. Women who were immune in their first pregnancy should not be vaccinated, as they have naturally acquired immunity. In addition to the above interventions, defining the target population age for rubella vaccination is a key issue. An efficient programme for selective immunization of pre-pubertal/adolescent girls should be considered, possibly as a critical component of the school health system. A future study including children and adolescents of various ages would allow the identification of the most susceptible time frame of infection in Tanzania. We also strongly recommend a large follow up study of pregnant women to determine the outcome of the pregnancy and the magnitude of CRS in our settings.

### Progress toward rubella elimination-World Health Organization European region, 2005–2019 [^114dMte5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2005, the Regional Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region (EUR) passed a resolution calling for the regional elimination of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). In 2010, all 53 countries in EUR * reaffirmed their commitment to eliminating measles, rubella, and CRS; this goal was included in the European Vaccine Action Plan 2015–2020. Rubella, which typically manifests as a mild febrile rash illness, is the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects. Rubella infection during pregnancy can result in miscarriage, fetal death, or a constellation of malformations known as CRS, which usually includes one or more visual, auditory, or cardiac defects. The WHO-recommended measles and rubella elimination strategies in EUR include 1) achieving and maintaining ≥ 95% coverage with 2 doses of measles- and rubella-containing vaccine (MRCV) through routine immunization services; 2) providing measles and rubella vaccination opportunities, including supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), to populations susceptible to measles or rubella; 3) strengthening surveillance by conducting case investigations and confirming suspected cases and outbreaks with laboratory results; and 4) improving the availability and use of evidence to clearly communicate the benefits and risks of preventing these diseases through vaccination to health professionals and the public. This report updates a previous report and describes progress toward rubella and CRS elimination in EUR during 2005–2019. In 2000, estimated coverage with the first dose of a rubella-containing vaccine (RCV1) in EUR was 60%, and 621,039 rubella cases were reported (incidence = 716.9 per 1 million population). During 2005–2019, estimated regional coverage with RCV1 was 93%–95%, and in 2019, 31 (58%) countries achieved ≥ 95% coverage with the RCV1. During 2005–2019, approximately 38 million persons received an RCV during SIAs in 20 (37%) countries. Rubella incidence declined by > 99%, from 234.9 cases per 1 million population (206,359 cases) in 2005 to 0.67 cases per 1 million population (620 cases) by 2019. CRS cases declined by 50%, from 16 cases in 2005 to eight cases in 2019. For rubella and CRS elimination in EUR to be achieved and maintained, measures are needed to strengthen immunization programs by ensuring high coverage with an RCV in every district of each country, offering supplementary rubella vaccination to susceptible adults, maintaining high-quality surveillance for rapid case detection and confirmation, and ensuring effective outbreak preparedness and response.

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and pregnancy outcomes according to gestational age at time of infection [^114L9JyQ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In early 2020, a new coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), arrived in Europe. It infected millions of persons and led to the deaths of thousands by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by May 2020, when numbers of infections per week in Europe decreased substantially. However, after a summer respite, the number of infections began to escalate again in September 2020, and several new variants were reported. Hundreds of articles published during this period reported the virus's relationship with and effect on pregnancy and attempted to determine adverse neonatal and obstetric outcomes after infection. Meanwhile, mother-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been established, and the World Health Organization recognized the virus as part of the TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other viruses, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex) family of infections (of which Zika virus was the most recent new member), adding yet more interest to the possible perinatal consequences of SARS-CoV-2.

In a cohort study using propensity score-matching at the level of age, body mass index (BMI), and underlying conditions (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, asthma), Badr et al. demonstrated that pregnant women at > 20 weeks of gestation (WG) infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a significantly higher risk for intensive care unit admission, endotracheal intubation, hospitalization for disease-related symptoms, and need for oxygen therapy. A systematic review demonstrated an increased risk for intensive care unit admission in infected pregnant women compared with infected nonpregnant women and noninfected pregnant women.

Many researchers have focused on the obstetric and neonatal outcomes of infected pregnant women. Some reports have demonstrated that rates of preterm and cesarean delivery have increased, whereas others have reported a close association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and preeclampsia or preeclampsia-like syndromes. Enormous effort has been made to learn more about adverse outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but most studies investigated patients in the late second or third trimester. Very few studies have stratified the adverse outcomes of patients according to the gestational age at which infection occurred. The objective of our study was to measure the prevalence of obstetric and neonatal outcomes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and to examine the effect of gestational age at infection on each outcome.

### Progress toward rubella elimination-Western pacific region, 2000–2019 [^113nFzk5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Rubella is the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects. Rubella typically manifests as a mild febrile rash illness; however, infection during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, or a constellation of malformations known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), commonly including one or more visual, auditory, or cardiac defects. In 2012, the Regional Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPR) * committed to accelerate rubella control, and in 2017, resolved that all countries or areas (countries) in WPR should aim for rubella elimination † as soon as possible. WPR countries are capitalizing on measles elimination activities, using a combined measles and rubella vaccine, case-based surveillance for febrile rash illness, and integrated diagnostic testing for measles and rubella. This report summarizes progress toward rubella elimination and CRS prevention in WPR during 2000–2019. Coverage with a first dose of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV1) increased from 11% in 2000 to 96% in 2019. During 1970–2019, approximately 84 million persons were vaccinated through 62 supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) conducted in 27 countries. Reported rubella incidence increased from 35.5 to 71.3 cases per million population among reporting countries during 2000–2008, decreased to 2.1 in 2017, and then increased to 18.4 in 2019 as a result of outbreaks in China and Japan. Strong sustainable immunization programs, closing of existing immunity gaps, and maintenance of high-quality surveillance to respond rapidly to and contain outbreaks are needed in every WPR country to achieve rubella elimination in the region.

### Pregnancy and infection: using disease pathogenesis to inform vaccine strategy [^116EcEjx]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

The primary goal of vaccination strategies for protecting against fetal infections is generation of protective maternal immunity prior to pregnancy. Because congenital infections can occur in the absence of maternal symptoms, vaccines against congenital agents should ideally provide complete sterilizing immunity. Rubella is included in a live-attenuated combination vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), which confers lifelong protective immunity. Because of the long duration of protective immunity following rubella vaccination, target populations include children and adolescent girls. However, incomplete vaccination coverage can lead to paradoxical increases in CRS due to an increase in the average age of infection, and so it is also recommended that unvaccinated women of childbearing age be counseled to receive the rubella vaccine at least one month prior to conception. The implementation of large-scale rubella vaccination programs has resulted in sufficient population-level immunity, significant reductions in CRS, and elimination of rubella virus from several developed countries, including the United States.

Following successful implementation of MMR vaccination programs, cytomegalovirus (CMV) has emerged as the most common congenital viral infection in the developed world. The incidence of congenital CMV varies based on geographic region and socioeconomic status, but overall birth prevalence is estimated to be 0.64%, which is similar to the incidence of Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome. In contrast to rubella virus, however, there is currently no licensed vaccine available for CMV, and with seroprevalence approaching 100% in some developing countries, vaccine development has been identified as a priority public healthcare goal. While CMV infection of healthy adults is usually asymptomatic, adaptive immune responses are insufficient to clear the infection, which results in lifelong latent infection of myeloid precursor cells. Although latent or reactivated CMV is less likely to cause congenital infection than a primary CMV infection during pregnancy, preconception immunity does not completely eliminate transplacental transmission and congenital disease. Moreover, pregnant women with latent CMV infection are still susceptible to primary infection with different CMV strains, which have been shown to have distinct virulence patterns. Overcoming the challenges associated with latent infections and strain variability are significant hurdles in the development of an effective CMV vaccine, and despite significant advances in our knowledge of CMV pathogenesis, the precise immune targets that constitute fetal protection remain unknown. Of the several CMV vaccine candidates that have been tested, none have provided complete protection against infection, and all have failed to protect against reactivation of latent CMV. More research on the pathogenesis CMV infection is needed to define immunological correlates of protection against CMV transmission during pregnancy to inform vaccine development.

### Estimated current and future congenital rubella syndrome incidence with and without rubella vaccine introduction-19 countries, 2019–2055 [^1117YScz]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rubella is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects. Rubella virus infection usually produces a mild febrile rash illness in children and adults. However, infection during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or a constellation of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Caring for CRS cases is costly, and rubella vaccination has been shown to be cost-effective in high- and middle-income countries. However, no similar studies have been conducted in low-income countries in Africa or Asia. A single dose of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) can provide lifelong protection against rubella. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011–2020 * included a target to achieve rubella elimination in at least five of the six WHO regions by 2020, and the WHO Immunization Agenda 2030 † includes rubella elimination as a critical impact goal.

During 2000–2022, the number of countries that included RCV in their childhood immunization schedules increased from 99 (52%) of 191 in 2000 to 175 (90%) of 194 in 2022. However, the 2020 WHO Rubella Vaccine Position Paper maintained WHO's 2011 recommendation that countries planning to introduce RCV into their immunization programs should have attained ≥ 80% coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) § through routine vaccination or ≥ 80% coverage with an MCV dose through supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). The rationale for the 80% coverage threshold is to avoid suboptimal RCV postintroduction vaccination coverage, which would have the effect of reducing, but not eliminating, rubella transmission; shifting the age of infection to older children, adolescents, and young adults who were not immune; increasing the interval between rubella outbreaks; and increasing the risk for rubella infection among nonimmune women of childbearing age, potentially leading to a paradoxical increase in cases of CRS compared with the prevaccine rubella epidemiology. Any change to the 80% coverage requirement would require recommendation by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, the principal independent advisory group to WHO for vaccines.

### Rubella in pregnancy: intrauterine transmission and perinatal outcome during a Brazilian epidemic [^113YuTTK]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Sixty pregnant women with clinical signs of rubella and specific rubella antibodies were studied between January 1999 and December 2002 in order to determine the intrauterine rubella transmission rate and the presence of the virus in amniotic fluid and fetal tissues by nested PCR. Thirty-three patients presented rubella before 12 weeks of gestation and 27 after 12 weeks. Gestational age at the time of acute rubella was determined on the basis of the date of last menstruation and the first trimester ultrasound scan. Thirteen patients with clinical features of rubella before 12 weeks of gestation were submitted to amniocentesis. Three products of conception were analyzed. The presence of the rubella virus was determined by nested PCR. IgM and IgG antibodies were analyzed in neonatal samples at birth and at 3 months of age using a capture immunoassay. Newborn follow-up was based on the presence of congenital rubella syndrome-compatible defects, anti-rubella antibodies, echocardiographic alterations, brainstem evoked response audiometry, and ophthalmological pathology. Five miscarriages and four fetal deaths were observed in the group of patients presenting clinical features before 12 weeks of gestation. IgM antibodies were detected in seven neonates at birth and at 3 months of age. Deafness was observed in three cases and pigmentary retinopathy in one case. Fourteen of the 16 samples (13 amniotic fluid and 3 fetal tissue samples) submitted to virological analysis tested positive. Four fetal deaths, five miscarriages (one with negative virology) and seven newborns with anti-rubella IgM at birth and/or at 3 months age were observed in the group with rubella before 12 weeks of gestation. There were three cases in which virological analysis of the amniotic fluid samples was positive (infected) while the newborn showed no signs of congenital rubella syndrome and anti-rubella IgM were absent. When maternal rubella occurred after 12 weeks of gestation, no fetal or neonatal rubella signs were observed. Eradication of congenital rubella syndrome is possible since vaccination campaigns continue and all services related to the health care of children, adolescents and women have become aware of the significance of the problem and are collaborating. All pregnant women in Brazil should be screened for the rubella antibody and the susceptible group should be vaccinated after giving birth.

### Newborn screening for congenital infectious diseases [^115NcJtt]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Rubella virus infection during early pregnancy can lead to severe birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome. Sequelae of rubella virus infection include three distinct neurologic syndromes: postinfectious encephalitis after acute infection, a range of neurologic manifestations after congenital infection, and an extremely rare neurodegenerative disorder, progressive rubella panencephalitis, that can follow either congenital or postnatal infection. A review of the literature that identified studies about the prevalence of anti-rubella antibodies from developing countries concluded that congenital rubella syndrome is an under-recognized public health problem and that appropriate data need to be collected to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a potential global rubella control program.

### Three cases of congenital rubella syndrome in the postelimination era – Maryland, Alabama, and Illinois, 2012 [^114VJgaz]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Infection with rubella virus during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Serious manifestations of CRS include deafness, cataracts, cardiac defects, mental retardation, and death. In the last major rubella epidemic in the United States, during 1964–1965, an estimated 12.5 million rubella virus infections resulted in 11,250 therapeutic or spontaneous abortions, 2,100 neonatal deaths, and 20,000 infants born with CRS. In 2004, after implementation of a universal vaccination program, elimination of endemic rubella virus transmission was documented in the United States; evidence also suggests that endemic rubella has been eliminated in the entire World Health Organization (WHO) Region of the Americas. However, rubella virus continues to circulate elsewhere in the world, especially in regions where rubella vaccination programs have not been established (e.g. the African Region), placing the United States at risk for imported cases of rubella and CRS. During 2004–2012, 79 cases of rubella and six cases of CRS were reported in the United States (Figure); all of the cases were import-associated or from unknown sources. Of the three cases of CRS that occurred in 2012, conditions included cardiac defects, cataracts, hearing impairment, and pericardial effusion in one infant; patent ductus arteriosus, cardiomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and pneumonitis in a second infant; and cataracts, thrombocytopenia, and cardiac defects in a third infant. All three mothers had been in Africa early in their pregnancies. While rubella remains endemic elsewhere in the world, imported CRS will continue to be a public health concern in the United States.

Rubella is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects. Although rubella virus infection usually causes a mild febrile rash illness in children and adults, infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or a constellation of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).

The Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011–2020 (GVAP) includes a target to achieve elimination of rubella in at least five of the six WHO regions by 2020. This report on the progress toward rubella and CRS control and elimination updates the 2017 report, summarizing global progress toward the control and elimination of rubella and CRS from 2000 (the initiation of accelerated measles control activities) and 2012 (the initiation of accelerated rubella control activities) to 2018 (the most recent data) using WHO immunization and surveillance data. Among WHO Member States, * the number with RCV in their immunization schedules has increased from 99 (52% of 191) in 2000 to 168 (87% of 194) in 2018 †; 69% of the world's infants were vaccinated against rubella in 2018. Rubella elimination has been verified in 81 (42%) countries. To make further progress to control and eliminate rubella, and to reduce the equity gap, introduction of RCV in all countries is important. Likewise, countries that have introduced RCV can achieve and maintain elimination with high vaccination coverage and surveillance for rubella and CRS. The two WHO regions that have not established an elimination goal (African [AFR] and Eastern Mediterranean [EMR]) should consider establishing a goal. §

### Pregnancy and infection: using disease pathogenesis to inform vaccine strategy [^114Nv9r6]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

Vaccination against congenital infections

Developing fetuses are extremely vulnerable to both infectious and noninfectious insults. Certain infectious agents that are often clinically silent in healthy adults can cause severe birth defects if they breach the placental barrier during critical developmental periods during pregnancy. An increasing number of pathogens are being recognized for causing congenital disease, and what was originally designated as the TORCH complex (Toxoplasma gondii, "other", Rubella virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes Simplex virus) is now expanded to include other infectious agents including Zika virus. Development of congenital disease can depend on the timing of infection during gestation, the infectious burden, and the pathogenesis in the fetus. The congenital syndrome for each pathogen is characterized by a variety of different developmental abnormalities, and commonly impact hearing, vision, and central nervous system function. For many congenital infections, the timing of infection during gestation determines the relative risk to the fetus and dictates the spectrum of disease that results. For example, while infection with rubella virus during the first 9 weeks of gestation is associated with an 85% risk of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), this is reduced to a 52% risk between 9–12 weeks, and minimal risk for infections occurring after 16 weeks of gestation. In contrast, the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis has been demonstrated to be highest during third trimester pregnancy, which is hypothesized to be due to differential expression of placental toll-like receptors, including TLR6, within first compared with third trimester trophoblast cells. Similarly, maternal infection with Listeria monocytogenes is typically associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes during the third trimester, though infection during the first trimester in nonhuman primates also leads to rapid fetal demise.
