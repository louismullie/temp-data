## Question

Krukenberg Tumor of the Ovary is an example of: a) Lymphatic Spread b) Vascular Spread c) Transcolomic Spread
78d) Intraductal Spread e) Transluminal Spread

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which type of metastatic spread a Krukenberg tumor of the ovary is an example of, with options including lymphatic spread, vascular (hematogenous) spread, transcoelomic spread, intraductal spread, and transluminal spread. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and histology of Krukenberg tumors. Then, I should verify the anatomic pathways of spread from gastrointestinal primaries to the ovaries. Next, I will weigh the evidence for transcoelomic versus lymphatic and hematogenous routes. After that, I need to check whether intraductal or transluminal spread are plausible or recognized mechanisms for ovarian metastasis. Finally, I will synthesize and confirm the most accurate answer with supporting references [^115PiVqm] [^115JidYk].

> Let me first confirm the definition and histology so I don't anchor on a misleading premise. Krukenberg tumors are metastatic adenocarcinomas to the ovary, classically from the stomach, characterized by abundant signet ring cells within a cellular ovarian stroma; they are a subtype of ovarian metastases rather than primary ovarian tumors, which already hints that their spread pattern should mirror gastrointestinal metastatic biology rather than primary ovarian carcinogenesis [^115PiVqm] [^112j3J4f].

> Wait, let me verify the anatomic context and plausible routes. The ovaries are intraperitoneal organs bathed by peritoneal fluid, and gastrointestinal primaries can shed cells into the peritoneal cavity; peritoneal dissemination is a well-established pathway for GI cancers, with ovarian involvement occurring via transcoelomic spread along ascitic flow patterns to peritoneal surfaces including the ovaries, which fits the observed distribution of Krukenberg tumors and their frequent bilaterality [^113dwFWG] [^11193xaL].

> I will now examine the evidence for transcoelomic spread as the primary mechanism. Multiple authoritative sources describe transcoelomic (intraperitoneal) dissemination as the dominant route for epithelial ovarian cancer and for GI cancers spreading within the peritoneal cavity, with cells detaching, surviving in ascites, and implanting on peritoneal surfaces including the ovaries; this mechanistic framework directly applies to Krukenberg tumors arising from GI primaries and explains their peritoneal distribution and surface involvement [^115JidYk] [^114WF9Q2] [^113dwFWG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review whether lymphatic spread could be the main driver instead. Some genomic and clinicopathologic studies suggest a lymphatic component in ovarian metastases from gastric cancer, noting lymphovascular invasion and cortical involvement, and even propose that ovarian metastases might represent a distinct metastatic pattern; however, these data do not overturn the broader consensus that transcoelomic spread is the predominant route, and they likely reflect heterogeneity across primary sites and cases rather than replacing transcoelomic dissemination as the principal mechanism in Krukenberg tumors [^113CViC3] [^114TYTYD].

> Let me consider hematogenous spread next. While hematogenous metastases to the ovary do occur in some cancers, Krukenberg tumors classically arise from GI primaries where peritoneal seeding is far more characteristic; moreover, the clinical and pathologic phenotype of Krukenberg tumors — bilateral, often surface-involved, and embedded in ovarian stroma — aligns more closely with transcoelomic implantation than with embolic hematogenous colonization, so hematogenous spread is not the best answer here [^113dwFWG] [^11193xaL].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about intraductal or transluminal spread; do these even make sense for ovarian metastasis? Intraductal spread pertains to ductal systems (e.g., breast or biliary ducts), and transluminal spread is not a standard descriptor for ovarian metastatic pathways; neither mechanism maps to the peritoneal cavity dynamics that govern how signet ring cells from a gastric or colorectal primary reach the ovary, so these options are not appropriate in this context [^112aJXsF].

> Let me synthesize and double-check consistency with imaging and pathology. Krukenberg tumors frequently show bilateral ovarian involvement with solid and cystic components and surface or cortical involvement, often accompanied by ascites and peritoneal disease — findings that reinforce a model of peritoneal fluid–medied dissemination and implantation rather than purely lymphatic or hematogenous dissemination; this clinico-radiologic pattern coheres with transcoelomic spread as the primary mechanism [^115PiVqm] [^113dwFWG] [^117VRBi2].

> Conclusion: I should confirm the answer clearly. Krukenberg tumors of the ovary are best characterized as an example of transcoelomic spread, reflecting intraperitoneal dissemination of gastrointestinal carcinoma cells via peritoneal fluid to implant on ovarian surfaces, even as adjunct lymphatic or hematogenous contributions may occur in select cases [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **c) Transcoelomic spread**. Krukenberg tumors are **ovarian metastases** from gastrointestinal primaries — most often gastric or colorectal cancers — and spread via **peritoneal seeding** of tumor cells through the peritoneal cavity [^111V2UHF] [^112aJXsF]. This transcoelomic route explains their frequent bilaterality, surface involvement, and association with ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis [^112aJXsF] [^11193xaL] [^117VRBi2]. Lymphatic and hematogenous spread can occur but are **not the primary mechanisms** for Krukenberg tumors [^112aJXsF].

---

## Pathogenesis and spread of Krukenberg tumor

Krukenberg tumors are characterized by **signet ring cells** [^115PiVqm] and typically arise from gastrointestinal primaries, especially the stomach and colon [^115PiVqm]. The **primary mechanism of spread** is transcoelomic dissemination, whereby tumor cells detach from the primary site, enter the peritoneal cavity, and are transported by peritoneal fluid to implant on ovarian surfaces [^115JidYk] [^114WF9Q2].

---

### Transcoelomic spread (option c)

- **Mechanism**: Tumor cells shed into the peritoneal cavity and are carried by peritoneal fluid to distant peritoneal surfaces, including the ovaries [^113dwFWG].

- **Clinical evidence**: Krukenberg tumors are frequently bilateral and show surface involvement with ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis, consistent with transcoelomic spread [^112aJXsF] [^117VRBi2].

- **Anatomical basis**: The ovaries are intraperitoneal and exposed to peritoneal fluid, facilitating implantation and growth of metastatic cells [^notfound].

---

### Lymphatic spread (option a)

Lymphatic spread is a recognized route for many cancers, but for Krukenberg tumors it is **not the primary mechanism** [^113CViC3]. Lymphatic involvement may occur secondarily, but the predominant pattern is peritoneal dissemination [^notfound].

---

### Vascular (hematogenous) spread (option b)

Hematogenous spread is **less common** as a primary route for Krukenberg tumors. Although some ovarian metastases may arise via the bloodstream, this is not the characteristic pattern for Krukenberg tumors [^113CViC3].

---

### Intraductal and transluminal spread (options d and e)

Intraductal and transluminal spread are **not applicable** to Krukenberg tumors. These terms refer to spread within ductal or luminal structures, which do not apply to ovarian metastases.

---

## Clinical implications of transcoelomic spread

Understanding transcoelomic spread is **clinically significant** because it explains:

- **Bilaterality**: Frequent bilateral ovarian involvement due to peritoneal fluid distribution [^112aJXsF].

- **Ascites**: Common association with malignant ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis [^114WF9Q2].

- **Prognosis**: Poor prognosis due to extensive peritoneal involvement and difficulty achieving complete cytoreduction [^116TW1wY].

---

## Diagnostic and therapeutic considerations

Diagnosis relies on **imaging** (ultrasound, CT, MRI) to identify bilateral ovarian masses with solid components, ascites, and peritoneal involvement [^117VRBi2] [^114VQNF4]. Management typically involves **cytoreductive surgery** with peritoneal stripping and oophorectomy, followed by chemotherapy [^115Rbuyd] [^117GgBjt].

---

Krukenberg tumors **primarily spread via transcoelomic dissemination**, with peritoneal seeding of tumor cells from gastrointestinal primaries to the ovaries [^112aJXsF]. This mechanism accounts for their characteristic bilateral, surface-involved presentation with ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis [^117VRBi2].

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this case-based article is to discuss the pathophysiologic findings, common pathways of spread, and imaging features associated with Krukenberg tumors. CONCLUSION. Not all ovarian metastases are Krukenberg tumors. Krukenberg tumors are the most common subtype of ovarian metastases, and they are histologically characterized by signet ring cell mucinous features. Common primary tumor sites include the stomach or colon. Although often difficult, distinguishing between Krukenberg tumors and primary ovarian malignancy on imaging is important because of management and prognostic implications.

### An in-depth look at krukenberg tumor: an overview [^112j3J4f]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Krukenberg tumor is an uncommon metastatic tumor of the ovary. This article provides an overview of the major pathologic manifestations of Krukenberg tumor, patient characteristics, clinical and laboratory features of the disease, prognostic factors, and current knowledge about its pathogenesis. Pathologists have to be familiar with the diagnostic histopathologic features of the tumor and its principal differential diagnoses. Awareness of the diagnostic manifestations of the tumor leads to the correct diagnosis and prevents tumor misclassification, thus avoiding improper clinical management. The article also addresses the potential clinical utility of serum CA 125 in patients with Krukenberg tumors. Prognosis of Krukenberg tumor is still very poor but our review of the literature reveals several factors that appear to have an impact on survival. There is no established treatment for Krukenberg tumors. A national registry and prospective studies are needed to set a therapeutic approach for Krukenberg tumors in the hope of improving the survival rate.

### Prognostic factors of krukenberg's tumor [^112oyzWU]. Gynecologic Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine prognostic factors of metachronous Krukenberg's tumors of gastric origin, thereby helping to establish a therapeutic plan for this rare entity.

Methods

Thirty-four female patients who underwent curative resection of gastric carcinoma from 1987 through 1996 and subsequently developed Krukenberg's tumors were identified. The covariates used for survival analysis were patient age at the time of ovarian relapse (categorized as < 50 years or ≥ 50 years), size of Krukenberg's tumor (categorized as ≤ 5, 5–10, or > 10 cm), initial AJCC stage of gastric carcinoma, relapse-free interval (categorized as < 1, 1–2, or ≥ 2 years), extent of recurrent disease, and the presence of gross residual disease after treatment for Krukenberg's tumors. The influence of all covariates on the survival period was assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

At a median follow-up of 32.3 months (range, 2.2–83.1), the median survival period of 34 study patients was estimated to be 7.7 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 5.8–9.6) after the diagnosis of metachronous Krukenberg's tumor. Cox-model-based survival analysis demonstrated that the absence of residual disease after treatment and limited disease extent were favorable prognostic factors. The median survival period of patients without gross residual disease was longer (10.9 months (95% CI, 4.6–17.1)) than that of patients with gross residual disease (7.5 months (95% CI, 6.6–8.3)) [P = 0.036]. Median survival periods according to the extent of metastasis were 10.9 months (95% CI, 0–23.0) for patients with disease confined to the ovaries, 13.1 months (95% CI, 5.9–20.3) for patients with disease confined to the pelvis, 7.5 months (95% CI, 6.8–8.1) for patients with intraabdominal disease, and 3.6 months (95% CI, 3.4–3.7) for patients with disease spread outside the abdomen and pelvis [P = 0.003]. In contrast, patient age, size of ovarian tumor, initial stage of gastric adenocarcinoma, and relapse-free interval were not prognostic indicators for survival after the development of ovarian metastases.

Conclusion

The absence of residual disease after treatment and limited disease extent were favorable prognostic factors of metachronous Krukenberg's tumors of stomach origin. Our data suggest that resection might have a role in the management of Krukenberg's tumors of stomach origin if it could render patients free of gross residual disease.

### Genomic and evolutionary characteristics of metastatic gastric cancer by routes [^113CViC3]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

The OVM, also called the Krukenberg tumor, is a unique pattern of cancer metastasis that occurs in women. It originates mainly from GC but also from various primary tumors including colorectal and breast cancer. The mechanism of how extra-ovarian tumors cause ovarian metastasis remains unclear; however, the frequent association of lymphovascular invasion with LN metastasis and the tumor involves the cortex of ovary rather than its surface, implying that OVM is a kind of lymphatic spread. Signet ring cell carcinoma, a main cell type of OVM, is a well-known cause of peritoneal metastasis that is a common concomitant metastasis to OVM in GC, suggesting it is a phenotype of peritoneal metastasis. The present results showed that the genomic distance of OVM was close to that of peritoneal metastasis, while the migration history showed that the OVM was from the primary tumor directly rather than via peritoneal or LN metastasis. In another study, GC patients with only OVM had better prognosis when compared to patients with other types of metastases. Therefore, OVM could have a pattern of peritoneal metastasis or an independent and distinctive metastatic pattern. Furthermore, the OVM of breast cancer seemed to be a hematogenous metastasis as chances of direct exposure of breast cancer cells to ovary are nil; this indicates that the mechanism of OVM could differ from that of primary tumor. Further genomic studies focusing on OVM from various primary cancer types will provide more clues to better understand its mechanisms.

### Signet ring stromal cell tumor: a legitimate (benign) mimic of krukenberg tumor [^116RjPHr]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Signet ring stromal cell tumor is a rare, benign ovarian neoplasm thought to arise from ovarian stromal cells. The pathophysiology of these tumors is poorly understood. They present in women in a wide age range, often with nonspecific symptoms including lower abdominal or pelvic pain. Their morphologic appearance raises a critical differential diagnosis of Krukenberg tumor, an aggressive malignancy with significant implications for patient management. For this reason, it is important for the pathologist to be aware of signet ring stromal cell tumor and its differentiating features, including useful histochemical and immunohistochemical ancillary tests. These tumors are curable with surgical excision, and there have been no recurrences or metastases among reported cases.

### Krukenberg tumors of gastric origin: the rationale of surgical resection and perioperative treatments in a multicenter Western experience [^117GgBjt]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In case of Krukenberg tumor (KT) of gastric origin it is controversial and debated whether radical surgery in case of synchronous KT or metastasectomy in case of metachronous ones is associated with additional benefits. Role of perioperative treatments is unclear.

Methods

Among 2515 female patients who were diagnosed with gastric cancer between January 1990 and December 2012 from 9 Italian centers, 63 presented simultaneously or developed KT as recurrence.

Results

Thirty patients presented with synchronous KT, while 33 developed metachronous ovarian metastases during follow-up. The differences between the two groups were analyzed and compared. The median age of 63 patients was 48.0 years (range 31–71). Resection was possible in 53 patients (20 synchronous and 33 metachronous). Twelve patients in the synchronous group and 15 patients of the metachronous group underwent hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy after resection of KT. All of them underwent adjuvant chemotherapy after KT resection. The median survival for all population was 23 months (95% confidence interval, 7–39 months). The median survival time in the metachronous group was 36 months, which was significantly longer than that in the synchronous group, 17 months, p < 0.0001.

Conclusions

KT remains a clinical challenge for gastric cancer therapy. The extent of disease and feasibility of removal of the metastatic lesion must be carefully evaluated prior to surgery to define the patients group who could benefit most from a resection associated with perioperative treatments.

Nonepithelial cancers, although uncommon, are extremely important. These include granulosa cell tumors, germ cell tumors, sarcomas, and lymphomas. They are discussed below as separate entities. Metastatic neoplasms to the ovary, such as tumors arising in the breast, lower reproductive tract sites (cervix or uterine carcinomas) and gastrointestinal tract (signet ring cell [Krukenberg] carcinomas, low grade appendiceal or pancreaticobiliary mucinous tumors and other neoplasms) are graded and staged in accordance with their respective sites of origin.

### Genomic and evolutionary characteristics of metastatic gastric cancer by routes [^114TYTYD]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cancer metastasis is the ultimate cause of death in cancer patients; thus, it is crucial that we understand its clinical and biological characteristics. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have improved our understanding of cancer at the genomic level, and the molecular characteristics of primary tumors have been thoroughly evaluated, which has led to the current levels of precision in oncology. Further studies on metastatic cancers have identified unique alterations in metastatic tumors that could be possible targets to improve patient survival, and genomic alterations driving cancer metastasis were found to be different based on the type of primary tumor.

Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common and lethal cancers in the world. Since the stomach is supplied with blood by five main vessels, (the right and left gastric, the right and left gastro-epiploic, and short gastric arteries) the venous and lymphatic drainage of the stomach is complicated. In addition, cancer cells can spread to the peritoneal space through the outer layer of the stomach. These anatomical characteristics of the stomach make the pattern of GC metastasis distinctive from that of other cancer types; peritoneal metastasis is the most common, ovarian metastasis (also called Krukenberg tumor) mainly develops from GC, and the extent and location of lymph node (LN) metastasis is difficult to predict (Fig. 1a). In the clinical practice, LNs around the stomach are classified using a tier system based on their anatomical locations: perigastric (D1), extra-perigastric (D2), and distant (D4 level). It is assumed that LN metastasis is sequential from proximal (D1) to distal (D2/D4).

### Pictorial essay: MRI evaluation of endometriosis-associated neoplasms [^111V2UHF]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Pitfalls

The main pitfalls at MRI are as follows:
Clot dark spot sign: the presence of a well-defined, markedly hypointense foci within an ovarian cyst on T2-weighted images, corresponding to a blood clot. This sign has a high specificity and is useful for differentiating endometriomas from hemorrhagic cysts in which it is usually absent (Fig. 8 and Additional file 1: Fig. S6).
Enhanced endocystic nodules, including the following: ➔ Polypoid endometriosis (Fig. 9), which affects more commonly post-menopausal women with hormone replacement therapy. Similar to the uterine endometrium, it appears as a hyperintense T2-weighted polypoid nodule with hypointense peripheric rim, contrast enhancement pattern mirroring the enhancement of the uterine endometrium, and classically lack of diffusion restriction. ➔ Cystadenofibroma frequently appears as a multiseptated predominantly cystic mass with variable amounts of solid nodular components. The individual locules may contain hemorrhage or protein content which will modify the T1/T2 intensity cystic signal. The solid component typically displays marked T2 hypointensity, with no restriction in diffusion-weighted imaging (also called "dark-dark appearance") and progressive enhancement with a type I perfusion curve. ➔ Decidualized endometriomas appear exclusively in pregnant women. Mural nodules may show high signal intensity on DWI 800 due to T2 shine-through effect, but not on higher b values, which can help distinguish decidualized endometriomas from ovarian cancers.
Ovarian metastases in patients with endometriosis are frequently bilateral. Krukenberg's tumors are the most common and originate from a primary adenocarcinoma. In order of frequency, the primary tumor site is the stomach, colon-rectum, appendix, pancreaticobiliary tract, contralateral ovary, endometrium (Fig. 10), breast, or lung. Krukenberg's tumors are classically mixt lesions with solid components displaying low signal on T1- and T2-weighted sequences, diffusion restriction, and enhancement, associated to cystic areas with T2 hyperintensity and no enhancement. Other cancers can also spread to the ovaries, including melanoma or lymphoma. At US, the "lead vessel" sign corresponding to a main peripheral vessel penetrating within the central part of the ovarian mass with a tree-shaped morphology can help to distinguish metastatic from the primary ovarian lesion in which this sign is absent.
Other ovarian lesions displaying spontaneous high signal intensity T1-weighted: fat-containing lesions (dermoid cysts), protein-mucinous-containing lesions (mucinous epithelial tumor, abscesses, struma ovarii) or hemorrhagic lesions (functional hemorrhagic cyst, ovarian hematoma complicating adnexal torsion) should also be considered as differential diagnoses.
Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare locally aggressive fibroblastic neoplasm and represents the main differential diagnosis of abdominal wall endometriosis in women with a history of cesarean section. The MRI features depend on its composition but the most commonly observed pattern is iso- or high signal intensity on T2 images, with moderate to intense enhancement and typical low-intensity, non-enhancing linear bands corresponding to dense collagenous stroma.

### Primary and secondary tumors of the peritoneum: key imaging features and differential diagnosis with surgical and pathological correlation [^117VRBi2]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary and recurrent gastric cancers tend to present miliary dissemination, with tiny nodules difficult to detect on CT, PET/CT or MRI. In this case, it is important to look for indirect signs of peritoneal dissemination, like ascites or subtle stranding of the mesenteric fat. Both colorectal and gastric cancers may produce ovarian metastases known as Krukenberg tumors, which must be differentiated from primary ovarian carcinomas (Fig. 15).

Fig. 15
Krukenberg tumors and peritoneal carcinomatosis secondary to a diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells, in a 32-year-old woman with non-specific abdominal discomfort. First, an abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed two voluminous solid masses in the lower half of the abdomen (a, b) and demonstrated vascularity within them by color Doppler (c). Axial (d–f) and coronal (g) CT images with intravenous contrast in the portal phase confirmed the presence of two large solid masses of probable adnexal origin (white asterisks), associated with ascitic fluid (blue arrows) and stranding of the omental fat (yellow arrows) suspicious of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Note also the presence of an ill-defined thickening of the gastric wall in the subcardial region, with extension toward the gastrohepatic ligament, suggestive of a primary gastric malignancy (d, red arrows). Subsequently, gastroscopy with biopsy was performed, confirming the diagnosis of a gastric adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells. Palliative debulking surgery with bilateral oophorectomy was decided after multidisciplinary discussion of the case. h Intraoperative view of the pelvis shows the left adnexal mass (white asterisk) and the inferior pole of the right adnexal mass (white arrow), which extends superiorly toward the upper abdomen

(d) Axial contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted image demonstrates enhancement of the mass (white arrow)

Ovarian metastasis account for about 5% of malignant ovarian tumours, and there is a potential risk of misjudgment if the primary tumour is not known. Stomach, colon, breast, lung and contralateral ovary are the most frequent neoplasms to metastasize to the ovaries. These tumours can spread to the ovaries by direct invasion, transcoelomic dissemination, hematogeneous and lymphatic spread. Krukenberg tumours are defined as metastatic lesions to the ovary from a gastrointestinal cancer and characterized by mucin-producing signet-ring cells (Fig. 9). Ovarian metastasis are more often bilateral with a cystic and solid or a predominant solid morphological appearance. An important enhancement of the cystic wall and of the solid component is usually seen after gadolinium administration. It is very difficult to distinguish between primary and secondary ovarian malignancy on diagnostic imaging, mostly because of the absence of typical features helping the differential diagnosis.

### Infiltrative pattern of metastatic invasive lobular breast carcinoma in the abdomen: a pictorial review [^113JXvQG]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

When peritoneal nodules and ovarian masses are seen in the abdomen, it can be challenging to distinguish metastatic breast cancer from metastatic ovarian cancer. This problem is compounded by the fact that ILC has a high incidence of metastasizing to the ovaries (up to 13%) and some breast cancer patients are at increased risk of developing primary ovarian cancer, such as patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Bilateral solid ovarian tumors or Krukenberg tumors (Fig. 10) favor metastatic breast cancer infiltration of the ovaries, as primary ovarian malignancy tends to have a mixture of solid and cystic components. In a patient with known ILC and imaging findings of peritoneal nodules and solid ovarian masses, metastatic ILC and metastatic ovarian cancer are important differentials for the radiologist to raise.

Fig. 10

Coronal T2-weighted MR image of the pelvis shows bilateral, solid, ovarian masses with heterogeneous low T2-weighted signal (arrowheads), suggestive of fibrous, desmoplastic components. There is an ovarian cyst adjacent to the right ovarian mass. The solid appearance of the masses and low T2-weighted signal favor Krukenberg tumors over primary ovarian malignancy. Metastatic ILC involvement was confirmed following hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy

### Survival benefit of metastasectomy for krukenberg tumors from gastric cancer [^115Rbuyd]. Gynecologic Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

An optimal treatment strategy for ovarian metastases of gastric cancer has not been clearly established. The aim of this study was to examine the role of a metastasectomy in the management of metachronous Krukenberg tumors after curative surgery for gastric cancer.

Methods

Among 1235 female patients who had undergone a curative gastric resection for stomach cancer between 1987 and 1998, 54 (4.4%) developed Krukenberg tumors as a first recurrence without evidence of a distant metastasis. Of these 54 patients, 33 underwent a metastasectomy while 21 did not. The survival duration between the two groups was analyzed and compared.

Results

The clinicopathological features of Krukenberg tumors as well as those of the primary cancers in the two groups were similar. All 33 patients in the resection group underwent subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy, including the 7 who received intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The 21 patients in the non-resection group were managed by either systemic chemotherapy (n = 16) or supportive care (n = 5) alone. The median survival duration of all the patients was 9 months (95% confidence interval, 3–15 months). The median survival time in the resection group was 17 months (95% confidence interval, 10–24 months), which was significantly longer than that in the non-resection group, 3 months (95% confidence interval, 2–4 months) (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Our results suggest that a metastasectomy was associated with an improved survival in patients with metachronous Krukenberg tumors from gastric cancer. These data offer a strong argument in favor of performing metastasectomy for Krukenberg tumors in the absence of an obvious distant metastasis.

### Ovarian cancer metastasis: looking beyond the surface [^112bjbEX]. Cancer Cell (2024). Medium credibility.

Historically, ovarian cancer (OC) was thought to metastasize by surface-to-surface spread, but recent developments have yielded a new understanding of the paths of metastatic spread. Given the histologic and molecular heterogeneity of OC, we will focus on high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). Here, we provide a critical and more holistic view of the evidence supporting various routes of metastasis, including peritoneal, hematogenous, lymphatic, and nerve-related. Understanding the underlying mechanisms is necessary to improve treatment strategies for this challenging disease.

Surface epithelial-stromal tumours account for 65% of all ovarian tumours and represent 85% of ovarian malignancies. In this section, we describe serous cystadenocarcinoma, mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, endometrioid tumours and clear cell tumours, whereas transitional cell (Brenner) tumours will be described in the next one because of their predominantly solid appearance.

Serous cystadenocarcinoma is the most common, and is responsible for about 40% of malignant ovarian neoplasms, whereas mucinous cystadenocarcinoma is less common and accounts for about 10% of ovarian malignancies. These tumours are seen as complex multilocular masses, usually with thick and irregular walls, septations, solid components and papillary projections of low signal intensity on T2-weighted images with contrast enhancement after gadolinium administration (Figs. 10 and 11). The serous fluid of the cystic components has low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. In some cases of serous cystadenocarcinoma there are psammomatos calcifications, better seen on CT scan because of their high attenuation. Signal intensity of mucinous content is variable depending on mucin concentration. These tumours can be very large, even greater than 12–15 cm. Serous cystadenocarcinoma is more frequently bilateral than mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. They may be responsible for peritoneal invasion leading to peritoneal carcinomatosis (Fig. 12).

### Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: 2025 update [^111sLTrt]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Similar to endometrial endometrioid cancers, endometrioid ovarian cancers can be associated with inactivating mutations of PTEN and activation of PI3 kinase signaling as well as to mutations in CTNNB1 (beta‐catenin), PIK3CA, and ARID1A. TP53 mutated endometrioid cancers are more aggressive with a poor prognosis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular classification of endometrial cancercan also be used for endometrioid ovarian cancers.

Serous carcinomas are the most common cell types in both the ovary and fallopian tube. More than 90% of fallopian tube carcinomas are HGSCs. Other cell types have been reported but are rare. Serous carcinomas are graded in a two‐grade system befitting their biology. HGSCs, including both classic appearing and those with solid, endometrioid‐like, and transitional (SET) features, have a high frequency of mutations in TP53. The "moderately differentiated" serous carcinoma is no longer used as the vast majority have mutations in TP53 and are considered high‐grade tumors. LGSCs are often associated with borderline or atypical proliferative serous tumors and associated with mutations in the mitogen‐activated protein (MAP) kinase gene pathway in approximately 50% of cases, including BRAF and KRAS mutations, and are wild‐type TP53.

Non‐epithelial cancers, although uncommon, are extremely important. These include granulosa cell tumors, germ cell tumors, sarcomas, and lymphomas. They are discussed below as separate entities. Metastatic neoplasms to the ovary, such as tumors arising in the breast, lower reproductive tract sites (cervix or uterine carcinomas), and gastrointestinal tract (signet ring cell [Krukenberg] carcinomas, low‐grade appendiceal or pancreaticobiliary mucinous tumors, and other neoplasms) are graded and staged in accordance with their respective sites of origin.

### Cellular origins of mucinous ovarian carcinoma [^111i6Um9]. The Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

One of the important issues in the diagnosis of MOC, particularly in higher‐stage (III/IV) disease, can be the misclassification of primary disease versus metastases that involve the ovaries but have arisen from other sites. The most common primary mucinous tumours that metastasise to the ovary include the lower gastrointestinal tract (colon/appendix; ~45%), upper gastrointestinal tract (pancreas/stomach/biliary; 20%), and uterus (cervix/endometrium; 18%). Sometimes, the ovarian tumour is the initial presentation. In this setting, characteristics of the tumour presentation can aid diagnosis. Stage I, primary MOC is more likely to have a tumour size greater than 10 cm (mean 20 cm) and show unilateral involvement (79%), whereas metastases to the ovary from elsewhere tend to be smaller (mean 7–10.6 cm), present in both ovaries, and display a nodular infiltrative growth pattern with ovarian surface involvement. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical guidelines suggest routine abdominal imaging and upper and lower endoscopy to rule out a gastrointestinal primary as well as measuring CEA and CA19‐9 levels. An observation that strongly favours a primary MOC is an associated teratoma, while signet ring cells (Krukenberg tumour) strongly favour a gastrointestinal (usually gastric) origin.

Immunohistochemical panels can also aid the diagnosis of primary compared to metastatic MOC. Markers that most efficiently distinguish ovarian from lower gastrointestinal metastases (with an accuracy of 95%) are CK7 and SATB2. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas are especially challenging, as they can mimic primary MOC when they metastasise to the ovaries and may even contain benign and borderline‐appearing areas. Ancillary IHC markers such as CK17 and SMAD4 have shown some promise in distinguishing ovarian mucinous tumours from metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas; however, the accuracy as individual markers remains limited, and further research into a marker panel is required. With growing pathological and clinical efforts, the misclassification rate of stage III/IV MOC has decreased significantly in recent years, enabling a more accurate study of the disease while facing the challenge of the increasing rarity of clinical trials. Furthermore, one has to keep in mind that the prognosis of stage III/IV MOC is similarly dismal compared to metastases to the ovary.

### Burkitts's lymphoma – an atypical presentation [^1129k2Di]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pediatric report of Burkitt's lymphoma mimicking Krukenberg tumor with synchronous involvement of stomach and ovary, even though ovarian or gastric implants of Burkitt´s lymphoma are a common finding. Similar reports have only been described in adult female patients, where gastric adenocarcinoma was the underlying disease.

Krukenberg tumor is generally defined as an ovarian carcinoma that contains a significant component of mucin-filled signet-ring cells typically lying within a cellular stroma derived from the ovarian stroma. It refers to a malignancy with metastasis to other organs, classically the gastrointestinal tract. Today, almost all Krukenberg tumors are thought to be metastatic signet-ring cell carcinoma in the ovary of gastric origin, although rare examples have been interpreted as primary.

Lymphomas represent 26% of all cancers in 15–29 year olds in Europe and the United States. In the 15–19 year-old group, diffuse large B-cell Lymphomas account for the largest proportion of NHL cases (37%) followed by BL (21%).

Patients with gastrointestinal BL may present with abdominal pain or distension, gastrointestinal bleeding or intestinal obstruction resulting from direct compression of the lumen by an expanding mass or by an intussusception triggered by the intraluminal projection of the tumor mass. These acute abdominal symptoms often lead to emergency laparotomies before a diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma can be made.

Spontaneous intestinal perforation is an uncommon complication of BL, even though previously reported in children. Possible explanations for spontaneous gastrointestinal perforation are tumor necrosis, immune suppression and protein malnutrition. Tumor necrosis is probably the most likely reason as perforation usually occurs during or after the first cycle of intensive chemotherapy. Epigastric pain is the first and most common symptom of gastric perforation. A high degree of suspicion should be present at all times, as early diagnosis and emergency surgery are crucial in saving life in the setting of such a complication.

Burkitt's and B-cell lymphomas in childhood have an excellent overall prognosis regardless of the location (except for primary central nervous system lymphoma), especially when treated with contemporary chemotherapy protocols.

Burkitt lymphoma has to be considered as differential diagnosis in adolescent girls presenting with apparent Krukenberg tumors. Prognosis remains excellent with precise histological and molecular diagnosis, early treatment and careful monitoring and prevention of tumor lysis.

### Two concurrent cancers in a 19-year-old patient: yolk sac ovarian tumor and metastatic gastrointestinal tract malignancy-case report [^116CB6K1]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Two concurrent malignancies present in a young person is an extremely rare condition. Diagnoses of gastric cancer primarily concern older patients. There are very few reports of concomitant Krukenberg tumor and germ-cell ovarian malignancy.

Case

A 19-year-old girl was admitted to the gynecologic oncology department with symptoms of advanced malignancy. Radiological imaging revealed disseminated neoplastic disease with bulky adnexal tumors. Cytoreductive surgery was performed, achieving no visible disease (T = 0 cm). The final pathology report confirmed metastatic mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC) in both ovaries, originating from the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, the primary germ cell yolk sac tumor was found in the left ovary.

Conclusion

In cases of concomitant gastric and ovarian tumors, metastatic disease (Krukenberg tumor) should be considered in the differential diagnosis. This concerns even adolescent patients. In particular cases, including tumors with germ cell components, primary debulking surgery is crucial for prognosis.

### Metastatic ovarian tumors: a review of 64 cases [^114YHfGW]. Gynecologic Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to review cases of metastatic ovarian tumor with respect to their clinical features.

Methods

Sixty-four patients with pathologically confirmed metastatic ovarian carcinoma, who were treated between 1978 and 2002 at Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases (OMCC), were reviewed and the clinical features examined.

Results

We found that metastatic tumors accounted for 21.1% (64/304) of malignant ovarian tumors. Of 64 metastatic ovarian tumors, 26 originated from gynecologic organs, and 38, from nongynecologic organs. Gynecologic primary sites were the uterine body (23%), uterine cervix (14%), and fallopian tube (3%). Eight of nine cervical cancers with ovarian metastases were adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix metastasized to the ovaries more frequently than squamous cell carcinoma (5.6% vs 0.1%, respectively; P < 0.01). Among 38 cases of metastatic ovarian tumors from nongynecologic organs, Krukenberg tumors, pathologically characterized by the presence of typical signet-ring cells, were found in 11 patients (29%). Most (8/11) had originated in the stomach. Half (19/38) were preoperatively diagnosed as metastases. The 5-year survival rate after resection of metastatic ovarian tumors from gynecologic organs was significantly higher than the rate after resection of such tumors from nongynecologic organs (47% vs 19%, respectively; P = 0.026).

Conclusions

Metastatic ovarian tumors are likely to be relatively common in Japan because of the high incidence of gastric cancer. In cases of pelvic tumor, metastatic ovarian tumor should always be included in the differential diagnoses. As the 5-year survival after resection of metastatic ovarian tumor is 19%, even for tumors from nongynecologic organs, it seems worthwhile to consider tumorectomy as the second cytoreduction.

### ESR bridges: imaging and treatment of ovarian cancer-a multidisciplinary view [^112qNdUL]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ovarian cancer — What is the clinical need to be addressed?

Multidisciplinary working is the cornerstone for optimal management of ovarian cancer with radiological assessment crucial throughout the patient pathway. Ovarian cancer is a term that encompasses pathologically distinct malignancies, all of which can have different patterns of spread and responses to treatment. The most common type of ovarian cancer arises from the epithelial cells of the fallopian tubes and ovaries (epithelial ovarian cancer, EOC); rarer subtypes and those arising from non-epithelial cells include ovarian germ cell tumours, ovarian stromal tumours and small cell carcinoma of the ovary. Management of all ovarian cancers is centred around combining surgical approaches with systemic anti-cancer treatment. Increased understanding of the biology and genomic make-up of ovarian cancer together with enhanced surgical techniques and more targeted treatments has led to paradigm shifts in the way that the disease is managed. Despite these advances, EOC continues to be the most lethal gynaecological malignancy responsible for over 200,000 deaths per year worldwide. There is no effective population screening. Ovarian cancer is associated with non-specific symptoms and many women present late with advanced disease. There is an unmet need for earlier detection, novel and more targeted treatments and a better understanding of the development of treatment resistance.

What is cancer?

Under normal conditions, the cells in your body divide and grow in an orderly, controlled fashion. Cell division and growth are necessary for the human body to perform its functions and to repair itself. Cancer cells are different from normal cells because they are not able to control their own growth. The reasons for this abnormal growth are not yet fully understood.

A tumor is a mass of unhealthy cells that are dividing and growing fast and in an uncontrolled way. When a tumor invades surrounding healthy body tissue it is known as a malignant tumor. A malignant tumor can spread (metastasize) from its original location to other parts of the body.

What is carboplatin?

Carboplatin is a medicine that is used to treat cancer of the ovaries. It acts by interfering with the division of rapidly multiplying cells, particularly cancer cells.

### Metastatic spread of serous ovarian carcinoma to the bilateral breasts: a rare presentation [^114MS1bK]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Background

Management of cancer localised to the breast versus cancer metastatic to the breast is very different. For patients presenting with a new breast mass, it is, therefore, necessary to distinguish between metastatic spread to the breast and primary breast malignancies. While breast cancer represents the most common malignancy in women, metastatic spread to the breast from extramammary solid tumours is comparatively rare and carries a poorer prognosis due to a high likelihood of widely disseminated disease.

Tissue and clinicopathological data

Tissue specimens (fresh/frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples) collected from patients undergoing primary laparotomy at the Gynaecological Cancer Centre, Royal Hospital for Women, Sydney, and the Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, between 1990 and 2003 were included in this study following informed consent and approval by the appropriate hospital research ethics committee. The histological classification at diagnosis was independently confirmed by a gynaecological pathologist for all tissue specimens before inclusion in the study. Normal ovaries were obtained from patients undergoing surgery for benign gynaecological conditions or unrelated malignancies. Patients exhibiting clinical, morphological or microscopic features suggesting metastatic mucinous ovarian carcinoma rather than primary MOC, including concurrent gastrointestinal carcinomas, the presence of Pseudomyxoma peritonei/ovarii, bilateral disease, Krukenberg tumours, and advanced stage borderline tumours, were excluded from the study. The clinical and pathological details of the tissue cohort used in this study are shown in Table 1.

### FIGO stage IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer revisited [^113NMCua]. Gynecologic Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer (EOC) is the seventh most common cancer diagnosis among women worldwide and shows the highest mortality rate of all gynecologic tumors. Different histological and anatomic spread patterns as well as multiple gene-expression based studies have demonstrated that EOC is indeed a heterogeneous disease. The prognostic factors that best predict the survival in this disease include: age, performance status and patient's comorbidities at the time of diagnosis; tumor biology, histological type, amount of residual tumor after surgery and finally tumor stage as surrogate for pre-operative tumor burden and growth pattern. In the majority of patients, the disease is diagnosed in advanced stage, disseminated intra- and/or extra-abdominally. It is unclear whether this is a consequence of distinct tumor biology, absence of anatomic barriers between ovary and the abdominal cavity, delay of diagnosis and/or the lack of sufficient early detection methods. FIGO stage IV disease, defined as tumor spread outside the abdominal cavity (including malignant pleural effusion) and/or visceral metastases, will be present in 12–33% of the patients at initial diagnosis. Overall, median survival for patients with stage IV disease ranges from 15 to 29months, with an estimated 5-year survival of approximately 20%. Unfortunately, over the past decades the overall survival gain compared to stage III remains disappointing. The current review aims to summarize the current data published in the international literature concerning FIGO stage IV EOC and discusses the published evidence for the clinical management of these patients.

### New insights into ovarian cancer pathology [^1126a3Zc]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Malignant epithelial tumors (carcinomas) are the most common ovarian cancers and also the most lethal gynecological malignancies. Based on histopathology and molecular genetic alterations, ovarian carcinomas are divided into five main types [high-grade serous (70%), endometrioid (10%), clear-cell (10%), mucinous (3%), and low-grade serous carcinomas (< 5%)] that account for over 95% of cases. These types are essentially distinct diseases, as indicated by differences in epidemiological and genetic risk factors, precursor lesions, patterns of spread, and molecular events during oncogenesis, response to chemotherapy, and prognosis. For a successful specific treatment, reproducible histopathological diagnosis of the tumor cell type is critical. The five tumor types are morphologically diverse and resemble carcinomas of the uterus. Actually, recent investigations have demonstrated that a substantial number of cancers, traditionally thought to be primary ovarian tumors (particularly serous, endometrioid, and clear-cell carcinomas), originate in the fallopian tube and the endometrium and involve the ovary secondarily. This presentation summarizes recent advances in the molecular pathology which have greatly improved our understanding of the biology of ovarian carcinoma and are also relevant to patient management.

### An evolving story of the metastatic voyage of ovarian cancer cells: cellular and molecular orchestration of the adipose-rich metastatic microenvironment [^1142gq46]. Oncogene (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epithelial ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among malignancies of the female genital tract, and the past few decades have witnessed only slight improvements in survival outcomes for patients with ovarian cancer. The high mortality rate of ovarian cancer is attributed, in part, to its nonspecific symptoms, which usually appear when the cancer has progressed to an advanced stage, and the lack of effective screening strategies to detect it at an early stage. Despite ongoing efforts to organize and unify screening programs for ovarian cancer, only a limited number of women are diagnosed before the cancer spreads beyond the ovaries (stage I). In the initial stage, a large number of patients can be cured by conventional therapeutic strategies. However, despite advances in surgical techniques and intensive combination chemotherapy approaches, the survival rate substantially decreases after ovarian cancer has metastasized to pelvic organs, such as the uterus, fallopian tube, bladder, and rectum (stage II); metastasized across the pelvic cavity to abdominal organs, such as the omentum, small intestine, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes (stage III); or metastasized beyond the peritoneal cavity to distant parenchymal organs, such as the liver, and lung (stage IV). Although many patients with advanced-stage disease initially respond to a combination of taxane and platinum-based chemotherapy, some chemoresistant cancer cells can persist in metastatic sites and remain dormant, eventually causing relapse.

### Clinical characteristics of young-age onset gastric cancer in Korea [^114WJLUc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

From January 2009 to January 2015, the medical records of patients diagnosed and treated as gastric cancer in Seoul St. Mary's hospital were retrospectively reviewed. In 5 years of following, 4,333 patients were diagnosed as gastric cancer. Among these patients, 163 patients were diagnosed as young age gastric cancer, age ranging in 22 to 39 years. The other eligible criteria were as follows: (1) pathologically confirmed as adenocarcinoma by endoscopic biopsy or surgical specimen; (2) patients who regularly followed up in Seoul St. Mary's Hospital. We analyzed the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, surgical treatment option, systemic chemotherapy regimens and survival outcomes through the medical records. The Gross and microscopic pathologic findings were reviewed based on operation records and pathology reports. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Catholic University of Korea (KC15RISI0675).

Treatments

Patients who were diagnosed as early gastric cancer underwent endoscopic mucosal resection or primary surgical resection. Patients with stage II or III gastric cancer received primary surgical resection followed up by 5-FU based adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Patients with stage IV gastric cancer were treated with oxaliplatin based systemic chemotherapy (FOLFOX, XELOX) as first line treatment. Among patients who showed progression after first line chemotherapy with good performance status, irinotecan or docetaxel based systemic chemotherapy were given. Monthly physical examination with laboratory evaluation were performed in early or locally advanced gastric cancer who received curative surgical resection with or without adjuvant chemotherapy. When cancer recurrence was detected, patients were treated as stage IV gastric cancer. Patient who showed cancer recurrence as Krukenberg tumor, resectability of metastatic ovary lesions were discussed with gynecologic surgeons in multidisciplinary meetings. Patients who underwent metastasectomy, systemic chemotherapy were administered as stage IV gastric cancer. Response evaluation was performed by CT scans every 2 to 3 months according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, ver. 1.0. Systemic chemotherapy was administered until unaccepted toxicity, disease progression or patients' refusal.

### Transforming treatment paradigms: focus on personalized medicine for high-grade serous ovarian cancer [^116amQ2S]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

HGSOC is pathologically staged according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system (Table 1). Staging and grading of ovarian cancer, guided by the FIGO system, are fundamental to determining the extent of the disease and tailoring treatment approaches. The FIGO system ranges from stage I (tumor confined to the ovaries) to stage IV (distant metastasis), thus offering a standardized framework for evaluating disease progression. Another classification is provided by the TNM (primary tumor [T], regional lymph nodes [N], and distant metastases [M]) system based on the anatomic spread of malignant tumors (Table 1). An effort to harmonize FIGO with TNM is underway. Moreover, histopathologic features are essential for the accurate diagnosis of HGSOC. The presence of the aforementioned papillary structures and STICs in the fallopian tubes supports a diagnosis of HGSOC, highlighting the interplay between ovarian and fallopian tube origins. The Silverberg grading system adds to these descriptions by categorizing tumors based on architectural and nuclear features, providing further granularity that can inform prognosis and therapeutic decisions. Moreover, the Silverberg grading system appears to be preferable for categorizing patients with HGSOC for prognosis and disease management.

### Multicellular detachment generates metastatic spheroids during intra-abdominal dissemination in epithelial ovarian cancer [^117TgawR]. Oncogene (2018). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological cancer, where survival rates have had modest improvement over the last 30 years. Metastasis of cancer cells is a major clinical problem, and patient mortality occurs when ovarian cancer cells spread beyond the confinement of ovaries. Disseminated ovarian cancer cells typically spread within the abdomen, where ascites accumulation aids in their transit. Metastatic ascites contain multicellular spheroids, which promote chemo-resistance and recurrence. However, little is known about the origin and mechanisms through which spheroids arise. Using live-imaging of 3D culture models and animal models, we report that epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells, the most common type of ovarian cancer, can spontaneously detach as either single cells or clusters. We report that clusters are more resistant to anoikis and have a potent survival advantage over single cells. Using in vivo lineage tracing, we found that multicellular spheroids arise preferentially from collective detachment, rather than aggregation in the abdomen. Finally, we report that multicellular spheroids from collective detachment are capable of seeding intra-abdominal metastases that retain intra-tumoral heterogeneity from the primary tumor.

### Impact of ovarian metastases on survival in patients treated with cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for peritoneal malignancy originating from appendiceal and colorectal cancer [^116vw7CQ]. Colorectal Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

Ovarian metastases from gastrointestinal tract malignancies have been considered an ominous finding with poor prognosis. The aim of this project was to determine the impact on survival, and potential cure, when cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) are combined to treat peritoneal malignancy in women with Krukenberg tumours.

Method

A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data between January 2010 and July 2015. Female patients undergoing complete CRS (macroscopic tumour removal) and HIPEC for pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) of appendiceal origin, or colorectal peritoneal metastases (CPM) were included. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and survival rates compared using the log-rank test.

Results

In total, 889 patients underwent surgery for peritoneal malignancy, of whom 551 were female. Of these, 504/551 (91%) underwent complete CRS and HIPEC. Overall, 405/504 (80%) had at least one involved ovary removed either during CRS and HIPEC or at their index prereferral operation. Three hundred and fifty-two patients (87%) had an appendiceal tumour and 53 (13%) had CPM. At a median follow up of 40 months, overall survival (OS) did not differ significantly between patients with or without ovarian involvement in women with a primary low-grade appendiceal tumour or CPM. In women with high-grade primary appendiceal pathology, OS was significantly lower in patients with ovarian metastases compared with those without ovarian involvement.

Conclusion

Women with ovarian metastases from low-grade appendiceal tumours or colorectal cancer treated with CRS and HIPEC have similar survival rates to patients without ovarian metastases. Long-term survival and cure is feasible in patients amenable to complete tumour removal.

### PTEN loss shapes macrophage dynamics in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma [^1165Dar9]. Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Trans-celomic spread is the main mechanism by which HGSC disseminates around the peritoneal cavity and macrophages seem critical for this spread: gene expression in omental resident macrophages changes within hours of tumor-cell injection in mice, whereas macrophages promote seeding of ID8 cells on the omentum, and macrophage depletion prior to tumor implantation prevents tumor seeding. This early seeding is independent of T, B, and NK cells, and occurs equally well in immunodeficient models. Omental fat-associated lymphoid clusters are macrophage-rich, and resident embryonic-derived TIM4 + CD163 + macrophages promote ID8 seeding and spread. Additionally, omental-independent mesenteric-derived resident macrophages also support dissemination.

PTEN loss and PIK3CA copy number alterations occur in HGSC carcinogenesis, whereas Pten deletion is essential for metastatic spread from the fallopian tube in transgenic murine models and also accelerates intraperitoneal tumor growth. We show here that Pten deletion does not enhance proliferation or survival in low-attachment conditions per se. However, Pten -null cells specifically induce the expansion of resident macrophages in the peritoneal fluid and omentum. Peritoneal resident macrophages support tumor spheroid formation and spread and targeting them can reduce tumor burden. We show that Pten -null tumors recruit peritoneal resident macrophages directly into the omentum and that this is independent of blood monocyte recruitment, as Ccr2 RFP/RFP and Ccr2 +/+ mice have equivalent omental resident macrophage numbers. This is important for considering targeting approaches, as recruitment does not occur directly from the blood. Furthermore, we show that Pten deletion accelerates formation of a unique resident macrophage population that expresses high levels of the heme-degrading enzyme, HMOX1. We find that Pten -null cells significantly upregulate known activators of the HMOX1 hi macrophage gene program, including the cytokine IL33, which is critical in inducing HMOX1 expression in red pulp macrophages and drives immunosuppressive macrophage accumulation in glioblastoma.

### Maspin overexpression correlates with positive response to primary chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients [^112osHzq]. Gynecologic Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Maspin is a member of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily. Experimental studies revealed that maspin suppresses tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. We examined maspin expression in human ovarian tumors and relation between maspin expression and clinicopathological features as well as the role of maspin in predicting clinical outcome in patients with ovarian cancer.

Methods

Tissue samples consisted of 42 benign tumors, 10 borderline (LMP) tumors, 76 ovarian carcinomas, 8 Krukenberg tumors and 32 normal tissues. Immunoblot analysis was performed to evaluate the relative expression of maspin/beta-actin.

Results

Relative maspin level was significantly higher in patients with LMP tumors (median 0.74) and early stages ovarian cancers (median 0.46) when compared with healthy tissues (median 0.03), those with benign (median 0.23) and metastatic tumors (median 0.22). Overexpression of maspin was found to correlate with the early stage of the disease (p = 0.001), non-serous subtype of ovarian cancer (p = 0.03) and positive response to chemotherapy (p = 0.02). A statistically significant longer PFS was seen in women with high as compared with low expression of maspin (p = 0.03).

Conclusions

Maspin is upregulated in borderline tumors and the early stages of ovarian carcinoma and then significantly downregulated with malignant transformation. High expression may paradoxically promote the invasion and metastasis of ovarian carcinomas. Our study revealed that maspin expression could play an important role in predicting the results of treatment of ovarian cancer patients.

### Hematogenous metastasis of ovarian cancer: rethinking mode of spread [^111AcJ8u]. Cancer Cell (2014). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer has a clear predilection for metastasis to the omentum, but the underlying mechanisms involved in ovarian cancer spread are not well understood. Here, we used a parabiosis model that demonstrates preferential hematogenous metastasis of ovarian cancer to the omentum. Our studies revealed that the ErbB3-neuregulin 1 (NRG1) axis is a dominant pathway responsible for hematogenous omental metastasis. Elevated levels of ErbB3 in ovarian cancer cells and NRG1 in the omentum allowed for tumor cell localization and growth in the omentum. Depletion of ErbB3 in ovarian cancer impaired omental metastasis. Our results highlight hematogenous metastasis as an important mode of ovarian cancer metastasis. These findings have implications for designing alternative strategies aimed at preventing and treating ovarian cancer metastasis.

### Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: 2025 update [^113WuVqW]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1.2 Lymphatic and lymph node drainage

The lymphatic drainage of the ovaries and fallopian tubes is via the utero‐ovarian, infundibulopelvic, and round ligament pathways and an external iliac accessory route into the following regional lymph nodes: external iliac, common iliac, hypogastric, lateral sacral, para‐aortic lymph nodes, and, occasionally, the inguinal nodes. The peritoneal surfaces can drain through the diaphragmatic lymphatics and hence to the major venous vessels above the diaphragm.

1.1.3 Other metastatic sites

The peritoneum, including the omentum and pelvic and abdominal viscera, is the most common site for dissemination of ovarian and fallopian tube cancers. This includes diaphragmatic and liver surfaces. Pleural involvement is also seen. Other extraperitoneal or extrapleural sites are relatively uncommon but can occur. After systematic, careful pathological review has excluded a tubal or ovarian site of origin, malignancies that appear to arise primarily on the peritoneum are designated as peritoneal cancer and have a similar pattern of spread. They may also frequently involve the ovaries and fallopian tubes secondarily. These "peritoneal" tumors may arise in endosalpingiosis or possibly from migrated p53 mutated tubal epithelia cells.

### Laparoscopy and unsuspected intra-abdominal malignancy with rapid peritoneal spread [^111RmCkW]. Surgical Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Use of the laparoscopic approach for intra-abdominal malignancy remains controversial because there have been multiple reports of tumor metastases at port sites after laparoscopy. Although several randomized trials have documented no difference in recurrence rates between laparoscopic and open surgery, there are still many questions about the behavior of tumor cells in laparoscopic conditions. The speed of tumor spread and time to recurrence appear to be variable. Abdominal insufflation and other effects of laparoscopy are only now being delineated. It is not clear whether tumor characteristics, preoperative tumor stage, or the laparoscopic milieu itself affect tumor spread during and after laparoscopic surgery. We present an unusual case of very rapid tumor dissemination in a young patient who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy.

### Targeting LRRC15 inhibits metastatic dissemination of ovarian cancer [^115iDWDi]. Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Widespread peritoneal dissemination at the time of diagnosis is a hallmark of ovarian cancer. Peritoneal dissemination and attachment of ovarian cancer to the mesothelium culminates predominantly in omental and bowel metastasis, resulting in malignant bowel obstruction (MBO; ref.), which is the major cause of mortality and a common problem in recurrent disease. Despite advances in treatment, the molecular drivers of ovarian cancer dissemination remains poorly defined, thereby impeding development of therapeutic approaches to target bowel metastasis in patients with ovarian cancer.

A major challenge is the lack of faithful models that replicate ovarian cancer progression and dissemination to dissect and therapeutically exploit molecular vulnerabilities. The recent report of the first comprehensive molecular characterization of primary ovarian cancer and matching bowel metastatic lesions (mets), identified genes that are differentially expressed. The causal role of any of these candidate genes in ovarian cancer dissemination and bowel metastasis is unclear and needs to be clarified in order to pave the way for future studies investigating the potential clinical benefit to be gained from targeting these mechanisms, if evidences emerge causally linking them with malignant spread.

### Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum [^116xXw8c]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

The Gynecologic Oncology Committee of FIGO in 2014 revised the staging of ovarian cancer, incorporating ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer into the same system. Most of these malignancies are high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC). Stage IC is now divided into three categories: IC1 (surgical spill); IC2 (capsule ruptured before surgery or tumor on ovarian or fallopian tube surface); and IC3 (malignant cells in the ascites or peritoneal washings). The updated staging includes a revision of Stage IIIC based on spread to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes alone without intraperitoneal dissemination. This category is now subdivided into IIIA1(i) (metastasis ≤ 10 mm in greatest dimension), and IIIA1(ii) (metastasis > 10 mm in greatest dimension). Stage IIIA2 is now "microscopic extrapelvic peritoneal involvement with or without positive retroperitoneal lymph node" metastasis. This review summarizes the genetics, surgical management, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies for epithelial cancers, and the treatment of ovarian germ cell and stromal malignancies.

### Tubal and ovarian pathways to pelvic epithelial cancer: a pathological perspective [^113fpKkQ]. Histopathology (2008). Low credibility.

Prolongation of ovarian epithelial cancer survival depends on early detection or improved responses to chemotherapy. Gains in either have been modest at best. Understanding the diverse pathogenesis of this disease is critical to early intervention or prevention. This review addresses six important variables, including (i) cell of origin, (ii) site of origin, (iii) initial genotoxic events, (iv) risks imposed by hereditary and other promoting conditions, (v) subsequent factors that promote different patterns of metastatic spread, and (vi) prospects for intervention. This review proposes two distinct pathways to pelvic epithelial cancer. The first initiates in ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), Mullerian inclusions or endometriosis in the ovary. The second arises from the endosalpinx and encompasses a subset of serous carcinomas. The serous carcinogenic sequence in the distal fallopian tube is described and contrasted with lower grade serous tumors based on tumour location, earliest genetic change and ability (or lack of) to undergo terminal (ciliated) differentiation. Ultimately, a clear understanding of tumour origin and the mechanism(s) leading to the earliest phases of the serous and endometrioid carcinogenic sequences may hold the greatest promise for designing prevention strategies and/or developing new therapies.

### An evolving story of the metastatic voyage of ovarian cancer cells: cellular and molecular orchestration of the adipose-rich metastatic microenvironment [^112KN48M]. Oncogene (2019). Medium credibility.

The majority of ovarian cancers are epithelial in origin and are histopathologically classified into the following five main types: high-grade serous carcinoma, low-grade serous carcinoma, endometrioid carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and mucinous carcinoma. These cancer types are inherently diverse diseases that are characterized by differences in precursor lesions, molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis, patterns of progression and metastasis, responses to chemotherapy, and clinical outcomes. In the early twenty-first century, a series of morphological and molecular genetic studies led researchers to propose a dualistic model of ovarian carcinogenesis that divided ovarian cancer into two groups: type I and type II. High-grade serous carcinoma, which is a prototypical type II tumor, is the most common and extremely aggressive subtype and contributes primarily to the poor prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. Because of the high metastatic potential of high-grade serous carcinoma, a large proportion of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage with multiple intraperitoneal disseminated tumors. Furthermore, a marked predilection for the adipose-rich omentum as the site of metastasis can be observed. Considering that most ovarian cancer-related deaths are directly attributable to the development of metastatic disease, an in-depth understanding of the cellular and molecular aspects of ovarian cancer metastasis is crucial to overcome this life-threatening disease.

Asymptomatic ovarian tumors in menopausal women do not always require surgical removal. Experts recommend an initial evaluation with transvaginal ultrasound to help characterize the tumor's malignant risk.

Indeterminate tumors require secondary testing with the strategies outlined in this Practice Pearl.

### From the archives of the AFIP: radiologic staging of ovarian carcinoma with pathologic correlation [^111KMXrC]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy, with approximately 70% of patients having peritoneal involvement at the time of diagnosis. It spreads predominantly by direct invasion and intraperitoneal dissemination. The staging system is surgically based, with stage I disease being limited to one or both ovaries. In stage II disease, there is extraovarian spread of tumor, but it does not extend beyond the pelvis. Stages III and IV disease are considered advanced, with stage III ovarian cancer including diffuse peritoneal disease involving the upper abdomen and stage IV disease having distant metastases including hepatic lesions. Common sites of intraperitoneal seeding include the omentum, paracolic gutters, liver capsule, and diaphragm. Thickening, nodularity, and enhancement are all signs of peritoneal involvement. Although computed tomography is the most common imaging modality used to stage ovarian cancer, magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be equally accurate. Currently, however, no imaging modality allows microscopic spread of disease to be ruled out, and a full staging laparotomy is always required. Early ovarian cancer is treated with comprehensive staging laparotomy, whereas advanced but operable disease is treated with primary cytoreductive surgery (debulking) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with unresectable disease may benefit from neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy before debulking.

### Ovarian tumors: a survey of selected advances of note during the life of this journal [^116FLaKB]. Human Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

The author reviews highlights of advances in knowledge concerning ovarian tumor pathology since the time of an essay in the first issue of this Journal written by Dr Robert E. Scully, who, both before and for several decades after the Journal was instituted, made many original contributions to the field and was the major architect of the 1973 World Health Organization classification of ovarian tumors which was much more clear and logical than prior ones. The current review considers the neoplasms in essentially the same order as was done in the first issue of this journal and presents a personal look at the highlights of new information concerning various well-known categories, surface epithelial, germ cell, sex cord-stromal, metastatic neoplasms and briefly, benign so-called tumor-like lesions. Some of the most notable developments are as follows: (1) an orderly approach to the classification of implants of serous borderline tumors into noninvasive and invasive categories; (2) recognition of distinctive micropapillary patterns seen in some borderline tumors and low-grade carcinomas; (3) a remarkable propensity for some endometrioid carcinomas to mimic sex cord- stromal tumors; (4) appreciation of the differences between primary mucinous tumors of intestinal and müllerian types; (5) the importance of distinguishing within primary mucinous carcinomas between expansile and destructive stromal invasion; (6) emphasis on the diagnosis of immature teratoma being based on the presence of primitive-embryonic-appearing tissues; (7) appreciation of variant morphology of cases of struma ovarii which may lead to significant diagnostic problems; (8) subdivision of granulosa cell tumors into adult and juvenile types because of the differing features of the two groups including in the second category the propensity for more malignant neoplasms to be mimicked; (9) recognition of a distinctive form of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, the retiform variant, with a propensity to occur in the young; (10) appreciation of a unique highly malignant neoplasm that typically afflicts the young and may be associated with hypercalcemia, so-called small cell carcinoma of hypercalcemic type; (11) greater awareness than was hitherto the case of the propensity for metastatic intestinal adenocarcinoma to mimic primary endometrioid carcinoma and similarly for metastatic mucinous carcinomas to simulate primary mucinous cystic tumors; (12) recognition of the distinctive features of low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms that spread to the ovary and are typically associated with pseudomyxoma peritonei; and (13) appreciation that the histologic spectrum seen in cases of Krukenberg tumor is broader than often previously thought.

1.1.1 Primary site

Ovarian epithelial tumors may arise within endometriosis or cortical inclusions of Müllerian epithelium, likely a form of endosalpingiosis. These include low‐grade endometrioid carcinomas, clear cell carcinomas, borderline and low‐grade serous carcinomas, and mucinous carcinomas. These tumors are thought to evolve slowly from lower‐grade precursor conditions (endometriotic cysts, cystadenomas, etc) and are classified as type I tumors. Fallopian tube carcinomas arise in the distal fallopian tube and the majority of these are high‐grade serous carcinomas. These are thought to evolve rapidly from more obscure precursors and are designated as type II tumors. This latter group encompasses high‐grade endometrioid carcinomas and carcinosarcomas. All of these high‐grade carcinomas are nearly always associated with mutations in the TP53 gene.

1.1.2 Lymphatic and lymph node drainage

The lymphatic drainage of the ovaries and fallopian tubes is via the utero‐ovarian, infundibulopelvic, and round ligament pathways and an external iliac accessory route into the following regional lymph nodes: external iliac, common iliac, hypogastric, lateral sacral, para‐aortic lymph nodes and, occasionally, to the inguinal nodes. The peritoneal surfaces can drain through the diaphragmatic lymphatics and hence to the major venous vessels above the diaphragm.

1.1.3 Other metastatic sites

The peritoneum, including the omentum and pelvic and abdominal viscera, is the most common site for dissemination of ovarian and fallopian tube cancers. This includes the diaphragmatic and liver surfaces. Pleural involvement is also seen. Other extraperitoneal or extrapleural sites are relatively uncommon, but can occur. After systematic pathologic analysis has excluded a tubal or ovarian site of origin, malignancies that appear to arise primarily on the peritoneum have an identical spread pattern, and frequently may involve the ovaries and fallopian tubes secondarily. These "peritoneal" tumors are thought to arise in endosalpingiosis.

### An ontogenetic approach to gynecologic malignancies [^1166MjTX]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Ontogenetic compartment theory of local tumour spread

Traditional principles of cancer surgery are based on centrifugal local tumour spread, irrespective of tissue boundaries (Fig. 3a and b). The margins required for an oncologic surgical specimen to be considered adequate sometimes lead to mutilating radical organ resection. Furthermore, despite adequate surgical technique with microscopic clear margins (R0), local recurrence rates in solid tumours still occur in 5 to 50% of cases. Adjuvant therapy has been recommended to a variety of them in order to reduce local recurrences, but leads to higher morbidity. Increasing the radial margin of resection has not always led to better disease control, particularly in highly prevalent malignancies such as breast and cervix.

Fig. 3
Axial high resolution T2-weighted image of the pelvis. a Fifty-six-year-old woman with synchronous malignancies of the rectum and cervix; b Centrifugal local tumour spread, irrespective of tissue boundaries, forms the basis of traditional cancer surgery, and dictates tumour excision with metrically defined margins; c According to the ontogenetic compartment theory of local tumour spread, tumour dissemination is not centrifugal, but rather confined to embryologically determined ontogenetic compartments until relatively late-stages. Resection along compartment borders is expected to lead to better disease control

The ontogenetic compartment theory of local tumour spread states that tumours initially spread within morphogenetically formed units, the compartment boundaries being tumour suppressive in the early stages of tumour growth. For transgression, phenotypic changes in tumour cells must occur, which then induce local permeation through inflammation or other phenomena. They are thought to occur relatively late in cancer progression and to favour compartments with a closer embryologic ancestry. As a result, in the early stages of the disease, resection along compartment borders leads to better disease control (Fig. 3c).

### Ovarian cancer development and metastasis [^115W9GG3]. The American Journal of Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

The biology of ovarian carcinoma differs from that of hematogenously metastasizing tumors because ovarian cancer cells primarily disseminate within the peritoneal cavity and are only superficially invasive. However, since the rapidly proliferating tumors compress visceral organs and are only temporarily chemosensitive, ovarian carcinoma is a deadly disease, with a cure rate of only 30%. There are a number of genetic and epigenetic changes that lead to ovarian carcinoma cell transformation. Ovarian carcinoma could originate from any of three potential sites: the surfaces of the ovary, the fallopian tube, or the mesothelium-lined peritoneal cavity. Ovarian cacinoma tumorigenesis then either progresses along a stepwise mutation process from a slow growing borderline tumor to a well-differentiated carcinoma (type I) or involves a genetically unstable high-grade serous carcinoma that metastasizes rapidly (type II). During initial tumorigenesis, ovarian carcinoma cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which involves a change in cadherin and integrin expression and up-regulation of proteolytic pathways. Carried by the peritoneal fluid, cancer cell spheroids overcome anoikis and attach preferentially on the abdominal peritoneum or omentum, where the cancer cells revert to their epithelial phenotype. The initial steps of metastasis are regulated by a controlled interaction of adhesion receptors and proteases, and late metastasis is characterized by the oncogene-driven fast growth of tumor nodules on mesothelium covered surfaces, causing ascites, bowel obstruction, and tumor cachexia.

### Primary and secondary tumors of the peritoneum: key imaging features and differential diagnosis with surgical and pathological correlation [^113dwFWG]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology of peritoneal malignancies

Primary peritoneal tumors are rare neoplasms that arise from the malignant transformation of cells located in the mesothelial or submesothelial layers of the peritoneum.

Secondary tumors of the peritoneum show a significantly higher prevalence and represent an advanced evolutive stage of metastatic neoplasms, known under the generic term of peritoneal carcinomatosis. This condition is usually secondary to intra-abdominal neoplasms, mainly ovarian and gastrointestinal cancers, although occasionally extra-abdominal neoplasms like breast cancer, lung cancer or malignant melanoma may also metastasize to the peritoneum. Four pathways have been described that, in isolation or synchronously, allow for this peritoneal dissemination: Intraperitoneal seeding This route is conditioned by the peritoneal ligaments and mesenteries, which dictate the flow dynamics of ascitic fluid. In patients with ascites related to an underlying malignant process, the fluid tends to collect in well-defined areas like the pelvic recesses, the superior aspect of the sigmoid mesocolon, the inferior part of the small bowel mesentery, the ileocecal junction, the right paracolic gutter, the Morison pouch and the right subphrenic space (Fig. 1). These areas of stasis facilitate the transcoelomic dissemination of free-floating neoplastic cells, which detach from the surface of the primary tumor and adhere to the peritoneal sheets.
Direct invasion In this route intra-abdominal neoplasms, like gastric carcinomas and small bowel neuroendocrine tumors, cross the serous membrane to invade directly the adjacent ligaments and mesenteries.
Lymphatic extension Tumoral cells circulating in the lymphatic vessels may reach the peritoneum through lymphatic stomata located on the surface of the diaphragm. This pathway plays a major role in non-Hodgkin lymphomas and is also frequently seen in ovarian and gastrointestinal cancers.
Embolic hematogenous spread Aggressive neoplasms that invade vascular walls may reach the peritoneal surfaces via the bloodstream. This route is typical of peritoneal metastases from extra-abdominal primary tumors.

### Role of histological type on surgical outcome and survival following radical primary tumour debulking of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancers [^111RcBmj]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

A further weakness of the present analysis is the relatively short follow-up of an average of 23 months.

It is known that underlying the general high mortality of EOC is the molecular behaviour of the disease, with ∼75% of patients presenting at an advanced clinical stage, in terms of a high-volume disease with dissemination in the entire abdominal cavity. Type I tumours have been described as slow growing, as evidenced by the observation that they are large and often confined to the ovary at diagnosis. This observation was corroborated in this study, where type I tumours initially presented in approximately half of the cases at an early stage restricted to the pelvis (IMO level 1), as opposed to only 14% of type II patients. This may imply that despite the fact that rare entities such as mucinous and clear cell carcinomas show a poorer response to conventional chemotherapeutic regimes, their tendency to be diagnosed at earlier stages, confined to the pelvis, may actually result in a more favourable prognosis and more beneficial profile of the type I tumours.

However, these hypotheses have to be verified in prospective morphological and molecular genetic studies, where a molecular biological profiling of the tumour will be conducted at inception of the disease and, subsequently, correlated with surgical outcome and survival. In this way a new rationale in the approach to detection, therapeutic management and follow-up may be developed, which would be closer to the actual tumour biology profiling and large-scale heterogeneity of the disease and may allow a more individualised and potentially more effective management.

### Mechanisms of transcoelomic metastasis in ovarian cancer [^115JidYk]. The Lancet: Oncology (2006). Medium credibility.

Metastasis from epithelial ovarian cancer can occur via the transcoelomic, haematogeneous, or lymphatic route. Of these, transcoelomic metastasis is the most common, and is responsible for the greatest morbidity and mortality in women with this disease. Unfortunately, very little is known about the mechanisms behind this process. This review assesses the current evidence and ideas about the biology of transcoelomic dissemination. The mechanisms of cell detachment, migration, and implantation in transcoelomic metastasis are placed within the context of clinical observations of ovarian cancer to derive a stepwise hypothesis of this process. Evidence for transcoelomic dissemination versus transcoelomic metaplasia in ovarian cancer is presented. Future high throughput microarray studies that compare changes at a genomic and gene expression level between primary ovarian tumours and their peritoneal metastases are hoped to lead to a more conclusive picture of transcoelomic metastasis, and to delineate the key molecular players in this process. These studies might also result in the identification of potential new therapeutic targets in ovarian cancer.

### Primary and secondary tumors of the peritoneum: key imaging features and differential diagnosis with surgical and pathological correlation [^116TW1wY]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis must be made with PPSC, which shares similar histological and radiological features but with no evidence of adnexal mass. Histology often reveals epithelial ovarian cancer, with high-grade serous carcinoma being the most common subtype.

The treatment of choice in stage III ovarian cancer with resectable peritoneal disease and no visceral metastases consists of a combination of CRS ± HIPEC, followed by platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy. In stage IV ovarian cancer or in cases with a large volume of peritoneal disease, the first option is neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which may be followed by interval CRS and adjuvant chemotherapy if there is a positive response to systemic treatment. Prognosis depends on the initial stage of diagnosis. In this sense, a recent study in a cohort of 1.3 million women showed a 5-year survival rate of 26% in stage III and 14% in stage IV. The volume of residual disease after CRS is considered the strongest prognostic factor for progression-free survival and overall survival.

Gastrointestinal cancer

Several malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract have the potential to metastasize to the peritoneal cavity. The most frequent ones are colorectal and gastric cancers, followed by others like appendix, pancreas and gallbladder. Different studies have reported that up to 5–15% of patients with colorectal cancer and 10–21% of patients with gastric cancer present with a synchronous peritoneal spread at initial diagnosis.

Imaging features are similar to those previously described on ovarian cancer, and relate to the classic appearance of peritoneal carcinomatosis: ascites, stranding of omental fat, omental nodules and masses, mesenteric nodules and thickening and enhancement of peritoneal sheets (Fig. 13). In advanced stages, peritoneal metastases commonly spread to the mesentery with a "stellate appearance", characterized by increased attenuation of the mesenteric fat and perivascular soft tissue thickening caused by microscopic infiltration of adipose tissue along the mesenteric blood vessels (Fig. 14). It is often associated with fixation, tethering and distortion of small bowel loops, with loss of fat planes and eventually bowel obstruction.

### Extent of peritoneal resection for peritoneal metastases: looking beyond a complete cytoreduction [^116hfQ22]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Completeness of cytoreduction is one of the most important prognostic factors impacting outcomes of cytoreductive surgery (CRS). To what extent the surrounding normal peritoneum needs to be removed is not known. We hypothesized that the extent of peritoneal resection should be different for different tumors and performed this study to find evidence to support this rationale. To determine the extent of resection of surrounding tissue for any tumor, the mechanisms of tumor development and spread, tumor morphology, the possibility of finding disease in the surrounding normal tissue, and the pattern of lymph node metastases should be known. Surgical resections also depend on patterns of recurrence and the impact of varying extent of resection on survival. We performed a review of literature pertaining to pathways and patterns of peritoneal cancer spread to determine the scientific basis for the extent of peritonectomy. We also reviewed studies comparing less and more extensive peritoneal resection. There is no consensus on the extent of lymphadenectomy required for most PM. Based on this review, we provide recommendations for the extent of peritoneal resection and the extent of lymph node dissection that should be performed for some common peritoneal tumors and identify areas that require further research. We propose that a systematic method of synoptic reporting of pathological specimens of CRS should be developed to capture information regarding the disease distribution within the peritoneal cavity and morphology of PM from different tumors. This can in future be used to establish standard guidelines for such resections.

### Early detection of ovarian cancer [^112ABWFZ]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Is an improved diagnostic pathway already in sight?

Undoubtedly the concept of ovarian cancer has been completely revised. Ovarian cancer is now recognised as an umbrella term for different cancer types that differ widely not only on a morphological and genetic level but also in clinical behaviour. Furthermore, heterogeneity is a feature seen not only within the primary tumour but also among its metastases.

Approximately 90% of ovarian cancers constitute of epithelial ovarian cancer types. Ovarian cancer has multiple cellular origins. The most common and aggressive type is high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) which originates in the epithelium of the fallopian tube as a STIC lesion. HGSOC may manifest as an ovarian or fallopian tube mass or primary peritoneal cancer, and the term tubo-ovarian cancer is often used. In contrast, only the biologically more indolent type I cancers (low-grade serous, mucinous, endometrioid, and clear cell) derive from the ovaries. These two distinct cancer categories differ not only in origin and aggressiveness, but also in the presence of identified precursor lesions. In this context — although they comprise only the minority of ovarian cancers — it is pivotal for early detection that precursor lesions may precede ovarian cancer for several years. Serous and mucinous borderline tumours may arise within cystadenomas, and it seems that there is a continuum in their development to invasive cancers. This is supported by the fact that borderline tumours are diagnosed in women approximately 10 years younger than the average age for HGSOC and the coexistence of borderline and invasive cancer in the same histopathologic specimen (Fig. 1). Endometriosis is associated with clear cell and endometrial cancer subtypes.

### Lymphangiogenesis and tumor metastasis: myth or reality? [^1155m6xL]. Clinical Cancer Research (2001). Low credibility.

The metastatic spread of tumor cells is responsible for the majority of cancer deaths, and with few exceptions, all cancers can metastasize. Clinical findings have long suggested that by providing a pathway for tumor cell dissemination, tumor-associated lymphatics are a key component of metastatic spread. It is not known, however, whether pre-existing vessels are sufficient to serve this function, or whether tumor cell dissemination requires de novo lymphatic formation (lymphangiogenesis) or an increase in lymphatic size. Lymphangiogenesis has traditionally been overshadowed by the greater emphasis placed on the blood vascular system (angiogenesis). This is due in part to the lack of identification of lymphangiogenic factors, as well as suitable markers that distinguish blood from lymphatic vascular endothelium. This scenario is changing rapidly after the identification of the first lymphangiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C). Increased expression of VEGF-C in primary tumors correlates with increased dissemination of tumor cells to regional lymph nodes in a variety of human carcinomas. Here I will review what is known about the mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis, particularly in the context of metastatic tumor spread, and will critically examine the role of VEGF-C in this process. However, despite recent progress in this field, it remains to be determined whether inhibition of lymphangiogenesis is a realistic therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor cell dissemination and the formation of metastasis.

1.2 Classification rules

Although CT scans can delineate the intra‐abdominal spread of disease to a certain extent, ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers should be staged surgically. Operative findings determine the precise histologic diagnosis, stage, and therefore the prognosis, of the patient.,

In selected patients with advanced stage disease, it may be appropriate to initiate chemotherapy prior to surgical intervention, and in these cases there should be histologic or cytologic confirmation of the diagnosis prior to starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy (see 5.2.2. below).

Chest radiograms may serve as a screen for pleural effusions. As distant metastases are infrequent, there is no requirement for other radiological evaluation unless symptomatic. Serum CA125 levels may be useful in determining response to chemotherapy, but they do not contribute to staging.

1.2.1 Fallopian tube involvement

Fallopian tube involvement can be divided into three categories. In the first, an obvious intraluminal and grossly apparent fallopian tube mass is seen with tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (carcinoma in situ) that is presumed to have arisen in the fallopian tube. These cases should be staged surgically with a histologic confirmation of disease. Tumor extension into the submucosa or muscularis and to and beyond the serosa can therefore be defined. These features, together with the laterality and the presence or absence of ascites, should all be taken into consideration.,

In the second scenario, a widespread serous carcinoma is associated with a tubal intraepithelial carcinoma. A visible mass in the endosalpinx may not be seen but the histologic findings should be noted in the pathology report since they may indicate a fallopian tube primary. Tumors obliterating both fallopian tube and ovary may belong to this group but whether a presumptive assignment of a tubal origin can be made in such cases is controversial given that tubal intraepithelial carcinoma cannot be confirmed.

In the third scenario — risk‐reducing salpingo‐oophorectomy — tubal intraepithelial carcinoma may be the only finding. It should be reported as originating in the fallopian tube and managed accordingly. The majority of early serous cancers detected are found in the fallopian tube, irrespective of genetic risk.

### Multicellular detachment generates metastatic spheroids during intra-abdominal dissemination in epithelial ovarian cancer [^111N1hZN]. Oncogene (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Metastasis is responsible for more than 90% of all the cancer-associated deaths. Intra-abdominal metastasis is frequently observed in gastrointestinal and gynecological cancers, in which cells disseminate and grow in the abdominal cavity. Intra-abdominal dissemination is particularly prevalent in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the most lethal gynecological cancer, with fewer than 30% of patients surviving 5 years after diagnosis. The majority (85–90%) of EOCs express epithelial markers (E-cadherin and cytokeratin) and acquisition of epithelial characteristics may be necessary for cell transformation during ovarian cancer initiation. The epithelial state of tumors at secondary sites is less clear, with reports of retention or loss of E-cadherin in metastases, implicating tumoral heterogeneity and epithelial plasticity in this process.

Ovarian cancer dissemination is associated with malignant ascites, which is present in a third of patients at diagnosis and almost all patients at recurrence, and is considered a major source of chemo-resistance, recurrence, and mortality. Malignant ascites contains disseminated tumor cells as single cells, or more commonly, as multicellular spheroids, in a complex fluid that constitutes a pro-tumorigenic environment. Spheroids are considered bona fide metastatic units that can attach to the mesothelium and invade the extracellular matrix during dissemination. Current models propose a multi-step process for intraperitoneal metastasis that includes: (1) shedding from the primary tumor; (2) evading anoikis; (3) formation of spheroids; and (4) peritoneal implantation and outgrowth. In comparison to the late stages of peritoneal implantation, the early stages of shedding, survival, and spheroid formation remain poorly understood. Despite the critical importance of spheroids during intra-abdominal dissemination, a long-standing question is how spheroids form. One hypothesis proposes that multicellular spheroids arise from single cells aggregating within the abdomen. An alternative possibility is that cells detach as groups that form spheroids. Here we report that spheroids predominantly arise from multicellular detachment from the primary tumor and are responsible for intraperitoneal metastasis. Furthermore, we report that detaching spheroids can maintain phenotypic heterogeneity of the primary tumor during dissemination.

### Redefining the origin and evolution of ovarian cancer: a hormonal connection [^113hRGTD]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality of all female reproductive cancers. Late diagnosis, tumour heterogeneity and the development of chemoresistance contribute to this statistic and work against patient survival. Current studies have revealed novel concepts that impact our view on how ovarian cancer develops. The greatest impact is on our understanding that, as a disease, ovarian cancer has multiple cellular origins and that these malignant precursors are mostly derived from outside of the ovaries. In this review, we propose a new concept of a step-wise developmental process that may underwrite ovarian tumorigenesis and progression: (1) migration/recruitment to the ovaries; (2) seeding and establishment in the ovaries; (3) induction of a dormant cancer stage; and (4) expansion and tumor progression. We will discuss the relationship of each step with the changing ovarian function and milieu during the reproductive age and the subsequent occurrence of menopause. The realization that ovarian cancer development and progression occurs in distinct steps is critical for the search of adequate markers for early detection that will offer personalized strategies for prevention and therapy.

### Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: 2025 update [^114j8g9J]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Causes of death include complications of disease (e.g. small bowel obstruction) or complications of therapy, and only rarely malignant transformation. The mainstay of treatment is primary surgical staging and cytoreduction. For patients with Stage I disease who want to preserve fertility, conservative surgery via unilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy can be considered after intraoperative inspection of the contralateral ovary to exclude involvement. For patients with only one ovary, or bilateral cystic ovaries, a partial oophorectomy or cystectomy can be considered for fertility preservation. For all other patients, total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy are recommended, with maximal cytoreduction if the disease is metastatic.

Patients with borderline tumors in all stages of disease should be treated with surgery. The response to chemotherapy is low. Uncommonly, some patients recur early and have higher‐grade invasive cancers and may possibly benefit from chemotherapy.

In patients with late recurrence of the disease, secondary cytoreduction should be considered. Follow‐up of patients with no evidence of disease is the same as for those with malignant epithelial carcinomas, but at less frequent intervals. If the contralateral ovary has been retained, it should be followed by TVS, at least on an annual basis,(Level of Evidence: C).

### Radiological manifestations of metastasis to the ovary [^114VQNF4]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

MRI is an effective tool for detection of ovarian neoplastic lesions. However, there are no highly specific radiological features that differentiate primary from metastatic ovarian masses. Histological diagnosis preoperatively is not always possible as there is a risk of disseminating an otherwise early stage primary ovarian cancer. The preoperative diagnosis of an ovarian lesion is therefore heavily dependent on the radiological features. The radiologist must rely on a combination of knowing the natural history of any known primary cancer, together with the radiological features such as bilaterality, mucinous appearance, pseudomyxoma as well as the clinical progress of the primary tumour in order to evaluate and predict the likelihood of metastatic disease. Even if a non-ovarian primary cancer is known, an ovarian mass cannot always be assumed to be a secondary lesion. Some tumours, such as BRAC-positive breast cancer, are known to have a high rate of concomitant primary ovarian cancer. Conversely, other tumours, such as gastric and appendiceal cancer, are known to have a high rate of ovarian metastatic disease. However, histology remains the only true way to determine an ovarian metastasis from a primary lesion.

### Factors influencing the use and accuracy of frozen section diagnosis of epithelial ovarian tumors [^111mZmxP]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to study factors influencing the use and accuracy of frozen section diagnosis (FSD) of ovarian tumors.

Study Design

Surgery was performed in 414 patients with epithelial ovarian tumors between 2001 and 2006. Factors were identified by univariate and multivariate analysis.

Results

FSD was requested in 274 patients: 152 benign, 55 borderline, and 67 malignant tumors. Age 50 years or older, tumor size 10 cm or greater, and preoperative evidence of malignancy were associated with FSD request. The sensitivity and specificity of FSD for benign, borderline, and malignant tumors were 97% and 81%, 62% and 96%, and 88% and 99%, respectively. The histologic type (mucinous), tumor size (less than 10 cm), the borderline component (less than 10%), and the pathologist's experience predicted misdiagnosis of borderline tumors. Spread outside the ovary was the only significant predictor of accurate FSD of malignant tumors.

Conclusion

FSD is less accurate for borderline than benign and malignant ovarian tumors. The pathologist's experience is a major determinant of diagnostic accuracy.

### Ovarian carcinomatosis: how the radiologist can help plan the surgical approach [^113shUQG]. Radiographics (2012). Low credibility.

Ovarian carcinoma is the most common cause of death due to gynecologic malignancy. Peritoneal involvement is present in approximately 70% of patients at the time of initial diagnosis. The disease spreads abdominally by direct extension, exfoliation of tumor cells into the peritoneal space, and dissemination of tumor cells along lymphatic pathways. Carcinomatosis characterizes an advanced stage of disease in which peritoneal disease has spread throughout the upper abdomen (stage IIIC) or in which diffuse peritoneal disease is accompanied by malignant pleural infiltration or visceral metastases (stage IV). Common sites of intraperitoneal seeding of ovarian carcinoma include the pelvis, omentum, paracolic gutters, liver capsule, and diaphragm. Soft-tissue thickening, nodularity, and enhancement are all signs of peritoneal involvement. Advanced-stage disease is treated either with initial cytoreductive surgery (debulking) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, or with initial neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by debulking. Radiologic imaging plays an important role in the selection of patients who may benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy before debulking. However, accurate interpretation of the imaging findings is challenging and requires a detailed knowledge of the complex peritoneal anatomy, directionality of flow of peritoneal fluid, and specific disease sites that are likely to present particular difficulties with regard to surgical access and technique. Although there is as yet no clear consensus on the criteria for resectability of peritoneal lesions, extensive involvement of the small bowel or mesenteric root, involved lymph nodes superior to the celiac axis, pleural infiltration, pelvic sidewall invasion, bladder trigone involvement, and hepatic parenchymal metastases or implants near the right hepatic vein are considered indicative of potential nonresectability. Implants larger than 2 cm in diameter in the diaphragm, lesser sac, porta hepatis, intersegmental fissure, gallbladder fossa, or gastrosplenic or gastrohepatic ligament also may represent nonresectable disease.

### Pathology of ovarian carcinoma [^117WgU7v]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Serous carcinoma is the most common type of ovarian cancer and usually is associated with peritoneal metastases and poor survival except for meticulously staged patients with tumors confined to the ovaries. Endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas account for most nonserous carcinomas and more often present with low-stage disease; survival for the various cell types is similar when stratified by stage. Borderline ovarian tumors can be subdivided into benign and malignant neoplasms, and in the view of some experts, this renders the borderline category obsolete. Women with typical serous borderline tumors (atypical proliferative serous tumors) constitute most of these patients and have virtually 100% survival, unless invasive peritoneal implants are present. Micropapillary serous carcinomas (a less common variant, also called serous borderline tumor with a micropapillary pattern) and tumors with invasive implants behave similar to low-grade invasive carcinomas.

### Genetic heterogeneity and evolutionary history of high-grade ovarian carcinoma and matched distant metastases [^1155MEYD]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most frequent and leading cause of death from gynaecologic cancers, with a 10-year survival of < 30%, despite efforts over the last three decades to change the outlook of this highly lethal disease.HGSOC is a heterogeneous cancer with a high rate of relapse and metastasis. HGSOC is typically diagnosed at advanced stages after dispersing to multiple sites, ensuing exceptionally poor prognosis with ~80% of patients relapsing despite initial responses to surgery and chemotherapy, of which many relent to treatment-resistant disease.

As most cancer-related deaths are due to metastatic disease, prevention of metastasis is of great clinical priority, currently achieved via earlier ablative surgery with systemic neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Due to the lack of distinct anatomical barriers in the peritoneal cavity, HGSOC metastases characteristically result in early and widespread disease at distal peritoneal sites, with exfoliating HGSOC cells transported via the physiological peritoneal fluid, and disseminating within the abdominal cavity.

In 66% of cases, HGSOC occurs bilaterally and often synchronously, affecting both ovaries. However, origins and relatedness of the HGSOC tumours present in each ovary remain unclear. It is debated whether they are independent primary tumours from multifocal oncogenesis, arising spontaneously from a similar genetic background, clonally related due to tumorigenesis initiating from one ovary and then metastasising to the contralateral ovary, or two metastases. Although some studies have revealed clonal relationships between the two tumours in patients, limited information is available on the genomic landscape spurring both bilateral and unilateral HGSOC evolution and metastatic processes.

Deep spatial and longitudinal sequencing studies of primary tumours and matched metastases can successfully establish the history of somatic and genetic events, allowing the dissemination and establishment of the new founding tumour cells at distant sites by increasing metastatic potential. Like tumour evolution, many competing models of metastasis exist, some of which include the linear progression model, where metastases arise from late-occurring advanced clonal subpopulations; parallel progression, suggesting early metastatic seeding and the independent acquisition of primary tumour mutations, with widespread disease at an early time point, and metastasis cross-seeding, where clones from distinct metastatic sites, not present in the primary tumour, can disseminate to a new metastatic site.

### Peritoneal spread of ovarian cancer harbors therapeutic vulnerabilities regulated by FOXM1 and EGFR / ERBB2 signaling [^113Y1e4G]. Cancer Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Peritoneal spread is the primary mechanism of metastasis of ovarian cancer, and survival of ovarian cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity as nonadherent spheroids and their adherence to the mesothelium of distant organs lead to cancer progression, metastasis, and mortality. However, the mechanisms that govern this metastatic process in ovarian cancer cells remain poorly understood. In this study, we cultured ovarian cancer cell lines in adherent and nonadherent conditions in vitro and analyzed changes in mRNA and protein levels to identify mechanisms of tumor cell survival and proliferation in adherent and nonadherent cells. EGFR or ERBB2 upregulated ZEB1 in nonadherent cells, which caused resistance to cell death and increased tumor-initiating capacity. Conversely, Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) was required for the induction of integrin β1, integrin-α V, and integrin-α 5 for adhesion of cancer cells. FOXM1 also upregulated ZEB1, which could act as a feedback inhibitor of FOXM1, and caused the transition of adherent cells to nonadherent cells. Strikingly, the combinatorial treatment with lapatinib [dual kinase inhibitor of EGFR (ERBB1) and ERBB2] and thiostrepton (FOXM1 inhibitor) reduced growth and peritoneal spread of ovarian cancer cells more effectively than either single-agent treatment in vivo. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that FOXM1 and EGFR/ERBB2 pathways are key points of vulnerability for therapy to disrupt peritoneal spread and adhesion of ovarian cancer cells. SIGNIFICANCE: This study describes the mechanism exhibited by ovarian cancer cells required for adherent cell transition to nonadherent form during peritoneal spread and metastasis.

### Models of endometriosis and their utility in studying progression to ovarian clear cell carcinoma [^116nao6s]. The Journal of Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Mouse models of epithelial ovarian cancer

It is now understood that ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease originating from different epithelial cells in the Müllerian tract, which show marked tropism for spread and growth on the ovary. As early as 1925, Sampson recognized this and said of ovarian endometriotic lesions: "The ovarian implants are usually more active than the latter (peritoneal), thus suggesting that ovarian tissue is the most fertile soil" 16. Thus, any ovarian cancer model used to study the development of the disease should take into account the tissue or cell of origin and the environmental cues that may determine growth at ectopic sites. Recent elegant studies have begun to shed light on the mechanisms which may explain why the ovary is the favoured site for tumour deposition and invasion 67. Labelled ovarian cancer‐initiating cells (OTICs) were injected into the uterine horns of superovulated mice. As early as 5 days later, fluorescent signal could be detected around the ovary by in vivo imaging. Histological examination showed labelled cells close to site of the corpus luteum and disrupted epithelium. After 10 days, the cancer cells had invaded the ovarian stroma, leaving an intact ovarian epithelium. While this experiment used OTICs derived from high‐grade serous carcinoma, it demonstrates that these cells are attracted to the ovary. This is likely to be the case for the other types of epithelial ovarian cancers whose cells of origin are different but which lodge in the 'fertile soil' of the ovary.

### Simultaneously detected endometrial and ovarian carcinomas – a prospective clinicopathologic study of 74 cases: a gynecologic oncology group study [^114TFxtB]. Gynecologic Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

The coexistence of carcinomas of the endometrium and ovary occurs in about 10% of women with ovarian carcinoma. It is often unclear whether this represents synchronous primary tumors or metastasis from endometrium to ovary, or from ovary to endometrium; consequently, staging, therapy, and expected outcome are uncertain. The Gynecologic Oncology Group sought to study patients with simultaneously detected adenocarcinomas in the endometrium and ovary with disease grossly confined to the pelvis to explore the possible correlation among discrete tumor subsets, natural history, and survival.

Methods

Between 1985 and 1991, 85 patients were prospectively enrolled, of whom 74 were eligible. All were initially treated with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and staging laparotomy, with radiation and chemotherapy left to the discretion of the treating physician and patient. Fifteen pathologic variables were examined to identify differences in tumor behavior.

Results

Of the 74 patients, 23 (31%) had microscopic spread of tumor in the pelvis or abdomen. Sixty-four (86%) patients had endometrioid carcinomas in both the endometrium and the ovary, and endometriosis was found in the ovary of 23 (31%) patients. There was concordance between the histologic grade of the tumor in the ovary and the uterus in 51 (69%) patients. The estimated probability of recurrence 5 years following staging surgery is 15.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.7–25.2%). The presence of metastasis discriminated two groups of patients that experienced different probabilities of recurrence within 5 years: 10.0% (95% CI: 4.32–21.3%) for those with tumors confined to the uterus and ovary and 27.1% (95% CI: 13.0–48.5%) for those with metastasis (hazard ratio = 4.6, P = 0.006). The histologic grades of ovarian and uterine tumors also distinguished groups of patients with different probabilities of recurrence at 5 years: 8.0% (95% CI: 2.8–21.3%) for those patients with no more than grade 1 disease at either site and 22.4% (95% CI: 11.8–38.4%) for those with a higher grade in either the ovary or the endometrium (hazard ratio = 3.1, P = 0.047). The estimated overall probability of surviving 5 years is 85.9% and that of surviving 10 years is 80.3%.

Conclusion

The prognosis for women with simultaneously detected carcinomas in the uterus and ovary with gross disease confined to the pelvis is surprisingly good, particularly for those with disease microscopically limited to the uterus and ovary or of low histologic grade.

### Noninvasive and invasive staging of ovarian cancer: review of the literature [^115txnEu]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The use of F-18 FDG PET/CT in the characterization of doubtful adnexal findings and in the staging of ovarian cancer is being extensively evaluated. The purpose of our article is to review the literature and to add our experience to the published works. We concluded that F-18 FDG PET/CT could represent an important method in addition to other imaging modalities (transvaginal ultrasound-, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography) in the characterization of adnexal masses and in the staging of ovarian cancer patients, particularly in assessing the presence of extra-abdominal metastatic spread.

### Fallopian tube metastases of non-gynaecological origin: a series of 20 cases emphasizing patterns of involvement including intra-epithelial spread [^114KgAa6]. Histopathology (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the frequency and distribution of Fallopian tube involvement in patients with ovarian metastases of non-gynaecological origin.

Methods and Results

All Fallopian tube tissue was processed for histological examination in a consecutive series of 31 patients with ovarian metastases of non-gynaecological origin. The most common primary sites were appendix (n = 10) colon (n = 7), stomach (n = 6) and breast (n = 4). Twenty cases (65%) showed at least one type of tubal spread. Mural involvement was most common (14 cases) but serosal, intra-vascular, intra-epithelial and intra-lumenal spread were also identified in 12, 9, 8 and 11 cases respectively. Intra-epithelial involvement was restricted to the fimbrial epithelium and mimicked tubal carcinoma in situ (CIS) architecturally. Pagetoid invasion was noted in two of the cases.

Conclusions

The Fallopian tubes are commonly involved in patients who have neoplasms metastatic to the ovaries. Metastases may show a CIS-like pattern of intra-epithelial spread and therefore small serous CIS-type lesions may not represent proof of tubal tumour origin in patients who have high-stage pelvic serous carcinomas. The frequency of intra-lumenal tumour cells supports transtubal spread as a likely mechanism for mucosal involvement by metastatic tumours involving the lower genital tract.

### Management of ovarian cancer: a 75-year-old woman who has completed treatment [^117Grbxr]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Ovarian cancer includes primary tumors of epithelial, sex cord-stromal, or germ cell origin as well as metastatic tumors that frequently originate in the gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 90% of ovarian cancer is epithelial in origin and constitutes a major therapeutic challenge because of its advanced stage of presentation in most patients. Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy and the fifth most common cause of female cancer death in the United States, with approximately 1 in 70 women developing this disease in their lifetime. Several important advances in surgical and medical management of this disease have led to prolongation of survival and improvement of quality of life of patients with ovarian cancer. Using the case of Ms W, we discuss the signs, symptoms, risk factors, and prognostic factors of epithelial ovarian cancer; review the evidence for surgical and postoperative medical management; and present the current recommendations for screening and follow-up.

### Metastatic malignancies to the ovaries [^11193xaL]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

Between 5% and 30% of malignant neoplasms involving the ovary are metastatic. A variety of neoplasms can metastasize to the ovary, including those from the colorectum, endometrium, breast, appendix, stomach, and cervix.

Objective —

To summarize the clinical, gross, and histologic features that aid in distinguishing primary ovarian neoplasms from metastatic neoplasms. Additionally, to discuss the immunohistochemical features that help identify the primary site of origin.

Data Sources —

Sources include literature review and cases identified from the authors' practice.

Conclusions —

There are many features that can help distinguish a primary ovarian neoplasm from a metastatic lesion. The patient's clinical symptoms and history may suggest the primary site. On radiology, the absence of ascites is suggestive of metastasis. Laboratory tests such as cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are helpful in distinguishing a primary versus metastatic neoplasm. Gross features that favor metastasis are bilaterality and small tumor size. Metastatic lesions often have multinodular growth and involve the surface or superficial cortex. Histologic features favoring metastasis include a nodular or infiltrative pattern, stromal desmoplasia, hilar involvement, lymphovascular invasion, and an absence of benign or borderline components. The presence of extracellular mucin and signet ring cells also suggests metastasis. Distinct histologic features can be suggestive of the primary site. Immunohistochemical stains, such as cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK20, SATB homeobox 2 (SATB2), p16, paired box 8 (PAX8), WT1 transcription factor (WT1), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3), can also be useful in evaluating the site of origin. Distinguishing between a primary ovarian tumor and metastasis is critical for determining prognosis and treatment.

### Metastases to the ovary arising from endometrial, cervical and fallopian tube cancer: recent advances [^112oY17G]. Histopathology (2020). Medium credibility.

The introduction of genomic studies has enabled assessment of the clonality of synchronous tumours involving the ovary and other sites in the female genital tract in a definitive way. This has led to the abandonment of conventional approaches to primary site assignment, and the recognition that most such synchronous neoplasms are clonally related single tumours with metastatic spread, rather than independent primary tumours. These discoveries have implications for diagnostic practice, analogous to the gradual change over the last few decades in our approach to mucinous neoplasms of the ovary metastatic from the gastrointestinal tract. In this review, we first examine the routes of metastasis to the ovary, and then discuss the diagnostic and clinical implications of concurrent ovarian carcinomas arising in combination with endometrial, endocervical and tubal carcinomas. It is proposed that cases of primary low-grade endometrioid endometrial carcinoma with a secondary unilateral ovarian tumour, both with indolent characteristics, may be classified as 'FIGO stage IIIA-simulating independent primary tumours', with a comment that conservative management would be appropriate. It should be recognised that human papillomavirus-associated endocervical adenocarcinomas may result in synchronous or metachronous ovarian metastases that appear to be unrelated to the primary tumour, and that these may be managed conservatively in the absence of other sites of disease. In cases of tubo-ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma, tubal intraepithelial or contralateral adnexal involvement should count as a pelvic disease site for staging purposes.

### The peritoneal tumour microenvironment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer [^115943c4]. The Journal of Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

There may be controversy about the cell and tissue origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC), but there is no doubt that by the time of diagnosis, this most common and lethal of the 'ovarian' malignancies has spread extensively throughout the peritoneal space, presenting a fundamental clinical problem. After optimal cytoreduction by surgery and chemotherapy, many microscopic nodules remain, and in these areas chemoresistant cells may develop. The reason why high-grade serous cancers are only detected once they have spread throughout the peritoneum is that small asymptomatic primary lesions, whether they develop on the surface of the ovary or the distal fimbria of the Fallopian tube, are able to generate multiple micro-metastases by the dissemination of malignant cells into the peritoneum.

There is as yet no appropriate genetic model of HGSC that accurately recapitulates the p53 mutation and general genomic instability characteristic of this malignancy, but intraperitoneal injection of malignant cells in xenogeneic or syngeneic models generates large intraperitoneal tumours and ascites fluid with tumour growth usually measured by bioluminescent imaging of luciferase-transfected cells or weight of macroscopic resected tumours–. The development of microscopic peritoneal metastases has not been studied in detail and it is not known if this is a valid model for the human situation. Our aim was to study the natural history and cellular composition of peritoneal metastases in mouse models and relate our findings to the human disease. We conclude that this clinical problem can be reproduced in mouse models; describe techniques that could enhance our understanding of peritoneal tumour spread and be useful in the development of novel treatments; and show how shRNA to the chemokine receptor CXCR4 had a significant effect on the development of intraperitoneal tumour deposits.

### Renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the ovary or fallopian tube: a clinicopathological study of 9 cases [^111V3rFX]. Human Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common type of kidney cancer in adult, rarely metastasizes to the ovary or fallopian tube, and most cases published in the literature were case reports. Herein, we describe the clinicopathological features of 9 cases of RCC metastatic to the ovary (n = 8) or the fallopian tube (n = 1). The patients' age at the onset of primary renal tumor was available in 8 patients, ranging from 37 to 73 years (mean, 51 years; median, 50 years). Ovarian metastasis was detected prior to or concurrently with the primary renal tumors in 3 patients, and after the diagnosis of renal tumors in 6 patients. The histotypes of the RCCs were clear cell (n = 7), chromophobe (n = 1), and unclassified (n = 1). Immunohistochemical stainings were performed on the sections containing metastatic tumors in 4 cases. Interestingly, pagetoid intraepithelial spread in the tubal mucosa was observed in the case of RCC metastatic to the fallopian tube. Among the 8 patients with follow-up data, 5 died of disease and 3 were alive with disease, with a follow-up period ranging from 3.7 months to 17 years (mean, 77 months; median, 53 months) after the diagnosis of primary kidney tumors. Diagnostically, metastatic RCC may mimic primary ovarian tumors clinically, morphologically, or immunophenotypically. Pathologists should also keep in mind that both ovarian and kidney tumors express PAX8 and PAX2, the markers commonly used to diagnose metastatic RCC. In addition, chromophobe RCC only rarely metastasizes, but it can be a diagnostic challenge when it metastasizes to the ovary.

### The disparate origins of ovarian cancers: pathogenesis and prevention strategies [^111ppaRB]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2017). Medium credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the fifth cause of cancer-related death in women and comprises a histologically and genetically broad range of tumours, including those of epithelial, sex cord-stromal and germ cell origin. Recent evidence indicates that high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma and endometrioid carcinoma primarily arise from tissues that are not normally present in the ovary. These histogenetic pathways are informing risk-reduction strategies for the prevention of ovarian and ovary-associated cancers and have highlighted the importance of the seemingly unique ovarian microenvironment.

### Metastatic neoplasms involving the ovary: a review with an emphasis on morphological and immunohistochemical features [^112AjUoA]. Histopathology (2005). Low credibility.

The ovary is a common site of metastatic tumour. In many cases of ovarian metastasis there is a known history of malignancy but in other cases the ovarian tumour is the first manifestation of disease. In this review metastatic colorectal, appendiceal, gastric, breast, pancreatic and biliary tract, hepatocellular, renal, transitional and cervical carcinomas and metastatic malignant melanoma involving the ovary are discussed, as is the issue of synchronous ovarian and endometrial carcinomas. Peritoneal tumours, including primary peritoneal carcinoma, mesothelioma and intra-abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumour, involving the ovary are also discussed, together with a variety of other rare, metastatic ovarian neoplasms. Many metastatic adenocarcinomas involving the ovary, especially those exhibiting mucinous differentiation, closely mimic primary ovarian adenocarcinomas with morphologically bland areas simulating benign and borderline cystadenoma. This is referred to as a maturation phenomenon. In recent years immunohistochemistry, especially but not exclusively differential cytokeratin (CK7 and CK20) staining, has been widely used as an aid to distinguish between a primary and secondary ovarian adenocarcinoma. While immunohistochemistry undoubtedly has a valuable role to play and is paramount in diagnosis in some cases, the results must be interepreted with caution, especially in mucinous tumours, and within the relevant clinical context. We feel the significance of differential cytokeratin staining is not always understood by histopathologists and this can result in erroneous interpretation. We critically discuss the value of immunohistochemistry and associated pitfalls with each tumour type described.

### The untapped potential of ascites in ovarian cancer research and treatment [^114WF9Q2]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Ascites and metastasis

While metastasis from ovarian cancer can occur via a haematogenous routeor lymphatic routes, most ovarian cancers primarily spread across the peritoneal cavity. This transcoelomic spread facilitates a more efficient process of metastasis, as malignant cells follow the dynamics of the peritoneal fluid to the squamous epithelium that lines the cavity — the mesothelial lining — where they will seed. This 'passive' metastasis results in the distribution of cellular deposits preferentially in areas where fluid accumulates within the peritoneum when in the supine position (the Pouch of Douglas and right subphrenic region), as well as in areas with constant and extensive exposure to peritoneal fluid (the omentum). This facilitated metastasis results in the common occurrence of peritoneal carcinomatosis, a more diffuse and widespread form of metastasis that negatively influences surgical resectability.

Malignant ascitic fluid is rich in tumour-promoting cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and proteinases and, as such, is considered a unique form of the tumour microenvironment, a feature recognised for its importance in metastasis (as well as in chemoresistance, discussed below). Cell-free supernatant extracted from the malignant ascites of ovarian cancer patients has been shown to promote the metastatic process by reducing the strength of tight-junctions (through downregulation of the expression of E-cadherin, connexin 43, occludin, and desmoglein) between mesothelial cells, thereby assisting transmesothelial migration. There is also broader evidence that ascites is involved in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), by shifting cancer cells towards a stem-cell-like phenotype. Cancer stem cells have the capacity to self-renew and differentiate, reducing their vulnerability to chemotherapy, especially in spheroids.EMT has been consistently implicated as a major contributor to ovarian cancer invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance.

Ovarian cancer metastasis and organ tropism for the adipose-rich omentum

Ovarian cancer is characterized by rapid proliferative growth, peritoneal disseminated metastasis, and malignant ascites within the intraperitoneal cavity. The biological mechanisms that regulate ovarian cancer metastasis are distinctive and notably different from the classic mechanisms of hematogenous metastasis that frequently occurs in most solid cancers. In certain cancers, such as breast, lung, liver, colorectal, and prostate cancers, the metastatic cascade represents a multifaceted process that includes local invasion, intravasation, survival in circulation, extravasation, and metastatic colonization at distant metastatic sites. Thereby, cancer cells frequently encounter with a number of environmentally grueling challenges. In ovarian cancer, peritoneal disseminated metastasis seems to be easier because of the lack of anatomical barriers around the primary ovarian cancer in the milieu of the peritoneal cavity. Upon successful detachment from primary tumor, ovarian cancer cells can survive by forming multicellular spheroids with some stromal components, which float in the specific microenvironment of ascitic fluid, and then metastasize predominantly to the omentum and peritoneum via a direct mechanism. This phenomenon leads to multiple disseminated tumors within the intraperitoneal cavity.

In the metastatic process, the phenomenon wherein cells of particular types of cancer preferentially colonize only a limited subset of target organs is defined as "organ tropism", which is classically referred to as the "seed and soil" hypothesis. Previous studies and clinical observations have highlighted the fact that ovarian cancer cells inherently possess a distinct metastatic tropism for the adipose-rich omentum and peritoneal surfaces. The omentum is a large fold of visceral peritoneum covering the intestine anteriorly in the abdominal cavity. As a central modulator of peritoneal homeostasis, the omentum regulates inflammation, controls fluid exchange, promotes angiogenesis, acts as a source of stem cells and various immune cells, and stores and supplies lipids in the peritoneal milieu. The metastatic behavior of ovarian cancer with tropism for the omentum indicates that the intraperitoneal metastatic microenvironment centering on the omentum plays a critical role in driving metastatic progression of ovarian cancer cells.

### Lethal, malignant, metastatic struma ovarii [^114A6ceZ]. Thyroid (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Struma ovarii (SO) is extremely rare, with less than 200 reported cases in the medical literature. SO is defined by the presence of an ovarian tumor containing thyroid tissue as the predominant cell type. Malignant transformation is rare and lethal cases of SO are even rarer. We report on a patient presenting with left ovarian cystic SO and lethal outcome.

Summary

A 45-year-old woman was diagnosed with a follicular variant of papillary carcinoma on laparotomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy. She had persistently elevated serum thyroglobulin following total thyroidectomy + radioiodine and second-look surgery. Imaging scan analysis showed pelvic tumor recurrence and hypervascular liver metastases during follow-up as well as peritoneal carcinomatosis in the pelvis, right abdominal wall, and malignant ascites. The patient died from cachexia at 37 months after diagnosis.

Conclusions

Such an aggressive malignant disease and lethal course of SO is rare. Total thyroidectomy is mandatory to exclude a primary thyroid neoplasm and for radioiodine therapy and follow-up. SO may spread to contralateral ovary, pelvic nodes, peritoneum, liver, lungs, and bones through hematogeneous spread, which is different from the dissemination pattern of papillary thyroid carcinomas. Imaging highlights the mixed behavior of this ovarian tumor.

10.1 Management of low malignant potential (borderline) tumors

Compared with invasive epithelial cancers, borderline tumors tend to affect a younger population and constitute 15% of all epithelial tumors of the ovary. Nearly 75% of these are Stage I at the time of diagnosis. The following can be said for these tumors:
The diagnosis must be based on the pathology of the primary tumor.
Extensive sectioning of the tumor is necessary to rule out invasive cancer.
The prognosis of these tumors is extremely good, with a 10‐year survival of about 95%.
Invasive cancers that arise in borderline tumors are often indolent and generally have a low response to platinum‐based chemotherapy.
Spontaneous regression of peritoneal implants has been observed.
Early stage, serous histology, and younger age at diagnosis are associated with a more favorable prognosis.
Although gross residual disease after primary laparotomy is associated with poorer prognosis, mortality from the disease remains low.
Those patients who have invasive implants in the omentum or other distant sites are more likely to recur earlier. The role of cytotoxic chemotherapy is questionable as the response rates are low.

The causes of death include complications of disease (e.g. small bowel obstruction) or complications of therapy, and only rarely malignant transformation. The mainstay of treatment is primary surgical staging and cytoreduction. For patients with Stage I disease who want to preserve fertility, conservative surgery with unilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy can be considered after intraoperative inspection of the contralateral ovary to exclude involvement. For patients with only one ovary, or bilateral cystic ovaries, a partial oophorectomy or cystectomy can be considered for fertility preservation. For all other patients, total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy are recommended, with maximal cytoreduction if the disease is metastatic.

Patients with borderline tumors in all stages of disease should be treated with surgery. A small percentage of patients with invasive implants may respond to chemotherapy but the response to chemotherapy is low. Uncommonly, some patients recur early and have higher‐grade invasive cancers and may benefit from chemotherapy.

In patients with late recurrence of the disease, secondary cytoreduction should be considered, and chemotherapy given only if invasive disease is present histologically.

Follow‐up of patients with no evidence of disease is the same as for those with malignant epithelial carcinomas, but at less frequent intervals. If the contralateral ovary has been retained, it should be followed by transvaginal ultrasonography, at least on an annual basis. Level of Evidence C.

### The peritoneum: anatomy, pathologic findings, and patterns of disease spread [^114P4Vfo]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Disease spread in the abdomen and pelvis generally occurs in a predictable pattern in relation to anatomic landmarks and fascial planes. Anatomically, the abdominopelvic cavity is subdivided into several smaller spaces or compartments by key ligaments and fascial planes. The abdominal cavity has been traditionally divided into peritoneal, retroperitoneal, and pelvic extraperitoneal spaces. Recently, more clinically relevant classifications have evolved. Many pathologic conditions affect the abdominal cavity, including traumatic, inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic processes. These abnormalities can extend beyond their sites of origin through various pathways. Identifying the origin of a disease process is the first step in formulating a differential diagnosis and ultimately reaching a final diagnosis. Pathologic conditions differ in terms of pathways of disease spread. For example, simple fluid tracks along fascial planes, respecting anatomic boundaries, while fluid from acute necrotizing pancreatitis can destroy fascial planes, resulting in transfascial spread without regard for anatomic landmarks. Furthermore, neoplastic processes can spread through multiple pathways, with a propensity for spread to noncontiguous sites. When the origin of a disease process is not readily apparent, recognizing the spread pattern can allow the radiologist to work backward and ultimately arrive at the site or source of pathogenesis. As such, a cohesive understanding of the peritoneal anatomy, the typical organ or site of origin for a disease process, and the corresponding pattern of disease spread is critical not only for initial diagnosis but also for establishing a road map for staging, anticipating further disease spread, guiding search patterns and report checklists, determining prognosis, and tailoring appropriate follow-up imaging studies. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Correlation of morphological appearance of peritoneal lesions at laparotomy and disease at pathological assessment in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery for peritoneal malignancy: results of phase I of the PRECINCT study in 707 patients [^114RA9oe]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

'Normal Appearing' Peritoneum

While estimating the sPCI, even regions that are not involved or resected are evaluated, which is why the most common morphologic term used was 'normal peritoneum'. The incidence of occult disease in lesions termed 'normal peritoneum' was 10%, which is in line with previously published reports. We did not make a distinction between regions that were or were not resected as this captures the clinical scenario at CRS and the incidence of occult disease could be higher. Some structures such as the greater omentum are removed in the majority of patients and the lesser omentum is removed in selected patients, even if not directly involved by disease, which explains why normal peritoneal regions were resected in this study.

Variation of Morphological Terms According to the Primary Tumor Type

There was a significant difference in the morphological terms used for different diseases — normal peritoneum was reported in nearly 70% of the regions in patients with gastric cancer (median sPCI-6), but was reported for only 33% of patients with appendiceal tumors and PMP (median sPCI-16) (Table 2). Apart from the extent of disease itself, the reason for the variation could be that different primary tumors produce morphologically different lesions, for example, mucinous lesions in PMP, scarring in ovarian cancer after NACT, plaques in mesothelioma and signet ring cell tumors, and this will be studied in greater detail when the study completes recruitment. The mechanisms of peritoneal spread could have an impact on the morphologic appearance. Trans-lymphatic spread and hematogenous spread are likely to produce more diffuse involvement and miliary disease compared with transcoelomic spread, however this is an unproven assumption.

Future Directive

The main takeaway from this study is that caution should be exercised when resecting regions that the surgeon classifies as 'tumor nodules'. Frozen section could be used more liberally in these cases before performing potentially morbid procedures such as visceral resections or diaphragmatic stripping more so in older and frail patients. The same should be applied to 'morphologically suspicious lesions' such as 'adhesions' and 'scarring'. Using pictorial depiction of various lesions to obtain a consensus among surgeons regarding the most appropriate morphological term for each one, it may be possible in future to limit the number of terms used. It could also help less experienced surgeons in intraoperative decision making.
