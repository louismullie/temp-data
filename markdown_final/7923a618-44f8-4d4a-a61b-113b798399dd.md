## Question

Erethymatus itchy plaques involvaig the back and the legs with high C reactive protein 105

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage a patient with erythematous, itchy plaques on the back and legs and a markedly elevated CRP of 105 mg/L, including a prioritized differential, diagnostic workup, and management plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to interpret the CRP magnitude and what it implies about systemic inflammation. Then, I should categorize the differential by pathophysiology and prioritize entities that typically present with plaques and high CRP. Next, I will outline the immediate diagnostic workup, including targeted labs, imaging, and biopsy strategy. After that, I will propose initial management pathways contingent on the most likely diagnoses, and finally, I will consider special populations and follow-up monitoring, making sure I verify each step against guidelines and key case series as I go.

> Let me first confirm the significance of the CRP value. A CRP of 105 mg/L is profoundly elevated and signals a robust acute-phase response; by comparison, minor CRP elevations of 3–10 mg/L are common in the general population and reflect low-grade inflammation, whereas values above 50–100 mg/L generally indicate significant systemic inflammation and should prompt evaluation for infection, autoinflammatory disease, or malignancy-associated inflammatory states, so I need to ensure I do not undercall this finding [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should organize the differential by pathophysiology to avoid anchoring. The main buckets that fit erythematous plaques with markedly elevated CRP include autoinflammatory and neutrophilic dermatoses, autoimmune connective tissue diseases, infectious mimics, drug-induced eruptions, and neoplastic or infiltrative processes; within these, entities like adult-onset Still's disease, Sweet syndrome, neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis, psoriatic arthritis with pustular or rupioid psoriasis, and cutaneous lymphoma are particularly salient given the morphology and systemic inflammatory burden, so I will prioritize those while keeping broader differentials in view [^1128JUhk] [^115zLJug] [^115FtBRy] [^113WxQow] [^112Fug7o].

> I will now examine adult-onset Still's disease as a top priority. AOSD typically presents with quotidian fevers, arthralgia or arthritis, a transient salmon-pink evanescent rash coinciding with fever spikes, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers including CRP and ferritin; the rash is often truncal and may be urticarial or morbilliform rather than fixed plaques, so I should confirm whether there is a fever pattern and obtain ferritin, CBC with differential, LFTs, and serologies for infection and autoimmunity, while considering that histology can show dermal mucin and dyskeratosis in some cases [^1128JUhk] [^115KAcZF] [^115rEigz].

> Wait, let me verify the possibility of Sweet syndrome. Sweet syndrome presents with tender, erythematous papules, plaques, or nodules on the upper limbs, trunk, and face, often accompanied by fever, neutrophilia, and very high CRP; histology shows a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate with leukocytoclasis, and the eruption can be idiopathic, drug-induced, infection-triggered, or associated with malignancy, so I should check for fever, mucosal involvement, and recent infections or new medications, and plan a biopsy if suspected [^115zLJug] [^1172M8mx].

> Let me consider neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis, especially if the plaques are urticarial, painful or burning, and persist beyond 24 hours. NUD is linked to autoinflammatory pathways and can be seen with SLE or cryopyrinopathies; biopsy shows a neutrophil-rich dermal infiltrate without vasculitis, and patients may have elevated CRP and ferritin, so I should ask about SLE symptoms, check ANA and dsDNA, and consider complement levels, with a low threshold to biopsy if lesions persist or are atypical for ordinary urticaria [^115FtBRy] [^113Fasom] [^114n42GP].

> Next, I should review psoriatic arthritis with pustular or rupioid morphology. PsA can present with diffuse plaques and systemic inflammation; rupioid psoriasis features thick, "dirty" hyperkeratotic crusts and may track with high CRP and PsA activity, and prospective data suggest higher baseline hsCRP predicts future PsA in psoriasis cohorts, so I need to screen for joint symptoms, dactylitis, and enthesitis, and obtain a rheumatology referral if suspected [^113WxQow] [^116QTmt4] [^116ZeqLH].

> But wait, what if this is a cutaneous lymphoma masquerading as inflammatory plaques. Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type, can mimic cellulitis or deep inflammatory plaques and may present with firm, infiltrated lesions and only modest CRP elevation, yet missing it delays oncologic therapy; I should palpate for nodes, obtain a deep incisional biopsy if lesions are indurated or atypical, and consider PET-CT if lymphoma is suspected [^112Fug7o] [^113mMZbm].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook infectious mimics. Chronic bacterial infections, including atypical mycobacterial disease, can present with indurated plaques and elevated CRP; in immunocompromised hosts or those with refractory "cellulitis", I should obtain tissue for culture and PCR, and consider mycobacterial and fungal stains, especially if there is a history of immunosuppression or nonresolving lesions despite antibiotics [^115pxBMv].

> Let me first confirm the immediate diagnostic workup. I should obtain CBC with differential, ESR, ferritin, comprehensive metabolic panel including liver enzymes, uric acid, ANA with dsDNA and ENAs, rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP, complement C3/C4, infectious serologies including HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis, urinalysis, and a chest radiograph if systemic symptoms are present; if AOSD is suspected, I should add ferritin and consider IL-18, and if lymphoma is on the table, I should obtain LDH and consider PET-CT [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the biopsy strategy. For suspected neutrophilic dermatoses or AOSD, a 4 mm punch biopsy from an active plaque should be obtained and sent for H&E; if urticarial vasculitis or NUD is suspected, I should request direct immunofluorescence and request that the pathologist evaluate for vasculitis, leukocytoclasis, dermal mucin, and dyskeratosis, as these features guide the differential toward Sweet syndrome, AOSD, or NUD respectively [^115zLJug] [^115KAcZF] [^115FtBRy].

> Next, I should review initial management contingencies while awaiting results. If AOSD is strongly suspected, early systemic corticosteroids are standard, with IL-1 blockade such as anakinra or canakinumab considered for refractory or steroid-dependent disease; canakinumab has robust data normalizing CRP and sustaining remission in cryopyrinopathies and has been used in Still's disease, so I should involve rheumatology early for targeted therapy selection [^1128JUhk] [^112J92gb].

> If Sweet syndrome is diagnosed, I should initiate systemic corticosteroids promptly, as response is typically rapid; steroid-sparing agents such as colchicine, dapsone, or potassium iodide can be considered for recurrences or steroid intolerance, and I must evaluate for underlying triggers including drugs, infections, and malignancy given established associations [^115zLJug] [^1172M8mx].

> If psoriatic arthritis with severe skin and joint disease is confirmed, I should escalate beyond topical therapy to conventional DMARDs such as methotrexate or targeted biologics per guideline-based treat-to-target principles, recognizing that high CRP supports systemic inflammation and may correlate with worse outcomes, and coordinate care with rheumatology for joint assessment and monitoring [^116QTmt4] [^115kYweU].

> If cutaneous lymphoma is diagnosed, I should refer urgently to hematology-oncology for staging and chemoimmunotherapy, as delays worsen prognosis; early recognition and tissue diagnosis are critical when lesions are indurated, persistent, or refractory to anti-inflammatory therapy [^112Fug7o] [^113mMZbm].

> I should double-check special populations and modifiers. In elderly patients, presentations may be atypical and CRP can be blunted or nonspecific, so I must maintain a high index of suspicion for infection, drug-induced eruptions, and malignancy; in patients with a history of malignancy or new medications, paraneoplastic Sweet syndrome or drug-induced neutrophilic eruptions should be prioritized, prompting medication review and age-appropriate cancer screening [^115NBkaG] [^115zLJug].

> Let me reconsider the role of CRP in follow-up. CRP is a dynamic marker of inflammation and can track response to therapy in autoinflammatory states; in AOSD and Sweet syndrome, serial CRP helps gauge disease control and taper decisions, whereas in psoriatic disease, CRP elevation may be absent in up to half of patients despite active disease, so I should integrate CRP with clinical and imaging assessments rather than relying on it in isolation [^1128JUhk] [^115zLJug] [^115kYweU].

> In summary, I need to ensure a structured approach: confirm the magnitude of CRP and its implications, prioritize AOSD, Sweet syndrome, NUD, psoriatic arthritis with pustular or rupioid features, and cutaneous lymphoma, pursue targeted labs, imaging when indicated, and a diagnostic biopsy, and initiate disease-appropriate therapy in parallel with evaluation for triggers and associated conditions; this balances timeliness with diagnostic rigor and reduces the risk of missing high-stakes diagnoses [^1128JUhk] [^115zLJug] [^116QTmt4] [^112Fug7o].

The most likely diagnosis is **psoriasis** (plaque or erythrodermic) given erythematous, itchy plaques on the back and legs with markedly elevated CRP, which reflects systemic inflammation [^112XbXBc] [^1179az9i]. Other considerations include **psoriatic arthritis** [^116QTmt4], **cutaneous T-cell lymphoma** [^111e4ubN], and **drug-induced eruption** [^113NBgAy]; however, psoriasis best fits the clinical and laboratory picture. Confirm with **skin biopsy** and assess for psoriatic arthritis with joint exam and imaging if indicated.

## Differential diagnosis

| **Diagnosis** | **Clinical features** | **Laboratory findings** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Psoriasis (plaque or erythrodermic) | Erythematous, scaly, itchy plaques on trunk and extremities; may be widespread | Elevated CRP, ESR; normal or mildly elevated ferritin | Common inflammatory skin disease; CRP reflects systemic inflammation [^115fXsEM] [^115jai1d] |
| Psoriatic arthritis | Psoriatic skin lesions with joint pain, stiffness, dactylitis | Elevated CRP, ESR; negative RF and anti-CCP | Inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis; CRP correlates with disease activity [^116QTmt4] [^115kYweU] |
| Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) | Erythematous, scaly plaques or patches; chronic, persistent | Elevated CRP, ESR; atypical lymphocytes on biopsy | Rare; biopsy essential for diagnosis [^notfound] |
| Drug-induced eruption | Erythematous, pruritic rash after new medication | Elevated CRP, eosinophilia possible | History of new medication exposure [^113NBgAy] |
| Erythrodermic psoriasis | Generalized erythema, scaling, pruritus, systemic symptoms | Markedly elevated CRP, ESR, leukocytosis | Severe psoriasis variant; high CRP expected [^115fXsEM] [^112XbXBc] |

## Pathophysiology of elevated CRP in dermatological conditions

CRP is an acute-phase reactant produced by the liver in response to IL-6–driven inflammation; in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, **IL-6/TNF-α/IL-17** pathways drive systemic inflammation and elevated CRP, reflecting disease activity and predicting progression to psoriatic arthritis [^116ZeqLH] [^115kYweU].

---

## Recommended diagnostic workup

- **Skin biopsy**: Confirm psoriasis vs mimics (e.g. CTCL, drug eruption); look for acanthosis, parakeratosis, dermal inflammation [^113WxQow].
- **Joint assessment**: Examine for psoriatic arthritis; consider imaging if symptoms suggest arthritis [^113pWDiL].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR, ferritin, rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, ANA, hepatitis B/C, HIV, metabolic panel, uric acid [^115kYweU].
- **Imaging**: Consider joint imaging if psoriatic arthritis suspected [^113pWDiL].

---

## Management strategies

- **Topical therapy**: High-potency corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, topical calcineurin inhibitors [^notfound].
- **Systemic therapy**: Methotrexate, acitretin, cyclosporine, or biologics (TNF-α inhibitors, IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors) for moderate-to-severe disease or psoriatic arthritis [^115kYweU].
- **Supportive care**: Emollients, antipruritics, patient education [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Psoriasis is chronic with relapses; high CRP indicates active systemic inflammation and increases risk of **psoriatic arthritis**, **cardiovascular disease**, and metabolic syndrome. Effective control of skin and joint disease improves prognosis and reduces systemic complications [^notfound].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **psoriasis** (plaque or erythrodermic) given erythematous, itchy plaques with markedly elevated CRP; confirm with biopsy and assess for psoriatic arthritis.

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Fever|- Typically spiking with temperature ≥ 39 °C for at least 7 days|
|Rash|- Transient and often coincides with fever spikes, preferentially involving trunk <br/> - Typically erythematous (salmon pink), but other rashes (such as urticarial) may be consistent with the diagnosis|
|Musculoskeletal involvement|- Usually presents with arthralgia/myalgia <br/> - Overt arthritis is supportive but not necessary for diagnosis and may appear later|
|Inflammation markers|- Typically identified by neutrophilic leucocytosis, increased serum CRP and ferritin.|

### Urticaria and a rare mutation: an unusual case of neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis [^113Fasom]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 59-year-old white woman with a medical history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (treated with dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), renal cell carcinoma (status post partial nephrectomies), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypothyroidism presented to clinic with a 10-month history of a painful skin eruption, polyarthralgia, fevers, and fatigue. A review of systems also found that she had bilateral partial sensorineural hearing loss. On physical examination, there were large, red, thin, erythematous plaques on the flanks, lateral thighs, abdomen, and lower legs (Fig 1). The patient reported that lesions persisted for 24 to 72 hours. Initially, allergic contact dermatitis was diagnosed. However, her symptoms persisted despite use of antihistamines and topical steroids and avoiding allergens. At a subsequent visit, a biopsy was performed which found a primarily dermal infiltrate composed of perivascular, perieccrine, and interstitial neutrophils with focal leukocytoclasia. Neither vasculitis nor edema was observed (Fig 2, A and B). Serology testing found an elevated C-reactive protein and mildly elevated ferritin. Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear Antibodies, cyclic citrullinated peptide, complements, and urine and serum protein electrophoreses were all unremarkable. Ultimately, genetic testing found that the patient had a unique heterozygous mutation in NLRP3 (c. 1976C > A). Neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis associated with a cryopyrin-associated disorder was the final diagnosis. Dasatinib was held, dapsone was initiated, and the patient's symptoms resolved.

### Multiple granulomatous dermatitides in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis [^113F2hMW]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Case report

A woman in her 70s was referred for a 20-year history of progressive skin disease consisting of annular plaques on her trunk and extremities, atrophic plaques on her legs, and painful subcutaneous nodules on her hands and feet (Fig 1). She complained of mild shortness of breath, polyarthralgias, and numbness and tingling of the lower extremities consistent with a sensory peripheral neuropathy. She had 2 episodes of ocular necrotizing scleritis that resolved with high-dose prednisone.

Physical examination found extensive pink scaly annular plaques on her upper back, arms, and legs; nodules on the dorsal hands and fingers overlying joints; and atrophic, orange-brown and hyperpigmented plaques on the lower shins as well as a symmetric polyarthritis. She also had transient red-brown subcutaneous nodules on the lower legs.

Laboratory blood analysis found a leukocyte count of 18.5 thousand/μL (normal, 3.8–10.8 thousand/μL) with a serum eosinophilia count of 4736 cells per microliter (normal, 15–500 cells per microliter) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 2.8 mg/L (normal, < 1 mg/L). Negative examinations included antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, urinalysis, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, anticitrullinated protein antibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and chest radiograph. Pulmonary function tests found mild restrictive and obstructive lung disease. Hand radiograph found erosions involving the distal fifth metacarpals bilaterally.

Histologic examination of the annular plaques and nodules on the dorsal hands and upper back found palisading granulomatous inflammation with mucinous degeneration of collagen consistent with granuloma annulare, whereas biopsy findings of the nodules on the right lower leg were consistent with erythema nodosum (Fig 2, A and B). Histologic evaluation of the papules overlying the joint spaces found palisaded histiocytes around eosinophilic material consistent with rheumatoid nodules (Fig 2, C). Histologic examination of the atrophic, hyperpigmented plaque on the shin found interstitial granulomatous infiltrate involving the superficial and deep dermis with layering of inflammatory infiltrate and dense hyalinized collagen consistent with necrobiosis lipoidica (not shown).

### Case of lichen planus with unusual features [^116EZYM7]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 25-year-old woman came with an itchy red rash on her back since 2years ago. This lesion then extended to the abdomen, arms and legs. From the patient's back, we found irregular linear hyperpigmented patches with some of the edges in the form of hyperpigmented plaques. On the abdomen, arms and legs, erythema-hyperpigmented plaque and patches were visible along the elevated edges with multiple scattered sizes. Lichen planus (LP) has several types based on various clinical manifestations. The diagnosis of LP can be made based on the clinical appearance and symptoms of pruritus. Many diseases can mimic other diseases so histopathology is used to make the diagnosis. Here, we report a case of LP with unusual features with diagnosis confirmed by histopathological examination. The patient was treated with oral and topical potent corticosteroids with good response.

### Erythrodermic presentation of psoriasis in a patient treated with dupilumab [^115fXsEM]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Report of a case

A woman in her 50s with a history of asthma and atopic dermatitis presented to the Emergency Department with erythroderma. A clinical diagnosis of atopic dermatitis was made by a local dermatologist many years ago, which had been treated with intermittent courses of prednisone. Four months before her presentation to our department, however, new plaques developed that were unlike her usual flares. They involved previously unaffected areas including the midback and anterior legs, were more painful with thicker scale, and did not resolve with a course of prednisone. Two months after the onset of the new eruption, after an initial course of oral steroids did not resolve her rash, her dermatologist initiated dupilumab. Her rash continued to progress over the next 2 months to involve most of her skin. She took no chronic medications and did not have any other new drug exposures.

Upon evaluation, she was tachycardic but afebrile. Skin examination found erythematous plaques involving the trunk and bilateral upper and lower extremities with thick white scale (Fig 1). On dermoscopic examination, few pinpoint pustules were appreciable on the legs and abdomen. Scalp examination found oval pink plaques with thick, adherent scale. The face was relatively spared.

Fig 1
Clinical presentation. Diffuse erythema involving the chest and well-demarcated pink plaques with thick scale on the posterior legs.

Our clinical differential diagnosis included drug-induced psoriasis versus new-onset erythrodermic psoriasis; less likely were acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis or any other cause of erythroderma, including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

Laboratory evaluation was significant for leukocytosis (13,960/μL) with neutrophilia (10,760/μL) and elevated C-reactive protein (12.3 mg/dL) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (31 mm/h). Eosinophils (370/μL, 2.7%) and serum calcium (8.7 mg/dL) were normal. The pustules were not cultured as they were minute.

### Itch and pruritus: what are they, and how should itches be classified? [^115xpg6E]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Itch and pruritus are two terms for the same thing. In this essay I will argue that casting about for a distinction between them creates only confusion. Once that matter is settled, it is still necessary to come up with a clinical classification for itches of different types. No system yet proposed, including the one that will be suggested here, is perfect.

### Mimickers of urticaria: urticarial vasculitis and autoinflammatory diseases [^115FtBRy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

A wide differential diagnosis must be considered in a patient presenting with urticarial plaques. Although acute and chronic urticaria are the commonest diagnoses, other differential diagnoses include polymorphous eruption of pregnancy, mast cell disorders, hypereosinophilic syndrome, urticarial vasculitis, pemphigoid, systemic lupus erythematosus, and autoinflammatory disease. This review will specifically address urticarial vasculitis and autoinflammatory syndromes. These entities represent contrasting examples of urticarial-like lesions resulting from either an adaptive immune complex-mediated mechanism (urticarial vasculitis) or an innate immune-mediated mechanism (autoinflammatory disorders), with differing therapeutic implications. In patients presenting with painful, persistent plaques that last more than 24 hours and resolve with bruising of the skin, consideration should be given to a diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis. A biopsy should be obtained to ascertain this diagnosis. In patients presenting with a persistent history of recurrent urticarial plaques associated with signs of systemic inflammation including fevers and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP]/serum amyloid A, leukocytosis, and negative connective tissue serologies), consideration should be given to autoinflammatory disorders: the 3 cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, Schnitzler syndrome, and familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome 2. Serum protein electrophoresis should be checked to rule out an underlying monoclonal gammopathy.

### A case of ulcerative tuberculous cellulitis in the setting of methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorder [^111k7ohk]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

An 85-year-old woman had been treated with methotrexate (MTX; 8 mg/week) and tacrolimus (2 mg/day) for rheumatoid arthritis for over a year. She had experienced tonsillar swelling 6 weeks before presentation. Her mother had died of TB several decades previously, but the patient had no TB history. Histopathology of a tonsillar biopsy revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-type MTX-LPD and Epstein-Barr-virus–encoded small RNA in situ hybridization. The tonsillar swelling improved immediately following MTX and tacrolimus discontinuation. However, a week later, the patient developed an itchy erythema multiforme-like eruption on her extremities (Fig 1), which was treated with oral prednisolone, starting at 20 mg per day and gradually tapered. She developed a high fever (39.0 °C) and a painful, indurated erythematous plaque on the medial side of her left thigh (Fig 2, A).

Ulcerative tuberculous cellulitis. A, Initial presentation showed painful indurated erythematous plaque on the medial side of the left thigh. B, Suture at the skin biopsy site on the medial side of the left thigh was compromised by an exudative ulcer. C, New ulcer on the back of the left knee.

Laboratory test results revealed an increased C-reactive protein level (11.14 mg/dL; reference range, ≤ 0.3 mg/dL). The cellulitis-like lesion did not improve after prednisolone withdrawal despite a 1-week course of intravenous antibiotics. A skin biopsy of the plaque on the patient's left thigh led to dehiscence at the biopsy site, resulting in ulceration. A few days later, a new ulcer appeared on the medial side of the patient's left thigh and at the back of her left knee (Fig 2, B and C).

### A pustular psoriasis flare treated with calcium supplementation [^112XbXBc]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Physical examination revealed significant leg edema, disseminated erythematous and squamous plaques, numerous sterile pustules on the legs, and onycholysis. The plaques were hyperkeratotic with inflammatory edges. He had numerous pustules on the legs and some plaques on the abdomen and the thighs associated with gross hyperkeratosis, as can be seen in rupioid psoriasis. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score was not calculated, because it was not suited to his partially pustular clinical presentation (Fig 1).

Fig 1
Clinical presentation. A, Disseminated erythematous and squamous plaques. B, Scaly plaques with inflammatory edges on the legs. C, Scaling plaques on the thighs. D, Numerous sterile pustules on the legs.

Physical examination revealed sinus tachycardia and the Trousseau sign (sudden contraction of the fingers and hand into the so-called obstetrical position due to carpal spasms). Laboratory tests revealed significant leukocytosis (12.5 g/L) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (346 mg/L). Albumin and renal function were normal. The remaining laboratory examinations showed severe hypocalcemia (0.96 mmol/L; normal range, 2.2–2.6 mmol/L) and hypomagnesemia (0.62 mmol/L; normal range, 0.7–1.1 mmol/L) and increased levels of creatine phosphokinase (1512 U/L; normal, < 200 U/L) and phosphorus (1.52 mmol/L; normal range, 0.8–1.5 mmol/L). The parathyroid hormone level was low (6 pg/mL; normal range, 9.4–29.8 pg/mL), indicating a diagnosis of primary hypoparathyroidism.

### Diffuse scaly erythematous plaques in patient taking poziotinib [^113NBgAy]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answers:

A. Seborrheic dermatitis – Incorrect. Cutaneous findings of seborrheic dermatitis are characterized by a yellow greasy scale in a seborrheic distribution.
B. Pityrosporum folliculitis – Incorrect. Pityrosporum folliculitis presents with pruritic, fine monomorphic papules and pustules on the face and back and may be confused with acne vulgaris.
C. Drug-induced papulopustular eruption with bacterial superinfection – Correct. Papulopustular drug eruptions, also known as acneiform drug eruptions, are common adverse reactions triggered by chemotherapeutic agents that target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family signaling pathways. Papulopustular drug eruptions usually present as diffuse excoriated erythematous papules and pustules that can coalesce into scaly plaques. Pustules are typically sterile, but significant superinfection can occur.
D. Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome – Incorrect. This condition typically presents as an extensive morbilliform eruption and is often accompanied by lymphadenopathy, fever, pharyngitis, and laboratory-based evidence of end-organ damage.
E. Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis – Incorrect. This condition classically presents as an eruption of papulopustules over erythematous annular plaques with associated pruritus. Other diagnoses with similar morphology, such as acne vulgaris, bacterial folliculitis, dermatophyte infection, mycosis fungoides, seborrheic dermatitis, and rosacea can be excluded with a skin biopsy submitted to potassium hydroxide examination.

### Three distinct cutaneous manifestations of kikuchi-fujimoto's disease and adult-onset stills disease overlap syndrome [^115rEigz]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case details

A previously-well 22-year-old Chinese woman was treated for a 2-month history of daily high-spiking fevers, arthralgias, and fatigue. A physical examination revealed cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy, and flagellate erythematous streaks over the back and flanks (Fig 1). She had no organomegaly, and mucous membranes were spared. Blood tests showed an elevated white blood cell count at 15.8 × 10⁹/L (80.6% neutrophils), elevated inflammatory markers; C-reactive protein of 183 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 58 mm/hr, procalcitonin of 63.5ug/L with hyperferritinemia (ferritin > 33 000 ug/L). She had significantly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase 658 U/L, alanine transaminase 412 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 422 U/L) and lactate dehydrogenase (2292 U/L). Serological markers were positive for anti-Sjögren's-syndrome-related antigen A Ro antibodies (41, positive > 20 RU/mL), antismooth muscle antibody (119, positive > 30 units) and a borderline antinuclear antibody at 1:80 with a homogeneous pattern. Rheumatoid factor was negative and serological markers for connective tissue and autoimmune disorders were unyielding. Schirmer's test was equivocal (left eye 5 mm, right eye 7 mm). Chest radiograph revealed mild bilateral pleural effusions. An extensive infective evaluation was negative. A skin biopsy performed over the right flank during her initial presentation revealed perivascular dermatitis with neutrophils and eosinophils, mild interface changes with mild dermal mucin deposition, supporting the diagnosis of AOSD. Her index rash had healed 1 month into her disease, but she then developed new acral hyperpigmentation involving her distal fingers (Fig 2, A - C). These eventually resolved spontaneously with desquamation. Two months into her illness, a new evanescent maculopapular exanthem erupted (Fig 3, A - C) over her face, neck, torso, and back and limbs, with notable recurrence of flagellate dermatitis over the back. On all 3 cutaneous eruptions, she was noted to be in disease-flare with fevers, arthralgias and elevated inflammatory markers. Submandibular lymph node biopsy during her second flare showed reactive lymphohistiocytic proliferation, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, karyorrhexis and CD68+ crescenteric histiocytes. Neutrophils, granulomas, and malignant cells were notably absent. This suggested early-phase KFD. A liver biopsy was normal. The patient was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral and topical corticosteroids with rapid abatement of fevers and improvement of inflammatory markers and cutaneous lesions. At 3-month follow-up, she developed telogen effluvium, though previous cutaneous manifestations remained quiescent. At 6-month follow-up, she remained disease-free.

### Asymptomatic erythematous plaques on the trunk [^112v346V]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Mycosis fungoides
B. Tumid lupus erythematosus
C. Cutaneous WM
D. Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma
E. Multiple myeloma

Answers:

A. Mycosis fungoides – Incorrect. While patch/plaque stage mycosis fungoides was originally favored clinically, expected histopathologic features include epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes, superficial lichenoid infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes, and/or intraepidermal collections of atypical lymphocytes (Pautrier microabscesses) were not seen.
B. Tumid lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Tumid lupus erythematosus can have violaceous plaques without surface change; however, the lesions are most commonly photo-distributed. Histopathologic examination demonstrates increased dermal mucin and a superficial and deep predominately lymphocytic infiltrate with perieccrine extension.
C. Cutaneous WM – Correct. Our patient's history and biopsy findings are most consistent with cutaneous WM. Cutaneous findings are seen in < 5% of cases and divided into the following 2 categories: (1) specific manifestations secondary to direct neoplastic involvement of the skin and (2) nonspecific manifestations secondary to hyperviscosity and cryoglobulinemia. Infiltration of clonal lymphoplasmacytic cells in the skin, as seen on our patient's biopsy, results in erythematous plaques of variable size, most often on the face/trunk.
D. Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma – Incorrect. While primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma can have a similar clinical presentation, histopathology would demonstrate dermal infiltrates of mature B-cells/plasma cells which can be nodular or diffuse with varying degrees of plasmacytoid differentiation (CD123 expected to be positive). There are also usually lymphoid follicles with reactive germinal centers.
E. Multiple Myeloma – Incorrect. Plasmacytomas in multiple myeloma can have erythematous to violaceous plaques or nodules due to direct infiltration of skin, occasionally emanating from underlying bony foci. Histopathology demonstrates deep dermal and subcutaneous plasma cell infiltrates in sheets that are positive for CD38 and CD138 and negative for B-cell markers.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum developing in a patient treated with dupilumab [^115XRcLz]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 33-year-old man with a history of Hashimoto disease, seasonal allergies, asthma, and severe AD since childhood was started on dupilumab therapy after failure of optimal topical treatment and intolerance to methotrexate. Five months before presentation, he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, which was well controlled with budesonide and 5-aminosalicylic acid.

Two days after his loading dose of dupilumab, he was hospitalized for rapidly progressing lower leg edema, painful ulceration, and worsening skin lesions. Physical examination found extensive eczematous plaques on the face, neck, lower portion of the back, and the flexor surfaces of the elbows and knees. He also developed bilateral ankle arthritis and dactylitis of both big toes and the left second toe (Fig 1, A), a lower leg ulcer, and numerous tender red to purple nodules, some breaking down to form small ulcers (Fig 1, B). The ulcer base was purulent, the borders were undermined and violaceous, and the surrounding skin was erythematous with infiltration and edema (Fig 1, C).

Fig 1
Clinical presentation. A, Dactylitis and bilateral arthritis. B, Tender nodules and a pus-filled vesicle on the inner side of the ankle. C, Ulceration on the lower portion of the left leg with an edematous, violaceous border.

On presentation, the patient was afebrile and his vital signs were stable. He had no abdominal pain nor diarrhea. Complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel, liver profile, and hemostasis tests were normal. The C-reactive protein level was elevated (63 mg/L; normal range < 3 mg/L). Serologic tests for hepatitis B and C, HIV, and syphilis were negative, as were tests for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies. Arterial and venous Doppler studies revealed no abnormalities.

Skin biopsy of a pus-filled vesicle revealed a hyperplastic ulcerated epidermis (Fig 2, A), hemorrhage and edema in the papillary dermis, and an abundant and dense inflammatory infiltrate within the dermis and the hypodermis, predominantly of neutrophils and eosinophils (Fig 2, B). Periodic acid–Schiff stain of the specimen was negative. Tissue cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi yielded negative results. The findings were compatible with PG. A biopsy specimen from a livedoid lesion was negative for vascular immune complex deposition by direct immunofluorescence.

### A dermatologic emergency; Sweet's syndrome [^1172M8mx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sweet's syndrome (SS), also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a rare condition characterized by recurrent erythematous skin lesions. Skin lesions appear as papules, nodules and plaques located on the upper extremity, trunk, neck and face.

Case Report

A 72-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with a 10-day history of generalized rash, generalized muscle and joint pain and high fever. He had a history of upper respiratory tract infection. He presented with painful erythematous plaques on both lower and upper extremities and the trunk as well as serohemorrhagic bullous lesions on the feet. The laboratory results revealed WBC count of 20.6 × 10³/mm³ (76.9% neutrophils), CRP (c-reactive protein) of 33 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation of 110/h. The patient was referred to a dermatologist with prediagnosis of SS due to the presence of typical painful skin lesions, high fever and neutrophilic leukocytosis. A systemic corticosteroid therapy was initiated. The diagnosis for SS was confirmed after the skin biopsy revealed the presence of dense dermal infiltrate of neutrophils and leukocytoclasis in the upper dermis. The patient responded rapidly to corticosteroids and the skin lesions improved.

Conclusion

We reported this case as it was a rare life-threatening dermatosis diagnosed in the emergency department, which is generally difficult to diagnose therein, and the skin lesions appeared on the lower extremities.

### Sleep disturbance in adults with chronic pruritic dermatoses is associated with increased C-reactive protein levels [^116BSpvr]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pruritus is a common symptom that can significantly reduce quality of life through sleep disruption.

Objective

To examine features of disturbed sleep in patients with chronic pruritic dermatoses and test the hypothesis that systemic inflammation may serve as a biomarker for impaired sleep in these patients.

Methods

Cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey investigating systemic inflammation using C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Logistic regression was used to compare patients with and without sleep disturbances, adjusting for demographics (model 1) and medical comorbidities (model 2).

Results

Chronic pruritic dermatoses were associated with multiple sleep disturbances, including nighttime awakenings (model 1: odds ratio [OR], 1.646; 95% confidence interval, 1.031–2.627; model 2: OR, 1.329; 95% CI, 0.888–1.989) and early morning awakening (model 1: OR, 1.669, 95% CI, 1.118–2.493; model 2: OR, 1.582; 95% CI, 1.008–2.481). Mean CRP levels were 52.8% higher among patients with pruritic dermatoses reporting trouble sleeping compared with those who did not (0.663 vs 0.434 mg/dL; p = 0.034). Trouble sleeping was also positively correlated with CRP levels (β = 0.142, P = 0.025).

Limitations

Potential recall bias among participants.

Conclusions

In addition to confirming sleep disturbances with pruritic dermatoses, we found these disturbances are more likely to present with elevated CRP levels. Clinicians should consider the potential risk for sleep-related and cardiac comorbidities in patients diagnosed with itchy skin conditions.

### New diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus after COVID-19 vaccination: a case report and review of literature [^114n42GP]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

An 18-year-old female with a history of autism presented with a rash of 1-month duration. A week before the onset of the rash, the patient had received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine. The patient initially developed facial swelling accompanied by red, painful, persistent bumps involving the face and extremities. There was no history of photosensitivity, oral ulcers, Raynaud's phenomenon, previous COVID-19 infection, and no known family history of autoimmune conditions. The patient denied taking any medications or herbal supplements. Examination showed ill-defined, erythematous, tender plaques and nodules on the face, arms (Fig 1, A and B), frontal scalp, legs, and chest. The patient also developed scarring alopecia with scalp lesions clinically consistent with discoid lupus erythematosus (Fig 1, C). Laboratory workup revealed leukopenia (white blood cell, 2520/μL), elevated C-reactive protein of 5.1 mg/L, positive anti-nuclear (1:2560) antibodies, positive anti-ribonuclear protein antibodies, positive anti-Smith antibodies, low complement levels (C3 of 62.3 mg/dL; C4 of 11.8 mg/dL), an elevated urine protein level (54.2 mg/dL), and an elevated urine protein to creatinine ratio (237 mg/gm). A biopsy from a plaque on the thigh revealed a superficial and deep perivascular and periadnexal infiltrate comprised of lymphocytes, with occasional neutrophils and neutrophilic debris (Fig 2, A and B). These features were consistent with a neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis, which can often be associated with SLE, and thus, pointed to a diagnosis of SLE given the dermatologic and laboratory findings. The scalp lesions were unable to be biopsied due to patient refusal. The patient fulfilled the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics criteria, and a diagnosis of SLE was established. She was initially treated with a prolonged taper of systemic steroids, beginning at 50 mg oral prednisone. However, once tapered down to 10 mg of prednisone, the patient experienced a flare of new erythematous plaques occurring on the face and elbows. This prompted addition of oral hydroxychloroquine and increasing the prednisone with a slower taper. At 3 months follow-up, the patient's rash resolved with brown macules and atrophic plaques.

### A recurrent, painful, and indurated plaque on a 75-year-old man's back [^112CdHwD]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 75-year-old male retired physician presented with a 6-year history of an episodic, indurated and painful plaque located on the upper left side of his back that continued to recur and regress with incomplete healing every 3 to 4 months. Physical examination found a well-demarcated, tender, indurated erythematous plaque with central erosion (Fig 1).

Reoccurrence manifested with development of a pustule or bulla, which subsequently progressed to a larger indurated plaque that was tender, pruritic, and burning. Punch biopsy found a dense infiltrate of atypical small-to-medium–sized lymphocytes in the upper and middle dermis as well as around hair follicles (Fig 2, A). Focally, the infiltrate obscured the dermoepidermal j unction (Fig 2, B).

### New practical aspects of sweet syndrome [^115zLJug]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Sweet syndrome (SS), or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is an inflammatory, non-infectious skin reaction characterized clinically by tender, erythematous papules/plaques/pustules/nodules commonly appearing on the upper limbs, trunk, and head and neck; histologically, SS is characterized by dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis. SS is accompanied by fever; an elevation of inflammatory markers (e.g., erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein) in serum may also be observed. Although most cases of SS are idiopathic, SS also occurs in the setting of malignancy or following administration of an associated drug. SS has also been reported in association with pregnancy and a burgeoning list of infectious (most commonly upper respiratory tract infections) and inflammatory diseases; likewise, the litany of possible iatrogenic triggers has also grown. Over the past several years, a wider spectrum of SS presentation has been realized, with several reports highlighting novel clinical and histological variants. Corticosteroids continue to be efficacious first-line therapy for the majority of patients with SS, although novel steroid-sparing agents have been recently added to the therapeutic armamentarium against refractory SS. New mechanisms of SS induction have also been recognized, although the precise etiology of SS still remains elusive. Here, we catalogue the various clinical and histological presentations of SS, summarize recently reported disease associations and iatrogenic triggers, and review treatment options. We also attempt to frame the findings of this review in the context of established and emerging paradigms of SS pathogenesis.

### Association of higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein with future development of psoriatic arthritis in psoriasis: a prospective cohort study [^1131NJH4]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study showed that a higher level of hsCRP, a biomarker of systemic inflammation, is independently associated with increased risk of the development of PsA among patients with psoriasis regardless of other known risk factors. This finding underscores the potential of hsCRP as a valuable biomarker for identifying patients at high risk of developing PsA in both dermatology and rheumatology settings.

Although rheumatologists often use CRP levels to assess disease activity, measuring hsCRP offers a more sensitive assessment of the protein level at the lower end of the spectrum. This distinction may be important because CRP levels tend to be lower in patients with PsA compared with other inflammatory rheumatic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica, which are more influenced by interleukin‐6–driven inflammatory pathways. Notably, CRP levels are elevated in only 50% of the patients with PsA, despite clinical evidence of active disease. This reflects the variability in the biologic mechanisms underlying PsA. Despite these limitations, CRP provides valuable prognostic information regarding the risk of progression of joint damage, response to therapy and development of comorbidities, such as cardiovascular events.

### Understanding the role of type I interferons in cutaneous lupus and dermatomyositis: toward better therapeutics [^112sLQzV]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

A 29-year-old female presented to a rheumatology-dermatology clinic with a pruritic rash that began 6 months prior, after a viral illness. She had previously been diagnosed with eczema and treated with antihistamines and topical steroids without improvement. She also noted fatigue, hair loss, and severe scalp pruritus. Physical examination was notable for violaceous periorbital edema, scaly erythematous papules on the metacarpophalangeal joints of bilateral hands, dilated capillaries of the proximal nail folds, scaly plaques on bilateral elbows, and excoriated erythematous plaques on upper chest, back and hips. The patient reported no muscle weakness, and strength testing and creatinine phosphokinase were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thigh showed no evidence of inflammation or edema. Antibody testing was negative. A diagnosis of clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis was made. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, colonoscopy, and mammogram showed no evidence of cancer. The patient was initiated on methotrexate. Her cutaneous manifestations persisted with debilitating intractable pruritus, and thus, she was transitioned to mycophenolate mofetil, again with minimal improvement. Intravenous immunoglobulin was not approved by insurance given the lack of muscle involvement in her disease. This patient's case highlights a common clinical scenario in rheumatology and dermatology and raises several important issues related to the immunologic underpinnings of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and dermatomyositis (DM): What is the role of type I interferon (IFN) in triggering skin disease in CLE and DM? What is the role of IFN in the pathogenesis of skin inflammation in CLE and DM? Can we apply what we know about IFN-targeted therapeutics in CLE and DM to develop better treatments for skin disease?

### Interpretation of ferritin concentrations in the dermatology clinic [^116Gd8nd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ferritin measurement is a common laboratory test in dermatology. Ferritin is a marker of iron storage in the human body but can also be -elevated in inflammatory states. Therefore, changes in ferritin are nonspecific, and correlation of specific clinical findings and risk factors with ferritin concentration and other biomarkers, e.g. iron studies or C-reactive protein tests, is recommended. This article discusses iron metabolism and the indications for ferritin measurement in dermatology and how to interpret the laboratory results.

### Prurigo chronica multiformis: expert consensus of the Japanese Dermatological Association [^112JMRYh]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Prurigo chronica multiformis is a commonly used diagnostic designation for a peculiar subtype of prurigo in Japan, although the disease entity might not be well-recognized in other countries. Experts approved by the Japanese Dermatological Association attempted to build a common consensus on prurigo chronica multiformis, agreeing that it is a unique and important disease entity in elderly patients. Skin lesions are characterized by intensely pruritic, edematous, urticarial papules, or small macules, which gradually become solid papules/small nodules. The papules tend to aggregate and occasionally coalesce into polygonal lichenified plaques. The most commonly affected sites are the lower abdomen and lower back, although the chest, thighs, and upper back might also be involved. Common histopathological features of prurigo chronica multiformis include infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophils in the upper dermis, with minimal epidermal changes. Basophil infiltration is also observed. The epidemiological incidence, differences in clinical manifestations by geographical location, and disease placement among other forms of prurigo and/or related skin diseases need to be further elucidated. Dermatologists should be aware of the clinical characteristics of prurigo chronica multiformis.

### Neutrophilic dermatoses [^112VkHhU]. Clinics in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Neutrophils may infiltrate all layers of the skin and consequently may cause different disorders, each with its own characteristic clinical and laboratory findings. We discuss how these disorders present and how they are diagnosed and treated. In addition, important associations with internal diseases are discussed to assist clinicians in evaluating for a concurrent illness. Because treatment of these disorders may often require systemic therapy, the potential short-term and long-term effects of commonly used medications are discussed. Finally, treatment of recalcitrant diseases, mostly by use of therapies published in the form of small case series or reports, is also included to guide clinicians in dealing with the more challenging cases.

### Scaly erythematous papules and plaques in a teenager [^114GYJ2b]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 13-year-old healthy Hispanic boy presented to the dermatology clinic with a 10-month history of a pruritic rash on his trunk and extremities. He was previously treated with fluocinolone 0.01% oil, triamcinolone 0.1% cream, and hydroxyzine 10 mg with no relief. The patient denied pain or a similar rash in the past. He had no relevant family or social history. Physical examination demonstrated non-blanching, scaly erythematous papules and plaques on his legs, right arm, and trunk (Figs 1 and 2). A punch biopsy from lower portion of his right leg was performed (Fig 3).

Question 1: Based on the clinical presentation, history, and histologic findings, what is your diagnosis?
A. Nummular eczema
B. Lichen planus
C. Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED)
D. Eczematid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis
E. Contact dermatitis

Answers:

A. Nummular eczema–Incorrect. Although clinically consistent with nummular eczema, biopsy revealed considerable perivascular dermal infiltrates and extravasated red blood cells, which are absent in eczema.
B. Lichen planus–Incorrect. While lichen planus can present with pruritic violaceous papules and plaques on the extremities, the histologic findings of the disease were absent in this patient's biopsy.
C. EED–Incorrect. EED is a necrotizing, small-vessel vasculitis characterized by erythematous plaques on the dorsal aspects of the hands or extensor surfaces. Histology would demonstrate a leukocytoclastic vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis of the dermal vessel wall.
D. Eczematid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis–Correct. Eczematid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis often presents as an eczematous, non-blanching, red-brown purpuric or petechial eruption in the lower extremities. Epidermal spongiosis with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and extravasation of red blood cells are seen histologically. Therefore, the clinical and histologic picture of our patient best reflect eczematid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis.
E. Contact dermatitis–Incorrect. Contact dermatitis could be a plausible diagnosis for our patient, as it presents with a well-demarcated erythematous papule or plaque confined to the site of contact with an allergen or irritant. However, the histologic features of contact dermatitis were absent in this patient.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^114RqM41]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Itch, also known as pruritus, is defined as an uncomfortable sensation that provokes an urge to scratch. It impairs the quality of life (QOL) of those experiencing itch and can be debilitating and even lethal when it becomes severe and/or chronic. Therefore, dermatologists and physicians who see patients with itch must be knowledgeable about it. This review will provide an overview of the pathophysiology and treatment strategies for itch, with a particular focus on itch with no underlying primary pruritic skin disease.

### Two instructive cases of primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (leg type) mimicking cellulitis and sporotrichosis [^112Fug7o]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case 1

An 80-year-old Chinese man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presented with a 1-month history of left lower limb erythema and swelling. There was no fever or pain. Investigations did not show any leukocytosis or elevated C-reactive protein. Cellulitis was diagnosed, and the patient was treated with intravenous co-amoxiclav. There was no clinical improvement over 3 days, and a dermatology consult was sought. Examination found confluent, erythematous, infiltrated plaques with a nodular surface, circumferentially affecting the entire left leg from the lower thigh to the medial malleolus (Fig 1). There was no warmth or tenderness. Palpable ipsilateral, large and matted, inguinal lymphadenopathy was detected. An incisional skin biopsy found a dense, diffuse infiltrate within the dermis and subcutis (Fig 2, A). This infiltrate consisted of large, atypical neoplastic cells with round nuclei (centroblasts and immunoblasts) admixed with small reactive lymphocytes (Fig 2, B). The neoplastic cells expressed B-cell marker CD20 (Fig 2, C), and were strongly positive for Bcl-2 (Fig 2, D). The cells showed partial positive staining for MUM-1 (Fig 2, E). There was a high Ki-67 proliferative index of more than 90% (Fig 2, F). These findings were compatible with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

### What does minor elevation of C-reactive protein signify? [^116sJTRY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Reports of the predictive value of minor elevation of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (between 3 and 10 mg/L) for atherosclerotic events have generated considerable interest, as well as a degree of controversy and confusion. CRP concentrations in this range are found in about one third of the American population. To better understand the mechanisms underlying minor elevation of CRP, we have surveyed its reported associations with a variety of states and conditions. It has become clear that even minimal environmental irritants and inflammatory stimuli elicit a minor CRP response. Minor CRP elevation has been found associated with a number of genetic polymorphisms, with membership in different demographic and socioeconomic groups, with a variety of dietary patterns and with many medical conditions that are not apparently inflammatory. Finally, minor CRP elevation bears negative prognostic implications for many conditions, particularly age-related diseases, and predicts mortality in both diseased and apparently healthy individuals. In sum, minor CRP elevation is associated with a great many diverse conditions, some of which are, or may prove to be, causal. Many of these reported associations imply a mild degree of tissue stress or injury, suggesting the hypothesis that the presence of distressed cells, rather than a resulting inflammatory response, is commonly the stimulus for CRP production.

### Association of higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein with future development of psoriatic arthritis in psoriasis: a prospective cohort study [^113pWDiL]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Setting

This study was nested in the ongoing University of Toronto Psoriasis Cohort, which began in 2006 as a prospective longitudinal cohort study aimed at identifying risk factors for the development of PsA. All patients enrolled in the cohort have a dermatologist‐confirmed diagnosis of psoriasis and undergo a pre‐enrollment assessment by a rheumatologist to exclude any history or presence of inflammatory arthritis. The cohort has been described in detail in previous publications. For this study, we used data collected from January 2006 to December 2019. Patients who lacked follow up study visits or did not have a serum sample in our biobank were excluded from the study. The study received approval from the University Health Network Research Ethics Board, and all participants provided informed consent.

Data collection

All study participants underwent an annual assessment by a rheumatologist, who evaluated whether patients had developed PsA since the previous visit and collected information on potential risk factors. Data collection followed standard protocols, capturing information on lifestyle habits, family medical history, musculoskeletal symptoms, comorbidities, medications, and findings from skin and nail examination.

Measurement of

Blood samples were collected at each annual visit, and serum samples are stored in our biobank. The first available serum sample was identified, and hsCRP levels were measured in our hospital laboratory using standard commercial kits. For each patient, hsCRP levels were measured only once.

Case definition

At each visit, a comprehensive assessment of PsA symptoms and signs was performed by a rheumatologist expert in PsA. The diagnosis of PsA was based on clinical findings with imaging modalities ordered only when clinically necessary to investigate abnormalities suggestive of PsA. The diagnosis of PsA was determined by at least two rheumatologists after reviewing all available clinical, laboratory, and imaging data.

To address loss to follow up, we reached out to patients who missed two or more consecutive annual visits to determine if they were alive and whether they have consulted a physician for musculoskeletal symptoms. We also reviewed all relevant medical records from rheumatologists and other specialists (available in the patient electronic medical records) to ascertain if a new diagnosis of PsA had been made.

### The future: critical knowledge about anti-itch therapy [^1114qEmJ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Itch is an extremely frequent and enervating symptom of many diseases. Current anti-itch therapy, which is based almost exclusively on an "immunocentric" viewpoint, is often unsatisfactory. Recent studies show that this symptom is in fact the result of a complex interplay among skin, nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system. This explains the frequent failure of therapeutic strategies focused only on a single factor and suggests the usefulness of a polypharmacologic symptomatic treatment, designed on a case-by-case basis as a result of a multidisciplinary approach. We discuss the perspectives of anti-itch therapy in light of the new pathogenetic and pharmacologic acquisitions.

### Rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis in a woman with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis [^1123BgZv]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis (RND) is an unusual cutaneous reaction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RND is characterized by symmetric, erythematous papules, plaques, nodules, and urticarial lesions often located over the joints, extensor surfaces of the extremities, or the trunk. This entity demonstrates an intense neutrophilic dermal infiltrate without vasculitis. All patients previously reported with RND had severe RA with relatively high titers of rheumatoid factor when tested. A 67-year-old woman had a 2-month history of multiple, tender, 4 to 8 mm erythematous, crusted papules and nodules that occurred in clusters on her anterior thighs, knees, and legs. She suffered from severe disabling seronegative RA. RND may complicate seronegative RA.

### An 11-year-old male with periorbital edema and painful subcutaneous nodules [^111y3jbG]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Case Presentation

An 11‐year‐old previously healthy male presented with painful skin lesions on the lower legs. In the 6 weeks leading up to presentation, he experienced profound lethargy, polyarthritis of large joints of the extremities, cyclic low‐grade fever, approximately 7 kg weight loss, and bilateral periocular edema. He had traveled to Liberia for 3 weeks, 1 year prior to symptom onset. The patient was not on any medications. The patient was normotensive and intermittently febrile without consistent pattern (T max = 38.5°C). On physical examination, he had hyperpigmented reticulated plaques and painful erythematous nodules on the lower legs, ankles, and dorsal feet (Figure 1), with milder involvement of the hands. He was also noted to have robust bilateral periorbital edema (Figure 2). An extensive workup revealed elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] > 130 mm/h; C‐reactive protein (CRP) 19.5 mg/dL). He had an elevated anti‐streptolysin O (ASO) titer of 592 IU/mL. The remainder of his workup was normal, including DNAse B antibody level, creatinine, urinalysis, terminal complement deficiency testing, immunologic titers, transthoracic echocardiogram, and full body MRI. A punch biopsy from the left foot was taken (Figures 3 and 4).

### Case report-indurated plaques and recurrent fevers in a 37-year-old man: challenge [^111e4ubN]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2021). Medium credibility.

A 36-year-old previously healthy man presented to the ED with recurring fevers of unknown origin concurrent with a skin rash for 2 months.

The patient had no prior medical problems, and he did not take any home medications. He initially noted a violaceous, nontender, and nonpruritic plaque present on his lower back that spread to his flank, groin, and posterior neck. He also reported constitutional symptoms of fatigue, night sweats, loss of appetite, and an unintentional weight loss of about 7 kg in 2 months. The patient was previously seen by his primary care physician and completed courses of ceftriaxone, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycin without resolution of fevers or skin changes. The clinical history was negative for autoimmune disease.

Physical examination revealed several erythematous, nonblanching, indurated plaques present on his lower back and hips, groin, upper abdomen, and the extensor surface of his neck (Figs. 1 and 2). All skin lesions were asymptomatic with no associated pruritus, pain, or purulence. No lymphadenopathy or organomegaly was noted on examination.

Histopathologic examination of a punch biopsy showed rimming of adipocytes by atypical lymphoid cells with hyperchromatic nuclei (Fig. 3). Prominent erythrophagocytosis was also noted (Fig. 4). Immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining for CD3, CD5, and CD8. Staining for the beta-F-1 chain of the alpha/beta T-cell receptor was positive. CD4, CD20, CD56, CD30, and S100 were negative. PCR for the delta chain of the T-cell receptor was negative.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^113FTLot]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) — indications and timing for patch testing: Patch tests are indicated in any patient with a chronic, pruritic, eczematous, or lichenified dermatitis if underlying or secondary ACD is suspected, and virtually any eczematous lesion could be caused or aggravated by a contactant; however, based on repetitive tests in patients with the angry back syndrome, it is recommended that patch testing should be deferred until the underlying dermatitis is no longer acute or severe because the skin may be irritable with false‑positive reactions, a positive test may trigger an exacerbation, and negative tests can help exclude a suspected agent.

### Two instructive cases of primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (leg type) mimicking cellulitis and sporotrichosis [^113mMZbm]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case 2

A 64-year-old Malay man with neuromyelitis optica (on long-term azathioprine, 75 mg once a day, with episodic courses of pulse methylprednisolone for flares) and chronic venous insufficiency, presented with progressive worsening of left lower leg swelling and erythema over 10 days. Before this, he had recurrent admissions (over a duration of 3 months) for presumed left lower leg cellulitis, which never completely resolved with courses of antibiotics. Examination by the dermatology team found a 4-cm infiltrative reddish-brown plaque with overlying hyperkeratosis at the left medial calf, with several discrete firm dermal papulonodules arranged in a sporotrichoid distribution (Fig 3). Interestingly, the patient reported that these papulonodules only appeared over the last fortnight. There was no palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy, nor history of trauma or exposure to animals or soil. There was no leucocytosis, and C-reactive protein was only mildly elevated (51 mg/L). A punch biopsy found a dense, diffuse infiltrate within the dermis and subcutis (Fig 4, A). The infiltrate consisted mainly of large neoplastic centroblasts admixed with some reactive small lymphocytes (Fig 4, B). The neoplastic cells expressed B-cell markers CD20 (Fig 4, C), Bcl-2 (Fig 4, D), and MUM-1 (Fig 4, E). There was a high Ki-67 proliferative index of more than 80% (Fig 4, F). These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of DLBCL. Initial staging scans were negative for systemic nodal involvement, hence establishing the diagnosis of PCDLBCL-LT. The patient underwent 4 cycles of chemotherapy uneventfully and remains in remission.

### Unique histopathologic findings in a patient with adult-onset still disease [^115KAcZF]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2007). Low credibility.

Adult-onset Still disease (AOSD) is an uncommon disorder characterized by fever, polyarthralgia, elevated white blood cell count, and a maculopapular rash, the histologic features of which have not been well-known. A 55-year-old Asian woman presented initially with a "burning" and severely pruritic eruption on her face, hands, and arms, thought clinically to be urticaria. Within 1 month, she began spiking high fevers, developed diffuse joint pain, and had marked elevations of ferritin, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, characteristic of AOSD. The cutaneous eruption became more widespread, involving the trunk, scalp, and remainder of the extremities, with diffuse thickening of the skin with papular and linear hyperpigmentation and accentuation. Biopsies from several locations showed focal hyperkeratosis associated with dyskeratotic keratinocytes with a peculiar, distinctive distribution in the upper epidermis and cornified layers. In addition, increased dermal mucin was present, with minimal fibroblast proliferation and inflammation. This unusual combination of diffuse dermal mucinosis and a unique pattern of dyskeratosis can present a challenge in generating an accurate differential diagnosis, and may represent an unusual response to chronic scratching or be a distinctive histologic manifestation of AOSD.

### Systematic review of the use of CRP in clinical trials for psoriatic arthritis: a concern for clinical practice? [^115kYweU]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease associated with the skin disorder psoriasis. PsA patients can present a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes, including oligoarthritis, symmetrical polyarthritis, axial disease, specific inflammation of the distal interphalangeal joints and arthritis mutilans, dactylitis and enthesitis. Common non-musculoskeletal comorbidities of PsA are uveitis, bowel inflammation, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.

Current treatment options include conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate, biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) such as antitumour necrosis factor, anti-interleukin (IL)12/23, anti-IL23 and anti-IL17, or targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs), such as Janus kinase inhibitors and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors.

There is no specific diagnostic test for PsA. Hence, a diagnosis is mainly made based on clinical presentation. Laboratory tests assessing inflammation and imaging can support the diagnostic process. Laboratory tests can also be considered useful to closely follow disease activity and support treatment decision making. Traditionally, non-specific markers of active inflammation such as elevated levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are suggested as laboratory markers for PsA.

However, increased CRP levels occur in less than 50% of PsA patients despite clinically active psoriatic disease with joint involvement. Yet, CRP is included in the most frequently used response criteria for PsA such as the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response and the Disease Activity Score-28 with CRP (DAS28-CRP). These response criteria and disease activity measures have also found their way into clinical practice, for instance in treat-to-target algorithms or in third-party payers criteria to reimburse costs for bDMARD and tsDMARDs.

### "Essential" cutaneous vasculitis: what every rheumatologist should know about vasculitis of the skin [^113UiBKs]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Although the classification of small-and medium-vessel vasculitides involving the skin remains complex and imperfect, a substantial body of knowledge related to cutaneous vasculitis exists. Some components of this knowledge, though beyond the usual purview of rheumatologists, are essential to understanding the vasculitides. The correct interpretation of cutaneous findings combined with a properly performed skin biopsy yields important insights not only into underlying diagnoses, but also into the pathophysiological mechanisms of individual cases. In this review, we discuss a classification scheme for the cutaneous vasculitides, outline the work-up for evaluating patients with these disorders, and describe the essential features of the major categories of skin vasculitis.

### Schnitzler syndrome [^113LZXBJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A woman in her late 40s with a history of psoriatic arthritis presented to us with fever, migratory rash, cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, and generalised myalgia. Her symptoms did not improve with steroids and her inflammatory markers were in the range of 200mg/dL for C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 71mm/hour and ferritin of 4000ng/mL. Infectious workup was negative. Haematological malignancy and autoimmune conditions were among the top differentials, and she was eventually diagnosed with Schnitzler syndrome. A multidisciplinary team consisting of internal medicine, rheumatology, infectious disease and haematology-oncology specialists was involved in the care of this patient. We highlight the diagnostic schema that was followed for this rare and unique constellation of symptoms.

### Systematic review of the use of CRP in clinical trials for psoriatic arthritis: a concern for clinical practice? [^112JNqVo]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

C reactive protein (CRP) levels are suggested as serum biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). However, increased CRP levels are found in less than 50% of PsA patients even in the presence of active disease.

Objectives

To evaluate the role of CRP levels in interventional clinical trials in PsA patients to better understand the trial generalisability, relationship with disease activity and predictive value for treatment response and decision making.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted via PubMed, Cochrane and Embase. We focused on phase III trials in PsA.

Results

Eight of 22 studies applied minimum baseline CRP levels for inclusion. Baseline CRP levels were wide-ranging (0.1–238 mg/L) and lower in studies without CRP in the enrolment criteria. All 22 studies used the American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) response and other endpoints that integrated CRP levels. One of seven studies that evaluated individual ACR-score components revealed a decrease in CRP levels along with improvement of other endpoints. Subanalyses show conflicting evidence on CRP levels as predictor of disease course.

Conclusion

CRP levels were inconsistently used as inclusion criterion in clinical trials, often limiting generalisability of the data. The use of composite scores such as ACR20 or Disease Activity Score-28-CRP is also limited since baseline levels of CRP affects their sensitivity to change. High CRP levels may be an individual predictor for disease progression and response to treatment, but the current conflicting findings and selective patient trial inclusions, do not allow CRP to play a very prominent role in treatment decision making.

### Generalized morphea / eosinophilic fasciitis overlap after epoxy exposure [^112nVZ9o]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Case report

A 24-year-old Hispanic man presented to MD Anderson Cancer Center in March 2017 with a 7-year history of diffuse, hyperpigmented sclerosis of his arms, legs, and trunk and accompanying tender edema of the distal extremities. His symptoms began in 2010, 3 weeks after starting a new painting job, during which he used paint with epoxy resins. He quit the job 1 month after the symptoms developed and received a diagnosis of EF after a bone marrow biopsy showed profound eosinophilia (> 3000 cells/mm 3). He was started on prednisone, 10 mg daily, which he has since continued. By 2011, the edema had progressed to indurated hyperpigmented patches and plaques, and the patient was administered oral methotrexate 25 mg/d for 1 year with minimal response. From 2012 to 2015, he received regimens of azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, and rituximab, all of which resulted in minimal improvement. New patches on his chest and upper back appeared in 2016.

Physical examination found hyperpigmented sclerotic patches of the upper back and bilateral upper and lower extremities, indurated hyperpigmented plaques with erythematous borders extending from the upper and mid–lateral chest to the neck and shoulder, and palpable fasciitis and tightening of the bilateral distal forearm muscles (Fig 1). Laboratory tests found positive antinuclear antibody levels, peripheral eosinophilia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels; however, systemic involvement and antiscleroderma-70 and anticentromere antibody levels were negative. Biopsy and histopathologic examination found homogenization and thickening of collagen fibers, fragmentation of elastic fibers, atrophy of skin appendages, and focal lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils throughout the dermis (Fig 2). These findings, together with the clinical presentation, were consistent with a diagnosis of EF/generalized morphea overlap. The patient received ultraviolet A1 (UVA1) phototherapy thereafter for 1 month with no signs of improvement.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^115mUmpB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) initial evaluation and lesion characterization — The initial patient evaluation should be focused to determine (through history and physical examination) whether the lesions that patients describe are consistent with CU (D). Lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals with surrounding erythema, are generally pruritic, and individual lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours; painful or burning dysesthesia suggests cutaneous vasculitis, and angioedema is nonpruritic, brawny, nonpitting edema without erythema affecting the lips, tongue, eyelids, and genitalia. The clinician should obtain objective assessments of body surface area covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial and each subsequent visit, and photographic documentation might assist in determining consistency with urticaria or angioedema. The medical work-up should be done while keeping in mind that CU is of undetermined cause in the majority of cases (C).

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Erythrodermic psoriasis — case 6 presents a 29-year-old man with a family history of psoriasis who developed plaque type psoriasis at 12 years of age initially treated with low-potency topical corticosteroids, with progressive worsening over the subsequent 6 years. He was treated initially with 15 mg per week of oral methotrexate (MTX) that led to significant elevations in his liver function test (LFT) findings after 9 months of therapy requiring discontinuation, failed to respond to a 12-week course of intramuscular alefacept, and thereafter obtained significant improvement with etanercept; approximately 7 months after his last etanercept dose an upper respiratory infection led to rapid worsening with involvement of most of his body surface area (BSA) sparing only the palms and soles. On examination he was afebrile with other vital signs within normal limits and had generalized erythematous inflammatory patches and plaques covering 95% of his BSA with superficial exfoliation of the face, palms, and soles, pitting edema of the lower extremities, and swelling of the toes without any specific individual joint tenderness.

### Umbilicated papules in an immunocompetent patient [^112mNHYP]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 39-year-old man presented with a pruritic eruption characterized by diffuse fissured lichenified patches, erythematous and edematous eyelids, conjunctival erythema, and fevers (Fig 1, A). The patient received prednisone in the emergency department and started receiving empiric intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. On hospital day 5, the patient developed an acute eruption of umbilicated papules with crust involving the face, chest, and extremities (Fig 1, B), and a punch biopsy was performed (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Contact dermatitis
B. Staphylococcus aureus cutaneous infection
C. Chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD)
D. Eczema herpeticum (EH)
E. Eczema molluscatum

Answers:

A. Contact dermatitis – Incorrect. Although it is possible for the patient to have an underlying contact allergy, contact dermatitis is not usually associated with fever and should improve temporarily with prednisone.
B. Staphylococcus aureus cutaneous infection – Incorrect. Although patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) have a predisposition for secondary Staphylococcus aureus infections and could have fever as a result of a disseminated infection, the unsuccessful treatment with empiric antibiotics makes this choice unlikely. The primary morphology of the lesions present is also more strongly suggestive of a herpesvirus infection.
C. CAD – Incorrect. Pruritic eczematous lesions and lichenified plaques on sun-exposed areas such as the face and hands are concerning for CAD; however, CAD classically spares the eyelids, occurs in men over the age of 50 years, does not present with fever, and would improve with steroid use.
D. EH – Correct. EH, a disseminated cutaneous infection of herpes simplex virus (HSV), presents as clusters of dome-shaped vesicular lesions that rupture to form tiny punched-out ulcers overlying an erythematous base. Systemic symptoms of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy may also be present. Because EH occurs as a result of a disrupted epidermis allowing viral entry, preexisting skin conditions such as AD are critical to the pathogenesis.
E. Eczema molluscatum – Incorrect. Although molluscum superinfection can also present with umbilicated papules on a background of AD, pathologic analysis would show more characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Henderson-Patterson bodies). Patients with this condition are also less systemically ill.

Severe psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and severe psoriasis — examples used by the guideline development group are defined as the presence of 1 or more of the items listed and are not a formal definition; severe PsA includes erosive disease, elevated markers of inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]) attributable to PsA, long-term damage that interferes with function (i.e., joint deformities), highly active disease that causes a major impairment in quality of life, active PsA at many sites including dactylitis, enthesitis, function-limiting PsA at a few sites, and rapidly progressive disease, while severe psoriasis includes a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of 12 or more, body surface area (BSA) of 5–10% or more, significant involvement in specific areas (e.g., face, hands or feet, nails, intertriginous areas, scalp) where the burden of the disease causes significant disability, and impairment of physical or mental functioning that can warrant a designation of moderate-to-severe disease despite the lower amount of surface area of skin involved.

### The rash that presents as target lesions [^113JbXQJ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We have explored the rash that appears as target lesions, with the central and dominant diseases belonging to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis group. After presenting the clinical patterns of an individual target lesion and classifying them into different types of lesions, the contribution has been organized with groups characterized by such specific findings according to the type of lesion: flat or raised, typical or atypical, presence or absence of fever, presence or absence of mucosal ulcerations, presence or absence of arthralgias, and/or internal organ involvement. Other specific features, such as histologic appearance, immunofluorescence findings, and laboratory changes, are considered. We provide clinicians with an algorithmic, systematic, and logical approach to diagnose the condition of the patients who present with targetoid lesions, and enable them to differentiate between those with serious systemic and life-threatening diseases from others with ordinary skin ailments.

### Association of higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein with future development of psoriatic arthritis in psoriasis: a prospective cohort study [^116ZeqLH]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

A total of 702 patients with psoriasis without clinical evidence of PsA were enrolled in the Toronto Psoriasis Cohort and observed from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2019. Of these, 67 patients were excluded from the analysis due to having only a single visit and contributing no follow up data. An additional 46 patients were excluded due to lack of serum samples. Ultimately, 589 patients were included in the analysis, with 57 patients developing PsA during the follow up period (Supplementary Figure 1). The mean duration of follow up was 7.5 years, yielding a crude PsA incidence rate of 1.2 patients per 100 patient years. The mean age of study participants was 47.3 ± 13.5 years (43.1% women, Table 1), and mean duration of psoriasis was 16.2 ± 14.4 years. The mean hsCRP level was 3.1 ± 5.5 mg/L, with those who developed PsA showing higher baseline hsCRP levels (5.4 ± 13.1 mg/L). hsCRP distribution by diagnosis can be found in Supplementary Figure 2.

Table 1
Baseline patient characteristics *

Baseline hsCRP levels were significantly higher in patients with arthralgia (4.2 ± 8.53 mg/L vs 2.71 ± 3.67 mg/L), those with obesity (4.75 ± 4.95 mg/L vs 2.45 ± 5.61 mg/L), and in women (3.92 ± 7.13 mg/L vs 2.51 ± 3.68 mg/L) (Supplementary Table 1). No significant differences in hsCRP levels were observed across the remaining groups.

Univariate regression analysis revealed that higher hsCRP levels were significantly associated with future development of PsA, with a 3% increase in PsA risk for each 1 mg/L increase in hsCRP (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.05; P = 0.002; Table 2). This association remained significant in the multivariable regression analysis, with a 4% increase in PsA risk for each 1 mg/L increase in hsCRP (HR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01–1.07; P = 0.007). The effect size was consistent across men and women (Figure 1). No significant interaction was found between hsCRP and sex or BMI (data not shown).

### Acral manifestations of sweet syndrome (neutrophilic dermatosis of the hands) [^112eV96A]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Neutrophilic dermatosis of the hand (NDH) is a rare localized variant of the syndrome, originally described two decades ago by Strutton et al. The lesions of NDH and Sweet syndrome are similar, as indicated in the first report of NDH. Both diagnoses are characterized by an acute onset of fever, leukocytosis, and tender, erythematous infiltrated plaques. There are also bullae and ulceration in NDH, in contrast to Sweet syndrome, in which bullae are quite uncommon, especially at the early stages. Similar to Sweet syndrome, the majority of NDH patients are women (69%). Patients with NDH present with fever, peripheral neutrophilia, leukocytosis, and/or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level, but at a significantly lower rate than those in Sweet syndrome (33%). Similar to Sweet syndrome, NDH has been associated with the following conditions: Malignancies (particularly hematological [21%], most common of which is acute myelogenous leukemia, but many other malignancies as well), inflammatory bowel disease (19%), medication and vaccination-related eruptions, bacterial and viral infections, rheumatologic diseases, and others. The clues to the diagnosis of NDH are the same as for Sweet syndrome. Awareness of this diagnosis is important not only to avoid unnecessary medical and surgical therapy and to expediently initiate the administration of steroids for this highly responsive dermatosis, but also to conduct an appropriate workup to exclude associated diseases, especially malignancies.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^111C7uM9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) gaps in research — the expert group's priorities emphasize that while much is known about diagnosis and evaluation, much has yet to be learned. Significant gaps in research were identified, including but not limited to: validation studies of the AAD workgroup diagnostic criteria, development, validation, and uniformity in use of disease severity and quality of life measurements applicable to a busy clinical practice environment, interventional studies testing impact of multidisciplinary management on AD outcomes, and additional quality, controlled studies on epidemiologic risk factors for disease. It is hoped that additional knowledge of AD pathogenesis will soon lead to a proven biomarker for diagnosis and/or monitoring, and that AD-associated pruritus is better understood to generate improved therapeutic options.

Case report

A 48-year-old man with XLA presented to an outside clinic with chronic leg lesions. He had been treated with intravenous immunoglobulin since 1974. Painful, bruiselike lesions developed below his knees 5 to 6 months before presentation. He also reported fatigue, inguinal discomfort, joint pain, and shortness of breath concomitant with worsening of his leg lesions. The lesions were initially thought to be clinically consistent with erythema nodosum, and he was started on prednisone, 20 mg daily. After a few weeks of treatment there was limited improvement, so he was referred to the dermatology clinic for evaluation.

On examination, he had normal vital signs and appeared in no acute distress. Skin examination found scattered, variably erythematous, violaceous, hyperpigmented, and firm plaques on the distal legs that were several centimeters in diameter, some with overlying superficial desquamation (Fig 1). Our differential diagnoses included infection (including atypical bacterial and fungal), erythema nodosum, erythema induratum, Sweet syndrome, and primary cutaneous granulomas as a manifestation of immunodeficiency. Laboratory evaluation found a mild transaminitis, white blood cell count of 11.4 × 10⁹/L (absolute neutrophil count of 10.7, absolute lymphocyte count of 0.3, and CD4 count of 154 cells/mm³), IgM and IgA below the measurable range, IgG in the normal range, C-reactive protein of 130 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 82 mm/h, procalcitonin of 0.75 ng/mL, and a negative interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON, QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). During the course of his evaluation, 3 punch biopsies found granulomatous and suppurative dermatitis with lipomembranous fat necrosis (Fig 2). Periodic acid–Schiff–diastase, Brown-Brenn, and Fite stains were negative for fungi, bacteria, and acid-fast bacilli, respectively. Multiple cultures of the biopsied skin for bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria were negative as well. During this time, he was evaluated by the urology department for orchalgia and epididymitis was diagnosed. He was started on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), 160 mg to 800 mg twice a day for 6 weeks and then daily for prevention. Treatment with TMP-SMX improved his orchalgia but did not improve his rash. As his prednisone was tapered down, the rash spread further, and tender, violaceous, mobile, subcutaneous nodules developed on his trunk.

### A case of chronic spontaneous urticaria with wheals lasting for more than a week [^113YBZJi]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) causes localized and temporary edema in the dermis, resulting in wheals of various sizes and shapes, and causing itching and possibly burning sensations. However, it usually disappears without leaving any traces within 30 min to 24 h. Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is an important differential diagnosis with edematous erythema and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation that persist for > 24 h. A survey of 883 physicians from 92 countries revealed that the key features in confirming the diagnosis of UV include wheals lasting > 24 h (72%), and skin biopsy results (63%), postinflammatory pigmentation (46%). Complete blood count and serum C‐reactive protein tests might be useful.

We experienced a case of wheals with markedly prolonged infestation that gradually expanded over several days and disappeared in up to 10 days. Nevertheless, no obvious inflammatory reaction and no histological signs of vasculitis were observed.

### Skin and soft tissue infections in the elderly [^115NBkaG]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To highlight the peculiarity of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in elderly patients and to provide useful elements for their optimal management.

Recent Findings

In the COVID-19 era, early discharge from the hospital and implementation of outpatient management is of key importance.

Summary

Elderly patients are at high risk of SSTIs due to several factors, including presence of multiple comorbidities and skin factors predisposing to infections. Clinical presentation may be atypical and some signs of severity, such as fever and increase in C-reactive protein, may be absent or aspecific in this patients population. An appropriate diagnosis of SSTIs in the elderly is crucial to avoid antibiotic overtreatment. Further studies should explore factors associated with bacterial superinfections in patients with pressure ulcers or lower limb erythema. Since several risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may coexist in elderly patients, these subjects should be carefully screened for MRSA risk factors and those with high risk of resistant etiology should receive early antibiotic therapy active against MRSA. Physicians should aim to several objectives, including clinical cure, patient safety, early discharge and return to community. SSTIs in the elderly may be managed using long-acting antibiotics, but clinical follow-up is needed.

### Oral Sweet's syndrome occurring in ulcerative colitis [^113ZS3Jk]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A man aged 78years presented with a 3-week history of tender mouth ulceration associated with arthralgia and weight loss. He had ulcerative colitis that was diagnosed 10years previously which was well controlled on adalimumab 40mg fortnightly. Biochemical and haematological investigations showed raised inflammatory markers (CRP 105) and a marked neutrophilia (10). On examination, the patient had severe oral ulceration involving the anterior tongue and lips. In addition, on cutaneous examination had tender erythematous nodules involving the forehead. Histology from a diagnostic punch biopsy showed marked dermal oedema with an inflammatory infiltrate consisting of neutrophils. Our working diagnosis was therefore oral Sweet's syndrome. The patient was then started on oral prednisolone and later received colchicine which led to a complete resolution of symptoms.

### Diffuse yellow-golden axillary plaques [^117Q1dN3]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

A 55-year-old Chinese female with iron deficiency anemia and chronic urticaria presented with a 1-year history of an asymptomatic yellowish discoloration over her axillae extending to her upper chest and inner upper arms. She was otherwise well and reported no new medications or contactants. Physical examination revealed thin yellow-golden plaques around bilateral axillae, upper chest, and inner arm with central axillary sparing (Figs 1, A and B). Liver and renal function tests, glycated hemoglobin, and lipid panel were normal. Her full blood count revealed mild microcytic anemia. A punch biopsy was performed (Fig 2) over the left axilla.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Contact dermatitis
B. Cutaneous amyloidosis
C. Diffuse plane xanthoma
D. Sarcoidosis
E. Systemic sclerosis

Answers:

A. Contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The lack of contactant history with the above histological findings makes this diagnosis extremely unlikely.
B. Cutaneous amyloidosis – Incorrect. While macular amyloidosis may affect the arm and axilla (like in this case), it would typically present as pruritic reticulated dark brown papules or plaques. Furthermore, focal eosinophilic faceted deposits in the papillary dermis with pigment incontinence would be seen on histology.
C. Diffuse plane xanthoma – Correct. Diffuse plane xanthoma (DPX) is a distinct form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Clinically, it manifests as yellow-golden to orange macules and plaques usually over the neck, axilla, folds, chest, and back. Dermoscopic examination reveals a yellow-orange amorphous superficial structure with occasional cholesterol crystals. An alabaster granule-like aggregate may be observed. Typical histological features include the presence of foamy CD68+ histiocytes, foam cells (as seen in this case), tortuan giant cells, and lymphocytic and eosinophilic dermal infiltrate.
D. Sarcoidosis – Incorrect. Skin manifestations in cutaneous sarcoidosis are erythema nodosum, discoid eczema, erythema multiforme, calcinosis cutis, or generalized pruritus. The lack of systemic symptoms and absence of noncaseating granulomas on histology make this diagnosis unlikely.
E. Systemic sclerosis – Incorrect. Cutaneous manifestations of systemic sclerosis include salt-pepper pigmentation, Raynaud's phenomenon, and sclerodactyly, among others.

### Pulmonary sarcoidosis associated with psoriasis vulgaris: coincidental occurrence or causal association? Case report [^111yeMLF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 38-year-old male, a heavy smoker, was admitted to our department, because of fever (38.4°C), weakness, arthralgias, non-pitting edema of the lower extremities and chest discomfort for the previous two weeks. The arthralgias were partially responsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient also reported skin eruptions on his elbows and lower extremities that had appeared six months previously. His past medical history was unremarkable.

On physical examination, sharply demarcated erythematous plaques covered by silvery white scales were observed on the right elbow and the lower extremities below the knees (figure 1). The patient's ankles were painful and edematous. On palpation, firm and painless subcutaneous nodules could be found on the occipital part of the scalp. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Basic laboratory tests were normal except for an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (57 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (45.2 mg/l). Further investigations, which included serum complement analysis, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmatic antibodies, immunoglobulin levels, and serological tests for hepatitis A, B and C and human immunodeficiency virus, disclosed no apparent pathologies. PPD skin test was negative. Neither arterial blood gases nor pulmonary function tests showed significant abnormalities. Radiographic examination, using x-ray and high resolution computed tomography of the chest, revealed bilateral hilar and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy with small nodules along the bronchovascular bundles. Fiber-optic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed. BAL fluid analysis revealed lymphocytosis (35%) with an increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio (4.2). Microbiological and cytological examinations were negative. Transbronchial lung biopsies were non-diagnostic.

A labial biopsy and biopsies from the cutaneous lesions were also obtained. The labial biopsy demonstrated the presence of small epithelioid (sarcoid form) granulomas (figure 2), while the skin biopsies were typical of psoriasis (figure 3). Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue samples with periodic acid-Schiff staining was negative. We concluded that the patient suffered from two separate clinical entities: pulmonary sarcoidosis and psoriasis vulgaris.

The articular manifestations responded partially to NSAIDs. Consequently, a short course of 30 mg prednisone daily and topical therapy to manage the psoriatic lesions were applied. This resulted in a significant clinical improvement. Three months after his discharge the patient remains asymptomatic.

### Multiple well-demarcated skin-colored papules and nodules [^113RgRPW]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Scleromyxedema (papular mucinosis)
B. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)
C. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy)
D. Cutaneous lupus mucinosis (papulonodular mucinosis)
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus

Answers:
A. Scleromyxedema (papular mucinosis) – Incorrect. Papules in scleromyxedema tend to be symmetric, widespread, and waxy, commonly arranged in linear groups with progressive sclerodermoid induration. Pertinent negatives further decrease the likelihood of scleromyxedema, including normal thyroid function and normal protein immunoelectrophoresis, immunofixation, and serum-free light chains. Scleromyxedema and cutaneous lupus mucinosis may have similar clinical presentations; however, in the context of the serologic findings, this is not scleromyxedema.
B. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) – Incorrect. Papular and nodular mucinosis may also present as findings of early systemic sclerosis; however, our patient had a normal scleroderma (Scl-70) antibody, no clinical evidence of sclerosis, and a negative review of symptoms for systemic sclerosis, including esophageal dysmotility, Raynaud phenomenon, and telangiectasias.
C. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy) – Incorrect. The patient had no history of radiologic imaging with gadolinium-based contrast or significant renal insufficiency. antinuclear, anticentromere, and anti–Scl-70 antibodies were negative, and serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, and light chain were insignificant.
D. Cutaneous lupus mucinosis (papulonodular mucinosis) – Correct. Nodular cutaneous lupus mucinosis is a rare manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus that presents with nodules on the trunk and upper and lower extremities. Histology typically shows abundant mucin deposition dispersed among collagen bundles within the dermis. On the basis of the combination of clinical, pathologic, and serologic findings, she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus and associated nodular cutaneous lupus mucinosis.
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a widespread nonscarring photosensitive rash presenting as annular plaques with raised borders and central clearing. Clinically, the quantity of mucin is not sufficient to produce detectable lesions. Histologically, there is epidermal involvement and vacuolar degeneration of the dermoepidermal junction.

### Autoinflammation in psoriatic arthritis: time to better define the multifaceted enemy [^1111tZrg]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Today, we know that PsA has several clinical subsets. It is still a highly relevant question whether these different clinical subtypes have clear-cut differences regarding clinical and genetic reflections of autoinflammation, specifically innate immunity. Future studies will hopefully focus on this aspect, besides the therapeutic interventions.

Metabolic comorbidities in patients with PsA are well described in current literature. Besides, a high CRP level, as a marker of inflammation, is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). It is an interesting question whether these genetic alterations of innate immunity have a role in the presence of metabolic disturbances in PsA patients and if they can be used as a predictor of metabolic comorbidities and CVD.

Autoinflammation seems a vital part of the PsA pathogenesis, especially in the presence of pustular PsO and Crohn's disease. Therapeutic application of this growing body of evidence is expected by clinicians dealing with PsA.

### Systematic review of the use of CRP in clinical trials for psoriatic arthritis: a concern for clinical practice? [^111v4pgy]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

CRP is a readily performed routine laboratory test, which makes it a practical parameter to use. Accurate detection of CRP levels may be clinically relevant, given that CRP is one of the laboratory markers proposed as a predictor for clinical disease course and progression of structural damage. Joint damage is highly variable in PsA, but high CRP levels have a predictive value for worse disease outcomes.CRP levels can be measured with different methods. Traditional testing measures CRP levels within the range of 10 to 1000 mg/L. Recently, high-sensitivity assays (hs-CRP) have also been developed. These can measure lower levels of CRP with a sensitivity range of 0.1–10 mg/L. Hs-CRP is not determined routinely and is mostly used to predict the individual risk of cardiovascular disease.

The objective of this study is to gain better insight into the importance of CRP levels as a laboratory marker for PsA in the context of key clinical trials for this disorder, and the potential impact thereof on daily clinical practice. The use of CRP levels in clinical trials testing new drugs for PsA may affect the generalisability of the trial data for the complete patient population, and inadvertedly limit access to drugs that patients need. We performed a systematic literature review to shed more light on the use of CRP in pivotal clinical trials for PsA, and discuss the potential impact on daily patient care.

### Canakinumab (Ilaris) [^112J92gb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Part 1, a complete clinical response was observed in 71% of patients one week following initiation of treatment and in 97% of patients by Week 8 (see Table 4 and Figure 1). In the randomized withdrawal period, a total of 81% of the patients randomized to placebo flared as compared to none (0%) of the patients randomized to ILARIS. The 95% confidence interval for treatment difference in the proportion of flares was 53% to 96%. At the end of Part 2, all 15 patients treated with ILARIS had absent or minimal disease activity and skin disease (see Table 4).

In a second trial (NCT00465985), patients 4 to 74 years of age with both MWS and FCAS phenotypes of CAPS were treated in an open-label manner. Treatment with ILARIS resulted in clinically significant improvement of signs and symptoms and in normalization of high CRP and SAA in a majority of patients within 1 week.

Markers of inflammation CRP and SAA normalized within 8 days of treatment in the majority of patients. Normal mean CRP (Figure 1) and SAA values were sustained throughout CAPS Study 1 in patients continuously treated with canakinumab. After withdrawal of canakinumab in Part 2, CRP (Figure 1) and SAA values again returned to abnormal values and subsequently normalized after reintroduction of canakinumab in Part 3. The pattern of normalization of CRP and SAA was similar.

### Fever and rash [^1176aEnF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing.

### Low-grade systemic inflammation is associated with risk of psoriasis in a general population study of more than 100 000 individuals [^1137M4D2]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Biomarkers of low-grade systemic inflammation have been reported to be higher in patients with psoriasis than in healthy controls. However, it is unknown whether this low-grade systemic inflammation contributes to the development of psoriasis or is merely a consequence.

Objectives

To investigate if low-grade systemic inflammation, measured as systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), or C-reactive protein (CRP), is an independent risk factor for psoriasis.

Methods

We used data from the Copenhagen General Population Study, a prospective cohort study of the Danish general population where individuals aged 20–100 were enrolled between 2003 and 2015. Upon enrolment in the study, all individuals underwent a physical examination, completed an extensive self-reported questionnaire regarding lifestyle, and provided blood samples, from which SII, NLR, and CRP were measured. Psoriasis was identified using ICD codes by individual-linkage to the Danish National Patient Registry. Associations between SII, NLR, and CRP and psoriasis were estimated using hazard ratios from Cox proportional hazard regression models. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders including sex, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, educational level, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and obesity.

Results

We included 105,418 individuals with a median age of 58 years of whom 55% were women. The risk of receiving a diagnose of psoriasis increased with increasing levels of SII, NLR, and CRP. In individuals with high levels (> 90 percentile) of SII, NLR, and CRP, the multivariable adjusted hazard ratios were 1.78 (95% confidence interval 1.41–2.24), 1.56 (1.22–1.99), and 2.83 (2.27–3.51), respectively, compared with individuals with low levels. Results were similar but slightly attenuated when we used topical calcipotriol (alone or in combination with corticosteroids) for mild psoriasis.

Conclusions

We found that low-grade systemic inflammation, as measured by SII, NLR, and CRP, was an independent risk factor for psoriasis, especially moderate-to-severe disease. These findings support the hypothesis that low-grade systemic inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis rather than simply being a consequence of the disease.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^117CEA92]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — lesion characteristics and differential include that CU lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals of variable size and shape with surrounding erythema and are generally pruritic, whereas a painful or burning dysesthesia is not characteristic of CU and suggests the presence of cutaneous vasculitis. Individual urticarial lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours, but new lesions might be developing simultaneously at other skin sites, while in contrast, vasculitis lesions are palpable and usually nonblanching, spanning several days or more and often followed by residual hyperpigmented changes, although in some cases lesions might be more evanescent, similar to ordinary CU. Angioedema typically appears as nonpruritic, brawny, nonpitting edema, typically without well-defined margins and without erythema, and the medical work-up should keep in mind that CU is of undetermined cause in the majority of cases.

### Dupilumab for the treatment of pityriasis lichenoides chronica [^111R5tii]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case 1

A 21-year-old male presented with a 2-year history of a rash on his upper and lower extremities, trunk, back, and groin. The patient denied any history of contact exposures or unprotected oral or penetrative intercourse. No fever, chills, nausea/vomiting, joint pain, or other symptoms of illness were reported. The patient reported minimal itching. Past medical history was remarkable for eczema, allergies, and supraventricular tachycardia. On physical exam, multiple erythematous, scaly, excoriated papules were visualized on the trunk (body surface area > 10%) (Fig 1, A). The extensor surfaces of the upper extremities revealed widespread scaly, hypopigmented papules (Fig 1, B). Genital exam was deferred. Erythematous papules with linear burrowing were also found in interdigital webspaces of his hands. Due to the rash distribution and question of burrows, scabies treatment with 5% permethrin cream and triamcinolone 0.1% ointment was initiated. There was no improvement after treatment. At this time, pityriasis rosea was also considered. One month later, due to treatment failure of rash, a laboratory work-up was done. Serology tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, and syphilis were all negative. Complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were also unremarkable. Histopathologic findings from several biopsies revealed epidermal acanthosis, lymphocytes in the dermal-epidermal junction associated with focal basovacuolar change, and a mild perivascular inflammatory infiltrate in the superficial dermis (Fig 2). CD3 stains highlighted the T-lymphocytes, and the CD4:CD8 ratio was within normal limits. Periodic acid-Schiff stains were negative for fungal organisms. These findings were consistent with PLC. Prior biopsies showed no spongiosis and the patient reported minimal itch, making a spongiotic or hypersensitivity reaction less likely. Treatment with a 4-week prednisone taper, 0.05% clobetasol ointment, and 0.1% tacrolimus ointment failed to provide adequate disease control. There are no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for PLC as all current treatments are based on case reports. Methotrexate and phototherapy were discussed, but the patient declined both. The patient expressed an interest in avoiding systemic immunosuppression, so a trial of dupilumab was discussed, which the patient agreed to. Dupilumab was initiated with a loading dose of 600 mg and then 300 mg every other week. For over 1 year, the patient has sustained complete resolution of lesions on dupilumab exclusively.

### A rupioid rash [^113WxQow]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

A 72-year-old man presented for a thick hyperkeratotic skin rash on the shins that had erupted 7 months earlier after minimal local trauma (Fig. 1A, B). Topical treatments with glucocorticoids and antibiotics were ineffective, although a slight improvement was noted during summer. Additionally, low-grade fevers and an asymmetric oligoarthritis of the upper and lower limbs and dactylitis of the thumb and fourth toe on the left appeared over the last weeks. Mild non-specific onychodystrophy of the toes was found, whereas no inflammatory back pain or enthesitis was present. Plain radiographs did not reveal disease-specific deformities, erosions or osteo-proliferative lesions. Laboratory tests showed raised inflammatory markers (CRP: 17.7 mg/dl, ESR: 107 mm/h), leukopoenia (2.580/μL) and anaemia (haemoglobin: 10.3 g/dl). Differential diagnosis of the rash included crusted scabies, secondary syphilis, neutrophilic dermatoses, histoplasmosis and a hyperkeratotic psoriasis variant. Skin biopsy revealed psoriasiform acanthosis, thick parakeratosis, dense neutrophilic infiltration and microabscess formation (Fig. 1C). Based on the type of musculoskeletal involvement and the skin histopathology, the patient was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis with rupioid psoriasis. Treatment with medium-to-low dose systemic glucocorticoids and infliximab led to arthritis remission, skin (Fig. 1D) and laboratory improvement. Rupioid psoriasis (derived from the Greek word ρύπος = dirt) is a rare hyperkeratotic variant of psoriasis characterized by well-demarcated plaques with thick, dirty-appearing adherent crusts. It is associated with local treatment failure, psoriatic arthritis and male sex and it may present challenges in the diagnosis of patients with arthritis and systemic inflammation.

### The C-reactive protein in diseases of the skin… [^111CXDWz]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The C-reactive protein is a globulin, probably formed in the liver, which appears in the sera in response to neoplasia, necrosis, and inflammation. It is not found in normal serum. Although a nonspecific indicator of infection, it is quite sensitive. It has enjoyed current usage as a more delicate index of inflammation than the sedimentation rate in acute myocardial infarction and rheumatic fever. It has been suggested that the response to C-reactive protein may represent a threshold effect to a certain level of stimulus. 1 Since inflammatory stimuli vary qualitatively and quantitatively, it would be of interest to note the provocative power of individual dermatoses with special reference to the depth of the process, systemic ramifications, or complications, in eliciting a positive C-reactive protein. Accordingly, 56 hospitalized male patients, 44 white and 12 Negro, were studied. Methods and Criteria The YAFFEE H.

### Don't order an erythrocyte sedimentation rate to look for… [^115jai1d]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein is a more sensitive and specific reflection of the acute phase of inflammation than is the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In the first 24 hours of a disease process, the C-reactive protein will be elevated, whereas the erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be normal. If the source of inflammation is removed, the C-reactive protein will return to normal within a day or so, whereas the erythrocyte sedimentation rate will remain elevated for several days until excess fibrinogen is removed from the serum.
