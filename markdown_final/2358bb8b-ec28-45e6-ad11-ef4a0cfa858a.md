## Question

Is famotidine an option for treating reflux in infants?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether famotidine is an option for treating reflux in infants. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing physiologic GER from pathologic GERD. Then, I should review guideline recommendations specific to infants. Next, I will verify FDA labeling and dosing constraints for famotidine in infants. After that, I need to evaluate the efficacy data for H2RAs and PPIs in infants. I will then assess safety risks, particularly in preterm and young infants. Finally, I'll synthesize when, if ever, famotidine should be considered and under what monitoring and duration limits, before stating a clear bottom line recommendation [^113RkpXr] [^114EDa2d] [^113J8R4J].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because I need to ensure we are not conflating physiologic gastroesophageal reflux (GER) with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GER is very common in healthy infants, peaks around 4 months, and usually resolves by 12 months, whereas GERD implies troublesome symptoms or complications like poor weight gain, esophagitis, or respiratory issues that require targeted management; most infant "reflux" encounters are physiologic and do not warrant medications, so I should be cautious not to pathologize normal development [^113RkpXr] [^11593PV8] [^1149HS2Q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about acid-suppressive therapy in infants without checking authoritative guidelines. The 2018 NASPGHAN/ESPGHAN guidelines strongly recommend against using PPIs or H2RAs, including famotidine, for crying/distress or visible regurgitation in otherwise healthy infants, emphasizing nonpharmacologic strategies first; when GERD is confirmed with erosive esophagitis, PPIs are the first-line therapy in infants and children, with H2RAs reserved when PPIs are unavailable or contraindicated, and trials of acid suppression as a diagnostic test are discouraged in infants and in those with isolated extraesophageal symptoms, which I should explicitly keep in mind [^113RkpXr] [^114EDa2d] [^116ns1Kh] [^1138qZFg].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory labeling and dosing constraints for famotidine in infants, because prescribing must align with safety boundaries. The FDA labeling allows famotidine oral suspension at 0.5 mg/kg once daily for up to 4 weeks in infants under 3 months, and 0.5 mg/kg twice daily for up to 4 weeks in those 3 months to less than 1 year, with an explicit warning that safety and benefit beyond 4 weeks are not established and that it should be used only alongside conservative measures when benefits outweigh risks; pharmacokinetic data in very young infants are limited, with most PK/PD evidence coming from older pediatric cohorts, so I should confirm weight-based dosing and renal function if considered [^113J8R4J] [^111RrAgc] [^115sZE6S].

> Next, I should review efficacy evidence in infants, and I need to double-check that symptom outcomes truly improve, not just acid metrics. Evidence for H2RAs in infants is sparse and of very low quality, with at best histologic healing signals and no consistent symptom benefit, while multiple infant randomized trials of PPIs show no superiority over placebo for symptom improvement despite potent acid suppression, underscoring that non-acid reflux predominates and that maturation drives natural improvement; physiologic studies confirm acid suppression reduces acid exposure but does not address non-acid events that often drive infant symptoms [^117MCmzn] [^114tVJR4] [^111NrbQY] [^1116e58M] [^113jawXe] [^114XUqEt] [^111Fdgpb].

> I will now examine safety signals, because I need to ensure the risk-benefit calculus is favorable before considering any acid suppression in this age group. Acid-suppressive therapy in young children is associated with increased risks of serious infections, and in preterm infants both H2RAs and PPIs have been linked to adverse outcomes including higher rates of infections and necrotizing enterocolitis, while infant PPI trials also reported more adverse events than placebo; these risks, together with limited efficacy, argue strongly for restraint in infants and careful justification if used at all [^117DYbJW] [^115EZhUQ] [^114fVLJw] [^114tVJR4].

> But wait, what if there is a narrowly defined scenario where famotidine could be appropriate; I should specify those conditions precisely. If an infant has confirmed GERD with objective evidence such as erosive esophagitis, is older than 3 months, has failed optimized conservative measures, and a PPI is not available, contraindicated, or not tolerated, then a short, time-limited trial of famotidine for no more than 4 weeks with close follow-up could be considered, ensuring dosing per FDA labeling and reassessing for clear benefit and harms [^114EDa2d] [^113J8R4J] [^117LoC9c].

> Let me reconsider scenarios where famotidine should not be used, because I need to avoid overtreatment. Do not use acid suppression for uncomplicated infant regurgitation or crying in otherwise healthy infants, avoid using PPIs or H2RAs for isolated extraesophageal symptoms without GERD evidence, avoid pharmacologic therapy in preterm infants with clinically suspected GERD due to unfavorable risk-benefit balance, and avoid long-term maintenance in infants given the absence of safety and benefit data beyond 4 weeks [^113RkpXr] [^1138qZFg] [^116ns1Kh] [^115EZhUQ] [^113J8R4J].

> I should also confirm the broader practice pattern context, because overuse can bias clinical decision-making. Despite guideline recommendations, observational data show frequent and increasing use of acid suppressants in infants, often without confirmed GERD, reinforcing the importance of adhering to evidence-based indications and tapering or discontinuing when no objective benefit is observed on reassessment [^112hfhtN] [^116ohwyK] [^113qp2cj].

> Clinical bottom line synthesis: No, famotidine is not a routine option for infant "reflux" because most cases represent physiologic GER for which acid suppression is discouraged; in rare, well-documented infant GERD with erosive disease where PPIs are unsuitable, famotidine may be considered as a second-line, short-term adjunct to conservative therapy with careful monitoring and reassessment at or before 4 weeks, and if no clear benefit is observed, it should be stopped to minimize harm [^113RkpXr] [^114EDa2d] [^113J8R4J] [^114tVJR4].

Famotidine is **not recommended for routine use** in infants with uncomplicated reflux [^113RkpXr] because most cases are physiologic and self-resolving [^111kqCGA] [^1149HS2Q]. It may be considered for **short-term use** (up to 4 weeks) in infants with confirmed GERD who have failed conservative measures, using 0.5 mg/kg/dose [^113J8R4J] once daily for < 3 months or twice daily for 3–12 months [^111RrAgc]. Famotidine is generally well tolerated [^113J8R4J] but can cause irritability, headache, diarrhea, and rare serious events; long-term use is discouraged due to risks such as infections and bone effects [^113RkpXr] [^117DYbJW]. PPIs are preferred for erosive esophagitis or severe GERD [^114EDa2d], and famotidine should be stopped if there is no response after 4 weeks [^113J8R4J].

---

## Clinical indications for famotidine use in infants

Famotidine is indicated for infants with **confirmed GERD who have failed conservative measures** and have persistent symptoms or complications (e.g. esophagitis, poor weight gain, feeding difficulties) [^114EDa2d] [^113J8R4J] [^11593PV8]. Routine use for uncomplicated reflux is **not recommended**, as most cases are physiologic and self-resolving [^113RkpXr] [^111kqCGA] [^116AYzen].

---

## Recommended dosing and administration guidelines

The FDA provides **specific dosing recommendations** for famotidine in infants [^113J8R4J]:

| **Age group** | **Recommended dose** | **Frequency** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| < 3 months | 0.5 mg/kg/dose | Once daily | Up to 4 weeks |
| 3 months to < 1 year | 0.5 mg/kg/dose | Twice daily | Up to 4 weeks |

---

Conservative measures (e.g. thickened feedings) [^117LoC9c] should be **continued concurrently** with famotidine [^113J8R4J]. Safety and benefit beyond 4 weeks have **not been established** [^111RrAgc] [^113J8R4J].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting famotidine use in infants

Clinical evidence supporting famotidine use in infants is **limited** [^112R56ff]. A double-blind, randomized, treatment-withdrawal study of 35 infants (< 1 year) showed some benefit in symptom control and esophagitis healing over the short term (up to 4 weeks) [^113J8R4J]. However, the sample size was small, and long-term efficacy and safety remain uncertain [^117MCmzn] [^113RkpXr].

---

## Safety profile and potential side effects

Famotidine is generally well tolerated in infants, but potential side effects include:

- **Common side effects**: Irritability, headache, diarrhea, constipation, and rash [^113J8R4J].
- **Serious adverse events**: Rarely, seizures, arrhythmias, and hematologic abnormalities have been reported.
- **Long-term risks**: Prolonged acid suppression may increase the risk of infections (e.g. pneumonia, gastroenteritis), bone fractures, and nutrient malabsorption [^113RkpXr] [^117DYbJW].

---

## Comparison with other pharmacological treatments

Famotidine (H2RA) is **less effective than proton pump inhibitors** (PPIs) in reducing gastric acid secretion and healing erosive esophagitis [^1129s8aN]. PPIs are recommended as first-line therapy for severe GERD or erosive esophagitis in infants [^114EDa2d]. However, PPIs also carry risks, including an increased risk of infection and nutrient malabsorption [^117DYbJW].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **conservative management as the first-line approach** for infant reflux [^114EDa2d] [^1149HS2Q]. Pharmacologic therapy, including famotidine, should be reserved for infants with confirmed GERD after failure of conservative measures [^11593PV8]. Famotidine is recommended for **short-term use (up to 4 weeks)** [^113J8R4J], and its use beyond this period is not supported by current evidence [^112R56ff].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Famotidine **may be considered for short-term use** in infants with confirmed GERD who have failed conservative measures [^114EDa2d] [^113J8R4J]. It is generally well tolerated, but potential side effects and long-term risks warrant careful consideration [^113J8R4J]. Evidence supporting its use is limited, and current guidelines recommend conservative management as the primary approach [^112R56ff] [^113RkpXr]. Discontinue famotidine if **no clinical response** is observed after 4 weeks of treatment [^113J8R4J].

### Famotidine [^113J8R4J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

These studies suggest that a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg/dose of famotidine oral suspension may be of benefit for the treatment of GERD for up to 4 weeks once daily in patients under 3 months of age and twice daily in patients 3 months to less than 1 year of age; however, the safety and benefit of famotidine treatment beyond 4 weeks have not been established. Famotidine should be considered for the treatment of GERD only if conservative measures, such as thickened feedings, are used concurrently and if the potential benefit outweighs the risks.

- **Pediatric patients 1 to 16 years of age**: The use of famotidine in pediatric patients 1 to 16 years of age is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of famotidine in adults and by the following findings in pediatric patients. In published studies involving small numbers of pediatric patients aged 1 to 15 years, the clearance of famotidine was found to be similar to that observed in adults. For pediatric patients aged 11 to 15 years, oral doses of 0.5 mg/kg were associated with a mean area under the curve (AUC) similar to that seen in adults treated orally with 40 mg. Likewise, in pediatric patients aged 1 to 15 years, intravenous doses of 0.5 mg/kg were associated with a mean AUC similar to that observed in adults receiving intravenous treatment with 40 mg. Limited published studies also indicate that the relationship between serum concentration and acid suppression is comparable in pediatric patients aged 1 to 15 years as compared to adults. These studies suggest that the starting dose for pediatric patients 1 to 16 years of age is 0.25 mg/kg intravenously, injected over a period of not less than…

### Physiology of gastroesophageal reflux in the neonate [^111kqCGA]. Seminars in Perinatology (2025). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux is physiologically normal in infants but can progress to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) when it leads to significant symptoms, such as persistent vomiting, weight loss, and feeding difficulties. GERD is highly prevalent among infants and contributes to increased health care utilization. Several physiologic and lifestyle factors predispose infants to a higher degree of gastroesophageal reflux and related diseases.

Preterm infants and those admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit form a special population with unique risk factors for GERD, exhibiting a high prevalence of the condition. To better understand gastroesophageal reflux in infants and neonates with medical complexity, this article first reviews the physiology of typical swallowing and motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract in infants. Subsequently, it discusses the pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux in infants. Finally, the article addresses specific physiological differences in preterm infants that are critical for understanding the management of GERD in this specific population.

### Tests to assess symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux in infants and children [^112zgnWb]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

In studying antireflux medications, tests for assessing symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux are used to establish or confirm a diagnosis of reflux disease and to evaluate whether study subjects are improving with therapy. Symptom assessment questionnaires need to be validated, results need to be reproducible, and the outcome variables measured need to be clinically relevant. Other outcomes for clinical trials include measures of esophagitis: histologic (morphometric) measures in infants, and endoscopic and histologic visualization in older children. Intraesophageal pH monitoring studies may be useful for obtaining pharmacodynamic data.

### Safety and efficacy of proton pump inhibitors in preterm infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease [^117Hotro]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Although physiological reflux is seen in nearly all newborns to varying degrees, symptoms can be severe and cause gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In preterm infants, one symptom that is often attributed to GERD is apnea and associated cardiorespiratory events, such as bradycardia and oxygen desaturation. Although the relationship between GERD and apnea, bradycardia, and desaturation events remains a subject of ongoing investigation, trials of agents that reduce gastric acidity, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPI), have been conducted to assess the effect of these agents on GERD.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of PPIs for the treatment of preterm infants with diagnosed or suspected GERD.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two trial registries, and Epistemonikos in October 2023. We checked reference lists of included studies, and studies and systematic reviews in which the subject matter was related to the intervention or population examined in this review.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials, cross-over trials, and cluster-randomized trials that assessed the use of PPIs (including esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, or rabeprazole) alone or in combination. Infants had to receive treatment for a minimum of three days. We considered the following comparisons: (1) PPIs versus no treatment, (2) PPI versus positioning changes (elevated head of bed or prone positioning), (3) PPI versus dietary changes (thickened feeds).

### Pharmacological treatment of children with gastro-oesophageal reflux [^112R56ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a common disorder, characterized by regurgitation of gastric contents into the oesophagus. GOR is a very common presentation in infancy in both primary and secondary care settings and can affect approximately 50% of infants younger than three months old. The natural history of GOR in infancy is generally that of a functional, self-limiting condition that improves with age; less than 5% of children with vomiting or regurgitation continue to have symptoms after infancy. Older children and children with co-existing medical conditions can have a more protracted course. The definition of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and its precise distinction from GOR are debated, but consensus guidelines from the North American Society of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN-ESPGHAN guidelines 2009) define GORD as "troublesome symptoms or complications of GOR".

This Cochrane review aims to provide a robust analysis of currently available pharmacological interventions used to treat children with GOR by assessing all outcomes indicating benefit or harm.

- **Search methods**: We sought to identify relevant published trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE, and EMBASE (1966 to 2014), the Centralised Information Service for Complementary Medicine (CISCOM), the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Science Citation Index (on BIDS-UK General Science Index), and the ISI Web of Science. We also searched for ongoing trials.

### Famotidine [^111RrAgc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Pharmacokinetic data from clinical trials and a published study in pediatric patients (3 months to 15 years) are comparable to those obtained for adults. Bioavailability studies of 8 pediatric patients (11 to 15 years of age) showed a mean oral bioavailability of 0.5 compared to adult values of 0.42 to 0.49. Oral doses of 0.5 mg/kg achieved AUCs of 645 ± 249 ng-hr/mL and 580 ± 60 ng-hr/mL in pediatric patients under 1 year of age (N = 5) and in pediatric patients 11 to 15 years of age, respectively, compared to 482 ± 181 ng-hr/mL in adults treated with 40 mg orally.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Pharmacodynamics of famotidine were evaluated in 5 pediatric patients aged 2 to 13 years using the sigmoid Emax model. These data suggest that the relationship between serum concentration of famotidine and gastric…

### Protonix delayed-release [^114tVJR4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Protonix was not found to be effective in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, treatment-withdrawal study involving 129 pediatric patients aged 1 through 11 months. Participants were enrolled based on a history of symptomatic GERD and a lack of response to non-pharmacological interventions for two weeks. Initially, all patients received Protonix daily for four weeks during an open-label phase. Subsequently, they were randomized in equal proportions to receive either Protonix treatment or a placebo for an additional four weeks under double-blind conditions. Efficacy was evaluated by measuring the time from randomization to study discontinuation due to symptom worsening during the four-week treatment-withdrawal phase. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of discontinuation between Protonix and placebo.

In this trial, adverse reactions reported more commonly (a difference of ≥ 4%) in the treated group compared to the placebo group included elevated CK, otitis media, rhinitis, and laryngitis.

A population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that systemic exposure to Protonix was higher in patients less than 1 year of age with GERD compared to adults receiving a single 40 mg dose. The geometric mean AUC was 103% higher in preterm infants and neonates receiving a single dose of 2.5 mg of Protonix and 23% higher in infants aged 1 through 11 months receiving a single dose of approximately 1.2 mg/kg. In these patients, the apparent clearance (CL/F) increased with age, with a median clearance of 0.6 L/hr and a range from 0.03 to 3.2 L/hr.

### Role of feeding strategy bundle with acid-suppressive therapy in infants with esophageal acid reflux exposure: a randomized controlled trial [^111cVez5]. Pediatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

We addressed the practice controversies in this clinical trial:

- **Screening and identification**: Screening and identifying acid-GERD objectively is possible in symptomatic infants prior to any pharmacotherapy.

- **Feeding strategy modification**: Modifications such as fluid restriction, positional changes, and prolonged feeding duration have no role in decreasing reflux-type symptoms or in improving the primary outcome of achieving independent oral feeds and/or a 6-point decrease in I-GERQ-R score.

- **Chronic lung disease prevalence**: No difference in the prevalence of chronic lung disease was noted between the groups.

- **I-GERQ-R scores over time**: I-GERQ-R scores decreased across time regardless of treatment group allocations, strongly supporting a maturational effect. However, we did not detect an effect on a priori short- or long-term outcomes following randomized allocations.

As restrictive feeding strategies do not make a difference, placebo-controlled clinical trials in a larger cohort of convalescing NICU infants with objectively determined newer GERD criteria must be addressed in future trials.

### Safety and efficacy of delayed release rabeprazole in 1- to 11-month-old infants with symptomatic GERD [^1116e58M]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of rabeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, were studied in infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

- **Methods**: Infants ages 1 to 11 months with symptomatic GERD resistant to conservative therapy and/or previous exposure to acid-suppressive medications were screened. After scoring > 16 on a GERD symptom score (Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire-Revised [I-GERQ]), 344 infants were enrolled in a 1- to 3-week open-label (OL) phase and received rabeprazole 10 mg/day. Following caregiver-rated clinical improvement during the OL phase, patients were randomized to receive either placebo, rabeprazole 5 mg, or rabeprazole 10 mg in the ensuing 5-week double-blind (DB) withdrawal phase. The primary endpoints evaluated from DB baseline to the end of the DB withdrawal phase included frequency of regurgitation, weight-for-age z-score, and daily and weekly GERD symptom scores.

- **Results**: Overall, 231 (86%) of the 268 randomized infants (placebo: 90; rabeprazole 5 mg: 90; rabeprazole 10 mg: 88) completed the study. Efficacy endpoints were similarly improved during the OL phase in all groups and continued improving during the DB withdrawal phase with no significant difference between the placebo and combined rabeprazole groups. The mean decrease in frequency of regurgitation was -0.79 vs. -1.20 times per day (P = 0.168), in I-GERQ-Revised scores was -3.6 [-25%] vs. -3.9 points [-27%] (P = 0.960), in I-GERQ-Daily Diary scores was -1.87 [-19%] vs. -1.85 [-19%] (P = 0.968), and increase in weight-for-age z scores was 0.11 [0.329] vs. 0.14 [0.295]; (P = 0.440).

### National Study of Off-label Proton Pump Inhibitor Use Among New Zealand Infants in the First Year of Life (2005–2012) [^113qp2cj]. Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Off-label prescribing of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to infants to treat symptoms attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is widely reported, despite evidence that PPIs are no more effective than placebo in relieving those symptoms. To initiate discussion about appropriate prescribing of these drugs for infants, we describe the characteristics of PPI use among infants in New Zealand.

Methods

In this population-based study we used routinely collected dispensing data to identify all children born between 2005 and 2012 who were dispensed a government-subsidized PPI (omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole) before their first birthday. Unique patient identifiers were used to link administrative datasets containing patient-level demographic, dispensing, and health information.

Results

In total, 22,643 children were dispensed a study PPI before their first birthday. The prevalence of infant PPI use as a proportion of all live births increased from 2.4% for children born in 2005 to 5.2% for children born in 2012. Overall, 71.6% of infants were dispensed a PPI by 3 months of age, and 8.7% received a PPI within the first month of life. Before PPI initiation, only 7.0% of infants had a hospital-based diagnosis of GERD (with or without esophagitis), and 4.7% of infants had a hospital-based diagnosis of one or more known or suspected GERD risk factors.

Conclusions

Off-label prescribing of PPIs to New Zealand infants was relatively common and increased over the study period. The appropriateness of PPI treatment should be questioned, as the majority of inf

### Anti-reflux medication use in preterm infants [^112hfhtN]. Pediatric Research (2022). High credibility.

Despite these recommendations, anti-reflux medications are frequently used. A large retrospective study, including infants admitted to neonatal units in 43 children's hospitals in the United States, reported that 24% received either an H2RA or PPI, with the extremely preterm infants being the most likely to receive these medicines. Similarly, Malcolm et al. reported that a quarter of extremely low birth weight infants who were enrolled in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Network generic database in 2002–2003 were discharged from the hospital with anti-reflux medications.

In the UK, two survey studies of neonatal healthcare professionals, in 2004 and 2018, revealed that clinicians reported frequently prescribing anti-reflux medications in neonatal units. Dhillon and Ewer reported that, in 2004, nearly all respondents used anti-reflux medications to manage GOR. In 2018, another survey showed that the use of anti-reflux medications remained popular despite the increasing evidence of lack of efficacy and possible harm. Both studies analyzed the use of medications as reported by clinicians. There are no studies that have analyzed the prevalence of GORD diagnosis and the actual use of anti-reflux medications in neonatal units in the UK.

In this study, we aimed to describe the prevalence of GORD diagnosis and the use of anti-reflux medications amongst very preterm infants in England as well as Wales. We also aimed to analyze the types of medications used, duration, and trend of medication use between 2010 and 2017.

### Role of feeding strategy bundle with acid-suppressive therapy in infants with esophageal acid reflux exposure: A randomized controlled trial [^1111vFqU]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

The strengths and clinical implications of the GMT trial are several:

- **Random allocation, study design, and protocol adherence**: These were robust and rigorous. Although our strict inclusion criteria may have led to lower eligibility, this approach resulted in carefully identifying infants with true acid reflux index (ARI) as a marker of esophageal acid exposure. Objective determination of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) based on ARI > 7% is justifiable in future trials, as nearly 40% of infants fall within this severe range. It is possible to study such a group in larger clinical trials based on pH and impedance criteria while employing a placebo for equipoise. Since time-limited proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy with feeding strategies was neither shown to be beneficial nor associated with adverse effects, it is safe to include a completely untreated placebo group in future trials enrolling patients with objectively determined acid-GERD.

- **Management strategies, feeding, and testing guidelines**: These were tightly regulated, and treatment was uniformly delivered across the two groups. The patient population was homogeneous and fairly represented the convalescing neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) population. The randomized controlled allocation accounted for premature or full-term birth and the indeterminate or determinate acid-GERD per ARI. Furthermore, the prevalence of oxygen requirement or tube feeding at discharge was not different between the groups.

- **Objectivity in study methods**: The determination of the Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire-Revised (I-GERQ-R) and ARI, as well as the monitoring of feeding methods during the trial, are strengths of the study.

Overall, the study clearly demonstrates the potential for conducting future trials with objective measures of acid-GERD and provides a framework for tightly controlled management strategies.

### Updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111gv15W]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were published in 1995 and updated in 1999. These and other guidelines undergo periodic review. Advances continue to be made in the area of GERD, leading us to review and revise previous guideline statements. GERD is defined as symptoms or mucosal damage produced by the abnormal reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. These guidelines were developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and were approved by the Board of Trustees.

- **Diagnostic guidelines**: Address empiric therapy and the use of endoscopy, ambulatory reflux monitoring, and esophageal manometry in GERD.
- **Treatment guidelines**: Address the role of lifestyle changes, patient-directed (OTC) therapy, acid suppression, promotility therapy, maintenance therapy, antireflux surgery, and endoscopic therapy in GERD.
- **Refractory GERD**: Finally, there is a discussion of the rare patient with refractory GERD and a list of areas in need of additional study.

Scant data exist on the normal range of serum gastrin in infants. In phase I and III trials of rabeprazole in gastroesophageal reflux disease, we studied serum gastrin levels in infants 1 to 11 months old and assessed normal ranges and the effect of acid-suppressive drugs.

- **Methods**: Overall, 349 treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced (previously exposed to proton pump inhibitors and/or H2-receptor antagonists) infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease were screened for baseline serum gastrin. Repeat gastrin was monitored at early termination or the end of the study, allowing assessment of 1- to 8-week daily rabeprazole (5- or 10-mg) treatment on gastrin levels.

- **Results**: Median (5%-95% range) baseline gastrin was 118 ng/L (39–315) in the treatment-naïve group (n = 251), driven mostly by high levels (121.5 [48–326] ng/L) in the 1- to < 4-month-old subgroup. Treatment-experienced infants (n = 98) had elevated baseline gastrin levels (152 [48–487] ng/L; P = 0.0011) with no clear difference between previously proton pump inhibitor-exposed and H2-receptor antagonist-exposed groups. At the end of the study, mean (standard deviation) levels were unchanged from baseline in infants withdrawn from rabeprazole to placebo (124 [94] ng/L), but elevated from baseline in those continuing treatment with 5-mg (245 [151] ng/L) and 10-mg (332 [222] ng/L) rabeprazole during the study.

- **Conclusions**: Gastrin levels in treatment-naïve infants were elevated through 8 months of age. Between 8 and 12 months of age, they declined so that the median level was within the upper limit of the normal.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease in infants: how much is predictable with questionnaires, pH-metry, endoscopy and histology [^1168W31c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are common in infants. It is often difficult to discriminate between physiological and pathologic gastroesophageal reflux, although this discrimination is essential to determine which infants to evaluate and treat.

- **Objectives**: To identify the prevalence of reflux symptoms in infants and to evaluate the predictive value of a questionnaire and the correlation between pH study, histology, and clinical score.

- **Methods**: Parents of 100 unselected infants visiting the well-baby clinic and 100 infants suspected of having gastroesophageal reflux disease were asked to fill in a 35-item questionnaire. A validated score, the Orenstein I-GERQ, was applied for selected questions. All infants suspected of having gastroesophageal reflux disease underwent prolonged esophageal pH monitoring, and 44 of 100 underwent upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy with esophageal biopsy.

- **Results**: Parents of infants with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease reported significantly more regurgitation (68% versus 45%, P < 0.05). Pathological reflux (reflux index > 10%) was found in 21 of 100 (21%) infants and was significantly associated only with pneumonia, apnea with fussing (P = 0.013 for both), defecation less than once a day (P = 0.033), and constipation (P = 0.05). Esophagitis was present in 17 of 44 (39%) infants, and no single question was found to be significantly predictive. Additionally, 38% of infants with a pathologic pH study had a normal esophageal biopsy, and 53% of infants with esophagitis had a normal pH study.

### Role of feeding strategy bundle with acid-suppressive therapy in infants with esophageal acid reflux exposure: a randomized controlled trial [^114tAdC1]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

To test the hypothesis that a feeding bundle combined with acid suppression is superior to acid suppression alone in improving gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) attributed-symptom scores and feeding outcomes in neonatal ICU infants, a study was conducted.

Infants (N = 76) between 34 and 60 weeks' postmenstrual age with an acid reflux index greater than 3% were randomly allocated to either a study group (acid-suppressive therapy plus feeding bundle) or a conventional group (acid-suppressive therapy only) arms for four weeks. The feeding bundle included total fluid volume.

Feeding strategy modifications combined with acid suppression are not superior to proton pump inhibitors (PPI) alone in improving GERD symptoms or in discharge feeding, short-term, and long-term outcomes.

Conservative feeding therapies are thought to modify GERD symptoms and its consequences.

### Effect of omeprazole on acid gastroesophageal reflux and gastric acidity in preterm infants with pathological acid reflux [^111Fdgpb]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is increasingly being used to treat premature infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); however, the efficacy of PPI therapy on acid production in this population has yet to be thoroughly assessed. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of 0.7 mg/kg/d omeprazole on gastric acidity and acid gastroesophageal reflux in preterm infants with reflux symptoms and pathological acid reflux on a 24-hour pH probe.

- **Methods**: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design trial of omeprazole therapy was performed in 10 preterm infants (34–40 weeks postmenstrual age). Infants were given omeprazole for 7 days and then placebo for 7 days in randomly assigned order. Twenty-four-hour esophageal and gastric pH monitoring was performed on days 7 and 14 of the trial.

- **Results**: Compared to placebo, omeprazole therapy significantly reduced gastric acidity (% time pH < 4, 54% vs. 14%, P < 0.0005), esophageal acid exposure (% time pH < 4, 19% vs. 5%, P < 0.01), and the number of acid GER episodes (119 vs. 60 episodes, P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Omeprazole is effective in reducing esophageal acid exposure in premature infants with pathological acid reflux, as measured by a 24-hour pH probe. However, the more complex issues of safety and long-term efficacy have yet to be fully addressed.

### Ranitidine immediate release [^1179TSC2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The recommended adult oral dosage for the treatment of GERD is 150 mg twice daily. For erosive esophagitis, it is advised to take 150 mg four times daily. The maintenance of healing for erosive esophagitis requires a dosage of 150 mg twice daily.

For pediatric use, the safety and effectiveness of ranitidine have been established for those aged 1 month to 16 years. However, there is insufficient information on the pharmacokinetics of ranitidine in neonatal patients (younger than 1 month) to make dosing recommendations.

- **Pediatric dosing information**:

	- **Treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers**: The recommended oral dose for treating active duodenal and gastric ulcers is 2 to 4 mg/kg twice daily, with a maximum of 300 mg/day. This recommendation is based on adult clinical trials and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients.

	- **Maintenance of healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers**: The recommended oral dose for the maintenance of healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers is 2 to 4 mg/kg once daily, with a maximum of 150 mg/day. This recommendation is also derived from adult clinical trials and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients.

	- **Treatment of GERD and erosive esophagitis**: Although limited data exist for these conditions in pediatric patients, published literature supports a dosage of 5 to 10 mg/kg/day, usually given in two divided doses.

For patients with impaired renal function, dosage adjustments should be made based on clinical experience with patients with severely impaired renal function.

### Pharmacokinetics of ranitidine in preterm and term neonates with gastroesophageal reflux [^1124YZEs]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Ranitidine decreases gastric acid secretion and improves esophagitis. It is fundamental to understand its pharmacokinetic activities to optimize its use in treating each patient. Several organ systems in normal newborns and infants progressively mature, an eventuality that depends on the specific organ system and the involved iso-enzyme. In a study by Hedenström et al. on the pharmacokinetics of ranitidine in adults, it was found that using a multiple dosing scheme has similar parameters to a single dosing scheme. Following intravenous administration, its concentration adheres to bi-exponential kinetics. In neonates, the half-life elimination is approximately 2 hours and is slightly prolonged after oral administration. Hepatic metabolism serves as one elimination route, suggesting the drug undergoes enterohepatic recirculation for a bi-exponential rate.

Due to the high risk of either overdosing or under-dosing in newborns, which could lead to therapeutic failure or toxic effects, studying ranitidine pharmacokinetics in this patient group is crucial. The absence of specific dosing schemes for newborns has led physicians to modify dosing schemes intended for older children, often resulting in overdosing or sub-therapeutic dosing schemes.

In a study of pharmacokinetics of ranitidine in 27 full-term newborns without liver or kidney problems using 2.4 mg/kg of ranitidine, Fontana et al. examined…

### Role of feeding strategy bundle with acid-suppressive therapy in infants with esophageal acid reflux exposure: a randomized controlled trial [^114XUqEt]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

It is important to note that the major mechanisms of GER, i.e. transient LES relaxation, are the primary reasons for any reflux events — both acid or nonacid substrate. Our therapeutic target was ARI in this study via PPI, feeding volumes, and positional changes. Given that acid GER can also be weakly or nonacid either before or after PPI therapy, and that there were no differences in outcomes between the two groups, we speculate that neither PPI, feeding volume, nor positional changes modify the studied indices or symptoms. Maturation under optimal conditions of good nutrition, along with placebo-controlled trials, are needed to address the importance of weakly acid or nonacid GER, which would require a multicenter trial with a large group of infants with appropriate physiologic diagnostic testing.

Our study has limitations:

- **Parental and physician biases**: These appeared to be a barrier to recruitment. Recruitment was slow despite the high prevalence of GERD-associated symptoms and a high eligibility rate. This is concerning, as many parents refused clinical trial participation. Many infants did not have true acid-GERD, and fluid restriction often occurred before testing. Interestingly, in some cases, parents and providers did not want to stop the PPI use. These barriers to recruitment can be mitigated in future larger trials with better parent−provider education, as no major effects on the primary or secondary outcomes were noted in our study with or without our allocated bundled GERD treatment.

- **Screening challenges**: Owing to the higher screening to eligibility ratio, rigorous inclusion criteria, and stri

### Do pediatricians apply the 2009 NASPGHAN-ESPGHAN guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux after being trained [^1125oWKo]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

According to a recent survey, the 2009 North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition-European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition gastroesophageal reflux guidelines are poorly adhered to by European primary care pediatricians. The main issue raised from the survey was the prescription of unnecessary acid suppressive medications, especially in infants. No inquiry into the reasons was made. The primary objective of the present study was to assess the applicability of the guidelines in European primary care pediatricians undergoing specific trainings.

- **Methods**: One hundred pediatricians involved in the previous survey agreed to participate and were randomly divided into two groups. One group was trained in the guidelines through an online podcast, and the other group was trained through a synopsis. During the following three months, each involved pediatrician was asked to enroll every consecutive infant, child, or adolescent with suggestive reflux symptoms. For every enrolled patient, pediatricians filled in a report concerning their diagnostic and therapeutic choices.

- **Results**: A total of 382 patients (boys/girls 186/196, infants/children/adolescents 194/123/65) were enrolled by pediatricians. Infants with unexplained crying and/or distressed behavior who were prescribed proton-pump inhibitors were 3.7% compared with 45.2% of the survey data obtained before the training (P < 0.05). Infants with uncomplicated regurgitation and vomiting who were prescribed proton-pump inhibitors were 4.5% against 37.1%.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and risk of serious infections in young children [^117DYbJW]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) effectively reduce gastric acid secretion and are one of the main treatments for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In infants, GERD may be difficult to distinguish from uncomplicated gastroesophageal reflux, a physiological process involving spitting up that affects up to 60% to 70% of infants at age 3 to 4 months and resolves spontaneously with standing and walking by 12 months. Uncomplicated gastroesophageal reflux does not require PPI treatment.

PPI use is growing among young children in most high-income countries. In France, 6.1% of children younger than 2 years used PPIs in 2019, up from 3.6% in 2010. In the first year of life, the prevalence of PPI use increased from 2.4% to 5.2% between 2005 and 2012 in New Zealand, while prescription rates were 1.9% in Sweden, 2.3% in Norway, and 4.6% in Denmark in 2020, a 3- to 5-fold increase since 2000.

PPI use has been associated with bone fractures, acute kidney injury, allergy, asthma, and inflammatory bowel diseases in children. They are also suspected of leading to infections through pH modification or direct action on the immune system. Although young children are particularly vulnerable to infections, real-life pediatric data evaluating this risk are scarce. The aim of this nationwide cohort study was to investigate the association between PPI use and serious infections in young children.

### Gastroesophageal reflux in infants: More than just a phenomenon [^116AYzen]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Rarely have the best methods of diagnosis or treatment of a disease engendered more controversy than gastroesophageal reflux (GER), a highly prevalent condition in infants.

- **Objective**: To discuss the latest controversies in the diagnosis and treatment of GER in infants.

- **Evidence review**: All articles related to the diagnosis and treatment of GER were reviewed and, whenever possible, literature about infants was weighted with greater importance than literature about older children and adults.

- **Findings**: Although as many as 60% of infants have signs of GER, the role of GER in causing disease is difficult to elucidate. Despite new diagnostic tools to detect acid and nonacid reflux, our understanding of the relationship between reflux events and symptoms is complex. Furthermore, acid suppression, the mainstay of therapy for GER, increases the burden of nonacid reflux, which is already much higher in infants than in older children and which may worsen symptoms. Therefore, more conservative therapies are recommended for symptomatic infants.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: Although GER is a common reason for visits to primary care providers and specialists, few data suggest that GER results in many of the symptoms to which it has been attributed. A strong shift away from acid-suppression therapy in infants has occurred because of the adverse effects, lack of efficacy, and increase of nonacid reflux burden relative to acid burden. Nonpharmacologic measures should be used whenever possible because most infant GER will resolve without intervention.

### Use of medications for gastroesophageal reflux at discharge among extremely low birth weight infants [^115nucjY]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Our goals were to determine the use of medications to treat gastroesophageal reflux in extremely low birth weight infants (birth weight of < 1000 g) at the time of hospital discharge and to identify demographic and clinical variables associated with the use of these medications. Among the 5126 infants who were discharged, 414 (8.1%) were sent home with prescriptions for antireflux medications. Notably, medication administration was more likely for infants experiencing medical complications, prolonged ventilation periods, or extended hospital stays. Additionally, infants discharged at < 42 weeks were discharged with antireflux medications.

For those infants, no tested variables were associated with treatment with antireflux medications at discharge.

### Role of feeding strategy bundle with acid-suppressive therapy in infants with esophageal acid reflux exposure: a randomized controlled trial [^1137noCw]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

This single-center, single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02486263) compares the effectiveness of two feeding strategies combined with the use of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), omeprazole, in managing acid-GERD in infants. Referred to as the GERD Management and Therapy (GMT) trial, it received approval from the Institutional Research Board (IRB) at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH (IRB #11–00734). Omeprazole is commonly used off-label for this population as part of the standard care. A data safety monitoring plan was implemented and monitored quarterly by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Written, signed, and informed parental consent was obtained, in adherence with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Study principal investigators (PI) and registered nurse (RN) coordinators were available 24/7.

Twenty-four-hour pH-impedance studies were conducted using equipment from Laborie Medical Technologies, Mississauga, ON, Canada. The ARI, representing the duration of esophageal acid exposure as a percentage, was calculated. Additionally, the I-GERQ-R symptom score was collected. Demographic and clinical outcomes were managed using research electronic data capture (REDCap) tools for up to 2 years from subject enrollment.

### Overuse of reflux medications in infants [^116ohwyK]. Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) occurs in up to two-thirds of healthy infants and usually resolves by one year of life. In contrast to GER, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is reflux that can involve poor weight gain, pain, or mucosal injury on endoscopy. Acid suppressants, such as histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) and proton-pump inhibitors (PPI), reduce gastric acidity but are not effective against GER. Acid suppressants have been linked to a higher risk of serious infections and fractures.

Weighing the risks of these medications against their unclear benefit, Choosing Wisely and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended against their use in infants with GER. Our objective was to determine the individual and health care system characteristics associated with acid suppressant overuse using a statewide all-payers claims database from the most recent years available with newer International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes that can distinguish GER from GERD.

### Gastroesophageal reflux: Management guidance for the pediatrician [^11593PV8]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Recent comprehensive guidelines developed by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition define gastroesophageal reflux (GER) as the physiologic passage of gastric contents into the esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as reflux associated with troublesome symptoms or complications. The ability to distinguish between GER and GERD is increasingly important to implement best practices in the management of acid reflux in patients across all pediatric age groups, as children with GERD may benefit from further evaluation and treatment, whereas conservative recommendations are the only indicated therapy in those with uncomplicated physiologic reflux.

This clinical report endorses the rigorously developed, well-referenced North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition guidelines and likewise emphasizes important concepts for the general pediatrician. A key issue is distinguishing between the clinical manifestations of GER and GERD in term infants, children, and adolescents to identify patients who can be managed with conservative treatment by the pediatrician and to refer patients who require consultation with a gastroenterologist. Accordingly, the evidence basis presented by the guidelines for diagnostic approaches as well as treatments is discussed. Lifestyle changes are emphasized as first-line therapy in both GER and GERD, whereas medications are explicitly indicated only for patients with GERD. Surgical therapies are reserved for children with intractable symptoms.

### Lansoprazole [^113jawXe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Based on the results of the Phase 3 efficacy study, lansoprazole was not shown to be effective. Therefore, these results do not support the use of lansoprazole in treating symptomatic GERD in infants.

- **Study in pediatric patients (one year to 11 years of age)**: In an uncontrolled, open-label, US multicenter study, 66 pediatric patients with GERD were assigned, based on body weight, to receive an initial dose of either lansoprazole 15 mg daily if ≤ 30 kg or lansoprazole 30 mg daily if greater than 30 kg, administered for eight to 12 weeks. The lansoprazole dose was increased (up to 30 mg twice daily) in 24 of 66 pediatric patients after two or more weeks of treatment if they remained symptomatic. At baseline, 85% of patients had mild to moderate overall GERD symptoms (assessed by investigator interview), 58% had non-erosive GERD, and 42% had erosive esophagitis (assessed by endoscopy).

After eight to 12 weeks of lansoprazole treatment, the intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated an approximate 50% reduction in frequency and severity of GERD symptoms. Twenty-one of 27 erosive esophagitis patients were healed at eight weeks, and 100% of patients were healed at 12 weeks by endoscopy.

### Protonix delayed-release [^111NrbQY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Protonix was not found to be effective in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, treatment-withdrawal study of 129 pediatric patients aged 1 through 11 months. These patients enrolled if they had symptomatic GERD based on medical history and had not responded to non-pharmacologic interventions for GERD for two weeks. During the study, patients received Protonix daily for four weeks in an open-label phase. They were then randomized in equal proportion to receive Protonix treatment or a placebo for the subsequent four weeks in a double-blind manner. Efficacy was assessed by observing the time from randomization to study discontinuation due to symptom worsening during the four-week treatment-withdrawal phase. There was no statistically significant difference between Protonix and placebo in the rate of discontinuation.

The adverse reactions that were reported more commonly (a difference of ≥ 4%) in the treated population compared to the placebo population included elevated CK, otitis media, rhinitis, and laryngitis.

In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the systemic exposure was higher in patients less than 1 year of age with GERD compared to adults who received a single 40 mg dose. The geometric mean AUC was 103% higher in preterm infants and neonates receiving a single dose of 2.5 mg of Protonix, and 23% higher in infants aged 1 through 11 months receiving a single dose of approximately 1.2 mg/kg. In these patients, the apparent clearance (CL/F) increased with age (median clearance: 0.6 L/hr, range: 0.03 to 3.2 L/hr).

### Guidelines for evaluation and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in infants and children: Recommendations of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition [^116uFFji]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER), defined as the passage of gastric contents into the esophagus, and GER disease (GERD), defined as symptoms or complications of GER, are common pediatric problems encountered by both primary and specialty medical providers. Clinical manifestations of GERD in children include vomiting, poor weight gain, dysphagia, abdominal or substernal pain, esophagitis, and respiratory disorders.

The GER Guideline Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition has formulated a clinical practice guideline for the management of pediatric GER. The GER Guideline Committee, consisting of a primary care pediatrician, two clinical epidemiologists (who also practice primary care pediatrics), and five pediatric gastroenterologists, based its recommendations on an integration of a comprehensive and systematic review of the medical literature combined with expert opinion. Consensus was achieved through the Nominal Group Technique, a structured quantitative method.

The Committee examined the value of diagnostic tests and treatment modalities commonly used for the management of GERD, and how those interventions can be applied to clinical situations in infants and older children. The guideline provides recommendations for management by the primary care provider, including evaluation, initial treatment, follow-up management, and indications for consultation by a specialist. The guideline also provides recommendations for management by the pediatric gastroenterologist. This document represents the official recommendations of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition.

### Pharmacokinetics of ranitidine in preterm and term neonates with gastroesophageal reflux [^1124Arur]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Use of ranitidine with other drugs in diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux is common. Gastroesophageal reflux is a common disorder of upper gastrointestinal motility that varies widely in severity and prognosis. Understanding ranitidine pharmacokinetics, along with other drugs typically combined for treating this condition, is crucial for optimizing therapeutic benefits. Although gastroesophageal reflux commonly affects elderly individuals, the pharmacokinetic variability in this population is notable. Furthermore, the primary condition of gastroesophageal reflux often coexists with symptoms and other medical issues that require treatment with additional compounds.

The ideal therapy for esophageal reflux should demonstrate linear pharmacokinetics, a relatively long plasma half-life (t½ el) allowing for once-daily administration, and a consistent effect independent of interactions with food, antacids, and other medications. In this study, total clearance of ranitidine was well correlated with glomerular filtration velocity. The administration of ranitidine (3 mg/kg/24 h) for 72 hours was reduced to 24 hours, suggesting that in full-term newborns with stable hepatic and renal functions, administration need not be more frequent than every 12 hours. Treatment response should be monitored with repeated measurements of gastric pH, and doses should be adjusted according to the response obtained.

### Anti-reflux medication use in preterm infants [^114Bg8Wp]. Pediatric Research (2022). Low credibility.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR), the passage of gastric contents into the oesophagus, is common in preterm infants. It usually occurs due to the relatively abundant volume of liquid intake and supine feeding position. However, GOR can worsen and lead to troublesome signs and symptoms, i.e.g.astro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).

Determination of the exact prevalence of GOR versus GORD is challenging because of an unclear distinction between physiologic and pathologic reflux. Additionally, the terms "reflux", "acid-reflux", and GORD are often used interchangeably by healthcare professionals as well as parents and families of infants. In a retrospective cohort study of 33 neonatal units in the United States, there was a wide variation in the proportion of preterm infants diagnosed with GORD based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9). Approximately 10% of infants born at 22–36 weeks gestational age (GA) were recorded to have GORD, with diagnosis prevalence ranging from 2.4 to 29.9% across the included neonatal units.

Anti-reflux medications, including histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) and proton-pump inhibitors (PPI), are unlicensed for use in neonates in the UK and many other countries, though off-label use is frequently reported. Antacids and other acid-suppressing agents may reduce gastric acidity, but anti-reflux medications do not improve signs or symptoms of GORD. Their use has been associated with increased risks of adverse outcomes, including necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and infections. The North American Society fo

### Proton pump inhibitor use in infants: FDA reviewer experience [^115c2yQ1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration has completed its review of four clinical trials evaluating the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in infants (ages 1 month to < 12 months) for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). An Advisory Committee meeting was held in November 2010 to discuss the potential reasons why PPI use in these trials failed to show a benefit in infants with GERD and directions for future study. The present review summarizes the findings from the clinical trials. Potential mechanisms for the failed clinical trials are discussed, and the safety of long-term use is also examined. As a result of our analysis and review, the authors agree with the Advisory Committee members that PPIs should not be administered to treat the symptoms of GERD in otherwise healthy infants without evidence of acid-induced disease.

### Short-term treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1129s8aN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of acid suppressant drugs in the empirical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and in the treatment of endoscopy-negative reflux disease (ENRD).

- **Design**: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched, and bibliographies were reviewed.

- **Setting**: Studies were eligible if they compared the short-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) with each other or with placebo in adults with GERD, enrolled irrespective of endoscopic findings (empirical cases) or in whom endoscopy showed no signs of esophagitis (endoscopy-negative cases).

- **Measurements**: Of 1,408 studies, only 13 could be included for meta-analysis. Data on 3,433 patients empirically treated for GERD and 2,520 patients treated for ENRD were extracted. The primary endpoint was the relief of heartburn.

- **Main results**: In the empirical treatment of GERD, the summary relative risk (sRR) for symptom relief from H2RAs versus placebo was 0.77 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.60 to 0.99). The relative risk in the only placebo-controlled PPI trial was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.46). The sRR for standard dose PPIs versus H2RAs was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.44 to 0.68). In the treatment of ENRD, both PPIs (sRR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.79) and H2RAs (sRR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97) were superior to placebo, and PPIs were superior to H2RAs (sRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.95).

- **Conclusions**: Acid suppressant therapy (with a PPI or an H2RA) is more effective than placebo for short-term relief of heartburn in patients with persistent symptoms.

### Pharmacokinetics of ranitidine in preterm and term neonates with gastroesophageal reflux [^117LybTF]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of gestational age on the pharmacokinetics of ranitidine in newborns with gastroesophageal reflux.

- **Methods**: A prospective, descriptive, and pharmacokinetic study was carried out in 30 pre-term and 20 full-term babies. A dosage of 3 mg/kg of ranitidine was administered intravenously to all the babies. Blood samples were drawn at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours following the administration to assess ranitidine levels using the high-performance liquid chromatography technique.

- **Results**: Pharmacokinetics of ranitidine exhibited a bi-exponential behavior, with a half-life elimination (t1/2el) of 2.79 hours. The area under the curve (AUC) was 1688 ng/mL, the volume of distribution (Vd) was 1.44 L/kg, and clearance (Cl) was 5.9 L/kg/h. The median plasma concentration was 1113 ng/mL in pre-term newborns and 280 ng/mL in full-term newborns. Vd, t1/2, and Cl presented high values in pre-term infants, although the correlation of Cl with glomerular filtration was better in term newborns.

- **Conclusions**: Plasma levels of ranitidine depend on the gestational age of the newborns. However, the possible relationship between postnatal age and pharmacokinetics as neonates' internal organs mature, regardless of their gestational background, needs further exploration.

### Efficacy and safety measurements of proton pump inhibitors in infants and children [^112m2EBo]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

The design of studies to evaluate the efficacy of acid-lowering drugs in children differs significantly from study designs in adult populations. Efficacy measurements may be less extensive than those used in adult studies because of limitations that exist secondary to concerns for patient safety, parental and institutional review board acceptance of efficacy endpoints, and existing standards of care within the pediatric gastroenterology community. Study designs involving patients who would routinely receive acid-lowering therapy have been successfully used to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of acid-lowering therapies, such as H2 receptor antagonists, and have led to pediatric labeling for these drugs. This approach may likewise be used in the study of newer acid-lowering agents, such as proton pump inhibitors.

### Are proton pump inhibitors indicated for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in infants and children [^111FYJwZ]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials in the pediatric population supporting the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) are lacking. Studies are needed to establish the safety of long-term acid suppression in infants and children, as well as to confirm a causal relationship between GER and extraesophageal symptoms and signs.

### Pediatric specialists' beliefs about gastroesophageal reflux disease in premature infants [^112jPZtQ]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Wide variation exists in the treatment of suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in premature infants; it is unknown to what degree diagnosis and treatment are affected by the treating physician's medical specialty or interpretation of the medical literature.

- **Methods**: This study involved an online survey of board-certified neonatologists, pediatric pulmonologists, and pediatric gastroenterologists about their beliefs regarding the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of GERD in premature infants in the NICU on the basis of both clinical impression and interpretation of the literature.

- **Results**: A total of 1021 neonatologists, 232 pediatric pulmonologists, and 222 pediatric gastroenterologists participated in the study (47.5% response rate). There was disagreement among specialists in nearly all aspects of the survey. Pulmonologists were most likely to report that respiratory symptoms are caused by GERD, while gastroenterologists and neonatologists were more conservative in their judgments. However, all specialties rated pharmacologic interventions as beneficial less than 50% of respondents supporting its effectiveness. There was moderate correlation between physician belief based on the medical literature and belief based on clinical impression (Spearman rank correlation: 0.47–0.75). For therapies supported by multiple meta-analyses in infants versus therapies with few infant trials, physicians rated the evidence for effectiveness similarly.

- **Conclusions**: There is evidence of a wide range of beliefs among pediatric specialists regarding the treatment of GERD in premature infants, indicating potential variations in practice that are not solely dictated by current evidence or guidelines.

### Acid suppression in mild-moderate laryngomalacia without GERD: A randomized controlled trial [^116dkEMo]. The Laryngoscope (2025). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of acid suppression therapy (AST) in treating gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and airway symptoms in infants with mild to moderate laryngomalacia.

From 2020 to 2023, infants aged ≤ 6 months with laryngomalacia at a tertiary children's hospital were randomly assigned to either famotidine and feeding modifications (AST) or feeding modifications alone (no-AST). Guardians completed the Laryngomalacia Airway Symptom Score (LASS) and the Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire (I-GERQ-R). Out of 343 patients approached, 257 were excluded due to severe laryngomalacia on LASS, severe GER (I-GERQ-R ≥ 16), prior AST, absence of laryngomalacia on laryngoscopy, recommendation for supraglottoplasty, and/or other airway anomalies. Twenty-one declined participation. LASS and I-GERQ-R were completed again 1–6 months following enrollment.

Sixty-five patients were enrolled; 40 of these, constituting 62%, followed up at a mean of 3.1 months (SD 1.4 months). Of these 40 patients, 10 (25%) had mild and 30 (75%) had moderate laryngomalacia. The median I-GERQ-R score was 11 (range 5–15) at the initial appointment and 7.5 (range 0–26) at follow-up (p = 0.002). Laryngomalacia resolved in 13 out of the 40 patients (33%) at follow-up based on LASS (p < 0.001). Patients randomized to AST (n = 20) and no-AST (n = 20) had comparable improvement on LASS (p = 0.3) and I-GERQ-R (p = 0.8). Additionally, the initial severity of laryngomalacia did not significantly impact improvement on either LASS (p = 0.3) or I-GERQ-R (p = 0.8). LASS (ρ = 0.423, p = 0.007) showed more improvement with a longer time from consult to follow-up, but not I-GERQ-R (ρ = 0.122, p = 0.5).

### Systematic review: Clinical effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux [^111mnW8E]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Low credibility.

The initial reference search yielded 3067 citations after removal of duplicates. Sixty-six citations were screened in full text, of which 31 were included in this systematic review (Figure 1). A list of the excluded articles is presented in Appendix S3.

- **Overview of interventions**: Studies on interventions for nocturnal reflux symptoms include head of bed elevation (n = 5), early versus late dinner (n = 2), left lateral decubitus sleep position (n = 2), nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) (n = 7), pharmacological interventions (n = 14), and surgery (n = 1). As expected, there was significant heterogeneity in the data due to the different interventions for nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux.

### Pharmacokinetics of ranitidine in preterm and term neonates with gastroesophageal reflux [^112LvoKy]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The plasma levels of ranitidine depend on the gestational age of a newborn. At the same time, the results could contribute to the rational management of ranitidine. It is inferred that there is a possible relationship between the age after birth and the pharmacokinetics of neonates, as their internal organs mature irrespective of their gestational background.

### Famotidine [^115sZE6S]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Orally administered famotidine is incompletely absorbed, with a bioavailability of 40 to 45%. Minimal first-pass metabolism occurs. After oral doses, peak plasma levels are reached in 1 to 3 hours, and plasma levels after multiple doses resemble those after single doses. Fifteen to 20% of plasma famotidine is protein-bound. The elimination half-life of famotidine is 2.5 to 3.5 hours. It is eliminated via renal routes (65 to 70%) and metabolic routes (30 to 35%). Renal clearance is 250 to 450 mL/min, indicating the involvement of tubular excretion. Twenty-five to 30% of an oral dose and 65 to 70% of an intravenous dose are recovered in the urine as unchanged compound, with the sole identified metabolite being the S-oxide.

There is a close relationship between creatinine clearance values and the elimination half-life of famotidine. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, characterized by a creatinine clearance of less than 10 mL/min, the elimination half-life may exceed 20 hours. Therefore, dose or dosing interval adjustments may be necessary for patients with moderate and severe renal insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

In elderly patients, no clinically significant age-related changes in the pharmacokinetics of famotidine have been observed. However, in elderly patients with reduced renal function, the drug's clearance may decrease (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).

The majority of clinical study experience involved oral administration of famotidine tablets and is provided here for reference.

### Gastroesophageal reflux in infants and children: Diagnosis and treatment [^115m2fRc]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux is a common physiological event in infants, where gastric contents pass from the stomach into the esophagus. It may be asymptomatic or cause regurgitation, often referred to as "spit up". This condition occurs daily in approximately 40% of infants. Symptoms typically begin before 8 weeks of life, peak at around 4 months of age, and usually resolve by 1 year. In children and adolescents, the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux is 2% to 8%. Family physicians should reassure parents that gastroesophageal reflux is self-limited, not pathologic, and does not warrant routine testing or pharmacologic treatment.

Gastroesophageal reflux may progress to gastroesophageal reflux disease when the reflux leads to troublesome symptoms — such as postprandial distress or pain, coughing, or choking — or causes complications, like esophageal stricture or reflux esophagitis. Diagnostic tests, including endoscopy, barium study, multichannel intraluminal impedance, and pH monitoring, may be employed when there is diagnostic uncertainty or when alarm symptoms are present, such as bilious or projectile vomiting and hematemesis.

Conservative treatments for gastroesophageal reflux disease in infants include the use of thickening agents or extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid-based formulas in formula-fed infants, or maternal elimination of dairy for breastfed infants. If infants and children do not improve with conservative measures, they may require pharmacologic treatment, including an empirical trial of acid-suppression therapy for 4 to 8 weeks.

### Efficacy and safety of histamine-2 receptor antagonists [^117MCmzn]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The importance of histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) lies in their frequent use for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in children; however, their efficacy and safety are questionable.

The objective of this study is to systematically review the literature to assess the efficacy and safety of H2RAs in pediatric GERD.

For the evidence review, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database were searched for randomized clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of H2RAs in pediatric GERD. Two reviewers independently extracted data from the included articles. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. When possible, infants and children were analyzed separately.

The findings showed that eight studies with a total of 276 children (0–15 years of age) were included. Compared with the placebo, H2RAs were more effective in reducing symptoms, achieving histologic healing, and increasing gastric pH with a larger overall treatment effect. In infants, H2RAs were only more effective concerning histologic healing. Comparing H2RAs with antacids, H2RAs were more effective in symptom reduction in only one study. H2RAs compared with proton pump inhibitors were not significantly different in any of the outcome measures. For safety analysis, data were not reported quantitatively, and for all outcomes, the quality of evidence was very low.

The conclusions and relevance indicate that evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of H2RAs in infants and children is limited and of poor quality. Well-designed placebo-controlled trials are needed to provide more definitive conclusions.

### Overview of pediatric gastroesophageal reflux disease and proton pump inhibitor therapy [^114DQVod]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are prevalent in children of all ages. Despite limited clinical data, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are frequently prescribed in pediatric patients. Studies are needed to determine the natural history of GERD, assess its impact on the quality of life of affected children, and identify risk groups in infancy and childhood. There is a critical need to evaluate PPI efficacy and safety in infants and children.

Regarding specific circumstances for gastroesophageal reflux disease, specifically in pediatric patients, the ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2018 guidelines recommend considering a 4–8 week trial of PPIs for typical symptoms such as heartburn, retrosternal or epigastric pain, as a diagnostic test for GERD in pediatric patients.

### Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116oTmuW]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

The primary treatment goals in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease are relief of symptoms, prevention of symptom relapse, healing of erosive esophagitis, and prevention of complications of esophagitis. In patients with reflux esophagitis, treatment is directed at acid suppression through the use of lifestyle modifications, such as elevating the head of the bed and modifying the size and composition of meals, and pharmacologic agents. These agents include a histamine H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) taken on demand or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) taken 30 to 60 minutes before the first meal of the day.

The preferred empiric approach is either step-up therapy, which involves treating initially with an H2RA for eight weeks and switching to a PPI if symptoms do not improve, or step-down therapy, which begins with a PPI and then titrates to the lowest effective medication type and dosage. In patients with erosive esophagitis identified on endoscopy, a PPI is the initial treatment of choice. Diagnostic testing should be reserved for patients who exhibit warning signs, such as weight loss, dysphagia, or gastrointestinal bleeding, and patients who are at risk for complications of esophagitis, such as esophageal stricture formation, Barrett's esophagus, or adenocarcinoma.

Antireflux surgery, including both open and laparoscopic versions of Nissen fundoplication, is an alternative treatment for patients who have chronic reflux with recalcitrant symptoms. Newer endoscopic modalities, including the Stretta and endocinch procedures, are less invasive and have fewer complications than antireflux surgery; however, response rates are lower.
