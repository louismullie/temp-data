## Question

A 34-year-old obese woman reports shortness of breath on exertion, with both echocardiography and functional testing returning within normal limits. I suspect her symptoms are due to deconditioning and would recommend a gradual increase in physical activity along with routine exercise.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether deconditioning explains dyspnea on exertion in a 34-year-old obese woman with normal echocardiography and functional testing, and whether recommending a gradual increase in physical activity along with routine exercise is an appropriate management plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the differential diagnosis when resting echocardiography and standard stress tests are unrevealing. Then, I should verify when and how cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) clarifies the mechanism of dyspnea. Next, I will review the CPET phenotypes that point to deconditioning versus cardiopulmonary disease. After that, I need to craft a CPET-guided, safe exercise prescription and monitoring plan. Finally, I should ensure we do not miss obesity-specific and alternative contributors, including EIB, anemia, thyroid disease, sleep-disordered breathing, and early pulmonary hypertension, with appropriate follow-up testing and timeline.

> Let me first confirm the working differential beyond "normal echo", because a normal resting study does not exclude exercise-induced abnormalities or noncardiac drivers of dyspnea. I need to consider early HFpEF, pulmonary vascular disease, occult airflow limitation or dysfunctional breathing, obesity-related mechanical restriction, anemia or thyroid disease, and pure deconditioning with low cardiorespiratory fitness; in young adults, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and hyperventilation/anxiety can masquerade as "asthma", so I should explicitly keep these in the differential and plan targeted testing rather than assume cardiac disease is absent just because resting imaging is normal [^113j1Uuh] [^111SAEso] [^113EvYze] [^115Ps6AL].

> Wait, let me verify whether normal echocardiography meaningfully excludes HFpEF or pulmonary vascular pathology during exertion; it does not, and exercise-only abnormalities are well-recognized, which is why CPET and, when needed, invasive CPET can unmask early HFpEF, exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension, or preload failure when routine tests are unrevealing. I should confirm this approach aligns with modern heart failure and pulmonary guidance emphasizing CPET's integrative diagnostic role in unexplained exertional intolerance, including its use to detect early HFpEF phenotypes and abnormal hemodynamic responses under load [^1116rbts] [^114cKg7e] [^112t3bBz].

> Next, I should review why CPET is the pivotal next step here. CPET simultaneously quantifies cardiovascular, ventilatory, gas-exchange, and metabolic responses to exercise, which lets me distinguish circulatory insufficiency from ventilatory limitation, gas exchange impairment, dysfunctional breathing, or deconditioning; this is exactly where resting testing is least informative and CPET is most powerful in defining mechanism and guiding management in unexplained dyspnea [^111SAEso] [^114rTE9k] [^112YzUAt].

> I will now examine the specific CPET patterns that would support deconditioning as the primary mechanism, but hold on, I should verify that I first exclude circulatory and gas-exchange abnormalities. If the VO2-work rate relationship is appropriate, oxygen pulse and heart rate response are normal, ventilatory efficiency is preserved, there is no arterial desaturation, and breathing reserve remains adequate, yet peak VO2 is reduced with an early lactate threshold, that constellation points toward deconditioning rather than cardiac or pulmonary disease; this interpretive sequence — rule out circulatory and gas exchange limitation first — helps avoid premature labeling of deconditioning [^115s1Jc5] [^111SAEso] [^113NwHHi].

> But wait, what if obesity itself is amplifying ventilatory demand without primary lung disease; I need to check for disproportionate dyspnea relative to oxygen uptake and ventilation, assess ventilatory efficiency and dynamic constraints, and interpret Borg dyspnea ratings within normative frameworks, since in obesity the symptom burden can reflect mechanical loading and activity avoidance rather than intrinsic gas-exchange pathology. Phenotyping breathlessness relative to V′O2 and V′E and confirming where abnormality emerges — often at peak — helps parse mechanical and perceptual contributors seen in obese individuals who may mask limitation by reducing activity [^114ytD3S] [^113wnwse] [^111SAEso].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline alignment before I jump to an exercise prescription. For unexplained dyspnea in ambulatory patients, contemporary guidance supports obtaining CPET to clarify mechanism and to quantify functional capacity; although CPET was historically reserved for advanced HF selection, that is incomplete. Wait, I need to correct myself: CPET is not only for transplant or LVAD evaluation; recent ACC/AHA statements endorse CPET to evaluate unexplained dyspnea and to assess functional capacity more broadly in heart failure populations, which supports its use here to both diagnose and tailor therapy [^111q5k95] [^113vkjTi] [^117HXwTJ].

> I should now translate CPET findings into a personalized, safe exercise prescription. Let me confirm intensity targets around ventilatory thresholds; using CPET-derived VT1 and, as tolerated, progressing toward VT2 allows precise titration of workload. Starting with 4–5 days per week of aerobic activity at an intensity just below VT1 or at approximately 60–70% of peak VO2 with interval progression is reasonable, layering in 2–3 weekly resistance sessions for major muscle groups, with careful heart-rate reserve or threshold-based targeting if beta-blockers are not confounding heart rate; this tailored approach is consistent with contemporary exercise prescription frameworks [^112dbJU9] [^113UXY1k] [^112F9xSB].

> I need to ensure safety and risk stratification before initiating training. Even in a young patient, obesity and dyspnea warrant a pre-exercise resting ECG, screening for red flags such as unstable symptoms, worrisome arrhythmias, or severe pulmonary hypertension, and consideration of supervised initiation if symptom burden is high; family medicine and metabolic society guidance emphasize ECG as a basic test and advocate progressive, monitored increases in activity in deconditioned adults rather than routine preparticipation imaging [^1131fS9k] [^114VmSJq].

> Next, I should review a progression and follow-up plan anchored to objective change. Let me double-check sensitivity of reassessment protocols; shorter-stage incremental tests can be more sensitive to changes in VO2peak during rehabilitation. A reasonable plan is to increase duration first, reassess symptoms weekly, and repeat CPET around 3 months to document expected 10–15% gains in VO2peak if deconditioning was dominant, while maintaining laboratory quality control to ensure reproducible measurement when comparing serial tests [^111v9owQ] [^116s8d4m].

> But wait, what if CPET shows abnormalities not consistent with pure deconditioning; I need to ensure a contingency pathway. If ventilatory inefficiency, desaturation, or abnormal pulmonary pressures are suspected, I should evaluate for pulmonary hypertension per ESC/ERS algorithms, consider V/Q scanning if CTEPH is on the table, and contemplate invasive CPET if hemodynamic clarification is needed; if symptoms or spirometry suggest EIB or dysfunctional breathing, bronchoprovocation testing and targeted respiratory therapy are appropriate next steps [^1117cusi] [^11483yoF] [^112t3bBz] [^115ohLAC].

> I should confirm we address obesity-specific comorbid factors that amplify dyspnea. Screening for anemia and thyroid dysfunction is simple and necessary, evaluating for sleep-disordered breathing or obesity hypoventilation can be decisive, and adding nutritional counseling to exercise training creates synergy for symptom improvement; importantly, many patients reduce activity to avoid dyspnea, so I need to explicitly coach graded exposure and reassure that conditioning is reversible with measurable gains in 6–8 weeks [^113j1Uuh] [^111SAEso] [^113NwHHi].

> Let me consider prognosis and how CPET metrics inform risk and motivation. Peak VO2 and VE/VCO2 slope carry robust prognostic information across cardiopulmonary conditions, and even in ostensibly healthy or obese individuals these variables predict outcomes; sharing these objective metrics with the patient can enhance engagement and adherence to the training plan and guide escalation if responses are suboptimal [^115HPTmW] [^114cKg7e].

> In summary, I should not jump to conclusions based on normal resting cardiac tests. The next best step is CPET to phenotype the mechanism of exertional dyspnea; if CPET shows preserved circulatory function and gas exchange with reduced peak VO2 and early lactate threshold, deconditioning is the likely diagnosis, best managed with a CPET-guided, progressive exercise program under a safety framework and with close follow-up, while staying vigilant for pulmonary vascular disease, EIB, anemia, thyroid disease, and sleep-disordered breathing if the pattern or response deviates from expectations [^115s1Jc5] [^111SAEso] [^111q5k95].

---

It is appropriate to attribute exertional dyspnea to **deconditioning** in a 34-year-old with obesity when echocardiography and functional tests are normal, as deconditioning is common in obesity and presents with exertional symptoms despite normal cardiac function. A **gradual, individualized exercise program** is recommended, starting with low-intensity aerobic activity [^1131fS9k] and progressing to at least 150 minutes per week [^114VmSJq], with resistance training twice weekly and close monitoring for symptom changes or new red flags [^112dbJU9]. If symptoms persist or worsen, pursue **further evaluation** with CPET [^111q5k95] or pulmonary function testing.

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking obesity and deconditioning to exertional dyspnea

Obesity and deconditioning contribute to **exertional dyspnea** through interrelated mechanisms:

- **Increased metabolic demand**: Excess body weight increases oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production during physical activity, placing greater demands on the cardiopulmonary system [^111SAEso].

- **Reduced respiratory compliance**: Obesity-associated fat deposition around the thorax and abdomen reduces chest wall compliance, increasing the work of breathing and causing early respiratory muscle fatigue [^113NwHHi].

- **Decreased cardiovascular fitness**: Sedentary lifestyle and physical inactivity lead to reduced cardiac output, stroke volume, and oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues during exercise.

- **Peripheral muscle deconditioning**: Reduced physical activity results in muscle atrophy, decreased oxidative capacity, and early onset of lactic acidosis during exertion, contributing to fatigue and dyspnea [^1116rbts].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic considerations

In patients presenting with exertional dyspnea, a **comprehensive clinical evaluation is essential** to exclude underlying cardiopulmonary pathology [^113j1Uuh]. The following diagnostic approach is recommended:

- **Detailed medical history and physical examination**: Assess for risk factors, comorbidities, and signs of cardiac or pulmonary disease [^113j1Uuh].

- **Baseline diagnostic tests**: Electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radiograph, spirometry, and pulse oximetry to exclude common cardiopulmonary conditions [^113j1Uuh].

- **Advanced diagnostic tests**: Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is considered the gold standard for evaluating unexplained exertional dyspnea, providing objective assessment of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic responses to exercise [^115s1Jc5] [^114rTE9k].

In this case, normal echocardiography and functional tests significantly reduce the likelihood of underlying cardiac pathology, **supporting a diagnosis of deconditioning-related dyspnea**.

---

## Evidence supporting exercise intervention in deconditioned obese patients

Exercise is **strongly supported by clinical evidence** [^113qFM8m] as an effective strategy to improve functional capacity, reduce dyspnea, and enhance quality of life in deconditioned obese patients. Key benefits include:

- **Improved cardiovascular fitness**: Regular aerobic exercise increases cardiac output, stroke volume, and oxygen delivery, reducing exertional dyspnea [^112dbJU9].

- **Enhanced respiratory function**: Exercise training improves respiratory muscle strength, lung compliance, and ventilatory efficiency.

- **Weight reduction**: Combined aerobic and resistance exercise promotes weight loss, reducing metabolic demand and improving exercise tolerance [^114VmSJq].

- **Psychological benefits**: Exercise intervention reduces anxiety, depression, and improves overall well-being [^114QNE8D].

---

## Recommended exercise prescription for deconditioned obese patients

A **gradual, individualized exercise program** is recommended for deconditioned obese patients, using the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type) principle [^112dbJU9] [^114VmSJq]:

| **Component** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Frequency | 3–5 days per week |
| Intensity | Low to moderate intensity (40–60% VO2max or 50–70% maximum heart rate) |
| Time | Start with 10–15 minutes per session, gradually increasing to 30–60 minutes |
| Type | Aerobic exercise (walking, cycling, swimming) combined with resistance training (2–3 days per week) |

---

Progression should be **gradual**, with intensity and duration increased as tolerated, and regular monitoring of symptoms and functional capacity [^1131fS9k].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to assess **progress, adherence, and symptom improvement**. Objective measures such as the six-minute walk test (6MWT) [^111MAQhE] or CPET can monitor functional capacity and guide exercise prescription adjustments [^113vkjTi].

---

## When to reconsider the diagnosis and pursue further evaluation

If symptoms persist or worsen despite adherence to the exercise program, or new symptoms develop — such as chest pain, syncope, or significant oxygen desaturation — **further evaluation is warranted**. Appropriate next tests include cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to objectively assess exercise capacity and identify underlying cardiopulmonary limitations [^111SAEso], pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to evaluate for obstructive or restrictive lung disease [^113j1Uuh], and advanced cardiac imaging (cardiac MRI or CT angiography) when cardiac pathology is suspected.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Given normal echocardiography and functional tests, the patient's exertional dyspnea is **likely attributable to obesity-related deconditioning**. A **gradual, individualized exercise program** is recommended, with regular monitoring and follow-up. If symptoms persist or worsen, pursue **further evaluation** with CPET or pulmonary function tests [^114rTE9k].

Physical activity and exercise in type 2 diabetes mellitus

The decision to screen asymptomatic individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to evaluate the presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) before starting an exercise program depends on the presence of risk stratifiers, cardiovascular symptoms, and the intensity of the exercise. For eligible individuals, the necessary evaluation tests must be individually determined. The resting electrocardiogram is considered a basic and essential test and should be conducted in all relevant cases. More complex, expensive, or invasive tests should be evaluated based on the clinical scenario.

- **Recommended exercises**: For individuals at increased risk of developing T2DM or those in a pre-diabetic state, engaging in 150 minutes of moderate-intense aerobic exercise reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. For individuals with T2DM, a combination of resistance exercises (at least one cycle of 10 to 15 repetitions involving 5 or more exercises, two to three sessions per week on non-consecutive days) and aerobic exercises (at least 150 minutes per week of moderate or equivalent high intensity, with no more than two consecutive days without activity) promotes significant reductions in HbA1c.

Adults, especially the elderly, are also encouraged to engage in physical exercises that emphasize balance and coordination.

### Interpreting the incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test [^115s1Jc5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) is an increasingly utilized diagnostic method for evaluating patients who report dyspnea during exercise. Performing maximal symptom-limited CPET can determine if a subject has a reduced exercise capacity and provide insights into the mechanism behind this reduction, whether cardiac, pulmonary, or pulmonary vascular in nature. This review suggests that interpreting the complex results of CPET should begin with assessing myocardial or circulatory insufficiency, followed by investigating any gas exchange abnormalities.

By closely examining the oxygen consumption (VO₂) versus work rate plot, one can identify whether oxygen delivery is adequate or impaired by abnormally reduced blood flow through skeletal muscles. An elevated ventilatory equivalent of carbon dioxide at the ventilatory threshold or arterial oxygen desaturation during effort strongly indicates gas exchange abnormalities. If circulatory insufficiency and gas exchange abnormalities are absent, it typically suggests either a normal response to effort or deconditioning, especially when peak VO₂ is below the maximal predicted value.

Extensive clinical research has provided robust evidence that exercise is a cost-effective measure to substantially alleviate the burden of many diseases, particularly those in the cardiovascular (CV) spectrum. The positive effects of exercise on cardiac health are attributed to improvements in standard risk factors for atherosclerosis and its beneficial impact on several pathophysiological mechanisms for CV diseases. For secondary prevention, exercise, optimally within a cardiac rehabilitation program, has been shown to improve functional capacity and survival. Clinicians should encourage physical activity and provide exercise recommendations for all patients, considering any underlying pathology. This review analyzes the benefits of exercise for the prevention and treatment of major CV risk factors and heart conditions.

### Pediatric cardiopulmonary exercise testing: Interoperability through domain analysis modeling and a national survey [^113Cc3PM]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Low credibility.

The electronic health record, data science advances, and dynamic environmental and infectious threats to child health highlight the need for harmonized and interoperable approaches to pediatric cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Accordingly, we developed a terminology harmonization in exercise medicine and exercise science domain analysis model (THEMES DAM) to structure CPET data elements.

THEMES DAM identified 114 data elements, including participant information, calibration, equipment, protocols, laboratory personnel, encouragement strategies, and analysis procedures. We used the THEMES DAM, vetted by the international data standards organization HL7, to construct a current-state survey of pediatric CPET centers in the United States. Forty-eight of 101 centers responded to a questionnaire covering seven major topic areas (38 items).

Centers predominantly performed between 100 and 500 tests annually. Cardiac disease represented 55% of referrals. Almost all centers calibrated gas concentrations and flow daily, but 42% never calibrated their treadmill or cycle ergometers. All centers measured V̇O2peak but calculated it differently. Centers used a variety of protocols, for example, for treadmill: 61% used the Bruce protocol, 43% used the modified Bruce, and 59% used other protocols. Additionally, 44% calculated CPET slopes from submaximal portions of CPET, such as V̇O2-HR. All centers verbally encouraged participants, but only 40% used a standardized approach. The interpretation of CPET was done by physicians (60%), exercise physiologists (25%), exercise technicians (10%), nurses (1%), or others (4%).

### Cardiopulmonary exercise test interpretation across the lifespan in congenital heart disease: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113UXY1k]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

This statement is intended for physicians, nurses, advanced practice clinicians, exercise physiologists, and other health care professionals involved in cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) or exercise training of children and adults with congenital heart disease (HD). It builds on previous American Heart Association publications on CPET in children and adults with congenital HD. Information on CPET methodology and requirements, as well as indications and contraindications for CPET, are found in these statements.

CPET allows the objective measurement of exercise capacity, which may be overestimated when self‐reported by patients. It may unmask impairments and arrhythmias, even in asymptomatic patients, and is an integral part of decision‐making. This is vitally important in congenital HD because they have many different complex processes that can affect exercise capacity. Additionally, CPET can be used to guide exercise prescription to ensure safety and optimal exercise intensity.

- **Metabolic parameters**: A review of commonly used CPET parameters is included in the Table. Although this statement will focus on metabolic parameters during CPET, rhythm and conduction patterns are critically important to comprehensive CPET in those with congenital HD.

- **Figure 1 description**: Diagram demonstrating the complex relationships between the cardiac, pulmonary, muscular, and nervous systems, and how potential derangements in these systems can affect exercise performance in those with congenital heart disease.

The statement indicates the importance of ventilation/perfusion as part of this dynamic complex.

### Use of stress testing early after coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^113LTLHL]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for exercise testing do not take a position regarding the utility of routine stress testing after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Our purposes were:

- **Document the patterns** of use of stress testing after CABG.
- **Establish whether the choice** of stress testing strategy is associated with clinical characteristics of patients.

The Routine versus Selective Exercise Treadmill Testing after Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery (ROSETTA-CABG) Registry is a prospective multicenter study that examined the use of stress testing after CABG among 395 patients at 16 clinical centers in 6 countries. During the 12 months after CABG, 37% of patients underwent stress testing (range across centers 0% to 100%). Among patients who underwent stress testing, 24% had a clinical indication and 76% had it as a routine follow-up.

A total of 65% of stress tests involved exercise treadmill testing alone, 17% involved stress nuclear perfusion imaging, 13% involved stress echocardiographic imaging, and 5% involved other types of stress tests, such as positron emission tomographic scans. The first stress test was performed at a median of 13 weeks after CABG, with 20% of patients having second tests at a median of 28 weeks and 6% having additional tests at a median of 34 weeks.

Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that the chief determinant of using routine stress testing was the clinical center. In conclusion, these results suggest that there is little consensus on the appropriate use of stress testing after CABG.

### Software for interpreting cardiopulmonary exercise tests [^116czVUa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) has become an important modality for the evaluation and management of patients with a diverse array of medical problems. However, interpreting these tests is often difficult and time-consuming, requiring significant expertise.

- **Methods**: We created a computer software program (XINT) that assists in CPET interpretation. The program uses an integrative approach as recommended in the Official Statement of the American Thoracic Society/American College of Chest Physicians (ATS/ACCP) on cardiopulmonary exercise testing. In this paper, we discuss the principles behind the software. We also provide the detailed logic in an accompanying file (Additional File 1). The actual program and the open-source code are available free over the Internet at http://www.xint.org. For convenience, the required download files can also be accessed from this article.

- **Results**: To test the clinical usefulness of XINT, we present the computer-generated interpretations of the case studies discussed in the ATS/ACCP document in another accompanying file (Additional File 2). We believe the interpretations are consistent with the document's criteria and the interpretations given by the expert panel.

- **Conclusion**: Computers have become an integral part of modern life. Peer-reviewed scientific journals can now present not just medical concepts and experimental studies, but actual functioning medical interpretive software. This has enormous potential to improve medical diagnoses and patient care. We believe XINT is such a program that will greatly enhance clinical practice.

### Do maximum flow-volume loops collected during maximum exercise test alter the main cardiopulmonary parameters [^112rXYdC]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Traditionally, ventilatory limitation to exercise is assessed by measuring the breathing reserve (BRR), which is the difference between minute ventilation at peak exercise and maximum voluntary ventilation measured at rest. Recent studies have documented important abnormalities in ventilatory adaptation that have the potential to limit exercise, even in the presence of a normal BRR. Among these abnormalities are lung hyperinflation and expiratory flow limitation, documented by comparing tidal to maximum flow-volume loops (FVLs) collected throughout the test. In the present study, we investigated whether the advantages of using such a technique within the classic cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) might be obscured by maneuvers interfering with the main functional parameters of the test, and potentially with interpretation of the CPET.

- **Methods**: We studied 18 healthy subjects, 19 patients affected by COPD, and 19 patients with chronic heart failure during a maximum exercise test on three different study days in a random order. On one occasion, the CPET was conducted with no FVLs (control test [CTRL]), whereas on the other occasions, FVLs were incorporated every 1 minute during exercise (FVL(1)-min) or every 2 minutes during exercise (FVL(2)-min).

- **Results**: None of the classic cardiovascular parameters recorded at ventilatory anaerobic threshold or at peak exercise differed between the study days, as determined by analysis of variance. Furthermore, the coefficients of variation of the main parameters between FVL(1)-min and FVL(2)-min days compared to CTRL day were well within expected ranges.

### Characterizing the use of exercise testing in repaired tetralogy of Fallot patients: A multi-institutional survey [^1165vyzK]. Pediatric Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is an important tool used in the management of patients with congenital heart disease. However, there are no clear guidelines for its use in specific populations, such as repaired Tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF). We sought to characterize practice patterns and attitudes regarding exercise testing in the rTOF population using an online survey distributed to pediatric cardiologists. Analyses were performed using qualitative statistics, Wilcoxon rank-sum, Kruskal-Wallis test, and chi-squared analysis.

One hundred and three clinicians completed the survey, with 83% routinely sending symptomatic rTOF patients for exercise testing and 59% for asymptomatic patients. Respondents who routinely test asymptomatic patients reported higher levels of perceived helpfulness of exercise testing (p < 0.01) and comfort with CPET interpretation (p < 0.01). Although a large majority of respondents found exercise testing to be helpful (81% either "somewhat" or "very" helpful), a considerably smaller portion indicated comfort with CPET interpretation (49% either "comfortable" or "very comfortable"). Nearly all respondents (92%) reported changing management primarily based on exercise testing results. However, the frequency of changes varied, with 10% "frequently", 62% "occasionally", and 19% "rarely" changing management. There was a statistically significant relationship between the perceived helpfulness of exercise testing and the likelihood of management changes (p < 0.01). While exercise testing is used to make clinical decisions, our findings suggest that in some cases, management is incomplete.

### Exercise stress testing: Indications and common questions [^1131fS9k]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Exercise stress testing is a validated diagnostic test for coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients and is used in the evaluation of patients with known cardiac disease. Testing of asymptomatic patients is generally not indicated. It may be performed in select deconditioned adults before starting a vigorous exercise program, but no studies have compared outcomes from preexercise testing versus encouraging light exercise with gradual increases in exertion.

Preoperative exercise stress testing is helpful for risk stratification in patients undergoing vascular surgery or who have active cardiac symptoms before undergoing nonemergent noncardiac surgery. Exercise stress testing without imaging is the preferred initial choice for risk stratification in most women. Sensitivity and specificity increase with the use of adjunctive imaging such as echocardiography or myocardial perfusion imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography. Exercise stress testing is rarely an appropriate option to evaluate persons with known coronary artery disease who have no new symptoms less than two years after percutaneous intervention or less than five years after coronary artery bypass grafting.

The Duke treadmill score has excellent prognostic value for exercise stress testing. Imaging is not necessary if patients are able to achieve more than 10 metabolic equivalents on exercise stress testing. Exercise stress testing is not indicated before noncardiac surgeries in patients who can achieve 4 metabolic equivalents without symptoms.

### The importance of an exercise testing protocol for detecting changes of peak oxygen uptake in cardiac rehabilitation [^111v9owQ]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

To assess which exercise testing protocol is most sensitive for assessing peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) changes as a result of cardiac rehabilitation, a prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted.

The study was set in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation center and involved forty-two cardiac patients (33 men; mean age, 65.4 ± 8.4 years). All patients participated in a 7-week cardiac rehabilitation program and were randomly allocated into two subgroups. One subgroup underwent evaluation using a 1-minute stage exercise testing protocol (n = 21), while the other subgroup was assessed using a 3-minute stage protocol (n = 21).

- **Main outcome measures**: In both groups, maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests on a bicycle were conducted, measuring VO2peak, expiratory volume (VE), respiratory exchange ratio, heart rate, cycling resistance (W), and test duration at the start and end of the program.

- **Results**: Subgroups were closely matched, and no changes in beta-blocker treatment occurred during the study. The total test duration and Wpeak showed significant improvement in both groups (p < 0.05). Additionally, the improvements in VO2peak, VEpeak, and total test duration were significantly greater in the 1-minute stage group compared to the 3-minute stage group (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: A 1-minute stage exercise testing protocol is more sensitive for detecting changes in VO2peak resulting from cardiac rehabilitation compared to a 3-minute stage protocol.

### Exercise training in heart failure: From theory to practice. A consensus document of the Heart Failure Association and the European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation [^111oXhcP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

The European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines firmly recommend regular physical activity and structured exercise training (ET). However, this recommendation is still poorly implemented in daily clinical practice outside specialized centers and in the real world of heart failure clinics. In reality, exercise intolerance can be successfully tackled by applying ET. We need to encourage the mindset that breathlessness may be evidence of signaling between the periphery and central hemodynamic performance, and regular physical activity may ultimately bring about favorable changes in myocardial function, symptoms, functional capacity, as well as an increased hospitalization-free life span and probably survival. This position paper provides practical advice for the application of exercise in heart failure and how to overcome traditional barriers, based on the scientific and clinical knowledge supporting the beneficial effects of this intervention.

### Cardiopulmonary exercise testing: What is its value [^114cKg7e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Compared with traditional exercise tests, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides a thorough assessment of exercise integrative physiology involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular, muscular, and cellular oxidative systems. Due to the prognostic ability of key variables, CPET applications in cardiology have grown impressively to include all forms of exercise intolerance, with a predominant focus on heart failure with reduced or with preserved ejection fraction. As impaired cardiac output and peripheral oxygen diffusion are the main determinants of the abnormal functional response in cardiac patients, invasive CPET has gained new popularity, especially for diagnosing early heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension. The most impactful advance has recently come from the introduction of CPET combined with echocardiography or CPET imaging, which provides basic information regarding cardiac and valve morphology and function. This review highlights modern CPET use as a single or combined test that allows the pathophysiological bases of exercise limitation to be translated, quite easily, into clinical practice.

### Biological quality control for cardiopulmonary exercise testing in multicenter clinical trials [^116s8d4m]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a non-invasive, sensitive test to evaluate cardiopulmonary (patho-) physiology. CPET assesses the physiological basis of functional capacity and exercise intolerance, playing a valuable role in diagnosis and clinical decision-making. It is also used to test intervention efficacy, such as exercise training in cardiovascular disease, pulmonary rehabilitation, and bronchodilator therapy in multicenter trials. These applications require strong agreement between consecutively performed tests within and among investigative centers.

However, precision (reproducibility, or test–retest variability) and accuracy (trueness) of CPET depend on interactions among testing equipment variability, calibration, and maintenance; physiological factors; participants' cooperation, motivation, and effort during testing; and the knowledge, skills, and training of laboratory personnel. Most factors cannot be controlled by a simple system calibration, emphasizing the importance of standardization and quality control (QC).

Clinicians can rely on trial results only if interpretation is not biased by measurement error. Therefore, assurance of study-wide precision and accuracy has a major impact on the design and conduct of multicenter trials by maximizing statistical discriminatory power and minimizing laboratory burden and participant risk.

### Cardiopulmonary exercise test interpretation across the lifespan in congenital heart disease: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115CJ9J2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Survivorship from congenital heart disease has improved rapidly due to advances in surgical and medical management. As these patients are living longer, treatment and disease surveillance targets have shifted toward enhancing quality of life and functional status. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a valuable tool for assessing functional capacity, evaluating cardiac and pulmonary pathology, and providing guidance on prognosis and interventional recommendations.

Despite the extensive evidence supporting the ability of cardiopulmonary exercise testing to quantitatively evaluate cardiovascular function, there remains confusion about how to properly interpret it in patients with congenital heart disease. The purpose of this statement is to provide a lifespan approach to the interpretation of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in such patients. This report updates the American Heart Association's previous publications on exercise in children.

This evidence-based update on the significance of cardiopulmonary exercise testing findings in pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with various congenital cardiac pathologies and surgically modified physiology is formatted to guide interpretation practically for clinicians and exercise physiologists. Focus is placed on the indications for exercise testing, expected findings, and how exercise testing should guide the management of patients with various congenital heart conditions.

### Phenotyping exertional breathlessness using cardiopulmonary cycle exercise testing in people with chronic airflow limitation [^114ytD3S]. Chest (2025). Low credibility.

- **Study question**: Does abnormally high exertional breathlessness in relationship to oxygen uptake (V′O2) only or also to minute ventilation (V′E) indicate different underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical characteristics in people with chronic airflow limitation (CAL)?

- **Results**: In 325 people (44% female) with mild to moderate CAL undergoing incremental cycle cardiopulmonary exercise testing, compared with those with normal breathlessness, the group with abnormal findings by V′O2 showed lower lung diffusing capacity and greater exercise ventilatory inefficiency, whereas the group with abnormal findings by V′O2 and V′E showed even worse lung function, dynamic critical inspiratory constraints, and exertional breathlessness along with worse symptom burden, physical activity, and health status in daily life.

- **Interpretation**: Our results show that phenotyping exertional breathlessness in relationship to level of exercise (V′O2) and ventilation (V′E) using normative reference equations informs on underlying symptom mechanisms and related clinical characteristics.

Breathlessness on exertion is a cardinal symptom in people with chronic airflow limitation (CAL) and is a leading cause of chronic illness and disability. The symptom trajectory often is progressive, leading to a vicious cycle of impaired physical activity, deconditioning, and worsening of breathlessness at progressively lower levels of exertion. Because many people often reduce their physical activity to avoid the symptom, the true severity of exertional breathlessness often is hidden.

### Aerobic capacity attainment and reasons for cardiopulmonary exercise test termination in people with cancer: A descriptive, retrospective analysis from a single laboratory [^117SVzmt]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Low credibility.

Aerobic exercise prescriptions in clinical populations often involve target intensities based on cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET). These tests are frequently discontinued before a patient reaches the true maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max), which can negatively impact exercise dose and efficacy monitoring. However, the reasons for early discontinuation are poorly reported. In our study, we explored the reasons for CPET termination in individuals with cancer who participated in exercise intervention studies.

This study involved an exploratory, descriptive analysis of retrospective CPET data, including VO2 and anaerobic threshold, and termination reasons. It utilized a convenience sample of people with cancer who participated in exercise intervention studies within a single laboratory. We standardized the CPETs using the modified Bruce treadmill protocol, incorporating expired gas collection and analysis with a metabolic cart. VO2 max was considered "met" when participants showed either an oxygen consumption plateau or two of the following criteria: a rating of perceived exertion ≥ 9/10, a respiratory exchange ratio ≥ 1.15, and/or a heart rate at 95% of the age-predicted maximum. We reported the frequency and distribution of reasons for test termination relative to the number of CPET exposures for the participants.

In our results, forty-four participants engaged in exercise studies between February 2016 and March 2018 provided data for the analysis. Participants completed up to three CPETs during this period, resulting in a total of 78 CPETs being analyzed. Notably, eighty-six percent of all CPETs were terminated prior to achieving the defined criteria for VO2 max.

### Evaluation of chronic dyspnea [^113j1Uuh]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic dyspnea is defined as dyspnea lasting more than one month. In approximately two-thirds of patients presenting with dyspnea, the underlying cause is cardiopulmonary disease. Establishing an accurate diagnosis is essential because treatment differs depending on the underlying condition. Asthma, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, interstitial lung disease, and psychogenic causes account for 85 percent of patients with this principal symptom.

The history and physical examination should guide the selection of initial diagnostic tests such as an electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, pulse oximetry, spirometry, complete blood count, and metabolic panel. If these are inconclusive, additional testing is indicated. Formal pulmonary function testing may be needed to establish a diagnosis of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or interstitial lung disease. High-resolution computed tomography is particularly useful for diagnosing interstitial lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, or pulmonary embolism. Echocardiography and brain natriuretic peptide levels help establish a diagnosis of congestive heart failure.

If the diagnosis remains unclear, additional tests may be required. These include ventilation-perfusion scans, Holter monitoring, cardiac catheterization, esophageal pH monitoring, lung biopsy, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

### Software for interpreting cardiopulmonary exercise tests [^111UpCA9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although XINT is a helpful tool for creating a uniform, clinically significant interpretation of CPET data, it is not a panacea. Many factors can affect its usefulness and accuracy. The program output is highly dependent on the quality of the data collection and the human determination of various critical CPET variables. XINT should not be used without oversight by a physician knowledgeable in CPET and its interpretation. Moreover, knowledgeable physicians are encouraged to modify the XINT interpretations based on their own experience and ongoing advances in the field.

It should also be noted that the various "cut-points" chosen in the XINT program are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Although we attempted to use clinically and physiologically meaningful values, unlike humans, computers require specific values. Under certain circumstances, it is possible that the program could give misleading or inaccurate interpretations. However, by utilizing an integrative approach, this problem is minimized. Further, extensive testing has shown that most physiologic abnormalities are described by the XINT program and the interpretations are usually clinically meaningful and complete.

### Moving toward the optimal test for the assessment of myocardial ischemia [^115YSywc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The authors stressed the importance of exercise stress testing to reproduce symptoms and correlate them with ECG and imaging findings. They also highlighted the comparison of functional capacity to the extent of ischemia and the use of the Duke treadmill score for prognostication. Unfortunately, the study did not provide data on the additional information obtained by either of the imaging tests on top of the exercise information, or the contribution of exercise information to the results of the imaging tests.

In a previous study with incremental testing using an exercise tolerance test and CMR perfusion imaging, the imaging test provided independent value in patients with high pretest likelihood. It also offered incremental value in patients with low pretest likelihood and positive exercise tolerance test results (ST segments or symptoms), as well as in those with intermediate pretest likelihood and a negative exercise tolerance test or one positive by symptoms or ST segments. Patients with low pretest likelihood and normal exercise tolerance test or intermediate likelihood and symptomatic and ST-segment–positive exercise tolerance test did not require additional imaging testing. Performing such an algorithm in the combined setting might be an effective approach. In general, whether pharmacological or physical stress is the better approach remains scientifically unanswered.

An important question remains regarding the costs of the presented approach. This will be addressed in a later study, but it is important to note that the use of an ergometer adjacent to the MR scanner might reduce expenses.

### Defining the optimal prognostic window for cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with heart failure [^115HPTmW]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO(2) slope) and peak oxygen consumption (VO) provide robust prognostic information in patients with heart failure undergoing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX). The purpose of this study is to assess the change in prognostic characteristics of CPX at different time intervals.

- **Methods and results**: Seven hundred ninety-one subjects (74% male, mean age: 60.7 ± 12.9 years, ejection fraction: 34.6 ± 15.0%, ischemic etiology: 51%) underwent CPX and were tracked for major cardiac events over a 4-year period. All event-free subjects were tracked for at least 3 years. Mean VE/VCO(2) slope and peak VO(2) were 35.0 ± 10.0 and 16.0 ± 6.4 mL O(2)·kg(-1)·min(-1), respectively. There were a total of 263 major cardiac events (199 deaths, 45 transplants, and 19 left ventricular assist device implantations). Both continuous and dichotomous expressions of the VE/VCO(2) slope and peak VO(2) were prognostically significant up to 18 months post-CPX. Continuous and dichotomous expressions of the VE/VCO(2) slope remained prognostically significant up to 36 months post-CPX, whereas peak VO(2) was not predictive during the third and fourth years of follow-up. In a multivariate analysis, the VE/VCO(2) slope was consistently the superior prognostic marker, whereas peak VO(2) added predictive value and was retained in the regression up to 18 months post-CPX.

- **Conclusions**: These results indicate that commonly assessed CPX variables retain prognostic value for at least 2 years. The VE/VCO(2) slope is the superior predictor of adverse events throughout follow-up.

### Using cardiopulmonary exercise testing to understand dyspnea and exercise intolerance in respiratory disease [^111SAEso]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

A cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) is ideally suited to quantify exercise tolerance and evaluate the pathophysiological mechanisms of dyspnea and exercise limitation in people with chronic respiratory disease. Although several statements on CPET exist, and many outstanding resources detail the cardiorespiratory and perceptual responses to exercise, limited information is available to support the healthcare provider in conducting a practical CPET evaluation. This article provides healthcare providers with practical and timely information on utilizing CPET data to understand dyspnea and exercise intolerance in patients with chronic respiratory diseases.

Information on CPET protocol, as well as how to evaluate maximal patient effort, peak rate of oxygen consumption, ventilatory demand, pulmonary gas exchange, ventilatory reserve, operating lung volumes, and exertional dyspnea, is presented. Two case examples are also described to highlight how these parameters are evaluated to provide a clinical interpretation of CPET data.

### Exercise rehabilitation in patients with cancer [^114QNE8D]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Emerging evidence indicates that patients with cancer have considerable impairments in cardiorespiratory fitness, which is likely due to the direct toxic effects of anticancer therapy as well as the indirect consequences secondary to therapy, such as deconditioning. This reduced cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with heightened symptoms, functional dependence, and possibly an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Understanding the complex interaction between the effects of the tumor and cancer-associated therapies on the organ components that govern cardiorespiratory fitness, along with the effects of exercise training on these parameters, is limited. Further research will be critical for the progress of exercise-based rehabilitation in the oncology setting.

- **Evidence**: We assess the evidence regarding the level, mechanisms, and clinical importance of diminished cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with cancer.
- **Efficacy and adaptations**: The efficacy and adaptations to exercise training to prevent and/or mitigate dysfunction, in conjunction with exercise prescription considerations for clinical use, are also discussed.

### Cardiopulmonary exercise testing and pulmonary function testing for predicting the severity of CTEPH [^1128Y6B7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides a unique and comprehensive evaluation of the respiratory and circulatory systems by detecting gas exchange and exercise load during exercise. It is considered a gold standard noninvasive measure of cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise capacity. CPET has been widely utilized in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH), heart failure (HF), chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), asthma, among others. It is significant in disease diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy evaluation, and prognostic assessment. However, the variety of parameters makes it challenging for clinicians to accurately interpret CPET reports.

The pathological characteristics of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) are organized thrombus and vascular remodeling, which can lead to right ventricular failure. Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA), balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA), and PH-targeted medicine are the main therapies for CTEPH. Diagnosis of CTEPH can be achieved through right heart catheterization (RHC), ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan, and CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA).

Since CTEPH is a progressive disease, it is imperative to appropriately evaluate the severity in patients for timely intervention. It has been reported that CPET may be used to estimate the severity of PH. Abnormalities observed during CPET were consistent and characteristic, correlating well with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) patients' NYHA class. Building on these findings, this study aimed to examine the differences in CPET performance between patients with mild-moderate CTEPH.

### Role of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in clinical stratification in heart failure. A position paper from the committee on exercise physiology and training of the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology [^112zigHC]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Traditionally, the main indication for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in heart failure (HF) was for selecting candidates for heart transplantation: CPET was mainly performed in middle-aged male patients with HF and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Today, CPET is used in broader patient populations, including women, the elderly, patients with co-morbidities, those with preserved ejection fraction, and left ventricular assistance device recipients — individuals with different responses to incremental exercise and markedly different prognoses.

Moreover, the diagnostic and prognostic utility of symptom-limited CPET parameters derived from submaximal tests is increasingly considered, since many patients are unable to achieve maximal aerobic power. Repeated tests are also being used for risk stratification and evaluation of intervention, so that these data are now available. Finally, patients, physicians, and healthcare decision-makers are increasingly considering how treatments might impact morbidity and quality of life rather than focusing more exclusively on hard endpoints such as mortality, as was often the case in the past. Innovative prognostic flowcharts, with CPET at their core, have been developed to help optimize risk stratification and the selection of management options in HF patients.

### 2016 focused update: Clinical recommendations for cardiopulmonary exercise testing data assessment in specific patient populations [^114qjDiA]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

In the past several decades, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) has seen an exponential increase in its evidence base. The growing volume of evidence in support of CPX has led to the release of numerous scientific statements by societies and associations. In 2012, the European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention & Rehabilitation and the American Heart Association developed a joint document with the primary intent of redefining CPX analysis and reporting in a way that would streamline test interpretation and increase clinical application. Specifically, the 2012 joint scientific statement on CPX conceptualized an easy-to-use, clinically meaningful analysis based on evidence-vetted variables in color-coded algorithms. Single-page algorithms were successfully developed for each proposed test indication.

Due to an abundance of new CPX research in recent years and a reassessment of the algorithms in light of the body of evidence, a focused update to the 2012 scientific statement is now warranted. The purposes of this update are:

- **Confirmation**: Confirm algorithms included in the initial scientific statement that do not require revision.
- **Revision proposals**: Propose revisions to algorithms included in the initial scientific statement.
- **New algorithms**: Propose new algorithms based on emerging scientific evidence.
- **Oxygen consumption application**: Further clarify the application of oxygen consumption at ventilatory threshold.
- **CPX variables**: Describe CPX variables with an emerging scientific evidence base.
- **Synergy value**: Describe the synergistic value of combining CPX with other assessments.
- **Personnel considerations**: Discuss personnel considerations for CPX laboratories.

This focused update is essential to ensure the continued relevance and clinical applicability of CPX in the assessment of specific patient populations.

### Cardiopulmonary exercise test interpretation across the lifespan in congenital heart disease: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116qxqQa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

This statement provides health care professionals with an evidence-based update on important targeted CPET findings in common congenital and surgically modified cardiac pathologies. CPET offers diagnostic and prognostic value in assessing cardiorespiratory capacity, symptomology, and longitudinal trends. Serial testing, beginning in childhood or early adolescence, is crucial to unmask vulnerabilities associated with poor patient outcomes and to identify earlier opportunities for interventions, including exercise training. The evidence reinforces exercise testing as an integral component of the lifespan approach to caring for those with congenital heart disease.

### Recommendations on the use of exercise testing in clinical practice [^117RmQLX]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Evidence-based recommendations on the clinical use of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in lung and heart disease are presented, with reference to the assessment of exercise intolerance, prognostic assessment, and the evaluation of therapeutic interventions (e.g. drugs, supplemental oxygen, exercise training). A commonly used grading system for recommendations in evidence-based guidelines was applied, with the grade of recommendation ranging from A, the highest, to D, the lowest.

- **Prognostic evaluation**: For symptom-limited incremental exercise, CPET indices, such as peak O(2) uptake (VO(2)), VO(2) at lactate threshold, the slope of the ventilation-CO(2) output relationship, and the presence of arterial O(2) desaturation, have all been shown to have power in prognostic evaluation.

- **Assessment of interventions**: The tolerable duration of symptom-limited high-intensity constant-load exercise often provides greater sensitivity to discriminate change than the classical incremental test. Field-testing paradigms (e.g. timed and shuttle walking tests) also prove valuable.

These considerations allow the resolution of practical questions that often confront the clinician, such as: 1) "When should an evaluation of exercise intolerance be sought?" 2) "Which particular form of test should be asked for?" and 3) "What cluster of variables should be selected when evaluating prognosis for a particular disease or the effect of a particular intervention?"

### Clinician approach to cardiopulmonary exercise testing for exercise prescription in patients at risk of and with cardiovascular disease [^112dbJU9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Exercise training is highly recommended in guidelines on the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This recommendation is based on the cardiovascular benefits of physical activity and structured exercise, which range from improving quality of life to reducing CVD and overall mortality. Therefore, exercise should be treated as a powerful medicine and a critical component of the management plan for patients at risk for, or diagnosed with CVD. A tailored approach, based on the patient's personal and clinical characteristics, represents a cornerstone for the benefits of exercise prescription. In this regard, the use of cardiopulmonary exercise testing is well-established for risk stratification and quantification of cardiorespiratory fitness and ventilatory thresholds, enabling a tailored, personalized exercise prescription. The aim of this paper is to provide practical guidance to clinicians on how to use data from cardiopulmonary exercise testing to create personalized exercise prescriptions for patients at risk of or with CVD.

### Cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen uptake): Safe and effective measure for cardiovascular screening before kidney transplant [^114x6CrU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

**Methods**: Cardiovascular screening for patients undergoing kidney or kidney/pancreas transplant evaluation at Mayo Clinic (Phoenix, AZ) has evolved over time. In October 2011, after extensive discussion with all stakeholders, including cardiologists, transplant nephrologists, transplant surgeons, and anesthesiologists, the decision was made to incorporate VO₂peak, obtained by performing a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), into the standard-of-care pretransplant cardiac screening algorithm. All patients aged ≥ 50 years and/or with diabetes mellitus underwent CPET. The VO₂peak provided an objective measure of cardiorespiratory fitness and was a branch point metric in the algorithm. Only those with VO₂peak ≥ 4 METs (VO₂peak = 14 mL/kg) were considered further in the process.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, specifically concerning bronchoprovocation testing, the AAAAI/ACAAI 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining spirometry and a detailed pulmonary examination. These measures help determine whether shortness of breath during exercise is associated with underlying conditions such as COPD, obesity, skeletal defects like pectus excavatum, diaphragmatic paralysis, or interstitial fibrosis, rather than exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).

### Software for interpreting cardiopulmonary exercise tests [^113HZkYi]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Reference values are a challenging area for CPET. Table 12 in the ATS/ACCP document lists various studies of normative or reference values and the studies' limitations. The committee concludes that none of the studies fulfill the requirements for "optimal" reference values. XINT attempts to minimize these problems by using an integrative approach and cut-off values that are clinically meaningful. For example, an FEV1/FVC ratio of 68% is used for "airflow obstruction" because, although there may be airflow obstruction above this value, it usually does not lead to significant exercise limitation.

Mild exercise limitation is not commented on by XINT as it may be within normal limits for the general population. Further, if an individual has normal exercise capacity, many minor physiological results, which could represent minimal abnormalities under different conditions, are ignored. The integrative approach depends on many factors. The logic XINT uses is similar to that of a human expert in CPET interpretation. The accompanying file, Additional File 1, provides a detailed discussion of the XINT logic.

Another way the program addresses the complexity of reference values is that, if desired, the user can change any of the predicted values directly on the input screen.

### Cardiopulmonary exercise testing applied to respiratory medicine: Myths and facts [^113NwHHi]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) remains poorly understood and, consequently, largely underused in respiratory medicine. In addition to a widespread lack of knowledge of integrative physiology, several tenets of CPET interpretation have relevant controversies and limitations that should be appropriately recognized. With the intent to provide a roadmap for the pulmonologist to realistically calibrate their expectations towards CPET, a collection of deeply entrenched beliefs is critically discussed.

- **Role of CPET in uncovering the cause(s) of dyspnoea**: The actual role of CPET in uncovering the cause(s) of dyspnoea of unknown origin is highlighted.

- **Peak O2 uptake**: This is considered the key metric of cardiorespiratory capacity.

- **Low lactate threshold**: The value of the low lactate ("anaerobic") threshold in differentiating cardiocirculatory from respiratory causes of exercise limitation is examined.

- **Heart rate-based indexes**: The challenges of interpreting heart rate-based indexes of cardiovascular performance are addressed.

- **Peak breathing reserve**: The meaning of peak breathing reserve in dyspnoeic patients is explored.

- **Operating lung volumes during exercise**: The merits and drawbacks of measuring operating lung volumes during exercise are discussed.

- **Gas exchange inefficiency metrics**: The best approach to interpret metrics such as the ventilation-CO2 output relationship is considered.

- **Arterial blood gases requirements**: Situations where measurements of arterial blood gases are required are explained.

- **Submaximal dyspnoea recording**: The advantages of recording submaximal dyspnoea "quantity" and "quality" are outlined.

Based on a conceptual framework that links exertional dyspnoea to "excessive" and/or "restrained" breathing, I outline the approaches to CPET performance and interpretation that proved clinically more helpful in each of these scenarios. CPET is used to answer clinically relevant questions in pulmonology.

### Cardiopulmonary exercise testing for heart failure: pathophysiology and predictive markers [^1116rbts]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

Despite numerous recent advancements in therapy, heart failure (HF) remains a principal cause of both morbidity and mortality. HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a condition that shares the prevalence and adverse outcomes of HF with reduced ejection fraction, remains poorly recognized in its initial manifestations. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), defined as a progressive work exercise test that includes non-invasive continuous measurement of cardiovascular and respiratory parameters, provides a reliable mode to evaluate early features and assess prognostic markers of both forms of HF.

While CPET measurements are standard of care for advanced HF and transplant programs, they merit broader clinical application in the early diagnosis and assessment of patients with HFpEF. In this review, we provide an overview of the pathophysiology of exercise intolerance in HF and discuss key findings in CPETs used to evaluate both the severity of impairment and the prognostic implications.

### Validity and repeatability of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in interstitial lung disease [^116KsMNS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the collective term for a series of pulmonary disorders characterized by inflammation, interstitial and alveolar damage, and irreversible declines in lung function. Presently, ILD affects approximately 2 million people and results in approximately 120,000 deaths globally. Traditionally, resting measures of pulmonary function, including forced vital capacity (FVC) and the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DL CO), have been utilized to monitor disease progression and evaluate the efficacy of treatments. Both variables are predictive of mortality and provide greater predictive power for survival over six months than histopathological factors alone; however, these are not the sole factors predictive of mortality.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a dynamic diagnostic and prognostic test that simultaneously stresses multiple organ systems to identify causes of exercise intolerance and obtain functionally useful biomarkers. Lower values for peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak), the primary outcome from CPET, are associated with increased risk of mortality and need for transplantation, enhancing the predictive power of static pulmonary function testing. This test also maintains high independent predictive power when these factors are controlled for. Ventilatory efficiency and exercise-induced hypoxemia are indicative of poorer prognosis, highlighting the importance of more functionally derived data available from CPET as independent and dynamic prognostic outcomes.

### Clinical and exercise test predictors of all-cause mortality: Results from > 6,000 consecutive referred male patients [^114uGiB3]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

To report the prevalence of abnormal treadmill test responses and their association with mortality in a large consecutive series of patients referred for standard exercise tests, with testing performed and reported in a standardized fashion.

Exercise testing is widely performed, but few databases exist of large numbers of consecutive tests performed on patients referred for routine clinical purposes using standardized methods. Even fewer of the available databases have information regarding all-cause mortality as an outcome.

All patients referred for evaluation at two university-affiliated Veterans Affairs medical centers who underwent exercise treadmill testing for clinical indications between 1987 and 2000 were determined to be dead or alive using the Social Security death index following a mean 6.2 years (median, 7 years) of follow-up. Clinical and exercise test variables were collected prospectively according to standard definitions; testing and data management were performed in a standardized fashion using a computer-assisted protocol. All-cause mortality was utilized as the end point for follow-up. Standard survival analysis was performed, including Kaplan-Meier curves and a Cox hazard model.

There were 6,213 male patients (mean ± SD age, 59 ± 11 years) who underwent standard exercise ECG treadmill testing over the study period with a mean follow-up duration of 6.2 ± 3.7 years. There were no complications of testing in this clinically referred population, 78% of whom were referred for chest pain, or risk factors or signs.

### Software for interpreting cardiopulmonary exercise tests [^115VccKK]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is increasingly being used due to advances in technology and an increased awareness of its importance in the clinical assessment of patients with diverse medical problems. Despite the rising importance and utility of CPET, the difficulty inherent in interpreting the large data sets generated by even limited studies represents a significant deterrent for both ordering and interpreting CPET. As it has in many areas of science and other complex endeavors, software will undoubtedly become useful for facilitating medical diagnoses and implementing appropriate therapies. XINT represents a substantial beginning in medical interpretive software to assist in patient care. It utilizes an integrative approach similar to the way a human expert does, without reliance on simple algorithms or a logic tree. It reviews the data, describes meaningful abnormalities, and then attempts to summarize key findings.

It is well recognized that even among experts, there is rarely uniform agreement when evaluating complex data such as that presented in the case studies provided in the results section. Yet, the XINT-based interpretations were comparable to those of the expert panel, and in each example, the program included the actual diagnosis, albeit often within a range of diagnoses. We currently use XINT at several Baylor College of Medicine-affiliated hospitals to provide CPET interpretations for actual patients and find them to be consistently useful and meaningful.

### Cardiopulmonary fitness and personalized exercise prescription in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^117NMrSS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Clinical assessments:

- **Personal history and clinical profile**: Clinical evaluation included personal and family history, physical examination, comorbidities, drug therapy, and cardiac symptoms at rest or during effort (e.g. palpitations, dyspnea, syncope, chest pain). Information was collected regarding beta-blocker therapy taken by patients, and equivalent doses were calculated using metoprolol 200 mg as 100%. For example, daily doses of 10 mg bisoprolol were considered a 100% dose equivalent, and nadolol 80 mg was defined as a 50% dose equivalent. Genetic counseling and testing were systematically offered to all patients upon establishing the diagnosis. The results of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were assessed, with particular attention to the presence and percentage of late gadolinium enhancement.

- **Exercise history**: Information about lifetime exercise history, including the type of exercise and the intensity and volume of training per week, was systematically collected via an interview during clinical evaluation. Physically active patients were defined as those performing more than 3 hours of organized exercise per week. A metabolic equivalent of task (MET) was assigned for all activities, and the physical activity volume was calculated by multiplying the MET score by the reported physical activity volume (session duration x frequency per week).

- **ECG assessment**: Resting heart rate, sinus rhythm, the presence of T-wave inversion, and bundle-branch blocks were evaluated. Left atrium enlargement was defined as a P-wave duration greater than 120 milliseconds or a negative portion of the T-wave.

### Plasma catecholamines in patients undergoing invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test for exercise intolerance [^111pyqKR]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (iCPET) combines traditional cardiopulmonary exercise testing with invasive hemodynamic measurements to assess exercise intolerance, which can be caused by preload insufficiency (PI), characterized by low ventricular filling pressures and reduced cardiac output during exertion. We hypothesize that plasma catecholamine levels at rest and during exercise correlate with hemodynamic parameters in PI.

- **Methods**: We included adult patients who underwent iCPET for exercise intolerance and had plasma catecholamines measured at rest and peak exercise.

- **Results**: Among 84 patients, PI was identified in 57 (67.8%). Compared to patients without PI, those with PI were younger [median (IQR) 37 (28, 46) vs 47 (39, 55) years, p = 0.005] and had lower workload at peak exercise [81 (66, 96) vs 95 (83.5, 110.50) Watts, p = 0.006]. Patients with PI had higher heart rates at rest and peak exercise [87 (78, 97) vs 79 (74, 87) bpm, p = 0.04; and 167 (154, 183) vs 156 (136, 168) bpm, p = 0.01, respectively]. In all patients, epinephrine and norepinephrine at peak exercise directly correlated with peak workload (r: 0.41, p < 0.001 and r: 0.47, p < 0.001, respectively). Resting epinephrine was higher in patients with PI [136 (60, 210) vs 77 (41, 110) pg/mL, p = 0.02]. There was no significant difference in the change in catecholamines from rest to peak exercise between patients with or without PI.

- **Conclusion**: PI patients exhibited elevated heart rate and epinephrine at rest, indicating increased sympathetic activity. We did not find a strong association between catecholamine changes and exercise intolerance in PI patients.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction update-2016 [^116MwgA1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, particularly concerning differential diagnosis, the AAAAI/ACAAI 2016 guidelines recommend suspecting a diagnosis of exercise-induced anaphylaxis instead of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction based on a history of shortness of breath or other respiratory tract symptoms accompanied by systemic symptoms, such as pruritus, urticaria, and hypotension.

### Prognostic value and diagnostic potential of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with chronic heart failure [^117KYuEA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a well-established technique for stratifying cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Important prognostic variables include a reduced peak oxygen uptake, which plays a central role in cardiac transplant selection, and the abnormal relationship between minute ventilation (VE) and carbon dioxide production (VCO₂), often referred to as the elevated VE/VCO₂ slope.

We will discuss the pathophysiology of these abnormal responses to exercise in CHF and how these are interpreted during CPET. The potential of CPET for diagnosing circulatory, respiratory, metabolic, musculoskeletal, or mixed limitations is an emerging field of research. Additionally, we will speculate on how CHF manifests during CPET and clarify the pathophysiological basis of these exercise responses.

To improve our understanding of the diagnostic value of CPET, further investigation by clinicians is required to develop reference ranges for CHF patients through a coordinated multicenter approach. The use of CPET technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in cardiology services, and it is likely that, in the future, CPET will take a more prominent role in guiding patient management provision.

### Clinical and exercise test determinants of survival after cardiac transplantation [^113hCB6h]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Cardiac transplantation (CTX) is now a viable option for patients with end-stage heart failure, but there remains a paucity of available donor hearts relative to the demand. Establishing prognosis after CTX can help direct this resource to patients most likely to benefit and guide therapy for CTX recipients. Clinical, exercise, and hemodynamic factors associated with survival after CTX have not been well established.

- **Methods**: One hundred seventy-four randomly selected patients who underwent heart transplantation between 1983 and 1999 at Rikshospitalet University Hospital were included in the study. Data were collected as a part of routine posttransplantation management a mean of 3.5 ± 2.1 years (± SD) after CTX. Clinical, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and hemodynamic measures were performed, including measures of peak oxygen uptake (O(2)), ejection fraction, cardiac index, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), pulmonary artery pressure, creatinine, and the presence of coronary artery disease. Patients were followed up for a mean of 7.1 ± 2.1 years; all-cause mortality was used as the end point for survival analysis.

- **Results**: During the follow-up period, 39 patients died; the average annual mortality was 3.6%. Peak O(2) was 19.6 ± 5.6 mL/kg/min, representing 70.5 ± 6.7% of the age-predicted value. Only right atrial pressure and PCWP differed between those who survived and those who died; both were slightly higher among those who died. By Cox proportional hazard analysis, there were no age-adjusted univariate or multivariate analyses that showed significant predictive values for survival except for right atrial pressure and PCWP.

### A reference equation for peak oxygen uptake for pediatric patients who undergo treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise testing [^114EJMRJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Pediatric patients are often referred to cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) laboratories for assessment of exercise-related symptoms. For clinicians to understand results in the context of performance relative to peers, adequate fitness-based prediction equations must be available. However, reference equations for the prediction of peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) in pediatrics are largely developed from field-based testing, and equations derived from CPET are primarily developed using adult data. Our objective was to develop a pediatric reference equation for VO2 peak.

Clinical CPET data from a validation cohort of 1,383 pediatric patients aged 6 to 18 years who achieved a peak respiratory exchange ratio ≥ 1.00 were analyzed to identify clinical and exercise testing factors that contributed to the prediction of VO2 peak from tests performed using the Bruce protocol. The resultant prediction equation was applied to a cross-validation cohort of 1,367 pediatric patients. Exercise duration, gender, weight, and age contributed to the prediction of VO2 peak, generating the following prediction equation: (R² = 0.645, p < 0.001, standard error of the estimate = 6.19 ml/kg/min): VO2 peak (ml/kg/min) = 16.411 + 3.423 (exercise duration [minutes]) - 5.145 (gender [0 = male, 1 = female]) - 0.121 (weight [kg]) + 0.179 (age [years]).

This equation was stable across the age range included in the present study, with differences ≤ 0.5 ml/kg/min between mean measured and predicted VO2 peak in all age groups. In conclusion, this study represents what we believe is the largest pediatric CPET-derived reference equation for VO2 peak.

### 2016 focused update: Clinical recommendations for cardiopulmonary exercise testing data assessment in specific patient populations [^112YzUAt]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

In the past several decades, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) has seen an exponential increase in its evidence base. The growing volume of evidence in support of CPX has led to the release of numerous scientific statements by various societies and associations. In 2012, the European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention & Rehabilitation, along with the American Heart Association, developed a joint document. This document aimed to redefine CPX analysis and reporting in a way that would streamline test interpretation and enhance clinical application.

The 2012 joint scientific statement on CPX conceptualized an easy-to-use, clinically meaningful analysis based on evidence-vetted variables within color-coded algorithms. For each proposed test indication, single-page algorithms were successfully developed. Due to the abundance of new CPX research in recent years and a reassessment of the algorithms in light of the evidence, a focused update to the 2012 scientific statement is now warranted.

- **Objectives of the update**: The purposes of this update are to:
	- Confirm algorithms included in the initial scientific statement that do not require revision
	- Propose revisions to algorithms included in the initial scientific statement
	- Introduce new algorithms based on emerging scientific evidence
	- Further clarify the application of oxygen consumption at ventilatory threshold
	- Describe CPX variables with an emerging scientific evidence base
	- Highlight the synergistic value of combining CPX with other assessments
	- Discuss personnel considerations for CPX laboratories

### Evaluation of routine functional testing after percutaneous coronary intervention [^11787yCL]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Following percutaneous coronary intervention, 348 patients were randomized to either routine or selective functional testing strategies. For the primary endpoint of maximal exercise endurance on a treadmill at 9 months, achievement was similar in the routine and selective groups. The secondary endpoints measuring functional status and quality of life also yielded similar scores in both groups. There was little difference in the rates of invasive cardiac procedures for the two groups at 9 months.

### Breathlessness abnormality is best assessed at peak exercise during incremental cardiopulmonary cycle exercise testing [^113wnwse]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Breathlessness on exertion is a common, distressing, and limiting symptom that can be quantified on incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) using normative reference equations.

- **Research question**: Is the breathlessness abnormality best uncovered and assessed at symptom limitation (peak exercise) compared with submaximal exercise intensities?

- **Study design and methods**: Analysis of people aged ≥ 40 years undergoing symptom-limited incremental cycle CPET in the Canadian Cohort Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) study. Each Borg 0–10 scale breathlessness intensity rating during CPET was converted to its probability of being normal (P norm), in relation to power output (W), rate of oxygen uptake (V'O2), and minute ventilation (V'E) using normative reference equations. Abnormally high exertional breathlessness (abnormal breathlessness) was defined as a P norm < 0.05.

- **Results**: Of 1,161 participants (42% women), abnormally high breathlessness was present in 22%, 23%, and 16% in relation to W, V'O2, and V'E at peak exercise. Among those with abnormal breathlessness at peak exercise, 55–60% had normal breathlessness across all submaximal exercise intensities. Among those with normal breathlessness at peak exercise, 93–97% were normal across all serial breathlessness ratings throughout the CPET (interclass correlation coefficients = 0.93–0.95). Findings were similar in people with or without chronic airflow limitation, and in people who did or did not reach maximal exertion at the end (symptom limitation) of the CPET.

- **Interpretation**: Abnormal breathlessness is a crucial factor in assessing exercise performance.

### Software for interpreting cardiopulmonary exercise tests [^111ro5Uh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

To test the utility of XINT for CPET interpretation in a non-biased way, we chose the five case study examples provided in the ATS/ACCP Statement on Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing. The computer-generated interpretations were derived strictly from the data taken from these examples. The reports are presented in Additional File 2. The actual diagnoses are shown in parentheses prior to each interpretation.

We believe the software-derived interpretations are substantially similar to those given by the expert group, thus validating this program for a diverse group of non-selected medical disorders.

### Comparison of different exercise tests in assessing outcomes of pulmonary rehabilitation [^113j2nyU]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Common modalities of clinical exercise testing for outcome measurement after pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) include walk tests, progressive cycle ergometry, and cycle endurance testing. We hypothesized that patients' responses to PR, as measured by those three tests, are differentially correlated, and we designed a study to investigate the tests' capacity to detect changes after PR.

- **Methods**: We prospectively tested 37 male patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who completed a comprehensive 6-week PR program that included supervised exercise training emphasizing steady-state lower-limb aerobic exercise. Before and after the PR program, the patients underwent a 6-minute walk test, progressive cycle ergometry, and cycle endurance testing (at 80% of the peak work rate achieved during progressive cycle ergometry). The exercise performance indices of interest were the peak oxygen uptake (VO2max) and maximum work-rate (Wmax) during progressive cycle ergometry, the cycling endurance time, and the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD).

- **Results**: After PR, there were statistically significant improvements in 6MWD (16%, p < 0.001), VO2max (53%, p = 0.004), Wmax (30%, p = 0.001), and cycling endurance time (144%, p < 0.001). The changes in VO2max and Wmax were significantly correlated (r = 0.362, p = 0.027), as were the changes in endurance time and Wmax (r = 0.406, p = 0.013). There was no significant correlation between changes in any other exercise index.

- **Conclusions**: Among the frequently used exercise tests in PR, the most responsive index is the endurance time.

### Cardiopulmonary exercise testing and its application [^117QaLRT]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) has emerged as an essential clinical tool for evaluating exercise capacity and predicting outcomes in patients with heart failure and other cardiac conditions. It provides an assessment of integrative exercise responses, involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular, and skeletal muscle systems, which are not adequately captured through measurements of individual organ system function. CPET is increasingly utilized across a wide range of clinical applications to evaluate undiagnosed exercise intolerance and to objectively determine functional capacity and impairment. This review focuses on exercise physiology and the physiological basis for functional exercise testing. It discusses the methodology, indications, contraindications, and interpretation of CPET in both healthy individuals and patients with heart failure.

### Exercise testing in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: An appraisal through diagnosis, pathophysiology and therapy - a clinical consensus statement of the Heart Failure Association and European Association of Preventive Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology [^111iCwig]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with HFpEF exhibit a high burden of comorbid conditions, with an average of five or more coexisting comorbidities at the same time, primarily contributing to adverse outcomes and critically impairing exercise capacity. Peak VO₂ is impressively restrained by comorbid conditions, explaining up to 50% of the predicted increase in functional capacity after exercise training (ET) programs. Nonetheless, a precise dissection of the role of any single comorbid and extracardiac factor may be limited by the coexistence of mixed phenotypes and wide heterogeneity of O₂ pathway derangements.

- **Systemic arterial and venous system abnormalities**: The arterial vascular system plays a central role in modulating compliance and resistances, ventriculo–vascular coupling, and blood flow redistribution to the working muscles. In elderly hypertensive subjects, an impaired vascular compliance reduces the wave transit time from the LV to peripheral sites of vascular reflection and back to the aorta, generating a late systolic load which contributes to ventriculo–vascular uncoupling, increased LV filling pressures, and high afterload. Despite the fact that vascular stiffening is a well-known hallmark feature of the hypertensive state, only recently have the implications of this been scrutinized under maximal exercise evaluation with gas exchange measurements by applying invasive or estimated measures of arterial functional response and load pulsatility.

### Performance and interpretation of invasive hemodynamic exercise testing [^112t3bBz]. Chest (2020).

Exertional dyspnea is a common complaint for patients seen in pulmonary, cardiac, and general medicine clinics, and elucidating the cause is often challenging, particularly when physical examination, echocardiography, radiography, and pulmonary function test results are inconclusive. Invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing has emerged as the gold standard test to define causes of dyspnea and exertional limitation in this population. In this review, we describe the methods for performing and interpreting invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing, with particular attention to the hemodynamic and blood sampling data as they apply to patients being evaluated for heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

High credibility is assigned to recent RCTs and guidelines from reputable US journals; however, this source was determined to have low credibility due to its publication year and the nature of the study.

### Practical guide to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in adults [^114rTE9k]. Respiratory Research (2022). Low credibility.

Unexplained exertional dyspnea or fatigue can arise from a number of underlying disorders and shows only a weak correlation with resting functional or imaging tests. Noninvasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) offers a unique, but still underutilized and unrecognized, opportunity to study cardiopulmonary and metabolic changes simultaneously. CPET can distinguish between a normal and an abnormal exercise response and usually identifies which of multiple pathophysiological conditions, alone or in combination, is the leading cause of exercise intolerance. Therefore, it improves diagnostic accuracy and patient health care by directing more targeted diagnostics and facilitating treatment decisions. Consequently, CPET should be one of the early tests used to assess exercise intolerance. However, this test requires specific knowledge, and there remains a significant information gap for those physicians primarily interested in learning how to systematically analyze and interpret CPET findings. This article describes the underlying principles of exercise physiology and provides a practical guide to performing CPET and interpreting the results in adults.
