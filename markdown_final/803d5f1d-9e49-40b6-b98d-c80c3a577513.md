## Question

NSAIDs associated kidney damage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about NSAID-associated kidney damage, including mechanisms, risk factors, clinical syndromes, dose/route/agent differences, special populations, and practical management recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology and reconcile COX-1 versus COX-2 effects in the kidney. Then, I should verify which patient and drug factors modify risk. Next, I will classify the nephrotoxic syndromes and their reversibility. After that, I need to examine dose, duration, route, and agent-specific differences. I will then review special populations, including CKD, older adults, pregnancy, and perioperative/trauma settings. Finally, I will synthesize management principles and monitoring, and close with a balanced conclusion that distinguishes relative from absolute risk and highlights evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic foundation: NSAIDs impair renal function primarily by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, which removes a compensatory vasodilatory signal that maintains renal perfusion when renal blood flow is threatened, leading to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and reduced GFR. This hemodynamic "functional" AKI is typically reversible with drug cessation, though persistent ischemia can progress to structural injury, and NSAIDs can also cause acute interstitial nephritis and, with chronic high-dose exposure, papillary necrosis, so I need to keep both functional and structural phenotypes in mind [^111NimAT] [^115s1xox] [^111djoPB] [^11176MPk].

> Wait, let me verify the COX-1 versus COX-2 nuance because I initially thought COX-2 selectivity might spare the kidney. Hold on, I should verify that assumption. COX-2 is constitutively expressed in the kidney and contributes to salt handling, renin release, and perfusion, so COX-2 inhibitors can still precipitate hemodynamic AKI and sodium retention, and comparative data show similar renal risk profiles between COX-2 inhibitors and nonselective NSAIDs, with some large programs even suggesting higher renovascular event rates for certain agents like etoricoxib, so I should not assume COX-2 selectivity confers renal protection [^111hNpyZ] [^112RT61P] [^113FKM95] [^111NimAT].

> Next, I should review risk modifiers. I need to ensure I capture both patient susceptibility and drug-related factors. High-risk patients include those with CKD, heart failure, cirrhosis, older age, diabetes, volume depletion, and those on RAAS inhibitors or diuretics, where NSAIDs can unmask or worsen hemodynamic instability. Mechanistically, RAAS blockade lowers efferent tone and NSAIDs lower afferent tone, creating a "double hit" on GFR, and observational data show a 3–5 fold AKI risk increase with the NSAID + diuretic ± ACEi/ARB combination, so I should double-check for these combinations before prescribing [^112FzdNJ] [^111NimAT] [^112iWAFa].

> I will now examine the clinical syndromes. Let me think about the spectrum and reversibility. Hemodynamically mediated, functional AKI is the most common and usually improves with NSAID withdrawal and correction of volume status. Acute interstitial nephritis presents with sterile pyuria, eosinophiluria, and systemic features and may require steroids in persistent cases. With prolonged high-dose exposure, papillary necrosis and chronic CKD progression can occur, and although many NSAID-induced kidney injuries are reversible, repeated or severe insults can accelerate CKD, so I should confirm duration and cumulative exposure when assessing risk and prognosis [^111NimAT] [^111djoPB] [^11176MPk] [^113hfbmU].

> Hold on, I should verify dose, duration, route, and agent-specific differences because these often drive bedside decisions. Risk is dose- and duration-dependent, with higher cumulative exposure linked to CKD progression and even modest short-term exposure increasing AKI odds in older adults. Topical NSAIDs reduce systemic exposure to roughly 0.4–2.2% of oral levels and have RCT-level safety signals with no serious renal events in pooled analyses, though observational data still suggest a small early AKI signal that likely reflects confounding. Among oral agents, ibuprofen tends to have lower renal risk signals than some comparators, whereas indomethacin and etoricoxib carry higher AKI or eGFR-decline risks, and long half-life NSAIDs may compound risk, so I should prefer the lowest effective dose for the shortest time and consider topical therapy when feasible [^115Ja7AA] [^11663mZo] [^115gRSjH] [^116rTJzw] [^112eLuEQ] [^113ZT2Tc].

> Let me consider special populations; I should confirm CKD-specific guidance. In CKD, NSAIDs can precipitate AKI, worsen hypertension/edema, and contribute to hyperkalemia; VA/DoD guidance advises avoiding NSAIDs when eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min and using extreme caution with short courses only if benefits outweigh risks at eGFR 30–59, with explicit avoidance of concomitant RAAS inhibitors and diuretics when possible; meta-analytic data suggest an approximately 1.6–1.7 fold AKI risk with NSAID exposure in CKD, reinforcing the need for shared decision-making and close monitoring if used at all [^116sjyWs] [^11366CiG] [^112iWAFa] [^113wuPZm].

> I should double-check older adults because age amplifies risk even outside overt CKD. In adults over 50, NSAID-associated AKI odds are roughly twofold higher than in younger populations, and in the very elderly, community-based data show increased AKI hospitalizations shortly after initiation; intriguingly, some biomarker-based cohorts in ambulatory older adults did not show faster eGFR decline among NSAID users, underscoring heterogeneity and the importance of baseline risk and ascertainment, so I need to individualize decisions and monitor early after starting therapy [^113CGjgy] [^116rTJzw] [^113WMDLC].

> But wait, what about pregnancy? I need to ensure fetal renal safety is addressed. After 20 weeks' gestation, NSAIDs can cause fetal renal dysfunction, oligohydramnios, and ductal constriction, so use should be limited before 30 weeks and avoided after 30 weeks unless compelling indications exist, with ultrasound monitoring if exposure occurs; this is a clear scenario where the renal risk extends beyond the mother to the fetus [^117LhRWv] [^1173Go9f] [^112STsa8].

> Next, I should review perioperative and critical care contexts. Let me verify the balance of analgesia versus AKI risk. NSAIDs reduce opioid requirements but can precipitate hemodynamic AKI in hypoperfusion states; a Cochrane review found uncertain effects on postoperative AKI with a small creatinine rise signal, and observational trauma data suggest no clear AKI signal with early NSAIDs in rib-fracture ICU patients, yet some perioperative analyses link intraoperative NSAIDs to higher AKI, so I should avoid NSAIDs in hypovolemia, shock, or high-risk surgeries and favor multimodal regimens with careful monitoring when used [^11592NKf] [^114YPu7g] [^112dK8BW].

> I need to ensure I translate this into practical management. Let me outline a risk-stratified approach. Identify high-risk patients and avoid NSAIDs when possible. If NSAIDs are necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, prefer topical formulations for localized pain, avoid triple whammy combinations (NSAID + diuretic + ACEi/ARB), correct volume status before initiation, and check serum creatinine/eGFR and electrolytes within 1–2 weeks of starting or escalating therapy. In CKD, avoid if eGFR ≤ 30 and consider acetaminophen, topical agents, or nonpharmacologic strategies first, documenting shared decision-making and explicit monitoring plans [^11366CiG] [^1158fgCQ] [^115gRSjH] [^116qRMqb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about absolute risk. I should verify population-level estimates to frame counseling. In large cohorts of active young adults, more than 7 NSAID defined daily doses per month associates with modest increases in AKI and CKD, translating to about 18 excess AKI cases and 30 excess CKD cases per 100,000 exposed per year. In older adults initiating NSAIDs, hospitalization for AKI occurs in roughly 1 in 200 new users within 45 days, and in CKD populations, pooled AKI risk is increased about 1.6–1.7 fold with an absolute risk near 4% in some analyses, so I should communicate that relative risks are real but absolute risks are low in low-risk groups and higher in high-risk groups [^115Ja7AA] [^111f881e] [^116rTJzw] [^112iWAFa].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. NSAID nephrotoxicity spans functional hemodynamic injury and structural entities like AIN and papillary necrosis, is dose- and duration-dependent, amplified by patient vulnerability and interacting nephrohemodynamic drugs, and is generally reversible with prompt recognition and withdrawal. Topical therapy meaningfully reduces systemic exposure and appears safer, and in CKD or other high-risk states, avoidance or extreme caution with close monitoring is warranted, with shared decision-making to balance analgesic benefit against renal risk [^111NimAT] [^115gRSjH] [^11366CiG].

NSAIDs cause kidney damage primarily through **prostaglandin inhibition** [^112RT61P], leading to renal ischemia [^113mghML], acute tubular necrosis, and interstitial nephritis [^111GTg8P]. Risk is highest in patients with CKD, heart failure, liver disease, dehydration, or those on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics [^112iWAFa]; **dose and duration** further increase risk [^111NimAT]. COX-2 inhibitors have similar renal risk to nonselective NSAIDs [^113FKM95] [^112RT61P]. Clinical features include AKI, sodium retention, hypertension, and hyperkalemia [^111NimAT]; most cases are reversible with prompt discontinuation, but chronic use can cause permanent damage [^113mghML] [^113hfbmU]. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, avoid in high-risk patients, and monitor renal function during therapy [^116qRMqb] [^11366CiG].

## Mechanisms of NSAID-induced kidney damage

NSAIDs impair renal function through several **interconnected mechanisms**:

- **Hemodynamic effects**: NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis [^111GTg8P], reducing renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), especially in patients dependent on renal prostaglandins (e.g. CKD, heart failure, cirrhosis, dehydration) [^111GTg8P].

- **Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)**: Prostaglandin inhibition can cause renal ischemia, leading to ATN, particularly in hypovolemic or critically ill patients [^111GTg8P].

- **Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN)**: NSAIDs can trigger immune-mediated AIN, characterized by interstitial inflammation and renal dysfunction [^114Z8zmx].

- **Papillary necrosis**: Chronic NSAID use can cause renal papillary necrosis, a severe and potentially irreversible lesion [^115s1xox].

---

## Risk factors for NSAID-induced kidney damage

Several patient- and medication-related factors increase the risk of **NSAID-induced kidney damage**:

| **Risk factor category** | **Specific risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Patient-related | - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Liver cirrhosis <br/> - Dehydration/hypovolemia <br/> - Advanced age <br/> - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - Hypertension [^111NimAT] [^112iWAFa] |
| Medication-related | - High NSAID doses <br/> - Prolonged duration of therapy <br/> - Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics <br/> - COX-2 selective NSAIDs (similar risk to nonselective NSAIDs) [^113U2Uhm] [^113FKM95] |

## Clinical manifestations of NSAID-induced kidney damage

NSAID-induced kidney damage presents with a range of **clinical syndromes**:

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Sudden decline in renal function, often reversible upon discontinuation of NSAIDs [^113mghML].

- **Sodium and water retention**: Causes edema, hypertension, and exacerbation of heart failure [^113mghML].

- **Hyperkalemia**: NSAIDs can cause hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with impaired renal function or those on potassium-sparing medications [^113c8s8k].

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression**: Long-term NSAID use can accelerate CKD progression, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment [^113hfbmU].

---

## Reversibility of NSAID-induced kidney damage

The reversibility of NSAID-induced kidney damage depends on the **severity and chronicity** of injury. Acute hemodynamic AKI is **usually reversible** with prompt NSAID discontinuation and supportive care, whereas chronic injury (e.g. papillary necrosis, interstitial fibrosis) may be **irreversible** and lead to permanent renal impairment [^113mghML].

---

## Preventive strategies and clinical guidelines

To minimize NSAID-induced kidney damage, clinicians should adhere to the following **preventive strategies**:

- **Use the lowest effective dose**: Limit NSAID dose and duration of therapy [^116qRMqb].

- **Avoid in high-risk patients**: Avoid NSAIDs in patients with CKD, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or dehydration [^112iWAFa].

- **Monitor renal function**: Regularly monitor serum creatinine, eGFR, and electrolytes during NSAID therapy, especially in high-risk patients [^11366CiG].

- **Consider alternatives**: Use acetaminophen or topical NSAIDs when appropriate, especially in patients with CKD or other risk factors [^115gRSjH].

NSAIDs can cause significant kidney damage through prostaglandin inhibition, leading to hemodynamic instability, acute tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis, and papillary necrosis. Risk is highest in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, heart failure, liver disease, dehydration, or those on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics. Most cases are **reversible with prompt discontinuation**, but chronic use can cause permanent damage. Clinicians should use the lowest effective dose, avoid NSAIDs in high-risk patients, and monitor renal function during therapy [^111GTg8P] [^111NimAT] [^113mghML].

## References

### Prospects for changing the burden of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity [^113RcRnW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increase the risk of clinically important upper gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeds about fourfold. Other risk factors for these events include advanced age, higher NSAID dose, prior ulcer or bleed, use of anticoagulants, use of corticosteroids, and poor general health. Among NSAID users with more than one risk factor, the incidence of serious ulcer complications may be as high as 4% to 8% per year. NSAIDs may also increase blood pressure and have adverse effects on renal function. NSAID-associated toxicity may be decreased by (1) trying less toxic alternative drugs; (2) using NSAIDs less frequently or at a lower dose; (3) use of cotherapy, such as misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors, to prevent complications; (4) or use of the more selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. More research is needed to determine which of these strategies or combination of strategies is optimal in terms of patient safety and cost.

Conclusion

AKI is an increasingly common global problem causing significant morbidity and mortality and with large resource implications. Exposure to NSAIDS and other nephrotoxic drugs is an important cause of AKI, but the risk of these exposures is modified by susceptibilities such as increasing age and the presence of CKD. This study found that the odds of developing AKI increased by over 50% in people who were exposed to NSAIDs in the general population and in people with CKD, and in older people the odds of developing AKI doubled. However, the absolute risk of developing AKI also depends on the baseline risk of AKI in the population exposed, which none of the included studies reported. Future studies should use internationally agreed definitions of AKI and estimate the absolute risk of AKI in different populations including older people and people with CKD to better inform clinical decision making. There is evidence that feedback and more complex interventions to reduce NSAID prescribing in people at high risk of renal adverse effects are effective, and clinicians should seek to minimise NSAID exposure in people particularly susceptible to AKI due to age, CKD or because of the co-prescription of other nephrotoxic drugs.

### Association of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescriptions with kidney disease among active young and middle-aged adults [^111f881e]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Concern about the renal effects of nonsteroidand al anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) among young, healthy adults has been limited, but more attention may be warranted given the prevalent use of these agents.

Objective

To test for associations between dispensed NSAIDs and incident acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease while controlling for other risk factors.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, longitudinal cohort study used deidentified medical and administrative data on 764 228 active-duty US Army soldiers serving between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2014. Analysis was conducted from August 1 to November 30, 2018. All individuals new to Army service were included in the analysis. Persons already serving in January 2011 were required to have at least 7 months of observable time to eliminate those with kidney disease histories.

Exposures

Mean total defined daily doses of prescribed NSAIDs dispensed per month in the prior 6 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident outcomes were defined by diagnoses documented in health records and a military-specific digital system.

Results

Among the 764 228 participants (655 392 [85.8%] men; mean [SD] age, 28.6 [7.9] years; median age, 27.0 years [interquartile range, 22.0–33.0 years]), 502 527 (65.8%) were not dispensed prescription NSAIDs in the prior 6 months, 137 108 (17.9%) were dispensed 1 to 7 mean total defined daily doses per month, and 124 594 (16.3%) received more than 7 defined daily doses per month. There were 2356 acute kidney injury outcomes (0.3% of participants) and 1634 chronic kidney disease outcomes (0.2%) observed. Compared with participants who received no medication, the highest exposure level was associated with significantly higher adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for acute kidney injury (aHR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1–1.4) and chronic kidney disease (aHR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.3), with annual outcome excesses per 100 000 exposed individuals totaling 17.6 cases for acute kidney injury and 30.0 cases for chronic kidney disease.

Conclusions and Relevance

Modest but statistically significant associations were noted between the highest observed doses of NSAID exposure and incident kidney problems among active young and middle-aged adults.

### Do early non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for analgesia worsen acute kidney injury in critically ill trauma patients? An inverse probability of treatment weighted analysis [^114YPu7g]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for acute posttraumatic analgesia is increasing in popularity as an alternative to opioids despite reservations regarding its potential impact on the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). We hypothesized that early NSAID administration for analgesia would be associated with worsened renal function in severely injured trauma patients.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of severely injured adult (≥ 16 years) patients admitted to the intensive care unit with ≥ 1 rib fracture between 2010 and 2017 was performed. The early NSAID group was defined by receipt of one or more doses of NSAID within the first 48 hours of hospitalization. Acute kidney injury diagnosis and staging were defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes Guidelines. The primary outcome was a composite measure of two outcomes within the first week of hospitalization: (1) AKI progression (increase in AKI stage from arrival) or (2) death. Secondary outcomes included AKI progression, AKI improvement, AKI duration, and mortality. Inverse propensity of treatment weights were generated using clinically sound covariates suspected to be associated with the decision to give early NSAIDs and the primary or secondary outcomes. Multivariable analyses were performed adjusting for inverse propensity of treatment weights, covariates, and length of stay.

Results

Of 2,340 patients, 268 (11%) were administered early NSAIDs. When compared with the control group, patients who received early NSAIDs were less severely injured. Renal outcomes were worse in the control group. Standardized mean differences were minimal after weighting. On multivariable analysis, administration of early NSAIDs was not associated with worsened renal outcomes or increased mortality.

Conclusion

Although only 11% of patients received early NSAIDs after trauma for analgesia, early NSAID exposure was not associated with increased AKI progression, decreased AKI improvement, prolonged duration, or increased mortality. Given the lack of evidence showing harm, early NSAIDs for analgesia may be underused for severely injured patients.

Level Of Evidence

Prognostic, level III, Therapeutic, level IV.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114byw17]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed in primary care for their analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects. One in fifteen US adults are actively prescribed NSAIDs at any one time, and in many countries low-dose preparations are also available over-the-counter (OCT). Partly due to their widespread use, NSAIDs account for 25% of adverse drug events (ADEs) reported in the United Kingdom ﻿﻿(UK) and 21% in the United States (US). NSAIDs are also commonly implicated in hospital admissions due to ADEs, including those which are fatal, but gastrointestinal and cardiac toxicity are better quantified than renal toxicity.

NSAIDs can reduce renal blood flow, cause tubular obstruction through crystal deposition, and induce direct cytotoxicity and cell-mediated immune injury mechanisms leading to the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Another symptom that is commonly caused by NSAIDs is interstitial nephritis (AIN) which requires specialist review, renal biopsy, high-dose corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressant treatments, and will normally be progression in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Older age and underlying chronic kidney disease are also related to the onset of AKI during NSAID use, with early studies showing that the risk of deterioration in renal function increases 3–4 fold in patients with abnormal baseline renal function compared to those with normal renal function. Notably, NSAIDs are commonly prescribed to people with CKD, despite guidance to avoid them in this population. In US veterans in 2005, 15.4% of people with CKD were prescribed traditional NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, compared to 11.1% of people with CKD in the UK in 2012, and 15.9% of people with CKD in Australia in 2004–2006. Better quantification of risk in people with CKD is therefore of particular clinical interest, as is whether NSAID risk varies by age and by COX-2 selectivity. In terms of COX-2 selectivity, early studies suggested that COX-2-selective inhibitors caused fewer renal adverse effects including reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased serum creatinine (SCr) and hypertension. Other studies have shown no significant differences in renal risk between COX-2-selective inhibitors and nonselective NSAIDs.

### Association of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescriptions with kidney disease among active young and middle-aged adults [^115pL19R]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Other limitations of the study arise from our reliance on dispensed NSAID prescriptions to quantify drug exposure. Whereas our data captured clinicians' instructions, there was no mechanism to observe the details of individual NSAID use. We would expect this approach to have created conservative association estimates because if prescription NSAID intake varied from the total quantity prescribed, it was presumably lower. However, we were unable to account for over-the-counter NSAID use, which could have offset this phenomenon.

Of the participants, 238 168 (31.2%) were new to the Army during the observation period. These individuals differed in gross exposure to the military environment from those with greater total service times. Furthermore, the presence of experienced soldiers in the data set represents a possible selection sieve, as these soldiers have served for potentially many years. We included the covariates for age, service time, and combat experience specifically to provide control for these factors.

Recently, a more cautious tone has permeated the discussion about NSAID use, with concerns including the potential delayed or inhibited healing associated with pain management. Nonpharmacologic interventions are increasingly emphasized, and research evidence on such options is available. Our findings provide additional support for the need for expanded research on alternative treatment options for pain and a greater focus on patient education about the risks and benefits of higher doses of NSAIDs.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^115vfRkF]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Nonopioid pharmacological therapy for acute sickle cell disease (SCD) pain — For adults and children presenting with acute pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests a short course (5 to 7 days) of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in addition to opioids for acute pain management (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). NSAIDs are defined broadly to include selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, and patient-specific assessment of harms should guide use and drug/class selection; patients at increased risk of renal toxicity should be identified, and if comorbidities confer significant risk, the mild potential benefit may not outweigh the risk. It is good practice to provide patient-centered education and surveillance related to NSAID toxicity, especially in patients with end-organ comorbidities, given limited long-term safety data and potential vascular, bleeding, and renal risks.

### Ketoprofen [^111mC2NP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10 fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. Forhigh risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greater risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE-inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

### Inflammation reduction pack [^11267NWY]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Caution should be used when initiating treatment with diclofenac sodium delayed-release in patients with considerable dehydration.

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

Advanced Renal Disease

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with diclofenac sodium delayed-release is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If diclofenac sodium delayed-release therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^115Ptt6L]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The substantial geographic variations in overall, long-term, and cumulative use of opioids and NSAIDs may reflect inconsistent treatment strategies across states. States with the highest prevalence of opioid or NSAID use did not necessarily have the longest average cumulative use of these medications. Previous studies also showed geographic variations in opioid use and opioid-related hospitalization and emergency department visits. These geographic variations suggest that each state or county may be facing different issues regarding inappropriate use of prescription analgesics. Considering the epidemic of opioid misuse, overdose, and death, it would be particularly relevant to design local regulations, educate physicians regarding opioid therapies, and raise public awareness about the risks of opioid use.

In our outcomes analyses, opioid use was associated with a higher risk of developing ESKD and death, independent of CKD status, which may be due to opioid users being at high risk of opioid dependence and opioid overdose, with consequent higher hospitalization and mortality. It is possible that people in pain requested or received more opioids. In contrast with opioids, no association was observed between NSAID use (except receiving NSAIDs for 91–180 days) and progression to ESKD, but a significant protective association was observed between receiving NSAIDs and death, with adjustment of other patient-level factors. Previous studies have been inconsistent with regard to the association between NSAIDs and progression to ESKD. Some found that regular consumption of NSAIDs was associated with decreased kidney function. Additionally, the risk of developing ESKD increased with greater cumulative exposure to NSAIDs among those with CKD. However, others have suggested that use of NSAIDs was not associated with decreased kidney function. Use of NSAIDs in CKD requires caution because of their known direct nephrotoxic effects, risk of causing fluid and electrolyte imbalances, hypertension, and other complications. However, effective pain management may relieve pain and related stress and could potentially delay disease progression and mortality. The observed protective association of NSAIDs and outcomes may reflect the benefits of pain relief relative to potential nephrotoxic effects, or it may be the consequence of rational clinical decision-making, such that physicians use NSAIDs for patients with CKD at earlier stages and for those who have low risk of progressing to ESKD regardless of stage, while they choose opioids for patients at later stages of disease and high risk of progression. Our results highlight the need for further investigation of the benefits and risks of choosing NSAIDs vs opioids in pain management.

### Concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of acute kidney injury: nested case-control study [^113U2Uhm]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury is a major clinical concern. According to the World Health Organization's most recent estimates (2009), the incidence rate of hospital admissions related to acute kidney in the United Kingdom is 5 per 10 000 residents. Furthermore, among people admitted to hospital with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis support, the incidence rate of mortality related to acute kidney injury can exceed 50%.

Adverse reactions to drugs remain an important cause of acute kidney injury. Kidneys regulate the excretion of almost all drugs, which, in turn, may lead to nephropathy. In England, the rate of hospital admission for drug induced nephropathy increased almost twofold between 1999 and 2009.

Although drug related acute kidney injury is commonly associated with the use of individual classes of drugs (such as antiretroviral drugs, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)), little is known about the effects of drug-drug interactions on this outcome. This aspect is particularly relevant among users of antihypertensive drugs, who often need more than one drug for adequate blood pressure control. For example, in patients with heart failure and hypertension, the concurrent use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers along with diuretics is common. However, many of these patients also have chronic inflammatory diseases or chronic pain, so the add-on use of NSAIDs may be indicated.

Some case reports and pharmacovigilance analyses have suggested that the concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers with NSAIDs can increase the risk of acute kidney injury. This risk is thought to vary with the number of antihypertensive drug classes used concurrently with NSAIDs. Specifically, patients can be exposed to a double or triple therapy combination composed of one or two of the aforementioned antihypertensive drug classes with NSAIDs.

From a pharmacological perspective, these combinations may increase the risk of acute kidney injury, as each has the potential to affect kidney function through different mechanisms. Use of diuretics can lead to hypovolaemia, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers cause a haemodynamic reduction in glomerular filtration rate due to efferent arteriolar vasodilation, and NSAIDs cause inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis (leading to renal afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction).

### The 6R's of drug induced nephrotoxicity [^114Z8zmx]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Recognition

Currently, there is no standard definition of DIKD and incidence of nephrotoxicity varies depending on the definition employed and the causal drug. The most common drugs that cause DIKD include antibiotics, anti-rejection medications, antiviral agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, anti-ulcer agents and chemotherapy.

Most studies have defined nephrotoxicity as 0.5 mg/dL or 50% rise in Scr over 24–72 h time frame and a minimum 24–48 h of drug exposure. However, these definitions pose challenges since a 50% increase in Scr may not have high specificity for DIKD since the underlying disease being treated as well as other AKI risk factors could be significant to the attribution of risk. In the setting of fluctuating renal function or those patients receiving renal replacement therapies, it is difficult to recognize DIKD. For example, if a critically ill patient develops AKI from sepsis, it may be difficult to recognize whether an antibiotic is causing additional injury to the susceptible kidney. Recognition is also complicated by the fact that the mechanism of kidney injury and time period for onset of injury varies by drug and some drugs cause injury by more than one mechanism. For instance, NSAIDS can result in AKI due to hemodynamic changes or acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), or nephrotic range proteinuria from glomerular injury.

In order to improve the recognition of DIKD in the literature, we convened an expert panel to develop consensus-based definitions. We propose that DIKD presents in one of four phenotypes: AKI, glomerular disorder, tubular disorder, or nephrolithiasis/crystalluria. The clinical presentation of each phenotype is based on primary and secondary criteria. We suggest that at least one primary criterion must be met for all drugs suspected of causing DIKD. For each phenotype definition, the following critical elements from the Bradford-Hill causal criteria must be met:
The drug exposure must be at least 24 h preceding the event.
There should be biological plausibility for the causal drug, based on known mechanism of drug effect; metabolism and immunogenicity.
Complete data (including but not limited to co-morbidities, additional nephrotoxic exposures, exposure to contrast agents, surgical procedures, blood pressure, urine output) surrounding the period of drug exposure is required to account for concomitant risks and exposures to other nephrotoxic agents.
The strength of the relationship between the attributable drug and phenotype should be based on drug exposure duration, extent of primary and secondary criteria met and the time course of the injury.

### Oxaprozin [^111cPPcu]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Use of NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of oxaprozin use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid oxaprozin use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations, Data).

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus

Use of NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment

Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment.

Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of oxaprozin to pregnant rabbits at doses 0.1-times the maximum daily human dose (based on body surface area) resulted in evidence of teratogenicity; however, oral administration of oxaprozin to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose revealed no evidence of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity. In rat reproduction studies in which oxaprozin was administered through late gestation failure to deliver and a reduction in live birth index was observed at doses equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as oxaprozin, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113wuPZm]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a common cause of adverse drug events (ADEs), but renal risks of NSAIDs are less well quantified than gastrointestinal and cardiac risks. This paper reports a systematic review of published population-based observational studies examining the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with NSAIDs in community-dwelling adults and those with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched until June 2016, and 3789 papers screened. Ten studies reporting NSAID risk of AKI in the general population were included in random effects meta-analysis, of which five additionally reported NSAID risk in people with CKD.

Results

In the general population, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of AKI for current NSAID exposure was 1.73 (95%CI 1.44 to 2.07), with somewhat higher risk observed in older people (OR 2.51, 95%CI 1.52 to 2.68). In people with CKD, individual study OR of AKI due to current NSAID exposure ranged from 1.12 to 5.25, with pooled estimate OR 1.63 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.19).

Conclusions

No study reported baseline risk of AKI in different populations meaning absolute risks could not be estimated, but baseline risk and therefore the absolute risk of NSAID exposure is likely to be higher in people with CKD and older people. Large population based studies measuring AKI using current definitions and estimating the absolute risk of harm are needed in order to better inform clinical decision making.

### Etodolac [^115Ehcv1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of etodolac and other treatment options before deciding to use etodolac. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

After observing the response to the initial therapy with etodolac, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

Dosage adjustment of etodolac is generally not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Etodolac should be used with caution in such patients, because, as with other NSAIDs, it may further decrease renal function in some patients with impaired renal function (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects).

Analgesia

The recommended total daily dose of etodolac for acute pain is up to 1,000 mg, given as 200 to 400 mg every 6 to 8 hours. Doses of etodolac greater than 1,000 mg/day have not been adequately evaluated in well-controlled clinical trials.

Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis

The recommended starting dose of etodolac for the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis is: 300 mg b.i.d., t.i.d., or 400 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg b.i.d. A lower dose of 600 mg/day may suffice for long-term administration. Physicians should be aware that doses above 1,000 mg/day have not been adequately evaluated in well-controlled clinical trials.

In chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to therapy with etodolac is sometimes seen within one week of therapy, but most often is observed by two weeks. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the patient's dose should be reviewed and adjusted as required.

### NSAIDs in CKD: are they safe? [^1137WjKP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of pain in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging for many reasons. These patients have increased susceptibility to adverse drug effects due to altered drug metabolism and excretion, and there are limited safety data for use in this population despite a high pain burden. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been regarded as dangerous for use in patients with CKD because of their risk for nephrotoxicity and thus alternative classes of analgesics, including opioids, have become more commonly used for pain control in this population. Given the well-established risks that opioids and other analgesics pose, further characterization of the risk posed by NSAIDs in patients with CKD is warranted. NSAID use has been associated with acute kidney injury, progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate in CKD, electrolyte derangements, and hypervolemia with worsening of heart failure and hypertension. The risk for these nephrotoxicity syndromes is modified by many comorbid conditions, risk factors, and characteristics of use, and in patients with CKD, the risk differs between levels of glomerular filtration rate. In this review, we offer recommendations for the cautious use of NSAIDs in the CKD population after careful consideration of these risk factors on an individualized basis.

### What is known about the health effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use in marathon and ultraendurance running: a scoping review [^116EJtaf]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

This systematic scoping review aimed to understand the extent and scope of evidence on the health risks of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use in marathon and ultraendurance running. NSAIDs are commonly consumed by runners to combat pain and inflammation; however, the health risks of consuming these drugs during marathon and ultrarunning events are currently not fully understood. Four databases (Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus) were searched to identify articles focusing on running events of 26.2 miles or further, and they must have reported on the health risks of NSAID use. There was no restriction on the study design or the date of publication. Thirty studies were ultimately included: 4 randomised controlled trials, 1 cross-sectional study, 11 retrospective reviews, 4 case reports, 1 non-randomised control trial, and 9 prospective observational studies. The literature showed that potential health concerns of NSAID use could be split into five categories: electrolyte balance and hyponatraemia; acute kidney injury (AKI); gastrointestinal disturbances; oxidative stress, inflammation and muscle damage; other medical concerns. None of these sections had clear statistically significant links with NSAID use in ultraendurance running. However, potential links were shown, especially in AKI and electrolyte balance. This review suggests there is very limited evidence to show that NSAIDs have a negative impact on the health of ultrarunning athletes. Indications from a few non-randomised studies of a possible effect on kidney function need exploring with more high-quality research.

### Drug class combination-associated acute kidney injury [^112McvfZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the quality of available evidence of drug class combinations and their association with the development of acute kidney injury (AKI).

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE and Embase databases was completed using the following terms: "risk factor AND (acute kidney injury or acute kidney failure) AND (drug or medication)".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Inclusion criteria were the following: English language, full-text availability, and at least 1 drug-combination. Each citation was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. The literature was evaluated using the quality of evidence component of GRADE. No standardized definition of AKI was applied throughout.

Data Synthesis

Out of 2139 total citations, 151 were assessed for full-text review, with 121 citations (6%) meeting inclusion criteria, producing76 unique drug class combinations. Overall, 56 combinations (73.7%) were considered very low quality; 12 (15.8%) were considered low quality. There were 8 (10.5%) of moderate quality, and no combination was considered high quality. 58 (76%) combinations that had a single citation, with a mean of 1.6 citations per drug class combination. The combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and diuretics was reported in 10 citations, the largest number of citations.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates a lack of well-designed studies addressing drug class combination-associated AKI. The combination of NSAIDs and diuretics with or without additional renin-angiotensin aldosterone agents had the strongest level of evidence. Despite limitations, the information included in this review may result in additional scrutiny about combining certain individual nephrotoxic drugs.

### Cyclooxygenases, the kidney, and hypertension [^111hNpyZ]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors that are in widespread clinical use were developed to avoid side effects of conventional NSAIDs, including gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. However, COX-2 is constitutively expressed in the kidney and is highly regulated in response to alterations in intravascular volume. COX-2 metabolites have been implicated in maintenance of renal blood flow, mediation of renin release, and regulation of sodium excretion. COX-2 inhibition may transiently decrease urine sodium excretion in some subjects and induce mild to moderate elevation of blood pressure. Furthermore, in conditions of relative intravascular volume depletion and/or renal hypoperfusion, interference with COX-2 activity can have deleterious effects on maintenance of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. In addition to physiological regulation of COX-2 expression in the kidney, increased renal cortical COX-2 expression is seen in experimental models associated with altered renal hemodynamics and progressive renal injury (decreased renal mass, poorly controlled diabetes), and long-term treatment with selective COX-2 inhibitors ameliorates functional and structural renal damage in these conditions.

### Update on cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [^113vNFSn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs represent the most commonly used medications for the treatment of pain and inflammation, but numerous well-described side effects can limit their use. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors were initially touted as a therapeutic strategy to avoid not only the gastrointestinal but also the renal and cardiovascular side effects of nonspecific nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, in the kidney, COX-2 is constitutively expressed and is highly regulated in response to alterations in intravascular volume. COX-2 metabolites have been implicated in mediation of renin release, regulation of sodium excretion, and maintenance of renal blood flow. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about both renal and cardiovascular side effects that are attributed to COX-2 selective inhibitors.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^114VbWBx]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology

AKI represents a clinical syndrome, rather than a single disease, with most cases being multifactorial. Commonly implicated mechanisms include (1) oxido-inflammatory stress (for example, hyperoxia or glyco-oxidative injury), (2) renal hypoperfusion (for example, hypotension or anemia), (3) endogenous or exogenous nephrotoxins, and (4) iatrogenic causes (fig. 1). Venous congestion has also been associated with postoperative AKI through multiple potential mechanisms including (1) hypoperfusion, (2) inflammation, (3) oxidative stress, (4) endothelial activation, and (5) sympathetic activation. Administration of nephrotoxic drugs and the need for intravenous contrast also place surgical patients at risk for acute interstitial nephritis and acute tubular damage. Prerenal etiologies, like true volume depletion and volume dysregulation secondary to congestive heart failure, and acute tubular injury from a myriad of insults including nephrotoxic drugs and intravenous contrast, are common mechanisms in the postoperative setting. The surgical environment also introduces the possibility of iatrogenic injury. Examples include ureteral damage in an intraabdominal surgery and emboli from vascular procedures.

Recommendation 2a — nonopioid pharmacological therapies for acute sickle cell disease (SCD) pain states that for adults and children with acute pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests a short course (5 to 7 days) of NSAIDs in addition to opioids for acute pain management (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects). Remarks specify that NSAIDs are defined broadly to include selective and nonselective COX inhibitors; that patient-specific assessment of harms, including renal, vascular, and gastrointestinal toxicity, anticoagulation requirements, and cardiovascular disease, will help identify patients who are appropriate for NSAID therapy and tailor the selection of the drug/class of NSAID; and that patients specifically at increased risk of renal toxicity need to be identified and, if comorbidities such as peptic ulcer disease, renal dysfunction, or full-dose anticoagulation are significant risk factors, the mild potential benefit may not outweigh the risk.

### Etodolac [^11673DKm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease, and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, and who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold risk for developing a GI bleed than patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly of debilitated patients, and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at a greater risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

### Moving toward a contemporary classification of drug-induced kidney disease [^115ZuQ36]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in about 10–15% of hospitalized and more than 50% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Severity of acute and chronic illnesses, iatrogenic exposures, and discrepant AKI definitions lead to variability in prevalence estimates across populations and across studies. Still, mortality rates reach up to 65% in the ICU for patients with AKI.

Clinicians and researchers have classified the heterogeneous etiologies of AKI using "pre-renal", "renal/intra-renal", and "post-renal" categories to explain the nature of the kidney insult. However, this approach fails to account for the overlapping and dynamic nature of AKI due to various etiologies including drugs. For example, a patient with AKI in the context of a decreased effective arterial blood volume from over diuresis — referred to as "pre-renal" AKI, can progress to parenchymal damage if this scenario is prolonged for an extended duration or if another drug such as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administered in combination during this pre-rental state, subsequently referred to as "intra-renal". Leading consensus groups recommend a more explicit and comprehensive AKI classification based on evidence of kidney dysfunction and/or damage. The 10th and 23rd Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) working groups proposed the terms "functional AKI" and "kidney damage" instead of "pre-renal", "renal", and "post-renal". This working group also suggested to exploit both functional and damage kidney biomarkers along with non-kidney biomarkers (e.g. natriuretic peptides, procalcitonin) to better define AKI and characterize its etiologies. Furthermore, the 23rd ADQI expert panel suggested to subcategorize KDIGO stage 1 AKI into 3 substages (1S, 1A, and 1B) and stage 2 and 3 individually into 2 substages (2A & 2B and 3A & 3B, respectively) based on the measurement of functional and damage biomarkers.

### Oxaprozin (daypro) [^1172UVNj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Use of NSAIDs, including DAYPRO, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of DAYPRO use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid DAYPRO use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations, Data).

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus

Use of NSAIDs, including DAYPRO, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment

Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment.

Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of oxaprozin to pregnant rabbits at doses 0.1-times the maximum daily human dose (based on body surface area) resulted in evidence of teratogenicity; however, oral administration of oxaprozin to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose revealed no evidence of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity.

Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

### Comparative risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on CKD [^112eLuEQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

There have been doubts about the association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and worsening kidney function, and whether there is a difference between risks of individual nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is presently unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug exposure and the risk of incident eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² and compare the risks between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug subtypes in the Chinese population.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

From 2008 to 2017, a total of 1,982,488 subjects aged 18 years or older with baseline eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for each patient's baseline characteristics was adopted to examine the association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and incident eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 or eGFR decline ≥ 30% with reference to baseline.

Results

After a median follow-up duration of 6.3 (interquartile range, 3.3–9.4) years, 271,848 cases (14%) of incident eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and 388,386 (21%) events of eGFR decline ≥ 30% were recorded. After adjusting for each patient's baseline characteristics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment was shown to be associated with a significantly higher risk of incident eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.67 to 1.75) and eGFR decline ≥ 30% (hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.89 to 1.96) when compared with no nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, with etoricoxib exhibiting the highest risk of eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (hazard ratio, 3.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.69 to 3.62) and eGFR decline ≥ 30% (hazard ratio, 3.11; 95% confidence interval, 2.78 to 3.48) and ibuprofen displaying the lowest risk of eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.23) and eGFR decline ≥ 30% (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 1.41).

Conclusions

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug exposure was associated with higher risks of incident eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and eGFR decline ≥ 30%. Highest risk was observed in etoricoxib users, and lowest risk was with ibuprofen.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^116qRMqb]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are strongly recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or hand osteoarthritis (OA), and they remain the mainstay of the pharmacologic management of OA. A large number of trials have established their short-term efficacy, and oral NSAIDs are the initial oral medication of choice in the treatment of OA, regardless of anatomic location, and are recommended over all other available oral medications. While the guideline did not address the relative merits of different NSAIDs, there is evidence suggesting that certain agents may have more favorable side effect profiles than others, and safe use includes appropriate patient selection with regular monitoring for potential adverse gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal side effects and potential drug interactions; doses should be as low as possible, and NSAID treatment should be continued for as short a time as possible.

### A community based study of adverse effects of NSAIDS… [^1139mHZV]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, are widely available over the counter in pharmacies, wholesale stores, gas stations, and convenience stores for the treatment of fever and pain. In addition, more than 111 million people in the U. S., including many older Americans, take prescription NSAIDs each year. In certain high-risk patients, NSAIDs can significantly disrupt blood flow to the kidneys and precipitate community-acquired acute kidney injury. CA-AKI can lead to hospitalization, new-onset chronic kidney disease, and more rapid progression of existing chronic kidney disease. Many patients are unaware of NSAID-associated risks and the importance of appropriate use to prevent NSAID-induced CA-AKI. Current patient education materials, including the medication guide, may focus too narrowly on bleeding risks associated with NSAID use and thereby fail to describe the potential for CA-AKI.

Project Description Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences implemented a research project to assess NSAID use and the potential for reducing preventable harm from both prescription and over-the-counter use. The project evaluated adverse renal risks among a large population of patients in primary care settings. An informed community-based pilot program was developed to educate providers, patients, and pharmacists and determine if NSAID risk awareness could be improved. Project Goals
- Evaluate a nationwide cohort of patients in the DARTNet Practice Performance Quality Improvement Registry in collaboration with American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network to determine NSAID prescribing patterns and associated effects on kidney function.
- Develop and implement an innovative community-based NSAID education program to target providers, patients, and pharmacists.
- Evaluate effects of the education program on provider NSAID prescribing patterns and electronic medical record documentation, patient awareness, and pharmacist counseling efforts. Project Results The final report from the researchers to the FDA included the following results:

- Patients exposed to NSAIDS were older, having more co-morbidities and kidney impairment than the general population. Primary care providers commonly prescribed NSAIDS to patients at high risk for NSAID-related kidney injury.
- A majority of patients preferred educational materials in print form. Patients who viewed educational materials in print form achieved higher scores related to NSAID and kidney risk knowledge than those who viewed a video.
- More than half of patients exposed to education materials regarding NSAID-related kidney risks reported they would avoid future NSAID use.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^116sjyWs]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hip and knee osteoarthritis — renal safety with NSAIDs and CKD precautions: There were no differences in renal events between celecoxib and naproxen, but a lower rate of renal events occurred in the celecoxib group versus the ibuprofen group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.44–0.85). The use of NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors should generally be avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially in patients with an eGFR of ≤ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) whose pain is not controlled with other non-NSAID treatments, potential risks and benefits of NSAIDs should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^116bgxqN]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest investigation of real-world use of prescription analgesics among older adults with and without CKD in the US, covering 2006 to 2015. Use of analgesics, particularly opioids, was high in the Medicare CKD population, increasing substantially between 2006 and 2013, then stabilizing or decreasing slightly thereafter. A higher proportion of opioid vs prescription NSAID use was found in patients with CKD compared with non-CKD Medicare beneficiaries. As expected, cumulative use of analgesics, both opioids and prescription NSAIDs, decreased with CKD progression. This prescription pattern could be associated with patients with advanced CKD being more susceptible to toxic effects and adverse effects in the setting of reduced kidney function. Additionally, NSAIDs were widely used in earlier stages of CKD while opioids were more frequently used in patients with advanced CKD. This finding may reflect both the variation in severity of pain by CKD stage, as opioids are typically used to treat moderate to severe pain, and avoidance of NSAIDs in patients with more advanced CKD, in whom risk of progression is higher with use of this class of medication owing to the inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on prostaglandin synthesis in the kidneys, with resultant potential for intrakidney ischemia.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^112iWAFa]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

NSAID-induced kidney injury risk in CKD and general populations — observational and meta-analytic data: Observational studies demonstrate that nephrotoxic risks of NSAIDs are modest, somewhat predictable, and may be less than risks associated with alternative medications. Patients at higher risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) include those with heart failure, cirrhosis, CKD, or dehydration, and those on RAASi, diuretics, or calcineurin inhibitors. In non-CKD populations, studies are conflicting, with some finding no association with incident CKD and others showing increased relative risk with risk generally increasing based on intensity or duration of NSAID exposure; although larger recent studies show a consistent trend toward increased incident CKD, the absolute risks are small when reported. One report demonstrated an excess of 17 CKD events per 100,000 exposed Active-Duty U.S. service members. In patients with pre-existing CKD, a meta-analysis supported increased risk of NSAID-associated AKI with HR of 1.7 and an absolute risk of 4% in NSAID exposed versus non-exposed individuals; however, individual trial estimates varied by an order of magnitude (e.g. OR: 1.05 to 5.25), so pooled averages should be interpreted with skepticism.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^111NimAT]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Renal Risks

In addition to the GI and CV effects of NSAIDs, epidemiological and pathologic data also associate NSAID use with the potential for both acute and chronic kidney disease (CKD).–Renal side effects which include sodium and water retention with edema, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury may precipitate renal failure resulting in acute dialysis. Risk factors include older age, renal impairment, heart failure, liver disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), and concurrent prescription with antihypertensive drugs (eg, diuretics, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors). Again, mechanisms of NSAID-induced kidney damage relate to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and are dose- and duration-dependent. Low levels of COX-2 are constitutively expressed in the macula densa, with COX-2 inhibition leading to a reduction in renal blood flow and resulting functional impairment. NSAIDs may also accumulate in renal tubular cells during secretion. While NSAID-induced sodium retention is COX-2-mediated, NSAID-induced reductions in glomerular filtration rate are mediated via COX-1.

Consistent with the dual COX-1/COX-2-dependent mechanisms, which predict the possibility of differences in renal toxicity for different NSAIDs, there are limited data to suggest clinically relevant differences. In the MEDAL program, etoricoxib had a greater risk of renovascular adverse events than diclofenac. In PRECISION, the risk of renal events was significantly lower with celecoxib compared with ibuprofen, and was similar for celecoxib compared with naproxen. In a meta-analysis, NSAIDs with high COX-2 selectivity had a lower association with acute kidney injury (AKI) compared to NSAIDs with low COX-2 selectivity. Overall, NSAIDs have a low but tangible risk in causing AKI, electrolyte imbalances and increased BP, but their role in progressive kidney disease is associated only with long-term use in high cumulative doses. In patients with CKD, withdrawal of NSAID use is recommended by nephrology consensus groups, but initiation of alternatives such as opioids conveys different and no less important drug-related concerns. In a study conducted in China that included age- and sex-matched controls of NSAID users, long-term (≥ 48 months) use of NSAIDs was independently associated with reduced renal function. It is recommended that patients with risk factors for renal impairment have preventative strategies in place that include using the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest possible time, as well as monitoring renal function, fluid retention and electrolyte abnormalities. The concomitant use of NSAIDs and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be avoided.

### Association of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescriptions with kidney disease among active young and middle-aged adults [^1167iqBD]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

We have identified modest but statistically significant associations between the highest level of observed NSAID exposure and incident AKI and CKD among active, largely healthy adults in the military. While recognizing that the pain burden in such active populations must be managed using the best-available measures, given the relatively high mean DDD per prescription we observed, providing lower doses is one approach to those with pain and/or inflammation. The increases in kidney disease risk that we observed for modifiable factors, such as body mass index and hypertension, reinforce the established importance of managing these conditions, regardless of patient age.

### Literature review: are NSAIDs harmful and is acetaminophen well tolerated? [^116mPu3s]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

On the basis of previous literature, NSAID use is typically avoided in patients at risk for kidney disease, while acetaminophen has generally been considered well tolerated. However, the extent of NSAID effect on the kidneys is not clear, especially in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the concerns about the safety of acetaminophen have been rising. In this review, we will discuss the latest evidence of the effects of NSAIDs and acetaminophen in the context of nephrology and hypertension.

Recent Findings

The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) by NSAIDs is higher with longer courses and in the presence of several factors such as older age, diabetes mellitus, lower eGFR, diuretic use and cardiovascular disease. The timing of NSAID use in relation to the onset of AKI may affect its progression. Regular NSAID use could be associated with an increased incidence of CKD, but the relation between NSAID use and CKD progression is less clear. Regular acetaminophen use was associated with increased SBP, while its use could have a renoprotective effect in certain situations.

Summary

In patients at risk of kidney disease, NSAIDs may be used cautiously after discussing possible adverse effects. Regular acetaminophen use should be reassessed in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111o6Ck2]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The study strengths include careful study selection and the use of a structured quality assessment tool to ensure that only high quality studies were included. The observed associations were consistent across subgroups, but the study has several limitations. As with all systematic reviews, the findings depend on the quality of the included studies. We chose to review and meta-analyse observational studies because an initial literature search identified that trials of NSAIDs rarely report renal outcomes (the focus of this study) and exclude people with CKD (a key topic of interest) and other comorbidities as well as older people and minority groups. However, observational studies are vulnerable to residual confounding by measured and unmeasured variables. An example is confounding by indication, which in this context is likely to occur if prescribers avoid NSAIDs in people they perceive to be at higher risk of NSAID toxicity including AKI, which would lead to an underestimation of AKI risk if present. There were also large differences between studies in the population examined and the way in which AKI was measured, both of which likely contributed to the observed moderate to large heterogeneity between studies. It is also important to recognise that the estimate of the risk of NSAIDs in the general population is adjusted for potential confounders, but the estimate in people with CKD is not because only one study reported an adjusted estimate. Other limitations include that we only included studies published in English, that there were a relatively small number of studies suitable for inclusion which made meta-regression to explore heterogeneity unfeasible, and that the rate of concomitant use of OTC NSAID use could not be assessed in the populations studied. Seven of the included studies addressed that OCT NSAID use may have caused exposure misclassification. But all of the studies believed that due to reasons such as financial incentives, the proportion of OCT NSAID users is expected to be small and nondifferential with respect to the NSAID categories the populations studied. Consequently, it would bias the results toward the null. As most of the studies confirmed eligible cases then selected controls according to a certain proportion, non-response rate was not given in the majority of the included studies. Since cases and controls of these studies were derived from the same databases, were examined for the same exposure and followed up in the same way, then non-response rate is not considered to be a problem and therefore it is unlikely there would be missing data bias. We were unable to access publication bias because of the extensive statistical heterogeneity. For many of the methodological qualities assessed there was an unclear risk of bias as studies did not provide explicit detail to make an informed judgement.

### Adverse renal effects of anti-inflammatory agents: evaluation of selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors [^112RT61P]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), i.e. nonselective cyclooxygenase COX inhibitors have well-documented nephrotoxicity. Adverse renal effects occur because of inhibition of the synthesis of cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandins which act to modulate pathologic processes that would normally impair various renal functions. The introduction of the selective COX-2 inhibitors raised hope that this class of drugs would reduce injury in both the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys. Animal and human data, however, suggest that COX-2 synthesized prostaglandins are important in the modulation of renal physiology during adverse conditions. Hence, it appears that these drugs are equal in causing nephrotoxicity as the nonselective COX inhibitors.

### Ibuprofen oral (ibuprofen) [^115s1xox]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

Advanced Renal Disease

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of ibuprofen in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with ibuprofen is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If ibuprofen therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^1138PpkB]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Opioids versus NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease (CKD) not requiring dialysis — associations with outcomes and utilization: In a prospective cohort followed for a median of 6.8 years, baseline full-agonist opioid and NSAID use were 9.9% and 15.5% respectively; baseline opioid use was associated with increased risk for a kidney disease composite outcome, kidney failure requiring KRT, hospitalization, and death, whereas baseline NSAID use was associated with increased risk for the kidney disease composite outcome and hospitalization, with outcomes not consistent among subgroups, and overall opioid use had a stronger association with adverse effects than NSAIDs. Given benefits and risks, some reviews now recommend considering cautious time-limited use of NSAIDs with consideration of individual risk factors, SDM, and careful monitoring.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^111MdUsT]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.10.1

We recommend that non-steroidal anti-inflammatories should not be given (1C).

Rationale

Given that the risk of renal side effects from short-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients without pre-existing risk factors is considered to be rare, NSAIDs are currently recommended in the postpartum period for perineal pain when paracetamol provides insufficient relief of symptoms. Although the risk profile of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is considered to be different in CKD, evidence supporting this is mixed. Historical case-control studies show an increased rate of kidney injury and progression to end stage renal disease in patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In contrast, data from older-age cohorts taking high-dose NSAIDS are conflicting, Questionnaire data from a female cohort showed no measurable association between NSAID use and renal function decline over 11 years, although the mean eGFR at study commencement was 88 ml/min/1.73 m². There are no data examining non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use in women of reproductive age with risk factors for renal disease progression, in the context of peripartum haemodynamic change. The guideline committee therefore endorses existing recommendations that NSAIDs should be contraindicated in women with a (pre-pregnancy) eGFR < 30mls/min/1.73m 2 (estimated to be equivalent to serum creatinine > 150 μmol/L in pregnancy), and should be avoided where possible in all those with renal impairment due to the possibility of sodium and water retention and a deterioration in renal function.

### NSAID use and progression of chronic kidney disease [^113hfbmU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The effects of nonselective and selective cyclooxygenase-2 specific (COX-2) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use on the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncertain. Due to the high prevalence of both CKD and NSAID use in older adults, we sought to determine the association between NSAID use and the progression of CKD in an elderly community-based cohort.

Methods

All subjects ≥ 66 years of age who had at least one serum creatinine measurement in 2 time periods (July-December, 2001 and July-December, 2003) were included. Multiple logistic regression analyses, including covariates for age, sex, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), diabetes, and comorbidity were used to explore the associations of NSAID use on the primary (decrease in eGFR of ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73) and secondary (mean change in eGFR) outcomes.

Results

A total of 10,184 subjects (mean age 76 years; 57% female) were followed for a median of 2.75 years. High-dose NSAID users (upper decile of cumulative NSAID exposure) experienced a 26% increased risk for the primary outcome (odds ratio [OR] 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.53). A linear association between cumulative NSAID dose and change in mean GFR also was seen. No risk differential was identified between selective and nonselective NSAID users.

Conclusions

High cumulative NSAID exposure is associated with an increased risk for rapid CKD progression in the setting of a community-based elderly population. For older adult patients with CKD, these results suggest that nonselective NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors should be used cautiously and chronic exposure to any NSAID should be avoided.

### Diclofenac potassium (Zipsor) [^112STsa8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Use of NSAIDs, including ZIPSOR, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of ZIPSOR use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid ZIPSOR use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations, Data).

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus

Use of NSAIDs, including ZIPSOR, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the

risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment

Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of

fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment.

Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive.

In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of malformations was observed in mice, rats, and rabbits given diclofenac during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 1, 1, and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of ZIPSOR, despite the presence of maternal and fetal toxicity at these doses. In published studies, administration of clinically relevant doses of diclofenac to pregnant rats produced adverse effects on brain, kidney, and testicular development [see Data]. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses.

### High prevalence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use among acute kidney injury survivors in the Southern community cohort study [^115ZAQht]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, regular NSAID use is common (20%) among socioeconomically disadvantaged AKI survivors. The high prevalence of an avoidable risk factor in a group at high risk for both kidney and cardiovascular events is concerning and underscores the need to better understand the association between NSAID use in this population and future adverse events and in whom the risks are highest, as well as the reasons for use and effective strategies to improve education and awareness among physicians, patients and caregivers.

### Celecoxib [^113c8s8k]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE inhibitors or the ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of celecoxib may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating celecoxib. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of celecoxib [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If celecoxib is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions

Celecoxib has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to celecoxib and in patients with aspirin sensitive asthma. Celecoxib is a sulfonamide and both NSAIDs and sulfonamides may cause allergic type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Seek emergency help if any anaphylactic reaction occurs.

Results

Study flow and characteristics

Electronic searches retrieved 4629 citations, with 3789 unique citations screened and four studies identified from other sources (Fig. 1). After title and abstract screening 30 full-text studies were reviewed of which 10 studies published between 1990 and 2012 met the inclusion and quality criteria and were included (details for excluding were recorded in Additional file 3). All 10 studies examined NSAID-associated AKI risk in the general population with a total of 1,609,163 participants. Five of these studies also provided data in the subset of people with CKD. Eighty percent of studies were rated with seven or more stars out of a possible nine on the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (Table 1). Hence the quality of the included studies was considered to be medium to high.

Fig. 1
Flow diagram of the identification process for eligible studies

In all included studies, eligible cases with AKI were recruited in a defined catchment area over a defined period of time, the ascertainment of exposure was through secure electronic records and the same method of ascertainment was used among cases and controls. Eighty percent of the included studies had independent validation of cases while the remaining 20% relied on record linkage alone (ICD codes in database) with no reference to the primary record. One study used hospital controls as their cases were people with community exposure to NSAIDs admitted to hospital with AKI. Two studies used a mixture of hospitalized and community controls. The other included studies selected controls from community or reported hospital and community controls separately in which case only comparisons with community controls were included. The history of outcome occurrence in cases and controls were adequate in 90% of the studies. Two included studies did not match for age and other factors among cases and controls while one of them adjusted for a list of confounders including sex and use of prescription of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in current use of any NSAID.

### Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (truvada) [^116Np5vP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3	New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment

Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of TDF, a component of TRUVADA [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Prior to initiation and during use of TRUVADA, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all individuals. In individuals with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus.

TRUVADA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.

Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures, and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in individuals at risk of renal dysfunction.

Treatment of HIV-1 Infection

Dosing interval adjustment of TRUVADA and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with estimated creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received TRUVADA using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of TRUVADA therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity. TRUVADA is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min or patients requiring hemodialysis.

HIV-1 PrEP

TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP is not recommended in uninfected individuals with estimated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min. If a decrease in estimated creatinine clearance is observed while using TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP, evaluate potential causes and re-assess potential risks and benefits of continued use [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

We therefore used data on the total active-duty US Army to estimate the independent associations between prescribed oral NSAID use and incident acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Renal effects of NSAIDs have been shown to be dose dependent. Increased frequency and duration of NSAID use amplify the risk of nonrenal adverse effects. Accordingly, we devised methods to study NSAID exposure volume over time while controlling for major factors of potential relevance to kidney dysfunction.

### Mitigating the cardiovascular and renal effects of NSAIDs [^114rB8fW]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are principal pharmacologic agents for symptom relief in patients with arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. Cardiovascular risk is associated with all NSAIDs, excluding aspirin. Selective inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX)-2 could produce a relative reduction in endothelial production of prostacyclin, while leaving the platelet production of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) intact. It has been speculated that this imbalance of homeostatic prostanoids might increase the risk for thrombotic events. The goal of this review is to provide physicians guidelines to mitigate cardiovascular and nephrotoxicity of NSAIDs.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature review to determine what information is available to guide treatment decisions in this patient population.

Results

Selective inhibition of COX-2 could produce a relative reduction in endothelial production of prostacyclin, while leaving the platelet production of TXA2 intact. Increasing degrees of selectivity for COX-2 are associated with augmented cardiovascular risk, whereas increasing degrees of selectivity for cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-1) are associated with augmented gastrointestinal risk. Some NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen) can interfere with the cardioprotective effects of aspirin by competitively binding to COX-1 enzyme, resulting in increased TXA2 production Naproxen may differ from other NSAIDs in sustaining functionally important degrees of inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 activity throughout the dosing interval.

Conclusion

It is of paramount importance to consider individual health factors when choosing therapy with NSAIDs.

### Ibuprofen-associated renal dysfunction… [^11176MPk]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Ibuprofen-associated, acute, reversible renal failure with hyperkalemia, tubular necrosis, and proteinuria developed in a patient who had no predisposing underlying disease. A renal biopsy specimen revealed mesangial hypercellularity without glomerular crescent formation. A profound interstitial nephritis with focal inflammatory cell infiltrates of predominantly mononuclear cells and neutrophils as well as focal tubular destruction was seen. Vasculitis was not observed. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the light microscopic diagnosis of a tubulointerstitial nephritis and, in addition, indicated the presence of electron-dense mesangial and subepithelial deposits. Direct immunofluorescence examination showed diffuse mesangial IgM and C3 deposition as well as vascular C3 deposition. Renal failure rapidly resolved after discontinuation of ibuprofen therapy and initiation of steroid therapy, with return to normal levels of serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, potassium, and sodium.

Proteinuria also resolved. Marasco WA, Gikas PW, Azziz-Baumgartner R, Hyzy R, Eldredge CJ, Stross J. Ibuprofen-Associated Renal Dysfunction: Pathophysiologic Mechanisms of Acute Renal Failure, Hyperkalemia, Tubular Necrosis, and Proteinuria. Arch Intern Med. 1987; 147: 2107–2116.

### Specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors: what have we learned since they came into widespread clinical use? [^115DDHmb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 were introduced into widespread clinical use in 1999. Since that time, celecoxib and rofecoxib have become two of the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States. Clinical trials using these medications for arthritis and pain have uniformly demonstrated efficacy superior to that of placebo and similar to that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, controversy surrounding the proper place of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in the hierarchy of treatment for arthritis continues, based primarily on their higher cost compared with that of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A decreased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity remains the primary justification for using the more expensive cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in preference to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The renal and cardiovascular effects of rofecoxib and celecoxib have been investigated in relation to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and to one another. The data with respect to alteration in renal function, lower extremity edema, and hypertension indicates that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors affect the kidney in a manner similar to that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The data comparing the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors is difficult to interpret because it is not clear that comparable doses have been used in clinical trials. The potential thrombogenic risk of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors remains controversial, and conflicting data exist. It remains important to increase our understanding of the place of these agents in clinical practice from the perspective of efficacy, toxicity, and cost.

### Analgesic use and associated adverse events in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ELWoL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Treating pain in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging because of altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with an increased risk of toxicity and drug adverse events in this population. The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to assess the prevalence of analgesic use and establish the risk of analgesics-related adverse events, in patients with CKD.

Methods

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL were searched until January 2021. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression were conducted to pool and summarise prevalence data and measures of association between analgesic use and adverse events.

Results

Sixty-two studies relevant to the prevalence of analgesic use and 33 to analgesic-related adverse events were included, combining data on 2.3 and 3 million individuals, respectively. Pooled analyses found that 41% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35–48) of the CKD population regularly use analgesia. The annual period prevalence was estimated at 50% for opioids and 21% for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Overall, 20% and 7% of patients with CKD are on chronic opioid or NSAID therapy, respectively. Opioid use was associated with an increased risk of death (1.61; 95% CI, 1.12–2.31; n = 7, I² = 91%), hospitalisation (1.38; 95% CI, 1.32–1.45; n = 2, I² = 0%), and fractures (1.51; 95% CI, 1.16–1.96; n = 3, I² = 54%).

Conclusion

High levels of analgesic consumption and related serious adverse outcomes were found in patients with CKD. Consideration needs to be given to how these patients are assessed and managed in order to minimise harms and improve outcomes.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113wfE6S]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this study is the first meta-analysis to examine associations between NSAID exposure and AKI in the general community-dwelling population and people with CKD. A previous systematic review which was conducted in 2014 included five observational studies and reported risk of AKI by individual NSAID exposure, finding a statistically significant elevated AKI risk among most of the traditional NSAIDs but did not achieve a statistical significance for COX-2 inhibitors or traditional NSAIDs with higher COX-2 selectivity (meloxicam and diclofenac). Our study used a more comprehensive search and included additional studies, and found a similar estimate of pooled risk but statistically significantly increased risk irrespective of COX-2 selectivity. Another systematic review specifically focused on myocardial, vascular and renal risks of COX-2-selective meloxicam allowed a broad definition of renal outcomes and it did not find a significantly increased renal risk. A third systematic review examined the risk of CKD progression associated with NSAID use, finding that high (but not standard) dose NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of CKD progression.

### Oxaprozin (coxanto) [^1121t1b6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Use of NSAIDs, including COXANTO, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of COXANTO use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid COXANTO use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations, Data).

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus

Use of NSAIDs, including COXANTO, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment

Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment.

Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of oxaprozin to pregnant rabbits at doses 0.1 times the maximum daily human dose (based on body surface area) resulted in evidence of teratogenicity; however, oral administration of oxaprozin to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses 0.2 times and 1.6 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively, revealed no evidence of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity. In rat reproduction studies in which oxaprozin was administered through late gestation failure to deliver and a reduction in live birth index was observed at a dose 1.6 times the maximum recommended human dose (based on body surface area). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as oxaprozin, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

### Effects of peri-operative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on post-operative kidney function for adults with normal kidney function [^11592NKf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide effective analgesia during the post-operative period but can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) when used peri-operatively (at or around the time of surgery). This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2007.

Objectives

This review looked at the effect of NSAIDs used in the peri-operative period on post-operative kidney function in patients with normal kidney function.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 4 January 2018 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at the use of NSAIDs versus placebo for the treatment of post-operative pain in patients with normal kidney function were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out independently by two authors as was assessment of risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by a third author. Dichotomous outcomes are reported as relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) together with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Meta-analyses were used to assess the outcomes of AKI, change in serum creatinine (SCr), urine output, renal replacement therapy (RRT), death (all causes) and length of hospital stay.

Main Results

We identified 26 studies (8835 participants). Risk of bias was high in 17, unclear in 6and low in three studies. There was high risk of attrition bias in six studies. Only two studies measured AKI. The use of NSAIDs had uncertain effects on the incidence of AKI compared to placebo (7066 participants: RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.40 to 7.96; I² = 59%; very low certainty evidence). One study was stopped early by the data monitoring committee due to increased rates of AKI in the NSAID group. Moreover, both of these studies were examining NSAIDs for indications other than analgesia and therefore utilised relatively low doses. Compared to placebo, NSAIDs may slightly increase serum SCr (15 studies, 794 participants: MD 3.23 μmol/L, 95% CI -0.80 to 7.26; I² = 63%; low certainty evidence). Studies displayed moderate to high heterogeneity and had multiple exclusion criteria including age and so were not representative of patients undergoing surgery. Three of these studies excluded patients if their creatinine rose post-operatively.NSAIDs may make little or no difference to post-operative urine output compared to placebo (6 studies, 149 participants: SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.27). No reliable conclusions could be drawn from these studies due to the differing units of measurements and measurement time points. It is uncertain whether NSAIDs leads to the need for RRT because the certainty of this evidence is very low (2 studies, 7056 participants: RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.07; I² = 26%); there were few events and the results were inconsistent. It is uncertain whether NSAIDs lead to more deaths (2 studies, 312 participants: RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 11.12; I² = 38%) or increased the length of hospital stay (3 studies, 410 participants: MD 0.12 days, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.72; I² = 24%).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall NSAIDs had uncertain effects on the risk of post-operative AKI, may slightly increase post-operative SCr, and it is uncertain whether NSAIDs lead to the need for RRT, death or increases the length of hospital stay. The available data therefore does not confirm the safety of NSAIDs in patients undergoing surgery. Further larger studies using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definition for AKI including patients with co-morbidities are required to confirm these findings.

### Need to develop new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug formulations [^115QnTHV]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In the management of pain, primary care physicians are often the first to diagnose and treat acute or chronic painful conditions. This places them in an important intersection to manage pain, in which safe and effective therapeutic options are paramount for their patients. For decades, NSAIDs have been routinely prescribed for relief of mild to moderate acute and chronic pain. Yet, safety and tolerability concerns associated with the use of this class of drugs continue to be an issue for patients and clinicians.

Objective

The objective of this review was to discuss the unmet medical needs of patients in the management of pain and inflammation, review the dose-dependent safety data associated with use of NSAIDs, and discuss the need to develop new NSAID formulations to improve safety and tolerability while maintaining efficacy.

Methods

We performed literature searches of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases through December 2012 for articles in English that reported dose-dependent safety and tolerability data associated with use of NSAIDs.

Results

The risk of serious, dose-dependent adverse events involving the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and kidneys is associated with use of NSAIDs. On the basis of these findings, the US Food and Drug Administration has requested that the package insert for all NSAIDs be revised to include a boxed warning highlighting the potential increased risk of cardiovascular events and the risk of serious, and potentially life-threatening, gastrointestinal tract bleeding. While using lower dosages of a particular NSAID may be associated with lower rates of adverse events, maintaining the clinical efficacy of standard NSAID dosages remains a challenge.

Conclusions

There is a need to develop new and effective NSAID formulations to minimize the safety and tolerability concerns associated with currently available NSAIDs, yet maintain efficacy in management of inflammation and pain.

Data extraction and quality/validity assessment

Data were extracted into a standardised form and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer. When data were reported in strata, the data were extracted as separate subgroups. The following data were extracted for each included study: author, publication year, study design, population (data source, sample size, location, age, gender and underlying renal conditions), definition of AKI, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, medication exposure (type of NSAID), period and length of NSAID usage, number of people who were and were not exposed to NSAIDs, as well as crude unadjusted and adjusted associations between NSAID use and outcomes. The quality of the included studies was evaluated in three domains using the validated Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort and case-control studies, with each item rated as either one star or missing (Table 1). Disagreements were resolved by discussions with two authors (XZ and BG) and a third reviewer was involved where required (PTD).

### Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-related injury to the gastrointestinal tract: clinical picture, pathogenesis, and prevention [^116u2NJC]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Increasing life expectancy in developed countries has led to a growing prevalence of arthritic disorders, which has been accompanied by increasing prescriptions for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These are the most widely used agents for musculoskeletal and arthritic conditions. Although NSAIDs are effective, their use is associated with a broad spectrum of adverse reactions in the liver, kidney, cardiovascular system, skin, and gut. Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects are the most common. The dilemma for the physician prescribing NSAIDs is, therefore, to maintain the antiinflammatory and analgesic benefits, while reducing or preventing GI side effects. The challenge is to develop safer NSAIDs by shifting from a focus on GI toxicity to the increasingly more appreciated cardiovascular toxicity.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug nephrotoxicity… [^111djoPB]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Various nephrotoxicity syndromes are seen with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The most common is reversible, hemodynamically mediated renal insufficiency. The role of prostaglandin inhibition by NSAIDs is discussed in the context of renal prostaglandin physiology. Potential differences among NSAIDs are reviewed. The "renal sparing" effect of sulindac may be attributable to the relative preservation of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Salsalate, although anti-inflammatory, demonstrates weak prostaglandin inhibition at therapeutic doses. A framework is developed for the clinical application of these considerations. Along a continuum of increasing risk factors for NSAID nephrotoxicity, or increasing NSAID dose, there likely exists a therapeutic window where differences among NSAIDs are most relevant.

### Nabumetone [^11278JAP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:

Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis.

Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain.

Animal Data

In animal reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not demonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no adequate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nabumetone should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as nabumetone, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Association between NSAID exposure and AKI in the general population

Ten studies that included a total of 1,609,163 participants were used to evaluate AKI risk among current NSAID users in the general population (Fig. 2). The adjusted OR for AKI was increased relative to non-users and between individual studies ranged from 1.05 to 4.10, with eight of the ten studies showing a statistically significant association between NSAID exposure and AKI. Meta-analysis of adjusted odds ratios estimated the pooled OR to be 1.73 (95%CI 1.44–2.07). Heterogeneity was substantial (I 2 = 89%, P < 0.001), suggesting that the pooled estimate should be interpreted with caution.

Association between NSAID exposure and AKI in people with CKD

Two case-control and three nested-case-control studies which included 106,681 people with CKD reported data that could be used to evaluate AKI risk by current NSAID exposure. The crude OR for AKI in NSAID users compared with nonusers ranged from 1.12 to 5.25 and was > 1 and statistically significant in 4 of 5 studies (Fig. 2). The pooled crude OR was 1.63 (95% CI 1.22–2.19) and I 2 statistic was 71% (P = 0.009). We noted weaker associations with AKI in larger studies with more precise estimates of risk, with the two studies reporting the largest risks being older, smaller and less precisely estimated.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) route and duration — risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia in older adults and patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD): Observational analyses examining the first 30 days after a newly prescribed topical, short course (< 14 days), or longer course NSAID found in older adults that both topical (OR: 1.48) and short-course oral NSAIDs (OR: 1.59) were associated with increased risk at 30 days; a similar analysis reported adjusted odds for AKI or hyperkalemia at 30 days of 1.29 for topical NSAIDs, 1.43 for systemic NSAIDs of < 15 days, and 1.84 for systemic NSAIDs of ≥ 15 days, with incrementally higher odds with oral and prolonged administration. Among patients with CKD, topical and oral NSAIDs (compared with no NSAID prescription) were associated with AKI (OR: 1.38 and 1.77 respectively), and moderate and severe AKI were increased with oral NSAIDs but not topical NSAIDs. While each analysis attempted to control for confounders, it is unclear how much residual confounding by indication remains, and the literature suggests that the risk of adverse kidney outcomes is decreased (but likely not eliminated) by use of topical rather than oral NSAIDs.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116up4JP]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

There is little evidence about the risk of AKI associated with NSAID use in people with CKD available from randomised trials of NSAIDs because such trials routinely exclude people with CKD and rarely report renal outcomes. Under these circumstances, observational evidence provides the best guide to practice that exists. The aim of this study is to systematically review published high-quality population-based observational studies to quantify the risk of AKI due to NSAIDs in the general population and in people with pre-existing CKD.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^115heYoE]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that there has been substantial use of opioids and prescription NSAIDs among older patients with CKD in the US with a clear increasing trend until recently, with early suggestion of decreasing use, perhaps due to the recent heightened awareness of the opioid epidemic in the US. Clinicians must continue evaluating benefits and risks of using opioids and NSAIDs in this and other patient populations. Specifically, clear clinical guidelines for chronic pain management among patients aged 65 years and older with CKD may be warranted to address potentially suboptimal pain management in this patient population.

### Gestational exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of chronic kidney disease in childhood [^115yQXke]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem affecting more than 10% of the general population worldwide. Human nephron formation occurs at approximately weeks 5 to 36 of gestation. Exposure to an adverse maternal environment during fetal development may increase the risk of CKD later in life. Therefore, addressing the use of nephrotoxic medications during pregnancy is crucial for both maternal and fetal health.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as indomethacin, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and can reduce uterine contractions to delay preterm delivery. However, the US Food and Drug Administration recommends avoiding NSAIDs after 20 weeks of pregnancy due to the risk of oligohydramnios, kidney damage, and premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 are key isoform enzymes in prostaglandin synthesis, and they have overlapping roles in physiologic functions. Currently, the safety of selectivity of COX inhibitors on long-term kidney outcomes in children exposed to NSAIDs during pregnancy remains uncertain.

Pregnant people commonly use NSAIDs as analgesics, with their use steadily increasing in Western countries from 1993 to 2013. Approximately 84% of pregnant people reported using over-the-counter NSAIDs during the first trimester. To address the knowledge regarding NSAID-related fetal nephrotoxicity, this study aimed to evaluate the association between NSAID exposure during different trimesters of pregnancy and the risk of CKD in childhood.

### Lifetime nonnarcotic analgesic use and decline in renal function in women… [^112WBLrj]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Background Analgesics are commonly used and may impair kidney function. However, limited prospective information is available on the long-term effects of aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and acetaminophen on renal function. Methods. Conclusions Higher lifetime use of aspirin and NSAIDs is not associated with renal function decline, but high acetaminophen use may increase the risk of loss of renal function. The absolute risk of renal function decline due to even high lifetime analgesic intake seems to be modest. Analgesic use is common in the general population, particularly among women. 1 Analgesics may impair kidney function by altering prostaglandin production, 2 causing interstitial nephritis, 3 or potentially through a direct toxic effect on the tubular epithelium. However, limited and inconsistent information is available on the long-term effects of aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and acetaminophen on renal function.

A recent large case-control study4 found a greater than 2-fold increased risk of newly diagnosed chronic renal insufficiency for regular users of acetaminophen or aspirin but not for NSAID users. Three previous cohort studies examined the association between analgesic use and change in renal function. The prospective Swiss watch factory study5 found an increased risk with phenacetin use, but aspirin use was not associated with an increased plasma creatinine level. In 11 years, we observed no association between lifetime use of aspirin or NSAIDs and risk of renal function decline, even in women who had consumed 3000 g or more of the drug. In contrast, women who had consumed 100 g or more of acetaminophen in their lifetime seemed to have a statistically significantly greater risk of losing an important proportion of their renal function compared with women who had consumed less than 100 g.

Published results of the association between NSAID use and risk of renal dysfunction have been inconsistent. These drugs have well-documented acute effects on the kidney, including decreased GFR; diminished ability to excrete sodium, potassium, and water; and interstitial nephritis with glomerular changes. 3 Although some case-control studies13, 15 found an increased risk, our findings are consistent with the recent studies4, 7 that found that NSAID use is not associated with risk of chronic renal dysfunction.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^11366CiG]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

NSAID safety in chronic kidney disease (CKD) emphasizes that concomitant use of multiple agents that affect kidney hemodynamics (e.g. RAASi, diuretics, SGLT2i, finerenone) as well as volume depletion may further increase the risk of NSAID-induced AKI; consider increasing frequency of eGFR monitoring with NSAID use, especially if prolonged or high-dose. Risks of NSAIDs are likely to outweigh benefits where there is evidence of little to no benefit (e.g., chronic primary musculoskeletal or wide-spread pain syndromes); determine meaningful functional targets for the patient, using SDM, prior to a trial of NSAID therapy, and proactively educate the patients on risks of NSAIDs, both OTC and prescribed, noting that patients may use OTC NSAIDs without discussion with a provider.

Additionally, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers can lead to a "functional" AKI (defined as an increase in serum creatinine). The prospective Translational Research Investigating Biomarker Endpoints for Acute Kidney Injury (TRIBE-AKI) study demonstrated that the graded increase in functional AKI (continued angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker greater than held angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker greater than no angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker use) was not accompanied by "structural" AKI (no difference in AKI risk between the three exposure groups, as assessed by four different urinary biomarkers for AKI). The results of a study can be dramatically altered based upon how AKI is defined (serum creatinine changes vs. biomarkers), and this discrepancy may be especially pronounced in patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. This study demonstrates that a rise in serum creatinine is not always accompanied by tissue damage (and tissue damage does not always result in rising serum creatinine, i.e. subclinical AKI), highlighting one of the major limitations of serum creatinine as a biomarker.

Management of NSAIDs

NSAIDs have been used to effectively mitigate postoperative pain while decreasing the opioid requirement.NSAIDs can adversely affect renal via prostaglandin mediated afferent arteriolar dilation, which causes reduced glomerular perfusion, leading to acute interstitial nephritis. Drug-associated acute interstitial nephritis presents a cell-mediated immune response, characterized by acute loss of kidney function, interstitial infiltrates, edema, and tubulitis on biopsy (with relative sparing of glomerulus and vasculature). Because of this risk, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (London, United Kingdom) has recommend that NSAIDs be avoided in hypovolemic patients; however, best practices in low-risk patients remain unresolved. A 2018 meta-analysis found that although NSAIDs led to a slight increase in serum creatinine, this was of unclear clinical significance, and no reliable conclusions could be drawn regarding the association between NSAIDs and renal replacement therapy, hospital length of stay, or death. A secondary analysis of data from the Restrictive versus Liberal Fluid Therapy in Major Abdominal Surgery (RELIEF) trial found that intraoperative NSAID or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor use was significantly associated with increased postoperative AKI, supporting the need for a randomized trial to better define the risk–benefit balance of these perioperative analgesic adjuncts. Emerging proteomic research sheds light on the molecular pathways, specifically differences in prostaglandin synthesis, driving NSAID-attributed AKI in the perioperative space.

### Salsalate [^117LhRWv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Carcinogenesis

No long-term animal studies have been performed with salsalate to evaluate its carcinogenic potential.

Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Use of NSAIDs, including salsalate, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of salsalate use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid salsalate use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations, Data).

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus

Use of NSAIDs, including salsalate, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment

Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment.

Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2% to 4% for major malformations, and 15% to 20% for pregnancy loss. Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not demonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as [active moiety], resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses.

### Efficacy and safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of acute pain after orthopedic trauma: a practice management guideline from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma and the orthopedic trauma association [^1175pJGz]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Fracture is a common injury after a traumatic event. The efficacy and safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat acute pain related to fractures is not well established.

Methods

Clinically relevant questions were determined regarding NSAID use in the setting of trauma-induced fractures with clearly defined patient populations, interventions, comparisons and appropriately selected outcomes (PICO). These questions centered around efficacy (pain control, reduction in opioid use) and safety (non-union, kidney injury). A systematic review including literature search and meta-analysis was performed, and the quality of evidence was graded per the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The working group reached consensus on the final evidence-based recommendations.

Results

A total of 19 studies were identified for analysis. Not all outcomes identified as critically important were reported in all studies, and the outcome of pain control was too heterogenous to perform a meta-analysis. Nine studies reported on non-union (three randomized control trials), six of which reported no association with NSAIDs. The overall incidence of non-union in patients receiving NSAIDs compared with patients not receiving NSAIDs was 2.99% and 2.19% (p = 0.04), respectively. Of studies reporting on pain control and reduction of opioids, the use of NSAIDs reduced pain and the need for opioids after traumatic fracture. One study reported on the outcome of acute kidney injury and found no association with NSAID use.

Conclusions

In patients with traumatic fractures, NSAIDs appear to reduce post-trauma pain, reduce the need for opioids and have a small effect on non-union. We conditionally recommend the use of NSAIDs in patients suffering from traumatic fractures as the benefit appears to outweigh the small potential risks.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113sVvpN]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of the meta-analysis showed that current exposure to NSAIDs was associated with an approximately 1.5-fold increase in the odds of developing AKI in the general population and in people with CKD. Since AKI is a rare NSAIDs associated adverse outcome, odds ratios will approximate to relative risks. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies, particularly in the general population group and so the pooled estimates should be interpreted with caution. The limited numbers of studies eligible for inclusion precluded meta-regression, so subgroup analyses were conducted in order to try to explore and explain heterogeneity. Results were consistent with and similar to the main findings. Older people who were prescribed NSAIDs had a somewhat higher (2-fold) risk of developing AKI, but there was no strong evidence that greater COX-2 selectivity was associated with lower AKI risk. NSAIDs with high COX-2 selectivity (≥ 5-fold) had a lower association with AKI than NSAIDs with COX-2 selectivity < 5-fold, and heterogeneity in the subgroups was reduced compared to the overall results consistent with some of the heterogeneity being due to differences in the age of the population studies and the type of NSAIDs examined. Five studies included individual NSAID usage in their analyses in which only Lafrance and Schneider compared dose effect in Rofecoxib, Celecoxib, Naproxen and Meloxicam (Lafrance only). Dose response cannot be easily stratified as higher dosage will be associated with a higher risk of effect compared to lower dosage but the exposure window is not under control. However, other differences in population and in AKI definition were substantial and likely accounts for much of the observed heterogeneity. Overall, all analyses showed a statistically significant, modestly increased risk of AKI from exposure to NSAIDs, and the magnitude of the increased risk of AKI was rather similar among all sub-groups with mostly overlapping confidence intervals.

### COX-2 inhibitors and the kidney [^117JAGGv]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors are now extensively used for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy. Several large controlled trials provide evidence to support the proposition that they cause fewer major gastro-intestinal side effects and less toxicity than routine nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In view of the documented different localizations of the cyclooxygenase-1 and COX-2 enzymes in the kidney, it was initially hoped that COX-2 inhibitors would be associated with fewer renal side effects than other NSAIDs. This has not been borne out by subsequent studies. Like other NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause salt and water retention, leading to edema and worsening hypertension. They can also cause acute declines in renal function and glomerular filtration rate. These events are, however, uncommon in large rheumatology populations and infrequently lead to discontinuation of the medications. Judicious use of COX-2 inhibitors in high-risk patients (such as those with chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes or congestive heart failure) will lead to a decreased incidence of adverse renal events.

### Naproxen oral (naproxen oral suspension) [^1173Go9f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Use of NSAIDs, including naproxen oral suspension, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of naproxen oral suspension use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid naproxen oral suspension use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations, Data).

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus

Use of NSAIDs, including naproxen oral suspension, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment

Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment.

Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies in rats, rabbits, and mice no evidence of teratogenicity or fetal harm when naproxen was administered during the period of organogenesis at doses 0.13, 0.26, and 0.6 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 1500 mg/day, respectively. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as naproxen, resulted in increased pre-and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115NcDw5]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Study selection

The search strategy and data extraction were defined in a PICOS format (participants, intervention, comparison, outcome and study design). Studies published in English were eligible for inclusion when they used observational methods to study adults in the community exposed to NSAIDs and reported AKI as an outcome. Given the historical lack of consensus on AKI definition, studies using a variety of definitions of AKI were included, with AKI defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 or 10 codes, or change in eGFR or creatinine clearance (CrCl) or serum creatinine (SCr). Similarly, varying definitions of CKD were allowed including estimated GFR < 60 ml/min (with or without standardization to body surface area), or based on ICD codes, or SCr > 122 μmol/L, or structured patient interview. Traditional NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors were included with the exception of low dose aspirin (< 300 mg per dose). Studies were excluded if they were published in abstract only, included children (age < 18 years old), only included post-operative patients or others receiving only one or two doses of NSAID as treatment (e.g. for renal colic or post-lithotripsy), or had end-stage renal disease defined as being on dialysis or having received a renal transplant. Finally, meta-analyses, studies with < 100 subjects, and studies without a contemporaneous control group drawn from the same population were excluded.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced acute kidney injury in the community dwelling general population and people with chronic kidney disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111x2dPV]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and search strategy

MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched from inception to June 21th 2016 using OVID from the Knowledge Network using a predetermined list of keywords including NSAIDs, renal diseases and renal function measurements modified from the search strategies used by two related Cochrane reviews (see Additional file 1 for search strategy). Search results were restricted to cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies in the English language. The reference lists from all identified primary studies, review articles, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines for CKD and AKI and OpenSIGLE (unpublished literature database) were manually checked to screen for additional relevant papers.

Citations were independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers based on title and abstract (XZ and SB or XZ and BG). If one or more authors deemed the study potentially relevant, or if there was any uncertainty about eligibility based on title and abstract alone, then the full text paper was retrieved for review. Authors of original studies were not contacted. Study selection and quality assessment from full-text papers retrieved were performed independently by two reviewers (XZ and BG).

### Association of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescriptions with kidney disease among active young and middle-aged adults [^115Ja7AA]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association between prescribed dosages of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and later incident kidney disease among active young and middle-aged adults?

Findings

In this cohort study of 764 228 US Army soldiers, prescriptions of more than 7 daily defined doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs per month were associated with modest but significant increases in the adjusted hazard ratios of acute and chronic kidney disease diagnoses.

Meaning

Prescribers should be cognizant of potential kidney disease risks associated with higher doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs among active young and middle-aged adults; dosage reduction represents an approach that may decrease associated kidney disease outcome rates.

### Nephrotoxic potential of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [^113FKM95]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relative nephrotoxic potential of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1996-February 2004) identified clinical trials evaluating the nephrotoxicity of COX-2 inhibitors versus traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Key search terms included cyclooxygenase inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, nephrotoxicity, and chemically induced.

Data Synthesis

Three clinical trials determined that COX-2 inhibitors have similar adverse effects on the kidney when compared with nonselective NSAIDs, while 2 studies concluded that COX-2 inhibitors are less nephrotoxic than nonselective NSAIDs. All 5 trials utilized low numbers of subjects, short-term therapy, and surrogate markers of kidney damage.

Conclusions

COX-2 inhibitors may not offer distinct advantages over nonselective NSAIDs with respect to kidney function. Longer trials in patients with comorbidities are warranted. These agents should be used cautiously or not at all in patients with predisposing conditions.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^115gRSjH]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Topical NSAIDs versus systemic NSAIDs — recommendation and renal safety data: Topical NSAIDs are recommended for use in knee osteoarthritis based on evidence of equivalent efficacy for improving pain and function and superior systemic adverse effect profiles compared to oral NSAIDs. Multiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate adverse effects of topical NSAIDs are similar to placebo except for increased local adverse effects, mostly mild skin reactions. Diclofenac is a topical NSAID approved in the U.S. for osteoarthritis, and in a pooled safety analysis of 7 RCTs of topical diclofenac 1.5% use, among 138 patients using topical diclofenac for 4–12 weeks, no patients experienced a serious kidney adverse event; changes in blood pressure and kidney function were similar between the diclofenac and placebo/control groups. Studies with topical diclofenac also report that the level attained in blood is 0.4–2.2% of the maximum serum.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of kidney cancer: a Swedish nationwide cohort study in the general and high-use populations [^1133HHmV]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs may cause a wide spectrum of chronic and acute kidney damage directly related to their pharmacological effect that is, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, affecting sodium homeostasis and blood pressure. Kidney damage may also arise from unrelated mechanisms, such as hypersensitivity reactions, including interstitial nephritis. Whether such effects of NSAIDs would lead to an increased KC risk remains, however, unknown.

Our study has several strengths, including our use of nationwide, population‐based prospective health registers with high coverage and validity. Our study is also one of the largest ones on the risk of KC with NSAID use to date. Cancer outcomes were ascertained independent of exposure, thereby minimizing the risk of recall or ascertainment bias, and exposure was determined using complete dispensation data rather than self‐reported. We found that the rates of KC in our general population comparator were the same as age‐ and sex‐standardized rates from the National Board of Health and Welfare, which indicates that the internal validity was good and that the observed observations are generalizable to individuals in Sweden with a similar age‐ and sex distribution as our general population cohorts. Assessing both the incidence and mortality of KC, and using data on TNM cancer stages, permitted assessment of potential detection bias. Moreover, we were able to adjust for several potential confounders, including both comorbid conditions of interest, family history of KC and in a subgroup analysis also smoking. We also evaluated the robustness of our results by applying an alternative timescale of the Cox regression model (i.e. time since the start of follow‐up instead of attained age) and found substantially similar results. Additionally, we conducted analyses in the RA and SpA cohorts incorporating an alternative exposure definition that included prescriptions dispensed prior to the date of inclusion, and these analyses also produced largely similar outcomes.

Subgroup analyses

To explore heterogeneity, we examined association with AKI in older users of NSAIDs (age > 50 years), stratified by COX-2 selectivity of the NSAIDs exposed to (none, < 5-fold and ≥ 5-fold), and in older patients with exposure to COX-2 selective NSAIDs (Figs. 3, 4 and 5). Statistical heterogeneity remained in subgroup analyses but it was modestly reduced, suggesting that subgroup analyses provided more confidence in the pooled estimates, but interpretation of pooled estimates should still be cautious.

Fig. 3

Fig. 4
Pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for AKI in elderly people using NSAIDs vs not using

Fig. 5
Pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for AKI in elderly people using NSAIDs with COX-2 selectivity vs not using

The pooled results of NSAIDs with different COX-2 selectivity for AKI are shown in Fig. 3. Similar to the general results, there were increased associations between AKI and exposure to NSAIDs with different COX-2 selectivity (no COX-2 selectivity 1.84, 95%CI 1.54–2.19, COX-2 selectivity < 5-fold 1.43, 95%CI 1.25–1.64 and COX-2 selectivity ≥ 5-fold 1.41, 95%CI 1.07–1.87). There was a non-statistically significant trend that the higher the COX-2 selectivity NSAIDs was, the lower the increased odds of AKI (subgroup difference test χ 2 = 5.31, df = 2, P = 0.07).

Older people (> 50 years) using NSAIDs had a somewhat higher odds of AKI associated with NSAID exposure than the general population (2.01, 95%CI 1.52–2.68; Fig. 4), although the confidence intervals overlap, and there was again significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 62%). In older people who were using NSAIDs with COX-2 selectivity, the odds ratio was 1.73 (95%CI 1.32–2.29; Fig. 5) which is similar to the general population. Heterogeneity was moderate (45%) in this subgroup.

### Moving toward a contemporary classification of drug-induced kidney disease [^115BZKeG]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis and severity of DIKD are commonly multifactorial, combining predisposing risk factors with exposure to nephrotoxin(s) and other insults. For example, in the case of medications belonging to the "both injury and dysfunction" category, the complete picture and different aspects of nephrotoxicity usually may not be observed unless other medication and non-medication related risk factors are present. For NSAID nephropathy, some of these factors are age above 60 years, true volume depletion (secondary to dehydration), effective arterial volume depletion (secondary to congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome), and concurrent treatment with ACEIs/ARBs, diuretics, or calcineurin inhibitors. In critically ill patients, the simultaneous presence of these factors is highly probable. Notably, in the case of concurrent treatment with ACEIs/ARBs, these agents can worsen NSAID-mediated reductions in oxygen delivery to the kidney parenchyma. Medication-induced crystalline nephropathy is another example. It varies from simple urine crystallization without kidney involvement (neither dysfunction nor damage) to full-blown kidney involvement (dysfunction and damage together), depending on the possible presence of volume depletion, drug dosing, urine pH, and underlying kidney disease. Therefore, it is likely that patients who received a specific nephrotoxic medication may be considered for different DIKD categories, depending on risk factors.

The potential of transition between categories provides opportunities for clinical management. A preliminary report in kidney transplant recipients demonstrated that in patients who developed cyclosporine nephrotoxicity, increased urine β2-microglobulin concentrations were detectable proceeding a SCr rise. Interestingly, cyclosporine dose reduction in these patients led to decreased urine β2-microglobulin. In addition, based on results of a cohort investigation, urinary NGAL levels between 96 and 144 h and urinary [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] normalized by urinary creatinine between 144 and 192 h of vancomycin use were predictors of developing AKI during hospital stay and recovery of AKI at the time of hospital discharge, respectively. There is the possibility of tracking patients' improvement with DIKD using novel biomarkers. A better understanding of DIKD severity will require researchers to evaluate daily biomarker concentrations, so that trends can be monitored closely; however, most current studies evaluate biomarker concentrations only intermittently.

### High prevalence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use among acute kidney injury survivors in the Southern community cohort study [^111jm8XQ]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the fastest growing conditions affecting the kidney and a risk factor for accelerated loss of kidney function and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Improving outcomes among the growing population of AKI survivors requires identifying modifiable risk factors to reduce these events. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly used analgesics worldwide and an established risk factor for AKI, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and CVD. The American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Quality and Patient Safety (QPS) Task Force highlighted the avoidance of NSAIDs as a high priority area "most open" to improvement in patients with kidney disease. Similarly, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently strengthened its warning regarding the link between NSAIDs and major vascular events, particularly among those with cardiovascular risk factors.

Despite growing attention to the dangers of NSAID use among high-risk populations, use is common among patients with CKD, ranging between 4–31% depending on the populations studied. However, to our knowledge, no studies to date have examined their use in patients who have experienced AKI. Given the high prevalence of CKD in this population and evidence linking AKI to future kidney and cardiovascular outcomes, examining NSAID use among survivors of AKI is important for identifying the magnitude of the gap between patient and provider practice and guideline recommendations. To examine the frequency of NSAID use among AKI survivors in a low socioeconomic population which carries a disproportionate risk of CKD and end-stage renal disease, as well as factors associated with NSAID use among AKI survivors, we leveraged detailed analgesic intake information collected from participants in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS), a large prospective cohort of low-income adults in the southeastern US.

### Association of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with kidney health in ambulatory older adults [^113WMDLC]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause kidney injury, especially in older adults. However, previously reported associations between NSAID use and kidney health outcomes are inconsistent and limited by reliance on serum creatinine-based GFR estimates. This analysis investigated the association of NSAID use with kidney damage in older adults using multiple kidney health measures.

Design

Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.

Setting

Multicenter, community-based cohort.

Participants

Two thousand nine hundred and ninty nine older adults in the Health ABC Study. A subcohort (n = 500) was randomly selected for additional biomarker measurements.

Exposure

Prescription and over-the-counter NSAID use ascertained by self-report.

Measurements

Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by cystatin C (cysC), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were measured in 2,999 participants; alpha-1 microglobulin (α1m), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), propeptide type III procollagen (PIIINP), and uromodulin (UMOD) were measured in 500 participants. GFR was estimated three times over 10years and expressed as percent change per year.

Results

Participants had a mean age of 74years, 51% were female, and 41% African-American. No eGFR differences were detected between NSAID users (n = 655) and non-users (n = 2,344) at baseline (72ml/min/1.73m 2 in both groups). Compared to non-users, NSAID users had lower adjusted odds of having ACR greater than 30mg/g (0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.51–0.89) and lower mean urine IL-18 concentration at baseline (-11%; 95% CI = -4% to -18%), but similar mean KIM-1 (5%; 95% CI = -5% to 14%). No significant differences in baseline concentrations of the remaining urine biomarkers were detected. NSAID users and non-users did not differ significantly in the rate of eGFR decline (-2.2% vs -2.3% per year).

Conclusion

Self-reported NSAID use was not associated with kidney dysfunction or injury based on multiple measures, raising the possibility of NSAID use without kidney harm in ambulatory older adults. More research is needed to define safe patterns of NSAID consumption.

Results of analyses addressing the primary study aim are reported in Table 3. NSAID exposure of 7 or more DDDs per month was associated with significant increases in the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of both AKI (aHR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1–1.4) and CKD (aHR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.3). Based on postregression-adjusted risk computations, the highest NSAID exposure level was associated with annual case excesses per 100 000 exposed individuals of 17.6 cases for AKI and 30.0 cases for CKD. Mean NSAID exposure of 1 to 7 DDDs was associated with smaller hazard increases that were not significant.

NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease — adverse effects and reversibility: NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and kidney adverse events and, by blunting prostaglandin-associated regulation of renal hemodynamics, can induce renal ischemia. NSAIDs can also increase blood pressure, cause edema and sodium retention (mostly mild), induce hyperkalemia, and contribute to heart failure, and NSAID-induced kidney injury is typically reversible with prompt discontinuation.

### Diclofenac sodium D / r [^113Vb4xd]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Caution should be used when initiating treatment with diclofenac in patients with considerable dehydration.

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood ow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

### Need for a judicious use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to avoid community-acquired acute kidney injury [^112FzdNJ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Millions of Americans use over-the-counter analgesics on a daily basis, and nearly 100 million nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prescriptions are filled per year. In high-risk patients, these medications can disrupt kidney hemodynamics and precipitate community-acquired acute kidney injury (CA-AKI). The risk of NSAID-associated CA-AKI increases 3- to 5-fold in patients taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and diuretics concurrently. CA-AKI increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) or accelerating progression of pre-existing CKD. Importantly, many cases of NSAID-induced CA-AKI may be avoided by identifying high-risk patients and providing patient and provider education on when to avoid these medications and minimize risk.

### Nonselective and cyclooxygenase-2-selective NSAIDs and acute kidney injury [^116rTJzw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acute kidney injury is well established, but it is less clear whether this risk is focused with specific agents. We undertook a large pharmacoepidemiologic analysis of the risk of acute kidney injury among older adults using nonselective NSAIDs or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors.

Methods

Medicare beneficiaries from 2 large states with drug benefit were eligible for study. Patients were included if they filled a prescription for a nonselective NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor after more than 6 months without any such prescriptions and without a previous diagnosis of acute kidney injury. Incident acute kidney injury was ascertained from hospitalization claims within 45 days of initiating nonselective NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor therapy. Adjusted proportional hazards models estimated the relative risk of acute kidney injury associated with each agent compared with celecoxib.

Results

We included 183,446 patients whose mean age was 78 years; 80% were women. Acute kidney injury was identified in 870 (0.47%) of nonselective NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor users. The agents with significantly elevated risk compared with celecoxib were indomethacin (rate ratio [RR] = 2.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.70–2.93), ibuprofen (RR = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.36–2.19), and rofecoxib (RR = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.26–1.83). These findings were robust in several subgroups.

Conclusion

Acute kidney injury requiring hospitalization is a relatively rare adverse event among older adults after initiation of nonselective NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitor treatment, observed in approximately 1 in 200 new users within 45 days. There seems to be a marked gradient of risk for acute kidney injury across agents, specifically for indomethacin, ibuprofen, and rofecoxib.

### High prevalence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use among acute kidney injury survivors in the Southern community cohort study [^112ahXJu]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Survivors of AKI are at increased risk for future kidney dysfunction, cardiovascular complications, and death. In this study, we demonstrate that nearly one in five AKI survivors were using NSAIDs regularly and that the prevalence remained consistently high regardless of time since the most recent AKI episode. Alarmingly, over one-half of NSAID users were taking these medications before and after the index AKI episode. Further, we demonstrate that in this predominantly low-income population, use of NSAIDs following AKI was somewhat more likely among participants with arthritis and those without diabetes.

The path to ESRD is often non-linear and marked by one or more AKI episodes. The incidence of AKI is also rising by approximately 10% per year, highlighting a growing population of survivors in need of follow-up care. While optimal care remains to be defined, little debate exists regarding the adverse effects of chronic NSAID use on the kidney and cardiovascular systems. The use of NSAIDs in patients at risk or with established CKD is a well-recognized problem, and was recently emphasized by the ASN QPS Task Force as one of five highest impact evidence-based areas in need of improvement. Patients who experience AKI, particularly when superimposed on CKD (36% of NSAID users in our cohort), are at highest risk for ESRD and thus represent a subgroup in whom preventing future loss of kidney function may be especially important. One potential mechanism for this increased risk may be through recurrent AKI. We have recently demonstrated that 25% of AKI survivors are re-hospitalized with another AKI event within a year of discharge. This study adds to the literature by pointing out a potentially modifiable risk factor for preventing recurrent AKI.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of renal disease: Use of non‑selective or COX‑2 selective NSAIDs can result in renal papillary necrosis, acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis with or without nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, acute renal failure, or other renal‑related injuries in an estimated 1–5% of patients, and all available agents approved for use in the U.S. include a warning for such events in their prescribing information. The risk for renal adverse events increases in patients who are dependent upon a compensatory increase in renal prostaglandins to maintain renal perfusion, and patients at higher risk include those with preexisting renal disease, volume depletion (e.g., diuretics, vomiting), congestive heart failure, liver dysfunction, cirrhosis with ascites, use of angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and older patients. In healthy patients, renal prostaglandins do not play a significant role in maintaining renal perfusion; however, in reduced volume, hypotension, and reduced renal perfusion, NSAID administration reduces compensatory vasodilatory renal prostaglandins, which can result in reduced renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and can lead to renal damage. Although other mechanisms exist, hemodynamically mediated acute renal insufficiency is the most common cause and is most frequently reversible once the offending agent is discontinued. In the PRECISION study, renal events were prospectively monitored in more than 20,000 RA or OA patients receiving celecoxib, ibuprofen, or naproxen for a mean follow‑up of 20 months, and eligible patients had baseline serum creatinine values within normal limits.

### Determinants of impaired renal function with use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the importance of half-life and other medications [^113ZT2Tc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may interfere with renal function, but little is known about the effects of the half-life of these agents, or the use of other medications, on renal function.

Subjects and Methods

Medication use was assessed during a standardized interview in a cross-sectional study of 802 patients undergoing total joint replacement because of osteoarthritis. Preoperative blood samples were used to estimate creatinine clearance using a standard formula that takes age, sex, and weight into account. Impaired renal function was defined as an estimated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min (fifteenth percentile). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between NSAID use (alone or in combination with diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) and impaired renal function.

Results

NSAID use per se was only marginally associated with impaired renal function (OR = 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9 to 2.2). This association was almost exclusively the result of the use of NSAIDs with a half-life of 4 or more hours (OR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2 to 5.7). Patients who used diuretics with NSAIDs (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.7 to 8.3) or without NSAIDs (OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.6 to 7.6) had a higher risk of impaired renal function than did patients using NSAIDs alone (OR = 1.6) or none of these drugs (reference). A similar but less pronounced pattern was observed for ACE inhibitors.

Conclusion

NSAID-associated impaired renal function seems to be mainly the result of compounds with intermediate-long half-life. We found no evidence that the adverse effects of diuretics and ACE inhibitors on renal function were greater in those who also used NSAIDs.

### Association of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescriptions with kidney disease among active young and middle-aged adults [^115WDy2N]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the United States in prescription and over-the-counter forms, with more than 70 million NSAID prescriptions written annually. In 2010, more than 29 million US adults were estimated to be regular NSAID users — an increase of 41% from 2005. A recent study of self-reported over-the-counter and prescribed ibuprofen therapy noted that 90% of those using ibuprofen took it regularly, 37% took another NSAID in addition to ibuprofen, and 11% exceeded the recommended daily limit of ibuprofen.

Clinicians who prescribe or recommend NSAIDs should weigh the benefits vs the risks for kidney health. Both selective and nonselective NSAIDs adversely affect the kidneys through prostaglandin-related effects. Potential insults include impaired renal blood flow and clinically significant cytotoxic effects. Signs and symptoms associated with NSAID use that can complicate blood pressure management, such as hypertension and edema, are relatively infrequentbut important.

Most epidemiologic research on the association of NSAIDs and incident kidney disease has involved older persons and/or those with chronic and serious conditions. Particularly regarding chronic and end-stage kidney disease, NSAID-related research has often focused on specific areas, such as disease progression. For younger healthy individuals, some studies provide statements of reassurance about the overall risks of NSAIDsand, in particular, about their renal effects. However, evidence on this demographic group is relatively sparse. This limited information may be because NSAID use is less common among young and middle-aged adults, and the expected population rate of clinically significant kidney disease due to NSAIDs is less than 1%.

Studying the NSAID-kidney disease association among working-aged adults therefore requires a large group with robust NSAID use. United States Army soldiers are a useful study population given recent research indicating that 69% or more of this sizable population may use NSAIDs. In addition, prior studies have raised concerns about kidney disease risk among NSAID users who engage in endurance exercise, as renal blood flow may fall to as little as 25% of resting values during strenuous activity. The Army population is one in which endurance activities, such as runningand long-distance rucksack marching, are regularly undertaken, so this group provides a unique window on NSAIDs and kidney disease among active persons. Other advantages of using a military population include standardized, comprehensive administrative and medical data, as well as preservice, annual, and combat duty–associated health screeningsthat facilitate recognition of incident diseases.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and chronic kidney disease progression: a systematic review [^114o9Sv7]. Family Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely regarded as one risk factor, which influences chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. However, previous literature reviews have not quantified the risk in moderate to severe CKD patients.

Objective

To estimate the strength of association between chronic NSAID use and CKD progression.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational general practice or population studies featuring patients aged 45 years and over. The electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, AMED, BNI and CINAHL until September 2011 without date or language restrictions. Searches included the reference lists of relevant identified studies, WEB of KNOWLEDGE, openSIGLE, specific journals, the British Library and expert networks. For relevant studies, random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the association between NSAID use and accelerated CKD progression (estimated glomerular filtration rate decline ≥ 15 ml/min/1.73 m²).

Results

From a possible 768 articles, after screening and selection, seven studies were identified (5 cohort, 1 case-control and 1 cross-sectional) and three were included in the meta-analysis. Regular-dose NSAID use did not significantly affect the risk of accelerated CKD progression; pooled odds ratio (OR) = 0.96 (95%CI: 0.86–1.07), but high-dose NSAID use significantly increased the risk of accelerated CKD progression; pooled OR = 1.26 (95%CI: 1.06–1.50).

Conclusions

The avoidance of NSAIDs in the medium term is unnecessary in patients with moderate to severe CKD, if not otherwise contraindicated. As the definition of high-dose of NSAID use remains unclear, the lowest effective dose of NSAIDs should be prescribed where indicated.
