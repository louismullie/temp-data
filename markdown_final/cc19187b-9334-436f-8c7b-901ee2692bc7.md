## Question

What are the most effective treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most effective treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum are and how to prioritize them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definition and diagnostic confirmation to ensure we are truly dealing with HG. Then, I should verify the highest-credibility guideline hierarchy and synthesize a stepwise treatment algorithm. Next, I will consider nonpharmacologic strategies, followed by first-line and second-line pharmacotherapies with safety nuances. After that, I need to check supportive care with fluids, electrolytes, and thiamine, and then rescue options like enteral or parenteral nutrition. Finally, I should confirm appropriate care settings, follow-up, and recurrence prevention, while keeping an eye on evidence gaps and risk–benefit counseling.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude alternative causes. HG is characterized by early-pregnancy nausea and/or vomiting severe enough to limit normal oral intake and activities, often with dehydration; these clinical features help differentiate HG from other etiologies that must still be considered and ruled out through focused history, exam, and targeted labs [^113mocJ4] [^113fPfJS]. I need to check electrolytes, renal function, and, importantly, liver tests, because LFTs are mildly elevated in up to 40–50% of severe HG and typically resolve, which helps avoid over-investigation, though atypical or severe derangements warrant broader evaluation [^111mUnNh].

> Next, I should review foundational nonpharmacologic measures while not delaying escalation if HG is evident. Small, frequent, carbohydrate-predominant meals, avoidance of triggers, and oral rehydration are low-risk and guideline-endorsed; optional adjuncts include ginger and acupressure, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy may help as an adjunct, although evidence quality is variable and benefits are modest on average [^1165CQtd] [^112ihLHV] [^111wLsZm]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these measures are supportive, but I should not rely on them alone once HG criteria are met, and early pharmacotherapy prevents progression and hospitalization, which several guidelines emphasize [^114U5zL1].

> Now, first-line pharmacotherapy — wait, let me verify the correct hierarchy so I don't misplace agents. I almost said metoclopramide is first-line, but that's not precise; RCOG places doxylamine–pyridoxine as first-line, along with other H1 antihistamines and phenothiazines, reserving metoclopramide for second-line due to extrapyramidal risks and the need for slow IV administration if used parenterally [^115Au6Tg] [^111y87uc]. I should confirm shared decision-making and stepwise escalation within this tier, as many patients need combinations to achieve control, and cross-class rotation is reasonable if one agent is not tolerated [^111y87uc].

> For second-line and adjunctive therapy, I will now examine dopamine antagonists and 5-HT3 antagonists used when first-line combinations are insufficient. Metoclopramide is second-line and should be given IV by slow bolus over at least three minutes to mitigate extrapyramidal effects; it can be combined with other classes if necessary, monitoring for adverse events and discontinuing promptly if reactions occur [^112uZSX6] [^116mukHV]. Ondansetron is widely used as an adjunct in moderate–severe disease that fails other combinations; I need to ensure counseling that first-trimester use may be associated with a very small absolute increase in orofacial cleft risk and that most guidelines advise use only if clearly needed after other options have failed, balancing against the risks of uncontrolled HG; parenteral, rectal, or transdermal routes are appropriate when oral intake is limited [^114Jf5uj] [^116yxJaJ] [^113nKxGj] [^117PJLHZ]. But wait, what if multiple serotonergic and antidopaminergic drugs are combined? I should caution about rare serotonin syndrome and monitor for neuromuscular changes and autonomic instability when polypharmacy is unavoidable in severe cases [^114tGFgv].

> Supportive care is not optional in HG; I need to ensure early IV rehydration with electrolyte correction and to give thiamine. Thiamine 100 mg three times daily orally or intravenously as part of a vitamin B complex should precede any dextrose-containing fluids and parenteral nutrition to reduce risk of Wernicke encephalopathy and refeeding complications, especially in those with prolonged inadequate intake [^113CN3Vz]. Let me double-check that this is consistently emphasized — yes, this is a strong, repeated recommendation in modern guidance and is one of the most effective preventive steps for serious neurologic complications in HG [^113CN3Vz] [^113fPfJS].

> If symptoms remain refractory despite optimal antiemetics and fluids, I should escalate thoughtfully. Enteral tube feeding or parenteral nutrition can be lifesaving in selected cases but should be instituted within a multidisciplinary framework, ideally with gastroenterology and nutrition support involvement while continuing antiemetics and vitamin repletion, and I must anticipate and prevent refeeding-related risks with pre-emptive thiamine [^115RKrzL] [^1117ox9a] [^113CN3Vz]. Hold on, I should verify commonly suggested rescue options — corticosteroids have not reduced rehospitalization in a rigorously conducted RCT, so if considered at all, they should be reserved for truly refractory cases after careful risk–benefit discussion rather than used routinely [^115AWg4x]. I also need to check for and treat comorbid GERD, esophagitis, or gastritis with H2 receptor antagonists or PPIs, which can meaningfully reduce ongoing emetic triggers from acid injury [^112zi2zM].

> Choosing the care setting is another determinant of effectiveness. I should confirm that mild cases can be managed as outpatient with antiemetics and close follow-up, whereas severe HG warrants day-unit or inpatient care for parenteral hydration, parenteral or rectal antiemetics, electrolyte management, and expedited escalation within a multidisciplinary team [^112MW6Sk] [^1117ox9a] [^117PJLHZ]. Let me reconsider timing as well — evidence and economic analyses suggest earlier, protocolized intervention may reduce symptom progression, admissions, and costs, supporting rapid access models of care for HG rather than fragmented, delayed presentations to emergency departments [^113EHRi1].

> Ongoing monitoring and obstetric follow-up are part of an effective strategy. I should confirm that persistent moderate–severe symptoms into the late second or third trimester prompt serial fetal growth ultrasounds, given potential nutritional compromise and weight loss, and ensure maternal weight, hydration, and electrolytes are trended as therapy is adjusted [^117Jb4hx]. For patients with prior significant NVP/HG, early re-initiation of lifestyle measures and antiemetics that were effective in a previous pregnancy may reduce recurrence or severity, which is a pragmatic prevention step I should discuss preconceptionally or very early in gestation [^114RXFce].

> Stepping back, the most effective "treatment" for HG is not a single drug but a guideline-driven, stepwise, multimodal pathway that begins with early diagnosis and escalation, first-line antiemetics anchored by doxylamine–pyridoxine and other H1 antihistamines or phenothiazines, second-line metoclopramide and adjunct ondansetron when needed, systematic thiamine before dextrose, aggressive hydration and electrolyte correction, and timely initiation of enteral or parenteral nutrition with multidisciplinary care for refractory disease, plus obstetric surveillance when symptoms persist later in pregnancy; no single agent has unequivocally outperformed others across RCTs, which is why integrated algorithms are emphasized by the strongest contemporary guidelines [^115Au6Tg] [^111y87uc] [^112uZSX6] [^113nKxGj] [^1158rPHw] [^1117ox9a].

The most effective treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum are a **stepwise approach** starting with first-line antiemetics (doxylamine-pyridoxine [^115Au6Tg], H1 antihistamines, phenothiazines [^111y87uc]), then second-line agents (metoclopramide [^112uZSX6], ondansetron [^113nKxGj]) if needed, and adding corticosteroids for refractory cases [^112uZSX6]. IV fluids with thiamine [^113CN3Vz] are essential for dehydration and to prevent **Wernicke encephalopathy** [^115YrDKc]. Enteral or parenteral nutrition [^117WqKbi] is reserved for severe, persistent cases [^115RKrzL], and a multidisciplinary team is recommended for complex or refractory HG [^1117ox9a] [^112FZSQE].

## Pharmacological management

### First-line antiemetic therapy

- **Doxylamine-pyridoxine combination**: Recommended as first-line therapy for HG [^1122WsJU] [^115Au6Tg].
- **H1 antihistamines**: Meclizine, promethazine, cyclizine are first-line options [^115jXL5z] [^111y87uc].
- **Phenothiazines**: Prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine are first-line options [^113fPfJS] [^111y87uc].

---

### Second-line antiemetic therapy

Metoclopramide [^1162C1Xj] can be used alone or with other antiemetics, and when given intravenously should be administered slowly to reduce **extrapyramidal effects** [^112uZSX6]. Ondansetron is considered when other regimens fail [^113nKxGj] and should be used cautiously in the first trimester because of a small risk of **orofacial clefts** [^114Jf5uj] [^116yxJaJ].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

Corticosteroids are considered for **refractory HG** after other therapies fail [^115AWg4x] [^113nKxGj]. Use should be limited to cases that do not respond to prior treatments [^1158rPHw].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Acupressure may be used as an **adjunctive therapy** [^112ihLHV] [^114bSzSe]. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy can be considered as an adjunct to **pyridoxine therapy** [^111wLsZm] [^1122WsJU].

---

## Nutritional support

Enteral tube feeding is considered when oral intake is **inadequate** [^117WqKbi] [^115RKrzL]. Parenteral nutrition is reserved for severe cases when **enteral feeding is not feasible** [^115RKrzL].

---

## Fluid and electrolyte management

Intravenous fluids are essential to treat **dehydration** and correct electrolytes [^114pr1Gp] [^113CN3Vz]. Thiamine should be administered before dextrose or parenteral nutrition to prevent **Wernicke encephalopathy** [^115YrDKc] [^113CN3Vz].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

A **multidisciplinary approach** is recommended for severe or refractory HG, involving obstetricians, gastroenterologists, dietitians, and mental health professionals [^1117ox9a]. Coordinated care among these specialists ensures **comprehensive management** [^112FZSQE] [^1117ox9a].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Serial ultrasounds are used to monitor **fetal growth** in persistent HG [^117Jb4hx]. Regular follow-up should track **maternal weight, hydration, and electrolyte status** [^115tX9y8].

---

## Summary of recommended treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Doxylamine-pyridoxine, H1 antihistamines, phenothiazines | First-line therapy |
| 2 | Metoclopramide, ondansetron | Second-line therapy |
| 3 | Corticosteroids | Refractory cases |
| 4 | Enteral or parenteral nutrition | Severe, persistent cases |
| 5 | Multidisciplinary care | Complex or refractory cases |

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^114vo1ry]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Low credibility.

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting, which typically begins by the fourth week and disappears by the 16th week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown but may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, which is characterized by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy? What are the effects of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013. (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review.) We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 32 studies that met our inclusion criteria and performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupressure; acupuncture; corticosteroids; ginger; metoclopramide; ondansetron; prochlorperazine; promethazine; and pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting [^111GcL98]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally result from infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to various conditions. Gastrointestinal etiologies include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases.

- **Central nervous system etiologies**: These are primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure and typically cause other neurologic signs.
- **Endocrinologic causes**: Pregnancy is the most common endocrinologic cause of nausea and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age.
- **Other causes**: Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses may also cause nausea and vomiting.

Evaluation should first focus on detecting emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.

### The management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum (Green-top guideline no. 69) [^113mocJ4]. BJOG (2024). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, and more specifically with respect to diagnosis, the RCOG 2024 guidelines recommend considering the diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) when symptoms start in early pregnancy. These symptoms should include nausea and/or vomiting severe enough to cause an inability to eat and drink normally and significantly limit daily activities. Signs of dehydration should be seen as contributory to the diagnosis.

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^116fkzDy]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, commonly known as "morning sickness", affects approximately 80 percent of pregnant women. Although several theories have been proposed, the exact cause remains unclear. Recent research has implicated *Helicobacter pylori* as one possible cause. Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is generally a mild, self-limited condition that may be controlled with conservative measures. However, a small percentage of pregnant women experience a more profound course, with the most severe form being hyperemesis gravidarum. Unlike morning sickness, hyperemesis gravidarum may have negative implications for maternal and fetal health.

Physicians should carefully evaluate patients with nonresolving or worsening symptoms to rule out the most common pregnancy-related and nonpregnancy-related causes of severe vomiting. Once pathologic causes have been ruled out, treatment is individualized. Initial treatment should be conservative and should involve dietary changes, emotional support, and possibly alternative therapies such as ginger or acupressure. Women with more complicated nausea and vomiting of pregnancy also may need pharmacologic therapy. Several medications, including pyridoxine and doxylamine, have been shown to be safe and effective treatments. Pregnant women who experience severe vomiting may require hospitalization, orally or intravenously administered corticosteroid therapy, and total parenteral nutrition.

### Pharmacogenetic predictors of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy severity and response to antiemetic therapy: a pilot study [^114jJncF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) affects up to 80% of all pregnant women. Although NVP is most common during the first trimester of pregnancy, as many as 20% of pregnant women are affected beyond 12 weeks of gestation and throughout the day (as opposed to being isolated to the morning hours). Of the women affected, 1 to 3% experience a severe form of NVP called hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), which includes weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances. In mild cases, NVP causes discomfort and inconvenience; however, HG can pose significant risks to the health of the pregnant woman and the fetus, often necessitating hospitalization. Even the milder cases of NVP can have a significant impact on the quality of a woman's life and contribute substantially to healthcare costs and time lost from work. Termination of otherwise wanted pregnancies has been reported in women suffering from severe, prolonged NVP. However, because NVP is rarely life-threatening, the goal of pharmacologic treatment is typically improvement in the quality of life for affected pregnant women.

Several dopamine antagonist antiemetics commonly used in pregnancy also act as weak serotonin receptor antagonists. These include promethazine, prochlorperazine, and metoclopramide. Additionally, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron is often used as an antiemetic in pregnancy. These antiemetics have been studied extensively and all appear to be safe for use in pregnancy. However, response to these medications in the treatment of NVP is highly variable.

### Testing effects of partner support and use of oral contraception during relationship formation on severity of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^117Bgf4T]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

We asked participants if they used any type of hormonal contraception at the time when they began the relationship with the biological father of their first child. We also asked specifically what type and what brand of hormonal contraception they used. Their experience of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) when expecting their first child was retrospectively assessed by two items, which were formulated as recall items based heavily on the wording and items in the Rhodes Index of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching, adapting each of its main two forms of response options.

The first item was: "During your pregnancy, did you experience feelings of nausea, retching, or vomiting which you attributed to 'morning sickness' or 'pregnancy sickness'?" with possible answers "No", "Mild", "Moderate", "Great", "Severe". The second question focused on the frequency of vomiting in a typical day: "At its peak, how often did you experience vomiting/retching in a typical day?" with possible answers "Never", "Once", "2–5 times", and "More than 5 times".

We coded the answers to both questions (1–5 and 1–4, respectively). Reliability analysis indicated high internal reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.846). On this basis, we summed these items to create a composite score of retrospectively scored NVP severity.

### Ondansetron use in pregnancy [^11341ihX]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends early treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy to prevent progression to hyperemesis gravidarum. Nausea, vomiting, and hyperemesis gravidarum typically occur during the first trimester, a sensitive time for exposure to teratogens due to organogenesis in the embryo. An efficacious treatment widely used across the United States for both nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum is ondansetron. Recent studies have provided conflicting findings on the safety of ondansetron during pregnancy.

There are numerous limitations in the literature on the safety of ondansetron. These include exposure to the medication not being limited to sensitive windows of organogenesis, a lack of information on dosing and compliance, the common use of self-reports of exposure, inadequate accounting for other factors that may explain the relationship between ondansetron exposure and adverse outcomes, and a lack of biologic plausibility by which ondansetron might cause harm. The authors opine that data do not support a reluctance to treat women with ondansetron in clinical practice.

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^1136Cd6w]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Cost estimates from the included studies highlight the economic burden associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). Two studies estimated an annual cost of NVP and HG in their respective countries, identifying a substantial economic burden. The studies used diverse cost inputs and outcome measures, making direct comparisons impractical.

Three studies provided cost estimates per patient over different time frames. A modeling study estimated a cost per patient with HG in the United States (US) to be USD $61,528 (in 2023-year value). An analysis of primary data from Canada reported an estimated weekly cost per patient with severe NVP at USD $880 (in 2023-year value), which equates to USD $31,680 per patient over a 36-week pregnancy.

Three studies found increasing costs with increasing symptom severity. One Canadian study reported higher costs with increasing self-reported symptom severity, a trend further illustrated by a later US modeling study.

- **Costs to facility and system level**:
	- Most studies included direct medical costs as significant contributors to the economic burden, such as hospital admissions, drug treatments, healthcare professionals, and emergency services.

The text also mentions cost-effectiveness of models of care, but does not provide complete information on this topic.

### Helicobacter pylori infection: a predictor of vomiting severity in pregnancy and adverse birth outcome [^1126aMuw]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Nausea and occasional vomiting in early pregnancy is common. Why some women experience severe nausea and occasional vomiting in early pregnancy is unknown. Causes are multifactorial and only symptomatic treatment options are available, although adverse birth outcomes have been described. Helicobacter pylori infection has been implicated in the cause of nausea and occasional vomiting in early pregnancy.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of H. pylori with vomiting severity in pregnancy and its effect on birth outcome.

- **Study design**: We assembled a population-based prospective cohort of pregnant women in The Netherlands. Enrolment took place between 2002 and 2006. H. pylori serology was determined in mid-gestation. Women reported whether they experienced vomiting in early, mid, and late gestation. Maternal weight was measured in the same time periods. Birth outcomes were obtained from medical records. Main outcome measures were vomiting frequency (no, occasional, daily) and duration (early, mid, late gestation), maternal weight gain, birthweight, small for gestational age, and prematurity. Data were analyzed with the use of multivariate regression.

- **Results**: We included 5549 women, of whom 1932 (34.8%) reported occasional vomiting and 601 (10.8%) reported daily vomiting. Women who were H. pylori-positive (n = 2363) were more likely to report daily vomiting (adjusted odds ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.16–1.78). H. pylori-positivity was associated with a reduction of total weight gain in women with daily vomiting.

### Managing hyperemesis gravidarum: A multimodal challenge [^112FZSQE]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Up to 90% of pregnant women experience nausea and vomiting. When prolonged or severe, this condition is known as hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), which can, in individual cases, be life-threatening. In this article, the aetiology, diagnosis, and treatment strategies are presented based on a selective literature review. Treatment strategies range from outpatient dietary advice and antiemetic drugs to hospitalization and intravenous (IV) fluid replacement in persistent or severe cases. Alternative methods, such as acupuncture, are not yet evidence-based but sometimes have a therapeutic effect.

In most cases, the condition is self-limiting and subsides by around 20 weeks of gestation. More severe forms require medical intervention once other organic causes of nausea and vomiting have been excluded. In addition, a psychosomatic approach is often helpful.

In view of its potential complexity, general practitioners and obstetricians should be well-informed about HG, and therapy should be multimodal.

### Assessment of management approaches for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a retrospective questionnaire analysis [^115c4ESK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum is the most severe form of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, commonly known as morning sickness. In the United States, 2% of pregnancies are affected by this condition. It is characterized by severe vomiting during the first trimester, often leading to hypovolemia and weight loss. The standard of care for hyperemesis and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is frequently ineffective. We hypothesize that, based on patient experience, the treatment guidelines for hyperemesis are not clinically effective. Our objective was to identify the efficacy of the various management approaches currently in place for hyperemesis and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

- **Methods**: A questionnaire was designed based on diagnostic criteria, standard demographic identifiers, and common medications for the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum. This questionnaire was distributed online through hyperemesis and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy support groups, personal social media, and institutional email.

- **Results**: In our study, most participants diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum trialed at least three medications, most of which were ineffective and/or had severe side effects. The most used medication for treatment is ondansetron, a standard antiemetic, with fatigue and constipation being the most reported side effects. All data in the dataset were coded as categorical and analyzed using contingency tables with Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square tests.

- **Conclusions**: The data presented in this research indicate that the…

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^114U5zL1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition affecting the health of a pregnant woman and her fetus. It can diminish a woman's quality of life and significantly contributes to health care costs and time lost from work. Since morning sickness is common in early pregnancy, the presence of nausea and vomiting may be minimized by obstetricians, other obstetric care providers, and pregnant women, and thus, it may be undertreated. Furthermore, some women do not seek treatment due to concerns about the safety of medications.

Once nausea and vomiting of pregnancy progresses, it becomes more difficult to control symptoms. Treatment in the early stages may prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization. Safe and effective treatments are available for more severe cases, while mild cases may resolve with lifestyle and dietary changes. The woman's perception of the severity of her symptoms plays a critical role in the decision of whether, when, and how to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. It is important to distinguish nausea and vomiting of pregnancy from those related to other causes.

The purpose of this document is to review the best available evidence about the diagnosis and management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^115jXL5z]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Low credibility.

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting, which typically begins by the 4th week and disappears by the 16th week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown, but it may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, characterized by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy? What are the effects of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2008. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 30 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^115azkew]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Given the difficulty in synthesizing cost data and outcomes of studies that used different methodological approaches, a narrative synthesis of the economic burden of NVP and HG was performed. These issues are common to economic analyses with a lack of standardization and transparency in reporting. Cost data was categorized into two main themes: costs to healthcare provider (direct) and costs to the patient (indirect). Costs reported in original studies were adjusted for inflation and currency differences, converting to 2023 US dollars ($USD) and inflating using US inflation rates.

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum [^115YrDKc]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2019). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is a common condition affecting up to 70% of pregnant women. Although hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) lacks a consensus definition, it is generally seen as a severe form of NVP, reported in 0.3–10.8% of pregnant women. HG can be associated with poor maternal, fetal, and child outcomes. While most women with NVP can be managed with dietary and lifestyle changes, more than one-third of patients may experience symptoms necessitating fluid and vitamin supplementation and/or antiemetic therapy. A combination of doxylamine/pyridoxine, which is not teratogenic, may effectively treat NVP. Ondansetron is commonly used for HG, but studies are urgently needed to determine if it is safer and more effective than first-line antiemetics.

Thiamine (vitamin B1) should be introduced following protocols to prevent refeeding syndrome and Wernicke encephalopathy. Recent genetic studies suggest a placental component in the etiology of NVP and HG, implicating common variants in genes encoding placental proteins (GDF15 and IGFBP7) and hormone receptors (GFRAL and PGR). New studies on etiology, diagnosis, management, and treatment are underway. Progress in these areas over the next decade may improve maternal quality of life and limit the adverse outcomes associated with HG.

### Assessment of management approaches for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a retrospective questionnaire analysis [^117CNC7p]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Despite the grave ramifications of this condition, many healthcare providers do not meet the needs of their hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) patients. This is evident not only from the sheer number of medications that patients are trialing, as shown in our data, but also from several studies regarding lessened quality of life and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Furthermore, we discovered that more than half of the patients who are prescribed medication for their symptoms are experiencing a plethora of side effects.

It is vital to reverse this trend; healthcare providers need to be aware of the high burden nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP)/HG and its treatment places on these patients. Support and high-quality care are essential for this vulnerable population. However, the lack of a unified standard of care for NVP/HG patients prevents the condition from being widely recognized and downplays the need for effective interventions, which is considered one of the highest priorities of experts in this field regarding this condition.

Without fully understanding the etiology of this multifactorial condition, the obstetrics community is at a loss for solutions to the root cause of this problem. By emphasizing the lack of efficacious, well-tolerated treatment, we hope that this research will inspire the obstetrics community to better understand NVP/HG, including treatments and outcomes. Though pregnant individuals are a controversial study population, high-quality research is necessary to bridge this gap. Effective therapeutics for NVP/HG will give patients a better outlook on pregnancy and an improved relationship with their healthcare experience.

### Practice bulletin no. 153: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^114NMNyC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition that affects the health of the pregnant woman and her fetus. It can diminish the woman's quality of life and significantly contribute to health care costs and time lost from work. Because "morning sickness" is common in early pregnancy, the presence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be minimized by obstetricians, other obstetric providers, and pregnant women and, thus, undertreated. Furthermore, some women do not seek treatment due to concerns about the safety of medications. Once nausea and vomiting of pregnancy progresses, it can become more difficult to control symptoms; treatment in the early stages may prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization. Mild cases of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be resolved with lifestyle and dietary changes, and safe and effective treatments are available for more severe cases. The woman's perception of the severity of her symptoms plays a critical role in deciding whether, when, and how to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. In addition, nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be distinguished from nausea and vomiting related to other causes. The purpose of this document is to review the best available evidence about the diagnosis and management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

### The teratogenicity of drugs for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: perceived versus true risk [^113Zgcdt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Women and health care providers commonly overestimate the teratogenic risk of medications in pregnancy. Regarding nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, this misconception leads to an underutilization of pharmacologic therapy. In some circumstances, pregnancy termination has even been elected when safe and effective alternatives for nausea have not been attempted. The misperception of teratogenic risk partly results from how safety data are presented. Awareness of this issue can lead to more balanced educational materials for patients and physicians. To facilitate the rational use of medicinal and non-medicinal therapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, we have developed an algorithm based on a recent systematic review of safety and efficacy in managing the problem. The hierarchical use of medication is based on the strength of evidence of fetal safety.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of corticosteroids for hyperemesis due to pregnancy [^115AWg4x]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy for which there is no proven pharmacological treatment, is the third leading cause of hospitalization during pregnancy. Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting due to cancer chemotherapy-induced emesis and might prove useful in hyperemesis gravidarum.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 126 women who had not responded to outpatient therapy for hyperemesis gravidarum during the first half of pregnancy. Intravenous methylprednisolone (125 mg) was followed by an oral prednisone taper (40 mg for 1 day, 20 mg for 3 days, 10 mg for 3 days, 5 mg for 7 days) versus an identical-appearing placebo regimen. All women also received promethazine 25 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously every 6 hours for 24 hours, followed by the same regimen administered orally as needed until discharge. The primary study outcome was the number of women requiring rehospitalization for hyperemesis gravidarum.

A total of 110 women delivered at our hospital and had pregnancy outcomes available for analysis; 56 were randomized to corticosteroids and 54 were administered placebo. Nineteen women in each study group required rehospitalization (34% versus 35%, P = 0.89, for corticosteroids versus placebo, respectively).

The addition of parenteral and oral corticosteroids to the treatment of women with hyperemesis gravidarum did not reduce the need for rehospitalization later in pregnancy.

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^113EHRi1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

The variation in treatment practices and costs across different studies highlights the need for standardized care protocols. Implementing consistent guidelines, which can help reduce unnecessary hospital admissions, improve timely care, and reduce associated costs, are important factors in providing effective and cost-effective care. The included studies demonstrated that costs related to NVP and HG escalate as the severity of the disease increases. Evidence from another randomized trial indicated that early intervention and treatment have the potential to mitigate the severity of symptoms. Consequently, there is an implication that early intervention may yield cost benefits.

Investigation of the effectiveness of early intervention of treatments and models of care is important, and should include the role of optimal and early management in preventing the progression of NVP and HG. Studies exploring the cost-effectiveness of the management of NVP and HG in various models of maternity care in the review were both from the UK. Further research is required to investigate the implementation of these specialized units in an Australian context. Currently, women may not encounter maternity services until 12–16 weeks' gestation, by which time they may have significantly advanced illness. Prior to this, women with NVP/HG are often managed in the general patient population (through emergency departments and/or general practice). Providing earlier specialized pregnancy care with midwives and obstetricians, with specialized knowledge, may be highly beneficial.

### Resident obstetricians' awareness of the oral health component in management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^1169TF9p]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common in early pregnancy, occurring in 50–90% of pregnant women between the 4th and 7th week after the last menstrual cycle, and resolve in all but 10% of these women. Many obstetricians encounter this problem and should be familiar with the probable outcomes and treatment options. Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy are usually self-limiting conditions. Women with uncomplicated nausea and vomiting of pregnancy have been noted to have improved pregnancy outcomes compared to those with complications.

Improving the oral health of pregnant women prevents complications of dental diseases during pregnancy. Maternal oral diseases have been associated with pre-term births, the development of pre-eclampsia, and the delivery of a "small-for-gestational-age" infant, which could lead to infant mortality and morbidity. Nausea and vomiting may cause a woman to avoid routine oral health practices such as tooth brushing and flossing, potentially leading to dental caries and gingivitis, the most common oral disease during pregnancy with a prevalence rate of 60–75%. Periodontitis, a bacterial infection detectable in up to 30% of pregnant women, has been linked with adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as pre-term delivery and low birth weight among infants.

Food cravings induced by pregnancy may lead to frequent consumption of foods high in carbohydrates, increasing the risk of dental caries. Tooth erosion can result from nausea and vomiting of pregnancy due to the hydrochloric acid content.

### Ginger for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy: randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial [^1165CQtd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

To determine the effectiveness of ginger for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, a study was conducted involving women who first attended an antenatal clinic at or before 17 weeks' gestation. Over a 5-month period, 70 eligible women consented to participate and were randomized in a double-masked design to receive either oral ginger (1 g per day) or an identical placebo for 4 days. Subjects graded the severity of their nausea using visual analog scales and recorded the number of vomiting episodes in the previous 24 hours before treatment and again during 4 consecutive days while taking the treatment. At a follow-up visit 7 days later, five-item Likert scales were used to assess the severity of their symptoms.

All participants, except three in the placebo group, remained in the study. The visual analog scores, comparing posttherapy and baseline nausea, decreased significantly in the ginger group (2.1 ± 1.9) compared to the placebo group (0.9 ± 2.2, P = 0.014). The number of vomiting episodes also decreased significantly in the ginger group (1.4 ± 1.3) compared to the placebo group (0.3 ± 1.1, P < 0.001). Likert scales showed that 28 of 32 in the ginger group experienced an improvement in nausea symptoms compared to 10 of 35 in the placebo group (P < 0.001). No adverse effects of ginger on pregnancy outcomes were detected.

In conclusion, ginger was found to be effective for relieving the severity of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.

### Interventions for treating hyperemesis gravidarum [^1158rPHw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, affecting 0.3% to 1.0% of pregnancies, and is one of the most common indications for hospitalization during pregnancy. While a previous Cochrane review examined interventions for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, there has not yet been a review examining the interventions for the more severe condition of hyperemesis gravidarum.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of all interventions for hyperemesis gravidarum in pregnancy up to 20 weeks' gestation.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field's Trials Register on 20 December 2015, along with reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of any intervention for hyperemesis gravidarum. Quasi-randomized trials and trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion. We excluded trials on nausea and vomiting of pregnancy that were not specifically studying the more severe condition of hyperemesis gravidarum.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently reviewed the eligibility of trials, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. Data were checked for accuracy.

- **Main results**: Twenty-five trials (involving 2052 women) met the inclusion criteria. However, the majority of the 18 different comparisons described in the review included data from single studies with small numbers of participants. The comparisons covered a range of interventions, including acupressure/acupuncture, among others.

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^112iNSkw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

This study clearly highlights common limitations encountered in health economic studies. A systematic review has revealed variations in the methods used to estimate costs, particularly societal costs, including non-healthcare expenses, creating limitations to using these studies to inform treatment and policy. Additionally, the quality appraisal of the evidence has revealed methodological concerns, particularly in navigating the uncertainty of cost estimates and the lack of sensitivity analysis. These limitations underscore the need for improved methodological rigor and a comprehensive approach in future studies.

- **Future directions**: Given the prevalence and impact of NVP and HG on women and society, greater investment in models of care and understanding of country-specific requirements is urgently needed. Highlighting the economic burden of NVP and HG, in addition to the well-documented physical and psychological suffering endured by women, can help inform policy and practice. It can also contribute to further research on methods to improve therapy and service utilization to manage this condition. Conducting economic evaluations of models of care to inform resource allocation decisions would assist in recommendations for effective funding allocation and help advocate for more effective treatment pathways for women.

### Assessment of management approaches for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: A retrospective questionnaire analysis [^112VfY3H]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

A total of 786 participants responded to the survey, and 1002 pregnancies were analyzed. Voluntary respondents completed a survey for each living biological child. Besides gathering demographic data, the survey assessed participants for symptoms congruent with hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), medication usage, and side effects. The majority of responses came from White Americans. Our data shows that 60.6% of respondents were formally diagnosed with HG, while 4.3% were unsure of their diagnosis.

- **Respondent demographics**: The survey assessed ethnicity and race, with participants residing in the United States and abroad. Respondents indicated whether they had ever been diagnosed by a healthcare provider with hyperemesis gravidarum.

- **Medication usage**: Of those diagnosed with HG, 22.4% took three medications, 15.3% took four, and 19.4% took five or more. No associations were found between HG diagnosis and subjective, self-reported medication compliance. Ondansetron was the most used medication by patients with HG, followed by pantoprazole, metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, prochlorperazine, promethazine, doxylamine, and vitamin B complex.

The expectation under H₀ is the response percentage under a perfect allocation by group, assuming no effect; these expected values are calculated from a contingency table of the data. The larger the observed bars deviate from the expectation, the larger the effect in that group.

The medical management of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, with a particular focus on antiemetics, is addressed by the RCOG 2024 guidelines. They recommend that healthcare providers inquire about any previous adverse reactions patients may have had to antiemetic therapies. If adverse reactions are observed, the medication should be promptly discontinued.

### Treatment of nausea in pregnancy: A cross-sectional multinational web-based study of pregnant women and new mothers [^116y4LhQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) is one of the most common pregnancy-related complaints, affecting millions of pregnant women worldwide each year. Approximately 7 out of 10 women experience nausea during pregnancy, and 50% experience both nausea and vomiting. For most patients, symptoms appear around the sixth week of pregnancy and gradually decline during the second trimester, peaking at 8–13 weeks. However, 10% of women will still experience symptoms after 20–22 weeks of pregnancy. The most severe form of NVP, hyperemesis gravidarum, is characterized by severe and persistent nausea and vomiting leading to weight loss, ketonuria, nutritional deficiencies, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance, often so severe as to merit hospitalization, and it affects about 1.1% of pregnant women.

NVP has been shown to greatly impact a woman's life, negatively affecting daily activities, relationships with partners, parenting, occupation, and social functioning. Feelings of isolation, fatigue, depression, and helplessness due to nausea have also been described. Nausea has been reported to be responsible for 33% of all sick leave during pregnancy. In the United States and Canada, NVP is a significant economic burden to women and society.

Because NVP is often most intense during the first trimester when organogenesis occurs, teratogenic effects are a concern in treatment. This may lead to caution in prescribing and taking conventional medicines to treat this condition, despite the proven safety of use during pregnancy of many medicines. Pregnant women often overestimate the teratogenic risks associated with pharmaceuticals.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome: Pathophysiology, comorbidities, and future research directions [^117QFyT2]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

There is a great need to identify and validate therapies to develop better prophylaxis measures and to abort acute emetic episodes in cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). The healthcare costs due to hospitalizations from CVS are high, amounting to $200 million annually based on a nationwide inpatient sample. This number does not include the additional staggering costs associated with medication therapies, emergency department care, outpatient visits and procedures, and lost time at work or in schooling due to CVS. These observations underscore the need for developing effective and safe therapies in CVS and reducing healthcare utilization.

Deficiencies of existing small, single‐center case series include poor patient characterization, a lack of validated instruments to quantify symptoms and healthcare utilization, and a failure to conduct trials in a controlled fashion. Several issues must be considered when designing CVS treatment trials, and barriers to conducting such trials should be acknowledged.

- **Treatment trial considerations**: Such treatment trials should consider both outpatient preventative protocols in addition to abortive therapies to be taken at home and parenteral treatments provided in an outpatient setting. This includes venues such as an infusion clinic or urgent care center, the emergency department, and inpatient settings.
- **Focus of trials**: Furthermore, these trials should look at the organization and processes of care as well as the comparative efficacy of multidrug protocols for well‐defined subsets of patients.

### Antiemetic treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum in 1,064 Norwegian women and the impact of European warning on metoclopramide: A retrospective cohort study 2002–2019 [^112GXCLA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Women suffering from severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, known as hyperemesis gravidarum, experience poor quality of life and an increased risk of potentially fatal maternal and fetal complications. There is increasing and reassuring knowledge about the safety of antiemetics in pregnancy. In 2013, the European Medical Agency (EMA) issued a warning on metoclopramide, limiting its treatment use to a maximum of five days. Metoclopramide was the most used antiemetic during pregnancy at the time the warning was implemented in the Norwegian hyperemesis guidelines in 2014. This study aimed to describe changes in the treatment of hyperemesis over time, including changes associated with the EMA warning.

- **Methods**: Retrospective chart review of all women hospitalized for hyperemesis gravidarum with metabolic disturbances between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2019, at a university hospital serving nearly 10% of the pregnant population in Norway. Time-series analysis described changes over time, and interrupted time series analysis quantified changes in treatment and clinical outcomes related to the EMA warning.

- **Results**: In total, 1,064 women (1.2% of the birthing population) were included. The use of meclizine, prochlorperazine, and ondansetron increased from 2002 to 2019. This led to a yearly increase in the percentage of women using any antiemetic of 1.5% (95% CI 0.6; 2.4) pre-hospital, 0.6% (95% CI 0.2; 1.1) during hospitalization, and 2.6% (95% CI 1.3; 3.8) at discharge. Overall, only 50% of the women received antiemetics pre-hospital. Following the EMA warning, prehospital use of metoclopramide dropped by 30% (95% CI 2%).

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189 summary: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^116yxJaJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the use of ondansetron PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it should be used only if clearly needed. The ACOG and SOGC guidelines suggest ondansetron as an adjunctive therapy for severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy when other antiemetic combinations have failed. The RCOG guidelines recommend reassuring pregnant women about the very small increase in the absolute risk of orofacial clefting with ondansetron use in the first trimester, while also considering the risks of poorly managed hyperemesis gravidarum.

Ondansetron PO is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an observed increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### Systematic druggable genome-wide Mendelian randomization identifies therapeutic targets for hyperemesis gravidarum [^11756R5g]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is a common disorder in pregnancy with a relatively benign course. However, the most severe form, hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), is associated with adverse maternal, fetal, and offspring outcomes. HG is the leading cause of hospitalization in the first trimester, generally occurring in 0.3 to 10.8% of pregnancies.

HG refers to severe vomiting and simple dietary modification, leading to weight loss, ketonuria, nutritional deficiencies, electrolyte disturbances, preterm birth, and even maternal death. Despite significant advances in our understanding of HG, it remains a condition with a complex etiology that is not fully understood. Recent research, however, has implicated the growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) as a significant factor in the pathogenesis of HG.

While several treatments, including ondansetron and other antiemetics, have demonstrated efficacy in managing HG symptoms, the variability in treatment response underscores the need for more effective therapies. It is crucial to continue developing and identifying novel treatments, as HG can have profound impacts on affected individuals, including therapeutic terminations of pregnancy due to the severity of symptoms, suicidal ideation, and increased risks for adverse outcomes for both the mother and child.

A large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT) is the most efficient method to estimate drug treatment strategies; however, it requires substantial preparation, economic support, and time for design and implementation.

### Comparison of the prevalence and severity of nausea and vomiting in the first trimester between singleton pregnancies conceived from stimulated in vitro fertilization and frozen embryo transfer cycles [^112sT3V2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting affect 70–80% of pregnant women and can range from mild "morning sickness" to severe hyperemesis gravidarum. The latter may cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, weight loss, dehydration, and deranged renal function requiring hospitalization.

The pathogenesis of nausea and vomiting is likely multifactorial, though the exact mechanism remains unknown. Women on oral contraceptive pills or hormonal replacement therapy may experience nausea and vomiting, suggesting a possible role of oestrogen and progesterone. Both of these hormones are thought to contribute by delaying gastric emptying. Oestrogen stimulates the production of nitric oxide via nitrogen oxidase synthetase, causing a slowing of the gastric intestinal transit time and gastric emptying via smooth muscle relaxation. One study found that women with hyperemesis gravidarum have 26% higher serum levels of oestradiol compared to controls. Additionally, it has been shown that nausea and vomiting are more severe in obese women who have higher oestrogen levels. However, the effect of oestrogen in causing nausea and vomiting remains inconsistent, as a review showed that only 5 out of 17 studies demonstrated a positive relationship between nausea and vomiting and serum oestrogen levels. Progesterone causes nausea and vomiting by reducing smooth muscle contractility and affecting gastric emptying. One study demonstrated an additive effect of oestradiol and progesterone co-administration in delaying gastric emptying, as evidenced by increased gastric slow-wave rhythm.

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^114L5ZH5]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Low credibility.

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting, which typically begins by the fourth week and disappears by the sixteenth week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown, but it may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, characterized by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy? What are the effects of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harm alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 22 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupressure, acupuncture, antihistamines, corticosteroids, corticotrophins, diazepam, dietary interventions other than ginger, domperidone, and ginger.

### Evaluation and treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults [^115tX9y8]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can reduce quality of life and indicate life-threatening illness. Acute nausea and vomiting last up to 7 days. In the absence of alarm symptoms, they are typically treated symptomatically and without an extensive evaluation. Typical causes include gastroenteritis or other viral syndromes, foodborne illness, acute migraine headaches, vestibular disturbances, early pregnancy, and adverse effects of medication. Chronic nausea and vomiting last 4 weeks or longer and have a broad differential diagnosis. Causes can be gastrointestinal, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or related to medications and toxins.

A careful history of related factors is essential to guide the initial evaluation and narrow the differential diagnosis. These factors include associated symptoms, timing of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating or relieving factors, alarm symptoms, medication and substance use, relationship with recent food ingestion, and comorbidities.

Nonpharmacologic management options include fluid and electrolyte replacement; small, frequent meals; and avoidance of trigger foods. Antiemetic drugs effectively reduce symptoms of acute nausea and vomiting, but chronic symptoms are often more challenging to treat. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist can be used. However, medications may also target the suspected cause of symptoms and the neurotransmitters involved in central and peripheral pathways of nausea and vomiting. Pharmacologic therapy should be used for the shortest duration possible to minimize side effects.

### Interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^114bSzSe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are the most common symptoms experienced in early pregnancy, with nausea affecting between 70% and 85% of women. About half of pregnant women experience vomiting.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different methods of treating nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (December 2002) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2002).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of any treatment for nausea and/or vomiting in early pregnancy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers assessed the trial quality and extracted the data independently.

- **Main results**: Twenty-eight trials met the inclusion criteria. For milder degrees of nausea and vomiting, 21 trials were included. These trials were of variable quality. Nausea treatments were different antihistamine medications, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), the combination tablet Debendox (Bendectin), P6 acupressure, and ginger. For hyperemesis gravidarum, seven trials were identified testing treatments with oral ginger root extract, oral or injected corticosteroids, injected adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), intravenous diazepam, and acupuncture. Based on 12 trials, there was an overall reduction in nausea from anti-emetic medication (odds ratio 0.16, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.33).

- **Reviewer's conclusions**: Anti-emetic medication appears to reduce the frequency of nausea in early pregnancy. There is some evidence of adverse effects, but there is very little information available.

### Serotonin syndrome after treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^114tGFgv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy often require pharmacotherapy for symptom management. Serotonin syndrome is a rare clinical entity that can be precipitated by the medications used to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

- **Case**: A 35-year-old pregnant individual with a history of hyperemesis gravidarum in an earlier pregnancy requiring prolonged hospitalization presented with nausea and vomiting at 7 weeks of gestation. She was incidentally found to have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection when she was universally screened at the time of admission. She required pharmacotherapy, including prochlorperazine and ondansetron for the treatment of nausea as well as sumatriptan for migraine. She developed acute spasticity, autonomic dysfunction, and temperature rise, precipitated by antiemetic therapy, consistent with serotonin syndrome. The syndrome resolved with supportive care and benzodiazepines.

- **Conclusion**: Serotonin syndrome is a serious clinical entity that can be provoked by the pharmacotherapy given to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. This medical emergency requires early recognition and prompt management.

### Assessment of management approaches for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: A retrospective questionnaire analysis [^114aHr32]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum is the most severe form of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, often referred to as morning sickness. Approximately 2% of pregnancies in the United States are affected by hyperemesis gravidarum, which is characterized by severe vomiting in pregnant individuals, particularly during the first trimester. This often leads to hypovolemia and weight loss. The standard of care for hyperemesis and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is commonly ineffective. We hypothesize that, based on patient experience, the treatment guidelines for hyperemesis are not clinically effective. Our objective was to identify the efficacy of the various management approaches currently in place for hyperemesis and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

- **Methods**: A questionnaire was designed based on diagnostic criteria, standard demographic identifiers, and common medications for the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum. This questionnaire was distributed online through hyperemesis and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy support groups, personal social media, and institutional email.

- **Results**: In our study, most participants diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum trialed at least three medications, most of which were ineffective and/or had severe side effects. The most commonly used medication for treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum is ondansetron, a standard antiemetic. Fatigue and constipation were the most reported side effects. All data was coded as categorical and analyzed using contingency tables with Mantel-Haenszel Chi square tests.

### Improving management of patients with hyperemesis [^114pr1Gp]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), defined as severe nausea and vomiting resulting in dehydration, is a common reason for emergency admission in gynaecology. The management of HG is supportive, focusing on the correction of dehydration and electrolyte disturbances and the use of antiemetics.

An audit in our unit identified that women with HG were not receiving appropriate fluid resuscitation, particularly in terms of inadequate potassium replacement. A proforma was developed by a multidisciplinary team to prompt appropriate investigations, medications, and fluid resuscitation. The proforma was introduced both in paper format and electronically, accompanied by an education programme for junior doctors.

This intervention has improved prescribing practice and fluid resuscitation for these patients. The length of admission has been reduced. Efforts have been made to ensure this change is sustainable in the long term through the involvement of junior doctors using the proforma at all stages of the project.

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^113fPfJS]. American Family Physician (2014). High credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy affect nearly 75% of pregnant women. The exact cause is unknown. In most cases, it is a mild, self-limited condition that can be controlled with conservative measures and has no adverse fetal sequelae. About 1% of women develop hyperemesis gravidarum, which may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and fetus. Patients with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be evaluated for other causes, particularly if symptoms are unremitting or presentation is atypical.

Initial treatment is conservative and includes dietary changes, emotional support, and vitamin B6 supplementation. Several safe and effective pharmacologic therapies are available for women who do not improve with initial treatment. Women with hyperemesis gravidarum may require more aggressive interventions, including hospitalization, rehydration therapy, and parenteral nutrition.

### Prepregnancy metformin use associated with lower risk of severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum [^114dPCPF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

Severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum are associated with adverse maternal, fetal, and child outcomes, with recurrence risks as high as 89%. Identifying an effective, safe, and affordable method to prevent hyperemesis gravidarum is critical to reducing this risk and improving health outcomes for mothers, fetuses, and children. Recent findings suggest that genetic predisposition to hyperemesis gravidarum is mediated by low pre-pregnancy levels of the emetogenic hormone growth and differentiation factor 15, resulting in hypersensitivity to its rapid increase during pregnancy. Since metformin increases circulating levels of this factor, it is hypothesized that its use before pregnancy might desensitize patients to the hormone, thereby lowering the risk of severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum.

- **Objective**: The objective of the study is to determine whether daily use of metformin is associated with a reduced risk of severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum.

- **Study design**: A structured questionnaire was utilized, targeting visitors to the Hyperemesis Gravidarum Education and Research Foundation's social media sites from January 2023 to September 2024. Participants reported daily use of 32 common substances in the month preceding each pregnancy and their levels of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Both crude and multivariate associations between the use of each substance and the occurrence of severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy/hyperemesis gravidarum in subsequent pregnancies were estimated through logistic regression.

### Helicobacter pylori infection: a predictor of vomiting severity in pregnancy and adverse birth outcome [^1148VDgL]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Nausea and occasional vomiting in early pregnancy is common. Why some women experience severe nausea and occasional vomiting in early pregnancy is unknown. Causes are multifactorial and only symptomatic treatment options are available, although adverse birth outcomes have been described. Helicobacter pylori infection has been implicated in the cause of nausea and occasional vomiting in early pregnancy.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of H. pylori with vomiting severity in pregnancy and its effect on birth outcome.

- **Study design**: We assembled a population-based prospective cohort of pregnant women in The Netherlands. Enrollment took place between 2002 and 2006. H. pylori serology was determined in mid-gestation. Women reported whether they experienced vomiting in early, mid, and late gestation. Maternal weight was measured in the same time periods. Birth outcomes were obtained from medical records. The main outcome measures were vomiting frequency (no, occasional, daily) and duration (early, mid, late gestation), maternal weight gain, birthweight, small for gestational age, and prematurity. Data were analyzed with the use of multivariate regression.

- **Results**: We included 5549 women, of whom 1932 (34.8%) reported occasional vomiting and 601 (10.8%) reported daily vomiting. Women who were H. pylori-positive (n = 2363) were more likely to report daily vomiting (adjusted odds ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.16–1.78). H. pylori positivity was associated with a reduction of total weight gain in women with daily vomiting.

### The impact and management of hyperemesis gravidarum: Current and future perspectives [^1177V1cr]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy affecting approximately 1%-3% of pregnancies worldwide. It is the most common reason for hospital admission in early pregnancy. HG can have lasting consequences for both pregnant individuals and their offspring. Best-practice management includes symptomatic treatment with anti-emetic pharmacological interventions, rehydration if needed, and psychological support. However, there is a lack of high-quality evidence on the treatment for HG. Future research should focus on understanding the cause and developing effective treatments to limit the burden of the disease on patients and healthcare systems.

### Treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting in pregnancy: A systematic review [^1122WsJU]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting affect approximately 85% of pregnant women. The most severe form, hyperemesis gravidarum, affects up to 3% of women and can have significant adverse physical and psychological sequelae.

The objective of this review was to summarize evidence on effective treatments for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum.

- **Evidence review**: Databases were searched up to June 8, 2016. Relevant websites and bibliographies were also searched. Titles and abstracts were assessed independently by two reviewers. Results were narratively synthesized; planned meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity and incomplete reporting of findings.

- **Findings**: Seventy-eight studies (n = 8930 participants) were included, consisting of 67 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 11 nonrandomized studies. Evidence from 35 RCTs at low risk of bias indicated that ginger, vitamin B6, antihistamines, metoclopramide (for mild symptoms), pyridoxine-doxylamine, and ondansetron (for moderate symptoms) were associated with improved symptoms compared with placebo. One RCT (n = 86) reported greater improvements in moderate symptoms following psychotherapy (change in Rhodes score [range, 0 {no symptoms} to 40 {worst possible symptoms}], 18.76 [SD, 5.48] to 7.06 [SD, 5.79] for intervention vs 19.18 [SD, 5.63] to 12.81 [SD, 6.88] for comparator [p < 0.001]). For moderate-severe symptoms, one RCT (n = 60) suggested that the pyridoxine-doxylamine combination taken preemptively reduced the risk of recurrence of moderate-severe symptoms compared with treatment once symptoms begin (15.4% vs. 39.1% [p < 0.04]).

### Managing hyperemesis gravidarum: A multimodal challenge [^1145Y2Ja]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Up to 90% of pregnant women experience nausea and vomiting. When prolonged or severe, this condition is referred to as hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), which can, in individual cases, be life-threatening. In this article, the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment strategies are presented based on a selective literature review. Treatment strategies range from outpatient dietary advice and antiemetic drugs to hospitalization and intravenous (IV) fluid replacement in persistent or severe cases. Alternative methods, such as acupuncture, are not yet evidence-based but sometimes have a therapeutic effect. In most cases, the condition is self-limiting and subsides by around 20 weeks' gestation. More severe forms require medical intervention once other organic causes of nausea and vomiting have been excluded. In addition, a psychosomatic approach is often helpful. In view of its potential complexity, general practitioners and obstetricians should be well-informed about HG, and therapy should be multimodal.

### ACOG practice bulletin No. 189 summary: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^114Jf5uj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the use of ondansetron hydrochloride PO (also known as Zofran) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if clearly needed. The ACOG and SOGC guidelines suggest ondansetron as an adjunctive therapy for severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy when other antiemetic combinations have failed. The RCOG guidelines suggest reassuring pregnant women about the very small increase in the absolute risk of orofacial clefting with ondansetron use in the first trimester, while also considering the risks of poorly managed hyperemesis gravidarum.

The drug ondansetron hydrochloride PO (also known as Zofran) is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage.

### Hyperemesis gravidarum [^117WqKbi]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2019). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on nausea and vomiting of pregnancy:

- **Definition**: NVOP, often referred to as morning sickness, is a common condition affecting the majority of pregnancies. It typically presents in the first trimester and is characterized by mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting. HG is a more severe form of NVOP characterized by excessive, persistent nausea and vomiting, leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, weight loss, and hospital admission.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of NVOP is not fully understood, but it is believed that a combination of hormonal changes, gastric dysrhythmias, and heightened olfactory and gustatory sensitivity may contribute to its development. Pregnancy-related hormones, such as progesterone, estrogen, and hCG, have been widely studied. Other hormones, such as leptin, placental GH, prolactin, thyroid, and adrenal cortical hormones, have also been implicated. Additionally, infectious, immunological, psychological, metabolic, and anatomical factors may play a role in its onset.

- **Epidemiology**: Nausea during pregnancy is reported in about 50–80% of individuals, with nausea and vomiting occurring in approximately 50%, and HG affecting about 0.3–3% of pregnant individuals.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for NVOP and HG include a history of these conditions in previous pregnancies, multiple pregnancy, and maternal age. Other factors, such as obesity, dysmenorrhea, motion sickness, migraine, and a history of psychiatric disorders, have also been associated with NVOP and HG.

### Complications in early pregnancy [^112jvSNK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

Early in pregnancy, women frequently experience nausea, vomiting, and vaginal bleeding. Nausea and vomiting can be mild, managed by dietary modifications and medications, or severe, requiring intravenous fluids and medications. Care should be used when selecting medications for nausea to avoid additional side effects or potential harm to the developing fetus.

When evaluating vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy must be ruled out. If an intrauterine pregnancy is seen, threatened miscarriage should be considered, and the patient appropriately counseled. If neither intrauterine pregnancy nor ectopic pregnancy can be established, a management algorithm for pregnancy of unknown location is presented.

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^112iJbZv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

The substantial economic burden associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) suggests a need for better resource allocation. This includes funding for specialized care units, such as day-stay or other outpatient services, which showed cost benefits in two studies in this review.

Original studies were methodologically and clinically diverse, including variations in country of origin, perspective, source of cost input data, and transparency of reporting. Appropriate consideration of country-specific health systems is vital when considering the implications of these results. In the study results which provided a per-patient cost, the US-based study had an average cost of over USD $60,000 per pregnancy. In comparison, the Canadian study showed weekly costs of USD $880, which, when extrapolated over 36 weeks of pregnancy, amounted to an average cost near USD $30,000. This discrepancy likely reflects the different costs of care in each healthcare system.

The implementation and allocation of resources for health services in countries such as Australia occur through federal and state-based allocation, with additional private models of care available through private health insurers and personal contributions. While this review demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of a hospital-based day-stay model of care in the UK, the feasibility of its implementation in Australian metropolitan versus rural and remote communities — due to unique geographic and demographic conditions — requires consideration of funding for issues of equity.
