## Question

Is CHADSVASC and HASBLED score applicator in a 93 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores are applicable and how to interpret them in a 93-year-old with atrial fibrillation, including what to do when bleeding risk is high and stroke risk is very high. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the competing risks of stroke and bleeding in extreme old age. Then, I should verify the components and thresholds for CHA2DS2-VASc and how age ≥ 75 years is handled. Next, I will review HAS-BLED components and its intended use. After that, I should confirm guideline positions on anticoagulation thresholds and whether a high HAS-BLED score should preclude therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, geriatric-focused recommendation with monitoring and risk-modification steps, and double-check for any caveats or exceptions that might change management in this 93-year-old patient.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. In a 93-year-old with atrial fibrillation, stroke risk rises steeply with age, and bleeding risk rises in parallel, creating a classic risk–benefit tension. Importantly, contemporary guidance emphasizes that bleeding risk should be used to identify and mitigate modifiable factors rather than to deny indicated anticoagulation, especially when stroke risk is high [^111Arhcd] [^115GsRLJ].

> I will now examine CHA2DS2-VASc applicability and scoring in this age group. Wait, let me verify the age thresholds: age 65–74 years adds 1 point, and age ≥ 75 years adds 2 points, so a 93-year-old automatically receives 2 points for age alone. The score remains valid across the full adult age spectrum, including patients older than those in many derivation cohorts, and its performance has been repeatedly validated in older adults, albeit with modest discrimination as with most clinical scores [^111aEBDA] [^112JdCMk] [^116s1aN1].

> Next, I should review HAS-BLED applicability. Hold on, I should verify the "elderly" component: HAS-BLED awards 1 point for age > 65 years, so a 93-year-old automatically receives 1 point for age. The score was designed for AF patients on or being considered for anticoagulation and has been validated in diverse cohorts, including older adults, though its predictive performance is modest and should complement — not replace — clinical judgment [^112ydz3S] [^112JGqpz] [^1139wwoj].

> Let me think about the likely risk profile in this 93-year-old. Even if no other risk factors are present beyond age, the CHA2DS2-VASc score is at least 2, which corresponds to an annual stroke risk around 2.2% per year; with additional comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, vascular disease, or female sex, the score and absolute stroke risk climb quickly, often into the 4–6% per year range or higher in very elderly patients, reinforcing the strong indication for oral anticoagulation when stroke risk is ≥ 2% per year [^112ERf29] [^112yBTNS].

> Now, I should confirm how to interpret HAS-BLED here. Age alone already places this patient at HAS-BLED ≥ 1, and common comorbidities in the oldest old — renal impairment, prior stroke, uncontrolled hypertension, antiplatelet use, or hepatic dysfunction — can easily push the score to 3 or higher, which flags high bleeding risk and mandates closer follow-up and aggressive modification of reversible risks. Crucially, a high HAS-BLED is not a reason to withhold indicated anticoagulation, but rather a prompt to mitigate bleeding hazards and monitor more frequently [^115GsRLJ] [^111Arhcd] [^112JGqpz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify guideline thresholds for anticoagulation. Contemporary ACC/AHA and AHA/ASA guidance recommend oral anticoagulation for men with CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 and women with CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 3, and consider anticoagulation at intermediate risk (about 1–2% per year), which in practice corresponds to CHA2DS2-VASc 1 in men or 2 in women; in a 93-year-old, the baseline score is already 2, so anticoagulation is indicated unless there are overriding contraindications or a compelling alternative strategy such as left atrial appendage occlusion in carefully selected, high-bleeding-risk patients [^112yBTNS] [^114sKXey] [^113TsaMT].

> I need to ensure the decision framework integrates both scores appropriately. The net clinical benefit generally favors anticoagulation in high stroke risk patients even when bleeding risk is elevated, provided modifiable bleeding risks are addressed. Scores should be recalculated regularly because both stroke and bleeding risks are dynamic, and shared decision-making with the patient or surrogate is essential given the high stakes in extreme old age [^111Arhcd] [^115GsRLJ] [^115ttd2n].

> Let me consider practical risk modification and monitoring. I should confirm blood pressure control, review and deprescribe interacting medications such as NSAIDs when possible, assess renal and hepatic function to guide agent selection and dosing, correct anemia, and consider gastroprotection such as a PPI if gastrointestinal bleeding risk is present. For a 93-year-old, I would favor a DOAC with lower intracranial hemorrhage risk, such as apixaban or edoxaban, and plan early follow-up within 2–4 weeks after initiation to reassess tolerance, renal function, and any bleeding signals, aligning with quality indicators that call for dynamic reassessment of stroke and bleeding risk at each visit [^111Arhcd] [^111GFwVk] [^11369Unb].

> But wait, what if the patient has very high bleeding risk or has already had a major bleed? I should double-check the guidance on restarting or substituting therapy. Even after a bleeding event, most patients with persistent AF and high stroke risk benefit from restarting anticoagulation once the bleeding source is addressed and reversible contributors are corrected; in those with truly prohibitive bleeding risk and suitable anatomy and life expectancy, left atrial appendage occlusion can be considered as an alternative to long-term oral anticoagulation, recognizing that this is a nuanced, device-based pathway requiring multidisciplinary evaluation [^111cBg6Z] [^113TsaMT].

> In summary, I should confirm that both CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED are applicable in a 93-year-old with AF. Age alone yields at least 2 points on CHA2DS2-VASc and 1 point on HAS-BLED, almost always placing the patient in a category where anticoagulation is indicated for stroke prevention, with HAS-BLED used to flag high bleeding risk for closer follow-up and risk-factor modification rather than as a reason to withhold therapy. Individualized agent selection, vigilant monitoring, and shared decision-making are essential in this very elderly patient [^111aEBDA] [^112yBTNS] [^115GsRLJ].

---

Yes, CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED are applicable to a 93-year-old with atrial fibrillation, but **interpretation must be cautious** because age ≥ 75 years adds 2 points to CHA2DS2-VASc and 1 point to HAS-BLED, often placing patients at high stroke and bleeding risk. CHA2DS2-VASc reliably identifies patients who benefit from anticoagulation, while HAS-BLED highlights bleeding risk and guides mitigation; **a high HAS-BLED should not automatically preclude anticoagulation**. Use shared decision-making, reassess frequently, and tailor therapy to comorbidities and patient preferences [^111Arhcd] [^114YJjwt].

## Applicability of CHA2DS2-VASc in a 93-year-old patient

### Components and scoring of CHA2DS2-VASc

The CHA2DS2-VASc score includes:

- **Congestive heart failure/left ventricular dysfunction**: 1 point
- **Hypertension**: 1 point
- **Age ≥ 75 years**: 2 points
- **Diabetes mellitus**: 1 point
- **Stroke/TIA/thromboembolism**: 2 points
- **Vascular disease (MI, PAD, aortic plaque)**: 1 point
- **Age 65–74 years**: 1 point
- **Female sex**: 1 point

In a 93-year-old, **age ≥ 75 years automatically adds 2 points**, so even with no other risk factors the minimum score is 2, indicating at least a moderate stroke risk and supporting anticoagulation consideration [^112yBTNS].

---

### Clinical implications of CHA2DS2-VASc in elderly patients

- **Stroke risk**: Stroke risk rises with higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores; in very elderly patients, scores are often ≥ 2, indicating substantial annual stroke risk and supporting anticoagulation [^112yBTNS].
- **Validation**: CHA2DS2-VASc is validated in older adults, including those ≥ 75 years, and remains the standard for stroke risk stratification in AF [^112JdCMk].
- **Limitations**: The score's predictive accuracy is modest (C-statistics ~0.6–0.7), and very elderly patients may have unique risks not fully captured (e.g. frailty, falls, cognitive impairment) [^116s1aN1].

---

## Applicability of HAS-BLED in a 93-year-old patient

### Components and scoring of HAS-BLED

The HAS-BLED score includes:

- **Hypertension (uncontrolled)**: 1 point
- **Abnormal renal function**: 1 point
- **Abnormal liver function**: 1 point
- **Stroke**: 1 point
- **Bleeding history or predisposition**: 1 point
- **Labile INR**: 1 point
- **Elderly (age ≥ 65 years)**: 1 point
- **Drugs/alcohol (antiplatelets, NSAIDs, alcohol)**: 1 point

In a 93-year-old, **age ≥ 65 years automatically adds 1 point**, so even with no other bleeding risks the minimum score is 1, indicating at least low bleeding risk; additional comorbidities can quickly raise the score [^112ydz3S].

---

### Clinical implications of HAS-BLED in elderly patients

- **Bleeding risk**: Higher HAS-BLED scores correlate with increased major bleeding risk, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, which is more common in the very elderly [^113ZtgGD].
- **Validation**: HAS-BLED is validated in older adults and is recommended to identify and mitigate bleeding risks, not to withhold anticoagulation [^112kXvBf].
- **Limitations**: The score does not capture all geriatric-specific risks (e.g. frailty, falls, polypharmacy), and its predictive accuracy is modest (C-statistics ~0.6–0.7) [^116aNfR6].

---

## Clinical decision-making in a 93-year-old patient

### Balancing stroke and bleeding risks

In very elderly patients, stroke and bleeding risks often rise in parallel, creating a **delicate balance**. CHA2DS2-VASc usually supports anticoagulation, while HAS-BLED highlights bleeding concerns; however, a high HAS-BLED should not automatically preclude anticoagulation. Instead, it should prompt **risk mitigation** and close monitoring [^115GsRLJ].

---

### Guidelines and expert consensus

- **Anticoagulation**: Guidelines recommend anticoagulation for CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women, with consideration at intermediate risk (1–2% annually) [^112yBTNS] [^114sKXey].
- **HAS-BLED**: Use HAS-BLED to identify modifiable bleeding risks and guide follow-up intensity; do not use it to deny indicated anticoagulation [^115GsRLJ].
- **Shared decision-making**: Engage patients and caregivers in discussions about risks, benefits, and preferences, especially in very elderly patients [^115RMB51].

---

### Practical considerations

- **Agent selection**: DOACs (especially apixaban or edoxaban) are often preferred in elderly patients due to lower intracranial bleeding risk compared to warfarin; dose adjustments are critical for renal function and body weight [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Frequent follow-up (every 3–6 months) to reassess renal function, bleeding, adherence, and falls is essential [^notfound].
- **Risk mitigation**: Address modifiable bleeding risks (e.g. uncontrolled hypertension, concomitant antiplatelets, alcohol use, renal impairment) [^11369Unb].

---

## Alternative or complementary risk stratification tools

Several tools may refine risk assessment in very elderly patients:

| **Tool** | **Purpose** | **Relevance to elderly patients** |
|-|-|-|
| ATRIA | Stroke risk | Includes age ≥ 75 and renal disease; may better stratify very elderly [^115xaUXr] |
| ORBIT | Bleeding risk | Simple, validated in elderly, includes renal disease [^114vn4Yi] |
| GARFIELD-AF | Stroke and bleeding | Web-based, includes multiple clinical factors [^115xaUXr] |
| ABC (age, biomarkers, clinical history) | Stroke risk | Incorporates biomarkers; may improve prediction in elderly |

---

These tools can complement CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED but **do not replace clinical judgment** in very elderly patients [^115GsRLJ].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Applicability**: CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED are applicable to a 93-year-old with AF, but interpretation must account for age-related risk amplification and geriatric factors [^112afnt9].
- **Anticoagulation**: CHA2DS2-VASc will typically support anticoagulation; HAS-BLED should guide risk mitigation, not denial of therapy [^115GsRLJ].
- **Approach**: Use shared decision-making, prefer DOACs when appropriate, and monitor closely with regular reassessment of stroke and bleeding risks [^113CnU8j].

In sum, **both scores remain useful in a 93-year-old**, but clinicians must integrate clinical judgment, patient preferences, and geriatric-specific risks to optimize outcomes.

Results

From April 2014 onward, 74 patients (mean age 32 ± 10 years (range 18–68), 54% male) with a Fontan circulation were identified from 513 ACHD on NOACs (anabaptist, n = 27; dabigatran, n = 7; edoxaban, n = 4; rivaroxaban, n = 36) in the NOTE registry (table 1). The indication for NOACs was AA in 52 patients, primary prevention of thromboembolism in 12 patients and secondary prevention of thromboembolism in 10 patients. CHA2DS2-VASc score was ≥ 1 in 49 patients (66%) and only 2 patients had a high HAS-BLED (bleeding risk factor scoring system in which 1 point is given for uncontrolled hypertension, abnormal renal or liver function, history of stroke or bleeding, labile international normalized ratio, age > 65 years, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or antiplatelet agents or alcohol) score of t3.

### Relation of the HAS-BLED bleeding risk score to major bleeding, cardiovascular events, and mortality in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation [^113ZtgGD]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Stroke risk in atrial fibrillation (AF) using oral vitamin K antagonists is closely related to bleeding risk. The HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile INR [international normalized ratio], elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly) bleeding score has demonstrated usefulness in assessing major bleeding risk in patients with AF. However, risk factors for warfarin-associated bleeding also predict stroke risk in patients with AF. We tested the usefulness of the HAS-BLED score for predicting both major bleeding and cardiovascular events in a cohort of anticoagulated patients with AF.

Methods and Results

We recruited 965 consecutive anticoagulated outpatients with permanent or paroxysmal AF who were stabilized for at least 6 months on oral anticoagulation (international normalized ratio, 2.0–3.0). Medical history and HAS-BLED score were assessed. Cox regression models were used to determine the association between clinical risk factors and bleeding episodes, adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality. The median HAS-BLED score was 2 (range, 0–6; 29% with a score ≥ 3 [ie, high risk]). Median follow-up was 861 days (range, 718–1016 days). Independent predictors for major bleeding were age ≥ 75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05–2.87; P = 0.030), male sex (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.03–2.80; P = 0.036), renal impairment (HR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.20–3.73; P = 0.010), previous bleeding episode (HR, 6.00; 95% CI, 3.73–9.67; P < 0.001), current alcohol consumption (HR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.03–5.06; P = 0.043), and concomitant malignant disease (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.13–4.18; P = 0.020). Independent predictors for adverse cardiovascular events were age > 75 years (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.40–3.46; P = 0.001), heart failure (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.20–2.86; P = 0.001), and previous stroke (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.20–2.86; P < 0.001). The HAS-BLED score was highly predictive for major bleeding events (HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.68–2.49; P < 0.001) and adverse cardiovascular events (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.27–1.81; P < 0.001). The incidence of both bleeding and adverse cardiovascular events was higher as HAS-BLED score increased, and crude bleeding rates only exceeded thrombotic events at a HAS-BLED score > 3. The HAS-BLED score also predicted all-cause mortality (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.40–2.01; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The HAS-BLED score not only is useful in the assessment of bleeding risk, but also shows some predictive value for cardiovascular events and mortality in anticoagulated patients with AF, consistent with the relationship between thrombosis and bleeding. Nonetheless, the HAS-BLED score has been designed for predicting bleeding risk rather than thrombotic events per se, and specific risk scores for cardiovascular events and mortality should be applied for these events.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation in the critically ill and post-surgery patient — thromboprophylaxis should assess thromboembolic risk with the CHA2DS2-VASc score and bleeding risk with disease-related high bleeding-risk features and the HAS-BLED score, then evaluate comorbidities, life expectancy, renal function, and cancer; low risk defined as CHA2DS2-VASc 0 in males, 1 in females leads to no antithrombotic therapy, whereas patients with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 1 in males or ≥ 2 in females) warrant consideration of stroke prevention with oral anticoagulation whether as vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), using the HASBLED score to "flag up" high-risk patients for review without treating a high HASBLED score as a contraindication to OAC, and agent selection can consider VKAs if renal or liver impairment or likely poor adherence with careful monitoring is useful, or NOACs if poor INR control/management.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112JdCMk]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — stroke risk categorization and score validation note that a patient's absolute risk of stroke can be characterized as low (< 1%/y), intermediate (~1 to < 2%/y), and high (≥ 2%/y). Risk discrimination is improved by including more predictors, with CHA2DS2-VASc improved on the original CHADS2 by adding additional risk factors and categories. Among 15 cohort studies, patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 had annual rates of stroke that ranged from low to high: < 1% in 4 cohorts, 1% to 2% in 6 cohorts, and > 2% in 5 cohorts, and higher scores were associated with higher stroke risk in each cohort. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is considered the most validated score, and CHA2DS2-VASc is generally the preferred score.

Atrial fibrillation stroke risk stratification — CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scoring — indicates that existing schema have modest discrimination with "C statistics typically between 0.55 and 0.70", and the CHADS2 score has been "independently tested in at least 10 separate cohorts". CHADS2 "gives a single point for each of" congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, and diabetes mellitus, and "two points for prior stroke or TIA", consistent with Table 2 where "Recent Congestive Heart failure exacerbation", "History Of Hypertension", "Age ≥ 75 years", and "Diabetes mellitus" are assigned 1 point and "Prior history of Stroke or transient ischemic attack" is assigned 2 points. Limitations include that in most studies CHADS2 has "only a modest ability to predict stroke in patients with AF (C statistics, 0.56–0.70)". The CHA2DS2-VASc score "combines the CHADS2 score with additional moderate risk factors", and "assigns points as in the original CHADS2 score… with the exception of age ≥ 75 years, which is assigned two points".

Europace (2017). Medium credibility.

Subclinical atrial fibrillation (AF) risk stratification and anticoagulation — device-detected atrial high rate episodes (AHRE): Assessment of the patient's stroke risk using the CHA2DS2-VASc score is recommended. No antithrombotic therapy for any patient with CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 in males or 1 in females, irrespective of AHRE, is recommended. For patients with two additional CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors (i.e. ≥ 2 in males, ≥ 3 in females) oral anticoagulation is recommended if AF burden > 5.5 h/day (if there are no contraindications). Consider oral anticoagulation for AF burden (longest total duration of AF on any given day) of > 5.5 h in patients with 1 additional CHA2DS2-VASc risk factor (i.e. score = 1 in males, = 2 in females). Recognize that the data suggest risk is similarly increased by a mere 5-min episode, but it is reasonable to see a patient with only a single 5-min episode again in follow-up to observe their AF burden over time before committing them to life-long oral anticoagulation. Bleeding risk should be assessed using validated scores, such as the HAS-BLED score; patients at high risk (score ≥ 3) should be identified for more regular review and follow-up, and the reversible bleeding risk factors addressed, and a high HAS-BLED score is not a reason to withhold anticoagulation.

### Comparison of the CHADS-VASc, CHADS, HAS-BLED, ORBIT, and ATRIA risk scores in predicting non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants-associated bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113gDtDy]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The increasing adoption of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) necessitates a reassessment of bleeding risk scores. Because known risk factors for bleeding are largely the same as for stroke, we hypothesize that stroke risk scores could also be used to identify patients with high bleeding risks. We aimed to compare the performance of 2 stroke risk scores (Congestive Heart failure, hypertension, Age ≥ 75 [doubled], Diabetes, Stroke [doubled], Vascular disease, Age 65–74, and Sex [female] [CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc] and Cardiac failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke [Doubled] [CHADS 2]) and 3 bleeding risk scores (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile INR, elderly [.65 years], drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each] [HAS-BLED], Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation [ORBIT], and AnTicoagulation and Risk factors In Atrial fibrillation [ATRIA]) in predicting major and intracranial bleeding. Using a large US commercial insurance database, we identified 39,539 patients with nonvalvular AF who started NOACs between October 1, 2010 and June 30, 2015. The performance of risk scores was compared using C-statistic and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Over a total of 22,583 person-years, 665 patients (2.94% per year) had major bleeding, including 74 intracranial hemorrhages (0.33% per year). For the prediction of major bleeding, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc had the highest C-statistic both as a continuous score (C-statistic 0.68) and as a categorical score (C-statistic 0.65). For the prediction of intracranial bleeding, CHADS 2 had the highest C-statistic both as a continuous score (C-statistic 0.66) and as a categorical score (C-statistic 0.66). There were no statistically significant differences between scores based on NRI. In conclusion, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc, CHADS 2, HAS-BLED, ORBIT, and ATRIA had similar, albeit modest, performance in predicting NOAC-associated bleeding in patients with AF. Careful assessment and active management of bleeding risk factors may be warranted in all patients on NOACs who have high stroke risk scores.

### Implications of the CHA (2) DS (2)-VASc and HAS-BLED scores for thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation [^111Hc5eR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There is increasing recognition of the value of oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, as well as the availability of new oral anticoagulants that overcome the limitations of warfarin, implying that even more atrial fibrillation patients will be using oral anticoagulation, with the role of aspirin being less defined. Thus, we need a paradigm shift so that stroke risk assessment can be simplified in the identification of those patients who are truly at low risk (ie, CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc [Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥ 75 years, Diabetes mellitus, Stroke, Vascular disease, Age 65–74 years, Sex category] score = 0) who could be treated with no antithrombotic therapy, and all others (ie, CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score ≥ 1), would be considered for oral anticoagulation. A simple bleeding risk assessment can clearly help guide office management here. The new HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile International Normalized Ratio, Elderly, Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) bleeding risk schema has been proposed as a simple, easy calculation to assess bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation patients, whereby a score of ≥ 3 indicates "high risk" and some caution and regular review of the patient is needed, following the initiation of antithrombotic therapy, whether with oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy.

### Atrial fibrillation and stroke: epidemiology [^116ykdJW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The statistics for AFib are impressive. (online video available at: http://education.amjmed.com/video.php?event_id = 445&stage_id = 5&vcs = 1). The principal risk with AFib, stroke or thrombotic embolism, is increased 5-fold in some series; AFib accounts for ≥ 15% of all strokes in the United States, 36% of strokes for individuals aged > 80, and up to 20% of cryptogenic strokes, which means > 100,000–125,000 embolic strokes per year, of which > 20% are fatal. Patients with ischemic stroke and AFib are significantly (P < .0005) more likely to be chronically disabled, bedridden, and to require constant nursing care, particularly older patients (≥ 85 years). Prevention of these thromboembolic outcomes requires prophylactic anticoagulation therapy. The "gold standard" for anticoagulation has been warfarin, despite its well-known side effects and adherence challenges for patients. The recent approvals of several new, novel oral anticoagulation (NOAC) agents, however, presents physicians with a benefit/risk profile that represents an important advance over warfarin prophylaxis. The principal risk with all oral anticoagulants is bleeding. An important misconception about warfarin is that if anticoagulated patients bleed, the risk can be quickly reversed, but most trial experience has found that warfarin reversal requires 24 hours to halve the INR value. Reversal of anticoagulation with the NOACs is unproven at present; possible approaches are presented in this review, but since the NOACs have both rapid onsets of action and short biologic half-lives, they do not present the same reversal challenges as warfarin. Finally, physicians must be aware of thromboembolic risk assessment. The principal risk assessment scores are CHADS2, updated with the more recent CHA2DS2-VASc to provide more accurate assessment of low-risk patients; this review concludes with a novel flow-chart showing physicians how the CHADS2/CHA2DS2-VASc scoring systems can be used.

Stroke risk rationale and risk models in nonvalvular AF: Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke 5 times, and AF in the setting of mitral stenosis increases the risk of stroke 20 times over that of patients in sinus rhythm. A meta-analysis stratified ischemic stroke risk using point scoring systems including CHA2DS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc, with CHA2DS2-VASc incorporating age ≥ 75 years [doubled] and age 65 to 74 years among its factors. Compared with CHA2DS2, the CHA2DS2-VASc score for nonvalvular AF has a broader score range (0 to 9) and includes additional risk factors; selection of an antithrombotic agent should be based on shared decision making considering risk factors, cost, patient preference, drug interactions, and time in the INR therapeutic range if the patient has been on warfarin.

### CHADS₂, CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS-BLED as predictors of outcome in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^112xMdWo]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores are used to estimate thromboembolic risk in atrial fibrillation (AF). HAS-BLED is recommended for bleeding risk prediction. Their value in predicting the outcome of AF patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is unknown. Thus, our aim was to assess whether these simple risk scores are useful in predicting outcome in these patients.

Materials and Methods

AFCAS is an observational, multicenter, prospective registry including patients (n = 929) with AF referred for PCI. Primary study endpoints were 1) all cause mortality; 2) major adverse events (all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, stent thrombosis, transient ischemic attack, stroke or other arterial thromboembolism; MACCE); and 3) bleeding at 12 months follow-up. CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores and a modified HAS-BLED (mHAS-BLED) score (omitting labile INR and liver function) were calculated.

Results

Patients were distributed as follows: CHADS2 low 29.5%, intermediate 55.2%, high 15.3%; CHA2DS2-VASc low 9.6%, intermediate 46.0%, high 44.5%. A high CHA2DS2-VASc score was predictive of all-cause mortality (p = 0.02), whereas CHADS2 was not. High CHA2DS2-VASc score predicted MACCE (HR 2.24, 95%CI 1.21–4.17, p = 0.01), as did a high CHADS2 score (HR 1.60, 95%CI 1.05–2.45, p = 0.029). Their predictive performance was only modest (C indexes 0.56–0.57). CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc scores were not associated with bleeding. High mHAS-BLED scores (≥ 3) were not associated with any of the study outcomes.

Conclusions

High CHA2DS2-VASc score was the best predictor of thrombotic outcomes after PCI in a high risk AF population. High mHAS-BLED score was not predictive of bleeding events. More accurate, simple risk scores are needed.

### Comparative outcomes of treatment initiation with brand vs. generic warfarin in older patients [^117N2T5z]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

The anticoagulant response to warfarin, a narrow therapeutic index drug, increases with age, which may make older patients susceptible to adverse outcomes resulting from small differences in bioavailability between generic and brand products. Using US Medicare claims linked to electronic medical records from two large hospitals in Boston, we designed a cohort study of ≥ 65-year-old patients. Patients were followed for a composite effectiveness outcome of ischemic stroke or venous thromboembolism, a composite safety outcome, including major hemorrhage, and a 1-year all-cause mortality outcome. After propensity score fine-stratification and weighting to account for > 90 confounders, hazard ratios comparing brand vs. generic warfarin initiators (95% confidence intervals) for the effectiveness, safety, and all-cause mortality outcomes, were 0.97 (0.65–1.46), 0.94 (0.65–1.35), and 0.84 (0.62–1.13), respectively. Results from subgroup analyses of patients with atrial fibrillation, CHADS-VASc score ≥ 3, and HAS-BLED score ≥ 3 were consistent with the primary analysis.

### Reviewing a clinical decision aid for the selection of anticoagulation treatment in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: applications in a US managed care health plan database [^115XcsQE]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The Clinical Decision Aid was created to assist in selecting anticoagulant therapies for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The aid incorporates a patient's absolute risk for stroke and bleeding, relative stroke risk reduction, and increase in relative bleeding risk to identify the agent with the lowest net risk. We describe theoretical implications of utilizing the aid at a US managed care population level.

Methods

This retrospective study used claims data from a large US managed care database including enrollees in commercial and Medicare Advantage plans. The distribution of patients across each possible combination of scores on the HAS-BLED scale (evidence of hypertension, abnormal renal or liver function, stroke, bleeding, labile INR, age > 65 years, and drugs or alcohol abuse or dependence) and the CHA2DS2-VASc scale (CHADS2 [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism] with additional nonmajor stroke risk factors, including age 65–74 years, female sex, and vascular disease) was generated. We assessed the correlation between the HAS-BLED and CHA2DS2-VASc scores and derived the optimal treatment options based on various bleeding ratios.

Findings

Data from 48,260 patients were included in the analysis. The MAPD subset had a higher mean HAS-BLED score (2.17 vs 1.39; P < 0.001) and a higher mean CHA2DS2-VASc score (3.35 vs 2.05; P < 0.001) than did the commercial subset. Pearson coefficients suggested a moderate to strong positive correlation between the HAS-BLED and CHA2DS2-VASc scores among the commercial (0.730; P < 0.001) and MAPD (0.568; P < 0.001) enrollees. Based on a 2:1 bleeding-to-stroke risk ratio, 70.50% of patients would be recommended treatment with apixaban; 25.86%, no treatment; 3.62%, acetylsalicylic acid; and 0.01%, dabigatran 150 mg, if the Clinical Decision Aid were to be used for anticoagulant treatment selection.

Implications

Evidence-based clinical decision-making tools utilizing risk assessment for recommending a treatment may be valuable for not only health care providers but also health care payers in optimizing care at the population level.

### Added predictive ability of the CHA2DS2VASc risk score for stroke and death in patients with atrial fibrillation: the prospective Danish diet, cancer, and health cohort study [^116S5qrA]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to evaluate the added predictive ability of the CHA(2)DS(2)VASc prediction rule for stroke and death in a nonanticoagulated population of patients with atrial fibrillation.

Methods and Results

We included 1603 nonanticoagulated patients with incident atrial fibrillation from a Danish prospective cohort study of 57 053 middle-aged men and women. The Net Reclassification Improvement was calculated as a measure to estimate any overall improvement in reclassification with the CHA(2)DS(2)VASc sore as an alternative to the CHADS(2) score. After 1-year follow-up, crude incidence rates were 3.4 per 100 person-years for stroke and 13.6 for death. After a mean follow-up of 5.4 years (± 3.7 years), the crude incidence rates for stroke and death were 1.9 and 5.6, respectively. During the entire observation period, the c-statistics and negative predictive values were similar for both risk scores. The Net Reclassification Improvement analysis showed that 1 of 10 reclassified atrial fibrillation patients would have been upgraded correctly using the CHA(2)DS(2)VASc score.

Conclusions

Both the CHADS(2) as well as the CHA(2)DS(2)VASc risk score can exclude a large proportion of patients from having high risk of stroke or death. However, using the CHA(2)DS(2)VASc risk score, fewer patients will fulfill the criterion for low risk (and are truly low risk for thromboembolism). For every 10 extra patients transferred to the treatment group at 5 years, using the CHA(2)DS(2)VASc risk score, 1 patient would have had a stroke that might have been avoided with effective treatment.

### CHADS-VASc score stratifies mortality risk in patients with and without atrial fibrillation [^115QLf3J]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Given that the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score is simple and based solely on clinical history and no laboratory or imaging parameters compared with existing Framingham-based cardiovascular risk calculators, ACC/AHA ASCVD risk estimator or SCORE (all of which require either a blood test, an imaging test, or a geographical European location), CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score may provide a simpler clinical alternative for mortality risk stratification. One parameter of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score that is not a known predictor of mortality is female sex. Indeed, there was a recent change in AF guidelines to using a gender-based threshold, where anticoagulation is not recommended for scores of 0 in men and 0 or 1 in women, can be considered for scores of 1 in men and 2 in women, and recommended with scores of 2 or more in men and 3 or more in women. Removing the female sex parameter may improve the prognostic utility of this score for death as well. CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc can be simply imbedded in any EMR to generate a risk for stroke based on published data, or total mortality risk in patients with or without AF based on the data from this cohort. We believe that this simple yet informative tool can be used by healthcare providers, administrators and most importantly patients to assess treatment strategies, health economics and healthcare/treatment decision making, respectively.

Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) risk scoring — appropriate use, reassessment, and misuse cautions: As with all clinical scores based on clinical factors, the CHA2DS2-VASc score only performs modestly for predicting high-risk patients who sustain events, and use of simplified scores to artificially categorize patients into low-, moderate-, and high-risk strata can be problematic. There is the move to focus in the clinical decision-making on identifying low-risk patients who do not need antithrombotic therapy first, following which stroke prevention can be offered to AF patients with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors. Stroke risk is also highly dynamic, and a clinical reassessment may be needed every 4–6 months to optimize risk re-assessment. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is used to predict new onset AF, again something it was not designed for, and another misuse of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is the prediction of bleeding risk; formal comparisons show that the CHA2DS2-VASc (and older CHA2DS2) score are inferior to a formal bleeding risk score such as the HAS-BLED score, for the prediction of major bleeding in AF patients. For bleeding risk management, appropriate use of bleeding risk scores such as HAS-BLED is to address modifiable bleeding risk factors and to schedule the 'high-risk' patients for early and more frequent follow-up visits (e.g. 4 weeks rather than 4 months).

### Stroke and bleeding risk co-distribution in real-world patients with atrial fibrillation: the euro heart survey [^114EELb7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The choice to recommend antithrombotic therapy to patients with atrial fibrillation should rely on cardioembolic and bleeding risk stratification. Sharing some risk factors, schemes to predict thrombotic and bleeding risk are expected not to be independent, yet the degree of their association has never been clearly quantified.

Methods

We described the cardioembolic (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age > 75, Diabetes mellitus, and prior Stroke or transient ischemic attack [CHADS2]/Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age > 75, Diabetes mellitus, and prior Stroke or transient ischemic attack, Vascular disease, Age 65–75, Sex category i.e. females [CHA2DS2-VASc]) and bleeding risk (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly (> 65 years), Drugs/alcohol concomitantly [HAS-BLED]) co-distribution among patients of the Euro Heart Survey on atrial fibrillation. We measured the within-patient correlation (Spearman) and concordance between the 2 types of score and score-based risk categorization (low, intermediate, high). The score-based predicted risk co-classification was then related to the observed 1-year stroke and bleeding occurrence.

Results

In 3920 patients, we found a between-scores correlation of 0.416 (P < .001) between HAS-BLED and CHADS2, and 0.512 (P < .001) between HAS-BLED and CHA2DS2-VASc. In 89% (CHADS2/HAS-BLED) and 97% (CHA2DS2-VASc/HAS-BLED) of patients, the bleeding risk category was equal to or lower than their cardioembolic risk category (P < .001 for symmetry test). A complete concordance between risk categories was found in 39.6% (CHADS2/HAS-BLED) and 21.7% (CHA2DS2-VASc/HAS-BLED) of patients; 4.4% (CHADS2/HAS-BLED) and 7.7% (CHA2DS2-VASc/HAS-BLED) of patients had high cardioembolic risk/low bleeding risk or vice versa. A tendency for an increasing frequency of stroke was observed for increasing bleeding risk within cardioembolic risk categories and vice versa.

Conclusions

In a real-world population with atrial fibrillation, we confirmed that the cardioembolic and bleeding risk classifications are correlated but not exchangeable. It is then worth verifying the advantages of a strategy adopting a combined risk assessment over a strategy relying only on the cardioembolic risk evaluation.

### Cardiovascular disease in the older adult: where are we 4 decades later? [^1122KGJ7]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmias

At the time of the Bethesda Conference, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) was just being recognized as a risk factor for stroke, and the role of anticoagulation for stroke prevention had not been clarified. It is now known that nonvalvular AF is a key risk factor for stroke, that the proportion of strokes attributable to AF increases with age, and that AF accounts for over 30% of ischemic strokes in Americans ≥ 75 years old.

Seminal advances in diagnosis and treatment of AF in older adults since 1986 include: 1) development of risk scores for predicting stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc) and bleeding (eg, HAS-BLED); 2) numerous randomized trials documenting the efficacy of oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention, including in patients of advanced age; 3) many trials comparing rate-control vs rhythm control, most of which have failed to demonstrate benefit from a rhythm control strategy; 4) catheter-based and surgical procedures for maintenance of sinus rhythm in selected patients; 5) novel direct-acting oral anticoagulants as alternatives to vitamin K antagonists; and 6) left atrial appendage occlusion as an alternative to anticoagulation in patients at high bleeding risk.

### Prediction of rates of thromboembolic and major bleeding outcomes with dabigatran or warfarin among patients with atrial fibrillation: new initiator cohort study [^115ttd2n]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Widely recognized risk scores such as the CHADS 2 score or CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score for stroke and thromboembolism and HAS-BLED score for major bleeding are used to estimate individual risk of these outcomes among patients with atrial fibrillation. The CHADS 2 score accounts for congestive heart failure, hypertension, age (≥ 75 years), diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke/transient ischaemic attack/thromboembolism (doubled risk weight), whereas the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score also accounts for vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and sex category (age ≥ 75 years and previous stroke carry doubled risk weight). The HAS-BLED score accounts for (age > 65 years, hypertension, abnormal renal and liver function, prior stroke, bleeding history (or predisposition), drugs predisposing to bleed, alcohol use disorders, and labile international normalized ratio.

While these risk scores provide baseline estimates of risk to guide whether to treat with an oral anticoagulant, they do not provide insight into optimal treatment selection when treatment is clearly indicated. The efficacy of oral anticoagulants in preventing thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation is well known, with many studies reporting over 60%reduction in stroke for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Also known is the potential for anticoagulants to increase the risk of major bleeding.

The updated 2012 European Society of Cardiology guidelinesand the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelinesrecommend that patients with at least one risk factor included in the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score be considered for anticoagulation therapy (excluding female patients under age 65 years with lone atrial fibrillation), and that anticoagulation should be offered to patients with atrial fibrillation and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 2 or more. However, which anticoagulant to offer remains debated. When a clinician and patient decide to initiate anticoagulation therapy, accurate predictions of benefit (prevention of thromboembolism) or harm (increased risk of major bleeding) with different oral anticoagulation agents can help guide treatment choice.

### Stroke and bleeding risk assessment in atrial fibrillation: when, how, and why? [^114FseKi]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Decision making with regard to thromboprophylaxis should be based upon the absolute risks of stroke/thromboembolism and bleeding and the net clinical benefit for a given patient. As a consequence, a crucial part of atrial fibrillation (AF) management requires the appropriate use of thromboprophylaxis, and the assessment of stroke as well as bleeding risk can help inform management decisions by clinicians. The objective of this review article is to provide an overview of stroke and bleeding risk assessment in AF. There would be particular emphasis on when, how, and why to use these risk stratification schemes, with a specific focus on the CHADS2 [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke (doubled)], CHA2DS2-VASc [congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)], and HAS-BLED [hypertension (i.e. uncontrolled blood pressure), abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile INR (if on warfarin), elderly (e.g. age > 65, frail condition), drugs (e.g. aspirin, NSAIDs)/alcohol concomitantly] risk scores.

### CHADS-VASc score stratifies mortality risk in patients with and without atrial fibrillation [^116oNFZd]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score is the preferred risk model for anticoagulation decision-making in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Recent studies have found this score to have prognostic value in other cardiovascular diseases. We assessed the relationships between CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score and long-term mortality in adults referred for stress testing, METHODS: 165 184 consecutive patients from January 1991 to December 2014 from a prospective registry were studied, with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score calculated for all patients, and AF and anticoagulation status were recorded. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality.

Results

In this cohort, 12450 (7.5%) patients had AF and mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 2.2 ± 1.2. There were 22152 (18.4%) deaths during mean follow-up of 6.1 ± 4.8 years. In multivariable analysis, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score, presence of AF and anticoagulation use, along with end-stage renal failure and smoking were all independently associated with mortality with HRs (95% CIs) of 1.23 (1.21 to 1.25), 1.18 (1.10 to 1.27) and 1.50 (1.40 to 1.60), respectively. Higher CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was incrementally associated with worse survival both in patients with and without AF (log-rank p < 0.001). Anticoagulation use was associated with reduced survival in non-AF patients with alternative anticoagulation indications at all CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score categories, and AF patients with lower CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score 0–2, but was protective in AF patients with higher CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score 4–9.

Conclusion

Incrementally higher CHA2DS2-VASc score, a simple clinical tool, is associated with mortality in patients regardless of presence of AF and anticoagulation status. Anticoagulation use was associated with worse survival in non-AF patients and AF patients with low CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores, but was protective in AF patients with high CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores.

### Bleeding risk scores in atrial fibrillation: helpful or harmful? [^112GQz3Z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The reasons for the lack of clinical impact by bleeding risks scores is partially because of the parallel nature of bleeding risk scores and stroke risk scores such as CHA2DS2‐VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes Mellitus, Prior Stroke, Vascular disease, Sex category). 11 For example, with increasing age, the risk of stroke and major bleeding increase. Because a bleeding risk score can help justify withholding anticoagulation from a high‐risk patient, they may actually harm patients. This editorial will further discuss the reasons why previously developed bleeding risk scoring systems, such as HAS‐BLED and GARFIELD‐AF, have minimal clinical impact, especially in modern anticoagulation therapy.

First, the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation in patients with AF has been studied. Friberg and colleagues showed that increased thromboembolism risk was associated with increased risk of bleeding, likely because many of the risk factors involved in the risk stratification scores overlap. 11 In this study, the only patients who did not benefit from anticoagulation were patients with a CHA2DS2VASc score of 0 or 1, patients in whom anticoagulation is not recommended by either the European Society of Cardiology or AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines. 1, 10, 11 In fact, a patient with a CHA2DS2VASc score of 5 and an HAS‐BLED score of 5 would have a net clinical benefit of 3% per year even when weighting intracranial hemorrhage as 1.5 times the clinical impact of a stroke. 11 In a study by Oleson and colleagues, bleeding risk does increase with higher HAS‐BLED scores. 12 However, net clinical benefit, measured in deaths or hospitalizations for thromboembolism or bleeding, significantly favored warfarin in all patients with a CHA2DS2VASc score > 1. 12 Thus, even when accounting for bleeding risk, warfarin therapy would provide net clinical benefit to those in whom guidelines recommend anticoagulation. The risk is that despite guideline statements to the contrary, bleeding risk scores could be used to justify withholding therapy from high‐risk patients, which places patients at risk of stroke.

Cohort Selection Diagram Data Sharing Statement At the index encounter, 53 920 patients met the definition for 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension. At 36 months, 83. 5% of patients met 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension compared with
53. 2% with Eighth Report of the Joint National Committee hypertension. Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guidelines lowered the blood pressure threshold to diagnose hypertension from 140/90 to 130/80 mm Hg. 2 Among nonhypertensive patients with AF, the new definition may result in earlier hypertension diagnoses, CHA2DS2-VASc up-scoring, and earlier OAC indications in those with previous scores of 0 or 1.

The primary outcome was CHA2DS2-VASc up-scoring, defined as receiving 1 point for hypertension with 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension but not JNC 8 hypertension, in patients with an initial score of 0 or
1. We used Kaplan-Meier product limit survival estimates to calculate the duration from the first encounter with CHA2DS2-VASc up-scoring until JNC 8 hypertension diagnosis, CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or higher from accumulating different comorbidities or increase in age, or end of follow-up. The analysis cohort comprised 316 388 patients with AF and outpatient encounters on or after January 1, 2016.

The clinical calculator "HAS-BLED score for major bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation" for atrial fibrillation.

The HAS-BLED score is a clinical calculator used to assess the risk of major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation. The acronym stands for Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile INR, Elderly (> 65), and Drugs/alcohol concomitantly. Each factor is assigned one point, and the total score ranges from 0 to 9.

This scoring system is specifically applicable to patients with atrial fibrillation, a common heart rhythm disorder. The clinical utility of the HAS-BLED score is to guide clinicians in making decisions about anticoagulant therapy, balancing the risk of stroke against the risk of major bleeding.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the HAS-BLED score. However, it should be noted that the score does not consider all possible risk factors for bleeding, and clinical judgment should always be used in conjunction with the score.

The HAS-BLED score evaluates the likelihood of major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation by examining nine different risk factors. Each factor contributes a point to the total score if present, leading to a potential range from 0 to 9. The elements considered in this assessment include:

- Uncontrolled hypertension, defined by systolic blood pressure exceeding 160 mmHg
- Renal dysfunction indicated by dialysis, transplant, or creatinine levels over 2.26 mg/dL (200 mcmol/L)
- Liver dysfunction characterized by cirrhosis or significant liver test abnormalities
- Previous stroke history
- Prior incidents of major bleeding, which necessitated hospitalization, transfusion, or a decrease in hemoglobin by more than 2 g/L
- Labile International Normalized Ratio (INR), where the therapeutic range falls below 60%
- Age over 65
- Use of medications such as antiplatelet agents or NSAIDs
- High alcohol consumption of 8 or more units per week

For each risk factor that applies (input marked 'true'), a score of 1 is added to the overall total. The cumulative score reflects the bleeding risk as follows:

- Scores of 0 or 1 suggest a low annual bleeding risk of about 1%.
- A score of 2 indicates a risk of 1.88% per year.
- A score of 3 raises the estimated risk to 3.74% annually.
- A score of 4 suggests an elevated risk of about 8.70% per year.
- Scores of 5 or above point to a substantial risk, at or surpassing 12.5% annually.

This calculated score provides both the total score and an interpretation, enabling healthcare providers to gauge the bleeding risk for patients with atrial fibrillation comprehensively.

### A novel user-friendly score (HAS-BLED) to assess 1-year risk of major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation: the euro heart survey [^112ydz3S]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite extensive use of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and the increased bleeding risk associated with such OAC use, no handy quantification tool for assessing this risk exists. We aimed to develop a practical risk score to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding (intracranial, hospitalization, hemoglobin decrease > 2 g/L, and/or transfusion) in a cohort of real-world patients with AF.

Methods

Based on 3,978 patients in the Euro Heart Survey on AF with complete follow-up, all univariate bleeding risk factors in this cohort were used in a multivariate analysis along with historical bleeding risk factors. A new bleeding risk score termed HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly (> 65 years), Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) was calculated, incorporating risk factors from the derivation cohort.

Results

Fifty-three (1.5%) major bleeds occurred during 1-year follow-up. The annual bleeding rate increased with increasing risk factors. The predictive accuracy in the overall population using significant risk factors in the derivation cohort (C statistic 0.72) was consistent when applied in several subgroups. Application of the new bleeding risk score (HAS-BLED) gave similar C statistics except where patients were receiving antiplatelet agents alone or no antithrombotic therapy, with C statistics of 0.91 and 0.85, respectively.

Conclusion

This simple, novel bleeding risk score (HAS-BLED) provides a practical tool to assess the individual bleeding risk of real-world patients with AF, potentially supporting clinical decision making regarding antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF.

### Serum lipoprotein levels, statin use, and cognitive function in older women… [^112BE13b]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

A reduction in the LDL cholesterol level during the 4 years tended to be associated with a lower odds of impairment compared with women whose levels increased. Higher total and LDL cholesterol levels, corrected for lipoprotein levels, were also associated with a worse Modified Mini-Mental State Examination score and a higher likelihood of impairment, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not associated with cognition. The mean ± SD age of the women was 71. 1 ±
6. 3 years. The characteristics of the participants did not differ across total cholesterol quartile, except that women in the lowest quartile were more likely to be taking statins and aspirin. None of the women were taking medications for AD, such as donepezil. Additional adjustment for statin use did not change the magnitude or statistical significance of the results for any of the analyses.

There was no association with HDL cholesterol or triglyceride level quartile and odds of cognitive impairment. total cholesterol level: unadjusted OR, 0. 55; and adjusted OR,

### Assessment of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score in predicting mortality and adverse cardiovascular outcomes of patients on hemodialysis [^116caR1L]. American Journal of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing chronic hemodialysis are at high mortality and cardiovascular risk. This study was aimed to assess whether the CHA2DS2-VASc score may be used for risk stratification of this population.

Methods

Included were patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis at Meir Medical Center. The CHA2DS2-VASc score was calculated for each patient at the initiation of hemodialysis. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to the CHA2DS2-VASc score: 0–3 (low), 4–5 (intermediate), and ≥ 6 (high). The primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke during the first year of hemodialysis.

Results

Of the 457 patients with ESRD, 181 (40%) had low, 193 (42%) intermediate, and 83 (18%) high CHA2DS2-VASc scores. During the first year of hemodialysis, 109 (23.8%) patients died, 17 (3.7%) had a stroke, and 28 (6.1%) had a myocardial infarction. Compared to patients in the low CHA2DS2-VASc score group, those in the intermediate and high score groups had higher risk for the composite endpoint (OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.6–4.2, p < 0.01 and OR: 4.2, 95% CI: 2.3–7.5, p < 0.01, respectively). Each 1-point increase in CHA2DS2-VASc score was associated with a 38% increased risk for the composite endpoint, a 19% increased risk for 1-year myocardial infarction, and a 29% increased risk for 1-year stroke.

Conclusions

Patients with ESRD are at an extremely high mortality and cardiovascular risk within the first year of hemodialysis. The CHA2DS2-VASc score was strongly associated with adverse outcomes and may be used for risk stratification of these patients.

### Quality indicators for the care and outcomes of adults with atrial fibrillation [^111Arhcd]. Europace (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation thromboembolic and bleeding risk assessment defines low risk using CHA2DS2-VASc and specifies reassessment intervals. Low-risk patients are "CHA2DS2-VASc score 0 in males, 1 in females" who "do not need antithrombotic therapy", whereas stroke prevention is offered when "CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 1 in males, ≥ 2 in females". Because "stroke risk is dynamic", "risk reassessment should occur at every follow-up visit", and "Bleeding risk changes over time as well and should also be assessed at every patient contact". The document states that "the best validated bleeding risk score is the HAS-BLED score" and that "a formal bleeding risk score (HAS-BLED) is superior to stroke risk scores (e.g. CHA2DS2, CHA2DS2-VASc) for assessing bleeding risk". It adds that "A strategy for dynamic bleeding risk assessment using the HAS-BLED score has been shown to reduce bleeding risk and to increase oral anticoagulation (OAC) use", and notes that "Given that renal function has implications for both stroke and bleeding risk, as well as prescriptions of OAC (choice of agent and dose)".

### Should atrial fibrillation patients with 1 additional risk factor of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score (beyond sex) receive oral anticoagulation? [^111P7Fw1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although the CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years or older, diabetes mellitus, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, female) score is recommended by both American and European guidelines for stroke risk stratification in atrial fibrillation (AF), the treatment recommendations for a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 are less clear.

Objectives

This study aimed to investigate the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with a single additional stroke risk factor (i.e. CHA2DS2-VASc score = 1 [males] or 2 [females]) and the impact of different component risk factors.

Methods

We used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Among 186,570 AF patients not on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, we evaluated males with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 and females with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2. The clinical endpoint was the occurrence of ischemic stroke.

Results

Among 12,935 male AF patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1, 1,858 patients (14.4%) experienced ischemic stroke during follow-up (5.2 ± 4.3 years), with an annual stroke rate of 2.75%. Ischemic stroke risk ranged from 1.96%/year for men with vascular disease to 3.50%/year for those 65 to 74 years of age. For 7,900 females with AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2, 14.9% experienced ischemic stroke for an annual stroke rate of 2.55%. Ischemic stroke risk increased from 1.91%/year for women with hypertension to 3.34%/year for those 65 to 74 years of age.

Conclusions

Not all risk factors in CHA2DS2-VASc score carry an equal risk, with age 65 to 74 years associated with the highest stroke rate. Oral anticoagulation should be considered for AF patients with 1 additional stroke risk factor given their high risk of ischemic stroke.

2014 ACC/AHA/HRS atrial fibrillation recommendations emphasize shared decision-making and risk-based therapy: "In patients with AF, antithrombotic therapy should be individualized based on shared decision-making after discussion of the absolute and RRs of stroke and bleeding, and the patient's values and preferences. (Class I, Level of Evidence: C)". "Selection of antithrombotic therapy should be based on the risk of thromboembolism, irrespective of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent.

### CHADS₂ and CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores as bleeding risk indices for patients with atrial fibrillation: the bleeding with antithrombotic therapy study [^114QZdVS]. Hypertension Research (2014). Low credibility.

The CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores, that is, ischemic stroke risk indices for patients having atrial fibrillation (AF), may also be useful as bleeding risk indices. Japanese patients with AF, who routinely took oral antithrombotic agents were enrolled from a prospective, multicenter study. The CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were assessed based on information at entry. Scores of 0, 1 and ⩾2 were defined as the low, intermediate and high ischemic risk categories, respectively, for each index. Of 1221 patients, 873 took warfarin, 114 took antiplatelet agents and 234 took both. The annual incidence of ischemic stroke was 0.76% in the low-risk category, 1.46% in the intermediate-risk category and 2.90% in the high-risk category by CHADS2 scores, and 1.44, 0.42 and 2.50%, respectively, by CHA2DS2-VASc scores. The annual incidence of major bleeding in each category was 1.52, 2.19 and 2.25% by CHADS2, and 1.44, 1.69 and 2.24% by CHA2DS2-VASc. After multivariate adjustment, the CHADS2 was associated with ischemia (odds ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.03–3.38 per 1-category increase) and the CHA2DS2-VASc tended to be associated with ischemia (2.18, 0.89–8.43). On the other hand, associations of the indices with bleeding were weak. In conclusion, bleeding risk increased gradually as the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores increased in Japanese antithrombotic users, although the statistical impact was rather weak compared with their predictive power for ischemic stroke.

### The HAS-BLED, ATRIA, and ORBIT bleeding scores in atrial fibrillation patients using non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [^114vn4Yi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Various bleeding risk scores have been proposed to assess the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation taking oral anticoagulants. Limited data are available with these scores, in users of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants.

Methods

Using the Danish registries, we evaluated and compared the risk classification properties of the Hypertension, Age, Stroke, Bleeding tendency/predisposition, Labile international normalized ratios, Elderly age/frailty, Drugs such as concomitant aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or alcohol excess (HAS-BLED), Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA), and Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT) scores for predicting major bleeding in 57,930 atrial fibrillation patients (44.6% female; mean age 73.5 years, standard deviation 11.4 years; mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score 3.2, standard deviation 1.8).

Results

At 1-year follow-up, C-statistics for ATRIA, HAS-BLED, and ORBIT were approximately 0.59, with only minor differences between scores. Both ATRIA and ORBIT categorized more patients as "low risk" (both > 83%, when compared with HAS-BLED, only 53%), and qualitatively, the receiver operating characteristic curves revealed higher sensitivity (62.8%) for HAS-BLED compared with ATRIA (29.7%) and ORBIT (37.1%). The clinical usefulness of scores was evaluated using decision curve analyses at a 1-year perspective. If the intervention threshold is low (< 1.7%), the benefit is toward monitoring all patients. If preference is for a major bleeding risk threshold between 1.7% and 2.0%, most benefit was obtained by using HAS-BLED. The ORBIT and ATRIA scores provided better benefit for thresholds between 2.0% and 6.0%.

Conclusion

This analysis of contemporary bleeding risk score stratification in a "real-world" non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant users population with atrial fibrillation showed modest predictive values using C-statistics. The scores represent different risk thresholds, with HAS-BLED classifying least patients at low risk and achieving the highest benefit if applying a major bleeding intervention threshold of approximately 2%, whereas benefit from using either ATRIA score or ORBIT score was only evident using higher intervention thresholds.

### Therapeutic anticoagulation complications in the elderly: a case report [^111yz7KH]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

We present the case of an 85-year-old female patient with a weight of 88 kg and a height of 165 cm who was admitted to our emergency department following a rapidly progressing atraumatic swelling of her lower left leg. One month prior to this event, a renal function monitored therapeutic anticoagulation with Enoxaparin sodium 80 mg/0.8 mL (Clexane®, ﻿Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) was initiated due to persistent atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 15 ml/min at the time of therapeutic anticoagulation initiation). Unfortunately, baseline CHA2DS2-VASc- and HAS-BLED scores were not provided at the initial hospital admission.

### Comparisons of CHADS₂ and CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores for stroke risk stratification in atrial fibrillation: which scoring system should be used for Asians? [^1118Wdv6]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Both U.S. and European guidelines recommend use of the CHA2DS2-VASc rather than CHADS2 score for stroke risk stratification in atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the CHA2DS2-VASc score has not been proved to be better than CHADS2 score for Asians in a large-scale study.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracies of CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores in predicting ischemic stroke in Chinese patients.

Methods

This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. A total of 186,570 AF patients without antithrombotic therapies were selected as the study cohort. The clinical end-point was occurrence of ischemic stroke.

Results

During follow-up of 3.4 ± 3.7 years, 23,723 patients (12.7%) experienced ischemic stroke. The CHA2DS2-VASc score performed better than CHADS2 score in predicting ischemic stroke assessed by c-indexes (0.698 vs 0.659, P < .0001). Among 25,286 patients with a CHADS2 score of 0, the CHA2DS2-VASc score ranged from 0 to 3, and the annual stroke rate ranged from 1.15% to 4.47%. Compared to patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0, the hazard ratio of ischemic stroke for patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3 was 3.998.

Conclusion

Patients with a CHADS2 score of 0 were not necessarily "low risk", and the annual stroke rate can be as high as 4.47% when patients were further stratified by the CHA2DS2-VASc score. In contrast, patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 had a truly low risk of ischemic stroke, with an annual stroke rate around 1.15%. As with Caucasians, the CHA2DS2-VASc score should be used for stroke risk stratification in Asians.

### CHADS-VASc and has-BLED scores do not accurately stratify risk for stroke or bleed in fall victims with atrial fibrillation [^117KMVSH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Falls are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Non-valvular Atrial fibrillation (AF) is present in up to 9% of this group and often requires oral anticoagulation (OAC). The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and HAS-BLED scores are validated tools assessing risk of ischemic stroke from AF and major bleeding (MB) from OAC. It is unclear if these predictions remain accurate in post-fall patients. This study seeks to determine the stroke and major bleeding rate in atrial fibrillation patients after a ground level fall and identify if validated risk scoring systems accurately stratify risk in this cohort.

Methods

Retrospective review of patients with AF presented to the emergency department after a fall. CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and HAS-BLED scores were calculated. Follow up information was reviewed to 1 year. Patients were grouped according to discharge thromboprophylaxis plan (DTP): no treatment, Anti-platelet (AP), OAC, and AP + OAC. Outcomes were ischemic stroke, MB, or death at 1 year. Ischemic stroke and MB rates were calculated. Kruskal-Wallis, Χ 2, Fisher's exact, and multivariable logistic regression were used to evaluate for clinical associations.

Results

192 patients were included. MB rate was 14.5 bleeds/100 person-years, and ischemic stroke rate was 10.9/100 person-years. There were no observed differences between DTPs. Overall, one-year mortality was 22.1%. On unadjusted analysis, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc did associate with ischemic stroke (p = 0.03); HAS-BLED did not associate with MB (p = 0.17). After logistic regression accounting for known risk factors, neither system associated with ischemic stroke or MB.

Conclusions

Fall patients are at higher risk for both ischemic stroke and MB compared to previously published reports. Current risk assessment tools should be used with caution. Further study of risk factors is warranted to guide medication decisions in these patients.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113CnU8j]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — anticoagulation efficacy and risk score use notes that randomized trials published in the 1990s established the superiority of anticoagulation, at that time limited to warfarin, to reduce stroke, and more recent trials comparing direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) with warfarin reported that DOACs were favored for lower risk of stroke, systemic embolism, and ICH. Patients at intermediate risk (1%-2%/y) can also benefit from anticoagulation. For calibration of risk scores, a CHADS2 score of 1 gave a stroke rate of 1.20 in ATRIA and 2.4 in a Swedish cohort, and it is practical to use a validated risk score, such as CHA2DS2-VASc, ATRIA, or GARFIELD-AF.

### CHADS-VASc score: a predictor of thromboembolic events and mortality in patients with an implantable monitoring device without atrial fibrillation [^112ERf29]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "CHA₂DS₂-VASc score for stroke risk in atrial fibrillation" for atrial fibrillation, acute ischemic stroke, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, transient ischemic attack and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

The CHA₂DS₂-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF). The acronym stands for Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥ 75 years (doubled), Diabetes mellitus, Stroke (doubled), Vascular disease, Age 65–74 years, and Sex category (female). Each factor is assigned a certain number of points, and the total score is used to estimate the risk of stroke.

This calculator is specifically applicable to patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation, including those who are being considered for anticoagulation therapy. The clinical utility of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score is to guide clinicians in making decisions about anticoagulation therapy, as higher scores indicate a greater risk of stroke and may warrant more aggressive treatment.

The CHA₂DS₂-VASc score should not be used in patients with rheumatic atrial fibrillation, as the risk factors and stroke risk in these patients are different. It is also not applicable to patients with transient causes of atrial fibrillation, such as those due to a reversible cause like surgery or acute illness.

The CHA₂DS₂-VASc score is a tool used to estimate the risk of stroke in individuals with atrial fibrillation. It assigns points based on various risk factors, and the total score guides clinical decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy.

Here's how the scoring works:

- Age:

- Below 65 years scores 0 points.
- Between 65 and 74 years scores 1 point.
- 75 years or older scores 2 points.

- Sex:

- Female scores 1 point.
- Male scores 0 points.

- Hypertension:

- If present, scores 1 point.
- If absent, scores 0 points.

- Diabetes Mellitus:

- If present, scores 1 point.
- If absent, scores 0 points.

- Congestive Heart Failure/Left Ventricular Dysfunction:

- If present, scores 1 point.
- If absent, scores 0 points.

- History of Stroke/Thromboembolism/Transient Ischemic Attack:

- If present, scores 2 points.
- If absent, scores 0 points.

- History of Vascular Disease (such as prior myocardial infarction or peripheral artery disease):
- If present, scores 1 point.
- If absent, scores 0 points.

To calculate the score, assess each of these factors for the individual and sum the respective points.

Once the total score is determined, it is interpreted as follows:

- A score of 0 implies a 0.2% risk of ischemic stroke and a 0.3% risk of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolism.
- A score of 1 indicates a 0.6% risk of ischemic stroke and a 0.9% risk of stroke/TIA/systemic embolism.
- A score of 2 suggests a 2.2% risk of ischemic stroke and a 2.9% risk of stroke/TIA/systemic embolism.
- A score of 3 means a 3.2% risk of ischemic stroke and a 4.6% risk of stroke/TIA/systemic embolism.
- A score of 4 reveals a 4.8% risk of ischemic stroke and a 6.7% risk of stroke/TIA/systemic embolism.
- A score of 5 corresponds to a 7.2% risk of ischemic stroke and a 10.0% risk of stroke/TIA/systemic embolism.
- A score of 6 represents a 9.7% risk of ischemic stroke and a 13.6% risk of stroke/TIA/systemic embolism.
- A score of 7 reflects an 11.2% risk of ischemic stroke and a 15.7% risk of stroke/TIA/systemic embolism.
- A score of 8 implies a 10.8% risk of ischemic stroke and a 15.2% risk of stroke/TIA/systemic embolism.
- A score of 9 equates to a 12.2% risk of ischemic stroke and a 17.4% risk of stroke/TIA/systemic embolism.

This comprehensive scoring system helps identify the stroke risk and aids healthcare providers in making informed decisions about patient care.

### Heart failure and major haemorrhage in people with atrial fibrillation [^1112FF64]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications of this research

Based on the CHA2DS2VASc stroke risk score, all patients with HF and AF should be considered for anticoagulation. When anticoagulation is initiated, international guidelines recommend that clinicians also undertake a bleeding risk assessment to identify patients at high-risk then seek to address any modifiable bleeding risk factors. In our subgroup analysis of patients with AF who received anticoagulation, those who also had HF were at significantly increased risk of bleeding (HR 1.68, 95% CI 159 to 1.78). However, at present, the most widely recommended bleed risk scores, HAS-BLED and ORBIT, do not include HF. Bleeding risk scores can only help to identify patients with most to gain from risk factor modification if they are accurate. Our results imply bleeding risk may be under-estimated in people with HF and AF using current risk scores.

Our results also show that competing risks are important to consider in determining bleeding risk among people with HF. Overall, the prognosis for people with HF is poor but outlook varies considerably based on an individual's age. Among older people who have a poor prognosis, there may only be a small difference in bleed risk between those with HF plus AF compared with people with AF only. However, younger people with HF and AF who have a good prognosis may be at a comparatively higher bleed risk. We hope to undertake further research to update bleeding risk prediction scores, incorporating competing risk methods to take account of mortality over time.

### 2020 update to the 2016 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality Measures for adults with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^114YJjwt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — rationale and risk stratification emphasize that AF increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and, with mitral stenosis, 20-fold; compared with CHADS2, the CHA2DS2-VASc score for nonvalvular AF has a broader score range (0 to 9) and includes additional risk factors such as female sex, 65–74 y of age, and vascular disease; the selection of an anticoagulant agent should be based on shared decision-making considering risk factors, cost, tolerability, patient preference, drug interactions, and clinical characteristics including time in the INR therapeutic range; and the term nonvalvular AF is used as "AF in the absence of moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve".

### 2016 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^112deQzU]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Medium credibility.

Areas for further research — bleeding assessment, outcomes, special populations, and candidate concepts — state that "documentation of a bleeding score may be beneficial but that more data are needed before calculation of a bleeding score is advanced to the level of a performance or quality measure", and although the "2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" references HAS-BLED, "no specific guideline recommendations are included with regard to bleeding risk assessment". The committee notes that "future research is needed to determine whether bleeding scores can lead to actionable risk stratification of patients" and that "there is insufficient evidence to support the use of an outcome measure (eg, stroke rate per capita) as a measure of quality of AF care". It also acknowledges "patients with adult congenital heart disease some of whom have residual atrial septal defects that may change the indication for anticoagulation" and that "these patients are not featured in the CHA2DS2-VASc" but "are at greater risk of stroke with atrial fibrillation". Additional concepts listed for exploration include "Shared decision making between the physician and patient on whether a rhythm or rate control strategy should be pursued", "Toxicity from amiodarone screening every 6 to 12 months", "Inappropriate use of anticoagulation in patients with extreme low risk of stroke (ie, CHA2DS2-VASc = 0)", "Prevention of re-occurrence of atrial fibrillation or flutter by controlling blood pressure in patients with hypertension", and "Exploring the feasibility of integration of pharmacokinetic guides for dose adjustments for new oral anticoagulants (eg renal conditions, or other conditions)".

### HAS-BLED and CHA ₂ DS ₂-VASc scores as predictors of bleeding and thrombotic risk after continuous-flow ventricular assist device implantation [^1111JTW8]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

HAS-BLED and CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores predict bleeding in patients on anticoagulation and thromboembolic (TE) risk in patients with atrial fibrillation, respectively. We hypothesized that these scores would be predictive of bleeding and TE complications following continuous-flow ventricular assist device (CF-VAD) implantation.

Methods and Results

Baseline HAS-BLED and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were retrospectively determined for 173 consecutive patients who underwent HeartMate II CF-VAD implantation at a single center from 2005 to 2011. Forty-three patients had bleeding (24.9%) and 22 had TE (12.7%) events over a 290 patient-year follow-up period. The mean ± SD HAS-BLED scores were 2.7 ± 1.0 and 1.9 ± 1.1 (P < .0001) in patients with and without bleeding, respectively. The CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores were 3.6 ± 1.4 and 2.9 ± 1.5 (P = .03) in patients with and without TE events, respectively. A HAS-BLED score of ≥ 3 was associated with a significantly higher risk of bleeding events compared with a score of < 3 (42% vs 15%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 3.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.82–6.32; P < .001). A CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of ≥ 3 was associated with a higher risk of TE events compared with a score of < 3 (18% vs 4%, respectively; HR 4.02, 95% CI 1.19–13.6; p = 0.025).

Conclusions

Baseline HAS-BLED and CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores of ≥ 3 conferred significantly higher risks of bleeding and TE, respectively, following HeartMate II implantation.

### The impact of CHADS-VASc and HAS-BLED scores on clinical outcomes in the amplatzer amulet study [^114mnroQ]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and HAS-BLED scores on ischemic and bleeding events of patients enrolled in the Amplatzer Amulet Observational Study.

Background

Baseline CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and HAS-BLED scores have been validated in atrial fibrillation patients to guide about anticoagulation but not in patients treated by left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO).

Methods

Subjects were stratified according to CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and HAS-BLED scores. Clinical outcomes were collected through 2 years and adjudicated by an independent committee.

Results

Subjects were considered at low (n = 156), moderate (n = 715), and high (n = 215) risk for ischemic stroke, corresponding to CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores of < 3, 3 to 5, and ≥ 6, respectively. The annual rates of ischemic stroke were 1.1%, 2.0%, and 3.5%, respectively. When compared with the predicted rate, LAAO reduced the risk of ischemic stroke by 56%, 69%, and 68%. Device-related thrombus occurred in 0.7%, 1.5%, and 3.0% of subjects at low, moderate, and high risk for ischemic stroke, respectively. The HAS-BLED score was ≤ 3 in 629 subjects and > 3 in 456 subjects, respectively. Non-peri-procedural major bleeding was reduced by 11% and 9% compared with predicted rates in the low and high bleeding risk groups, respectively.

Conclusions

LAAO with the Amplatzer Amulet reduced the risk of ischemic stroke compared with the predicted rate, with a greater magnitude among patients at high thromboembolic risk without increasing the bleeding risk. (Amplatzer™Amulet™ Post-Market Study [Amulet™PMS]; NCT02447081).

### The predictive ability of the CHADS₂ and CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores for bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation: the MAQI (2) experience [^116CEVef]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Guidelines recommend the assessment of stroke and bleeding risk before initiating warfarin anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation. Many of the elements used to predict stroke also overlap with bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation patients and it is tempting to use stroke risk scores to efficiently estimate bleeding risk. Comparison of stroke risk scores to bleeding risk scores to predict bleeding has not been thoroughly assessed.

Methods

2600 patients followed at seven anticoagulation clinics were followed from October 2009-May 2013. Five risk models (CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, HEMORR2HAGES, HAS-BLED and ATRIA) were retrospectively applied to each patient. The primary outcome was the first major bleeding event. Area under the ROC curves were compared with C statistic and net reclassification improvement (NRI) analysis was performed.

Results

110 patients experienced a major bleeding event in 2581.6 patient-years (4.5%/year). Mean follow up was 1.0 ± 0.8years. All of the formal bleeding risk scores had a modest predictive value for first major bleeding events (C statistic 0.66–0.69), performing better than CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores (C statistic difference 0.10–0.16). NRI analysis demonstrated a 52–69% and 47–64% improvement of the formal bleeding risk scores over the CHADS2 score and CHA2DS2-VASc score, respectively.

Conclusions

The CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores did not perform as well as formal bleeding risk scores for prediction of major bleeding in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients treated with warfarin. All three bleeding risk scores (HAS-BLED, ATRIA and HEMORR2HAGES) performed moderately well.

### Usefulness of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score to predict adverse outcomes in patients having percutaneous coronary intervention [^111YYyiA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The application of the CHA2DS2-VASC score as a novel risk stratification tool for predicting outcome in clinical applications other than atrial fibrillation and stroke prevention has been previously examined. However, its usefulness in a population of patients with coronary artery disease after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been explored. We investigated 12,785 consecutive patients who underwent PCI in a tertiary medical center from April 2004 to August 2014 (mean follow-up 6.5 years) and computed the CHA2DS2-VASC score on their index PCI. We assessed the relation between the CHA2DS2-VASC score and clinical outcomes (for example, all-cause mortality and mortality or myocardial infarction) at 1 and 5 years. The mean CHA2DS2-VASC score was 3.7 ± 1.7, 59.1% of patients obtained a score of 3 to 5. Both the primary and secondary outcomes at 1 and 5 years were significantly more frequent as the CHA2DS2-VASC score increased. Overall, the mortality rate after PCI was 10 times higher for patients with a CHA2DS2-VASC score of 5 compared with a score of 1 at both 1-and 5-year follow-up. The CHA2DS2-VASC score predicted all-cause mortality and death or nonfatal myocardial infarction in a significant (p < 0.001, C-index 0.73 and 0.72) and linear fashion. In conclusion, the CHA2DS2-VASC score can be used as a simple and effective tool to predict long-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing PCI.

### How well Do stroke risk scores predict hemorrhage in patients with atrial fibrillation? [^112Pn5HU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The decision to use anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation depends on comparing a patient's estimated risk of stroke to their bleeding risk. Several of the risk factors in the stroke risk schemes overlap with hemorrhage risk. We compared how well 2 stroke risk scores (CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc) and 2 hemorrhage risk scores (the ATRIA bleeding score and the HAS-BLED score) predicted major hemorrhage on and off warfarin in a cohort of 13,559 community-dwelling adults with AF. Over a cumulative 64,741 person-years of follow-up, we identified a total of 777 incident major hemorrhage events. The ATRIA bleeding score had the highest predictive ability of all the scores in patients on warfarin (c-index of 0.74 [0.72 to 0.76] compared with 0.65 [0.62 to 0.67] for CHADS2, 0.65 [0.62 to 0.67] for CHA2DS2-VASc, and 0.64 [0.61 to 0.66] for HAS-BLED) and in those off warfarin (0.77 [0.74 to 0.79] compared with 0.67 [0.64 to 0.71] for CHADS2, 0.67 [0.64 to 0.70] for CHA2DS2-VASc, and 0.68 [0.65 to 0.71] for HAS-BLED). In conclusion, although CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc stroke scores were better at predicting hemorrhage than chance alone, they were inferior to the ATRIA bleeding score. Our study supports the use of dedicated hemorrhage risk stratification tools to predict major hemorrhage in atrial fibrillation.

### Comparison of HAS-BLED and HAS-BED versus CHADSand CHADSVASC stroke and bleeding scores in patients with atrial fibrillation [^114ovwsK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation is recommended in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) for stroke prevention, and the bleeding risk associated suggests the need for a bleeding risk stratification. HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio (INR), elderly > 65 years, drugs/alcohol concomitantly) score includes "labile INR" referred to quality of anticoagulation. However, in naïve patients, this item is not available. In addition, stroke and bleeding risk prediction scores shared several risk factors. The aims of our study were as follows: (1) to evaluate if the HAS-BLED score in its refined form excluding "labile INR" (HAS-BED [hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, elderly, drugs/alcohol]) is still associated with bleeding risk and (2) to evaluate the predictive ability for bleeding of both stroke and bleeding prediction models. We followed an inception cohort of 4,579 patients with AF enrolled in the Survey on anticoagulaTed pAtients RegisTer (NCT02219984). Major bleeds were recorded. During follow-up (7,014 patient-years), 115 patients experienced a major bleeding (MB; rate 1.6 × 100 patient-years). Patients at high risk were better identified by HAS-BLED and HAS-BED scores with respect to CHADS 2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age > 75 years, diabetes, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack) and CHA 2 DS 2 VASc (congestive heart, failure, hypertension, age [> 75 years], diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age [65 to 74 years], female gender). HAS-BLED has a slightly higher c value in comparison to CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 VASc. However, among naïve patients, the predictive ability for hemorrhage of HAS-BED score is overlapping with CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 VASc. In low stroke risk patients (CHA 2 DS 2 VASc = 0 to 1), only 6 patients are at high bleeding risk, and none of them experienced MB. In conclusion, in our prospective cohort of patients with AF, we found that HAS-BLED and HAS-BED scores identify patients at high bleeding risk. However, the predictive value for MB of HAS-BED used in naïve patients is similar to CHADS 2 or CHA 2 DS 2 VASc, suggesting that stroke stratification scores could be sufficient for tailoring treatment.

### Long-term stroke risk prediction in patients with atrial fibrillation: comparison of the ABC-stroke and CHADS-VASc scores [^113VbnYN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Results

We included 1125 patients (49.7% men) with a median age of 76 years (IQR 71–81). A summary of baseline clinical characteristics is shown in Table 1. Median CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc and ABC‐stroke scores were 4 (IQR 3–5) and 9.1 (IQR 7.3–11.3), respectively. The median time in the therapeutic range at 6 months after entry was 80% (IQR 66–100) and the median HAS‐BLED score was 2 (IQR 2–3). During 6.5 years (IQR 4.3–7.9) of follow‐up, there were 203 major bleeding events (18%, 2.77% per year) and 450 patients died (40%, 6.15% per year).

Table 1
Baseline Clinical Characteristics

At the interim 3.5 years (IQR 3.1–3.6) of follow‐up, 58 patients experienced an ischemic stroke (5.2%, an annual rate of 1.50% per year). Of these, 98.3% were "high risk" by CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc category (ie, score ≥ 2) and 70.7% were high risk by ABC‐stroke category (ie, predicted event rate > 2%). At the end of follow‐up, ie, at 6.5 years (IQR 4.3–7.9), 114 patients experienced an ischemic stroke (10.1%, annual rate of 1.55% per year). Of these, 99.1% were high risk by CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc category and 68.4% by ABC‐stroke (Table 2).

### The HAS-BLED score has better prediction accuracy for major bleeding than CHADS₂ or CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation [^1139wwoj]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a specific bleeding risk score, HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly), was better at predicting major bleeding compared with CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, 75 years of age or older, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack) and CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, 75 years of age and older, diabetes mellitus, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, 65 to 74 years of age, female) in anticoagulated atrial fibrillation (AF) patients.

Background

The CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores are well-validated stroke risk prediction scores for AF, but are also associated with increased bleeding and mortality.

Methods

We recruited 1,370 consecutive AF patients (49% male; median age, 76 years) receiving oral anticoagulation therapy from our outpatient anticoagulation clinic, all of whom were receiving acenocoumarol and had an international normalized ratio between 2.0 and 3.0 during the preceding 6 months. During follow-up, major bleeding events were identified by the 2005 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. Model performance was evaluated by calculating the C-statistic, and the improvement in predictive accuracy was evaluated by calculating the net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement.

Results

After a median follow-up of 996 (range, 802 to 1,254) days, 114 patients (3.0%/year) presented with a major bleeding event; 31 of these events were intracranial hemorrhages (0.8%/year). Based on the C-statistic, HAS-BLED had a model performance superior to that of both CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc (both p < 0.001). Both net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement analyses also show that HAS-BLED was more accurately associated with major bleeding compared with CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores.

Conclusions

In anticoagulated AF patients, a validated specific bleeding risk score, HAS-BLED, should be used for assessing major bleeding. The practice of using CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc as a measure of high bleeding risk should be discouraged, given its inferior predictive performance compared with the HAS-BLED score.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation stroke-risk rationale and scoring note that "Nonvalvular AF increases the risk of stroke 5 times, and AF in the setting of mitral stenosis increases the risk of stroke 20 times over that of patients in sinus rhythm". Risk stratification uses CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc with age thresholds noted as "age ≥ 75 y" and "age 65–74 y", and "the CHA2DS2-VASc score for nonvalvular AF has a broader score range (0 to 9) and includes a larger number of risk factors". Treatment selection guidance states, "The selection of an antithrombotic agent should be based on shared decision making that takes into account risk factors, cost, tolerability, patient preference, potential for drug interactions, and other clinical characteristics, including time in the INR therapeutic range if the patient has been on warfarin, irrespective of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent".

### Improving CHADS-VASc stratification of non-fatal stroke and mortality risk using the intermountain mortality risk score among patients with atrial fibrillation [^113XwJtV]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

The argument for starting a patient with AF on OAC at a specific CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score threshold is based on recommendations of society guidelines. These recommendations are based on studies that suggest the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc more clearly defines risk than the CHADS 2 score and redistributed more patients from a low-risk to a high-risk group. This shift from the CHADS 2 to CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score is largely based on removing the large intermediate-risk group found with CHADS 2, where anticoagulation recommendations were not very clear. The result was a large shift of women, particularly older women, to the high-risk group. Unfortunately, while older women have a heightened risk of stroke, they are also at a higher risk for bleeds. It is also suggested that CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc was a better discriminator of 'true low-risk' patients when compared with CHADS 2. This is important as the net benefit analyses have shown only patients who truly do not benefit from OAC are those at low risk for stroke, even when taking bleeding risk into account. While CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc are the most widely used measures to determine use of OAC in patients with AF, it is readily apparent that they are challenged by their lack of discernment between low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk patients, as well as a lack of dynamicity. While a study showed that CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc can increase over time,(29) this only occurs when a risk factor that a patient did not already have is diagnosed, while laboratory factors can increase and also decrease and may improve in response to a successful treatment. By current guidelines, patients with a score > 1 should receive OAC. In this cohort, that accounts for 91.1% of women and 70.1% of men (88.6% of men when a score of 1 is included in the high-risk group).

### The HAS-BLED score for predicting major bleeding risk in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Vh2C9]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Our objective was to compare the diagnostic accuracy between the HAS-BLED score and any of HEMORR2 HAGES, ATRIA, CHADS2, or CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation. We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Embase databases for relevant studies. Data were extracted and analyzed according to predefined clinical endpoints. Eleven studies were identified. Discrimination analysis demonstrates that HAS-BLED has no significant C-statistic differences for bleeding risk prediction compared with ATRIA or HEMORR2 HAGES, but it has significant differences compared with CHADS2 or CHA2 DS2 -VASc. The significant positive net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement values also show that HAS-BLED is superior to that of any of HEMORR2 HAGES, ATRIA, CHADS2, or CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores. According to calibration analysis of HAS-BLED, it overpredicts the risk of bleeding in the low (risk ratio [RR]: 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63–2.13, P = 0.64) risk stratification but underpredicts that in the moderate (RR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51–0.86, P = 0.002) and high (RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.70–1.10, P = 0.27) risk stratifications. The HAS-BLED score not only performs better than the HEMORR2 HAGES and ATRIA bleeding scores, but it also is superior to the CHADS2 and CHA2 DS2 -VASc stroke scores for bleeding prediction. The HAS-BLED score should be the optimal choice to assess major bleeding risk in clinical practice.

Europace (2017). Medium credibility.

CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED risk assessment and anticoagulation — Until more evidence is forthcoming, stroke and bleeding risk in these patients should be assessed using CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED, and a high HAS-BLED score is not a reason to withhold OAC. Given that all clinical risk scores have only modest predictive value, the initial step should be the identification of 'low risk' patients (CHA2DS2-VASc score 0 in males, 1 in females) who do not need any antithrombotic therapy; the subsequent step is to consider stroke prevention (which is OAC) in patients with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors, with a clear recommendation for OAC in those with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2. OAC refers to a NOAC or well controlled VKA, with time in the therapeutic range (TTR) > 70%, and a TTR of > 70% is associated with the best efficacy and safety of the VKAs; a good TTR can be predicted by clinical factors encompassed within the SAMe-TT2R2 score.

Risk stratification

Managing risk is an essential component of caring for patients with AF. Numerous efforts have been made to devise accurate user-friendly tools to estimate the risk of stroke and the risks and benefits of oral anticoagulation (OAC). However, these risk prediction tools have significant limitations that hinder their effectiveness. First, commonly used risk scores have a modest discrimination value. For example, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc, the most common risk score for the prediction of stroke in the setting of AF, only achieved a C-statistics of 0.61 in the original validation cohort and C-statistics between 0.58 and 0.69 in subsequent confirmatory studies. Similarly, the HASBLED score, a widely used score to predict bleeding risks with warfarin, attained C-statistics of 0.60–0.66 when externally validated in prospective cohorts. Second, current risk prediction schemes omit key predictors of the event of interest. For example, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc does not account for AF duration, left atrial size and function, left atrial appendage contractility, and morphology, all of which have been shown to strongly correlate with ischemic stroke risk. Likewise, the HASBLED score does not account for the type of anticoagulant used, and hence may not be applicable to modern practice where most AF patients receive direct OACs. Third, although commonly used in daily practice, the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was derived from observations made several decades ago. Since then, medical treatment has evolved, risk factors have changed, and stroke incidence has declined. There is a dire need to revisit the value of these "historical" data and their applicability to current or future practice. Fourth, risk scores do not address the need of the growing number of "special AF populations" whose unique characteristics are not accounted for in these schemes. For instance, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which affects 12%-36% of octogenarians and is associated with a several-fold increase in micro and overt intracranial hemorrhage, is not recognized by current risk scores (Figure 1). Indeed, both the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and the HASBLED scores yielded a limited value in predicting stroke and bleeding in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Similarly, these scores are inadequate to risk-stratify patients with end-stage renal disease, a rapidly growing population in whom the prevalence of AF exceeds 25%. The increasing complexity of AF patients and of the available stroke prevention strategies along with the limitations of risk prediction tools highlight the need for a team approach to effectively appraise the evidence and provide individual patient-centered recommendations.

Atrial fibrillation bleeding risk scores emphasize HAS-BLED, defined as hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function (1 point each), stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile INR, elderly (> 65 years), and drugs/alcohol concomitantly (1 point each). HAS-BLED is a superior predictor of bleeding risk compared with CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc, has similar or superior performance to more complex scores, and has been validated in patients on NOACs and in patients with CAD treated with coronary stenting. In comparative work, ORBIT demonstrated the best discrimination and calibration in the RE-LY cohort, whereas the biomarker-based ABC bleeding risk score did not appear to confer long-term benefit over a simpler clinical score such as HAS-BLED; the PRECISE DAPT score does not currently provide useful information on additional bleeding risk when both OAC and DAPT are indicated.

### Discriminative ability of CHADS-VASc and HAS-BLED score in whites and nonwhites [^1176z1xG]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and HAS-BLED scoring systems are used in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) to estimate risk of stroke and bleeding, respectively. Both were developed in minimally diverse European populations and these scores have not yet been extensively studied in US whites and nonwhites. In a retrospective cohort study, we included patients with AF who received inpatient or outpatient care in a large integrated academic health system from 2011 to 2017. Cox proportional hazards were used to analyze associations between stroke and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score in AF patients not prescribed anticoagulation and between incident bleeding and HAS-BLED score in anticoagulated patients. After exclusions for previous stroke, the cohort included 21,648 patients with a mean age of 66.8 ± 15.8. Anticoagulation was prescribed in 52% of whites and 46% of nonwhites (p < 0.001) with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of ≥ 2. Mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores were 2.4 ± 1.6 in whites and 2.2 ± 1.6 in nonwhites and mean HAS-BLED scores was 1.5 ± 1.1 in whites and 1.3 ± 1.0 in nonwhites. After adjusting for baseline differences, the discriminative ability of CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and HAS-BLED was similar in whites and nonwhites (p = 0.52, 0.33, respectively). The discriminative ability of HAS-BLED was similar in patients on vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants. In conclusion, oral anticoagulation was prescribed less frequently in nonwhites. However, the discriminative ability of CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and HAS-BLED were similar in whites and nonwhites.

### Should we recommend oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing coronary artery stenting with a high HAS-BLED bleeding risk score? [^114ZArxp]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Recent European guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation recommend oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes, history of previous stroke, vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and sex category [female]) ≥ 1. The HAS-BLED score (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly [> 65 years], Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) has been suggested to assess bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation (score ≥ 3 indicates high risk of bleeding). Despite the guidelines, this approach has never been tested in a cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation.

Methods and Results

We studied 590 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention/stenting and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASC score > 1 (ie, OAC recommended). We compared patients with low-intermediate bleeding risk (HAS-BLED 0–2) and high risk (HAS-BLED ≥ 3), the relation between CHA(2)DS(2)-VASC and HAS-BLED, and the benefit and risks of the use of OAC in patients with high bleeding risk. The development of any bleeding episode, thromboembolism, mortality, cardiac events, and the composite major adverse cardiac events (ie, death, acute myocardial infarction, and/or target lesion revascularization) end point was recorded as well as the composite major adverse events (ie, major adverse cardiac events, major bleeding, or thromboembolism) end point at 1-year follow-up. Of the study cohort, 420 (71%) had a HAS-BLED score ≥ 3, and patients who were on OAC at discharge had lower mortality rate (9.3% versus 20.1%; P < 0.01) and major adverse cardiac events (13.0% versus 26.4%; P < 0.01) but with a similar major adverse event (20.5% versus 27.6%; P = 0.11) and higher major bleeding rate (11.8% versus 4.0%; P < 0.01). In a Cox multivariable analysis in patients with HAS-BLED ≥ 3, predictors of increased death were chronic renal failure and heart failure (both P < 0.05), whereas OAC at discharge was associated with a reduced death rate (P < 0.01). Predictors of major bleeding were chronic renal failure and the use of drug-eluting stents (both P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Most patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention/stenting have a high risk for major bleeding (HAS-BLED score ≥ 3). Even in these patients, OAC improves prognosis in these patients (reduced mortality and major adverse cardiac events) with an increase in major bleeding.

Atrial fibrillation — risk stratification for thromboembolism includes four directives: Patients with AF should be evaluated for their annual risk of thromboembolic events using a validated clinical risk score, such as CHA2DS2-VASc; patients with AF should be evaluated for factors that specifically indicate a higher risk of bleeding, such as previous bleeding and use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, in order to identify possible interventions to prevent bleeding on anticoagulation; patients with AF at intermediate annual risk by risk scores (eg, equivalent to CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 in men or 2 in women) who remain uncertain about the benefit of anticoagulation can benefit from consideration of factors that might modify their risk of stroke to help inform the decision; and in patients deemed at high risk for stroke, bleeding risk scores should not be used in isolation to determine eligibility for oral anticoagulation but instead to identify and modify bleeding risk factors and to inform medical decision-making, labeled "1 B-NR", "1 B-NR", "2a C-LD", and "3: No Benefit" respectively.

### Antithrombotic regimens for patients taking oral anticoagulation after coronary intervention: a meta-analysis of 16 clinical trials and 9, 185 patients [^1132nE8Y]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Careful risk stratification should be made to balance the risk of stroke and bleeding before the initiation of antithrombotic therapy. The most widely used score to predict stroke risk in patients with AF is the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years [2 points], diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism [2 points], vascular disease, age 65–74 years, sex category). 2 Oral anticoagulation is necessary in AF patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score ≥ 1, and high scores are associated with a stroke risk of up to 15% per year. 2 The HAS‐BLED score (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio [INR], elderly [> 65 years], drugs/alcohol concomitantly) is the most validated bleeding‐risk score in AF. 37 A HAS‐BLED score ≥ 3 indicates a high bleeding risk; however, it could not be depended on, on its own, to exclude patients from OAC. 38 There is a large overlap between the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc and HAS‐BLED score, and individualized strategies balancing stroke and bleeding risk are needed.

ACC/AHA PM-1 rationale — Atrial fibrillation (AF), whether paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent, significantly increases thromboembolic ischemic stroke risk, with nonvalvular AF increasing the risk of stroke 5 times and AF in the setting of mitral stenosis increasing the risk of stroke 20 times; the appropriate use of antithrombotic therapy and control of other risk factors substantially reduce stroke risk, the CHA2DS2-VASc score for nonvalvular AF has a broader score range (0 to 9) and includes a larger number of risk factors, and selection of an antithrombotic agent should be based on shared decision making that takes into account clinical factors and patient preference.

### Risk stratification for bleeding complications in patients with venous thromboembolism: application of the HAS-BLED bleeding score during the first 6 Months of anticoagulant treatment [^116KMcex]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism affects around 1 to 2 adults per 1000 every year. 1 The most recent American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines recommend treatment with non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants over vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin) in patients without cancer for at least 3 months. 2 In patients with cancer, low‐molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are recommended over other treatments. The goal of anticoagulation is to treat the current VTE and to prevent recurrent VTE. However, anticoagulation also imposes an increased risk for bleeding events and this risk must be assessed to determine appropriateness of a given treatment plan for each patient.

In an analogous treatment paradigm, individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) often receive long‐term anticoagulation for prevention of cerebrovascular events. In the AF population, risk scores are now commonly used as clinical decision support tools to initiate anticoagulation based on stroke risk (eg, CHADS s and CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc). 3 More recently, bleeding risk scores have been developed to go hand‐in‐hand with stroke risk scores to determine the potential net clinical benefit of anticoagulation and to guide patient follow‐up throughout therapy. 3

The Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding, Labile International Normalized Ratio (INR), Elderly, Drugs or alcohol use (HAS‐BLED) score is one such score and has been shown to have strong predictive validity for major bleeding complications. 4 HAS‐BLED has been validated across several AF cohorts 4, 5 and has recently been applied to patients with VTE to determine its ability to identify those at the highest risk. 6 These prior studies of VTE cohorts have been limited in size and number of events, and have thus been unable to establish a clear ability of the HAS‐BLED score to assess bleeding risk in a VTE population.

This study's primary objective was to evaluate the HAS‐BLED score in a large cohort of VTE patients receiving outpatient anticoagulation treatment. Second, the HAS‐BLED score was evaluated in a subgroup of VTE patients with cancer. The latter objective fulfills a crucial gap in the literature, given that cancer is one of the strongest risk factors for VTE and presents a more complicated patient population in regards to additional risk factors for adverse bleeding events.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation risk assessment when initiating oral anticoagulation (OAC) — it is important to first assess thromboembolic and bleeding risks. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is the most extensively validated tool to assess stroke or systemic embolism risk; current ACC/AHA/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines recommend that men with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 and women with a score ≥ 3 take an OAC. Patients with lower scores may be considered for OAC based on additional clinical factors and patient preference. Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or rheumatic mitral stenosis are advised to take an OAC regardless of the CHA2DS2-VASc score; similar guidance exists for patients undergoing electrical cardioversion or AF ablation. The type of AF, symptoms, and AF burden do not usually affect OAC decision-making, although OAC for brief, asymptomatic, device-detected AF is uncertain. Several bleeding risk scores (e.g. HAS-BLED, HEMORR2HAGES, ATRIA) and definitions (e.g. ARC-HBR) exist, but none are perfectly discriminant.

### Effects of oral anticoagulant therapy in medical inpatients ≥ 65 years with atrial fibrillation [^112afnt9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

In this retrospective cohort observational study, we investigated mortality, ischemic, and hemorrhagic events in patients ≥ 65 years with atrial fibrillation consecutively discharged from an Acute Geriatric Ward in the period 2010 to 2013. Stroke and bleeding risk were evaluated using CHA2DS2-VASC (congestive heart failure/left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension, aged ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolism, vascular disease, aged 65 to 74 years, gender category) and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly) scores. Co-morbidity, cognitive status, and functional autonomy were evaluated using standardized scales. Independent associations among clinical variables, including use of vitamin K antagonist-based oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT), all-cause mortality, and fatal and nonfatal ischemic and hemorrhagic events, were evaluated. Further clinical outcomes comparison between patients treated with OAT and those untreated was performed after adjustment for significant differences in patient baseline characteristics with propensity score matching. Of 980 patients discharged (mean age 83 years, 60% women, roughly 30% cognitively impaired or functionally dependent, mean CHA2DS2-VASC and HAS-BLED scores 4.8 and 2.1, respectively), 505 (51.5%) died during a mean follow-up period of 571 days; ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke occurred in 82 (12.3%) and 13 patients (1.3%), respectively, and major bleedings in 43 patients (4.4%). Vitamin K antagonists' use was independently associated with reduced mortality (odds ratio 0.524) and with a nonsignificant reduction in incidence of ischemic stroke, without excess in bleeding risk. Similar findings were observed in the 2 propensity score-matched cohorts of patients. In conclusion, among vulnerable patients with atrial fibrillation ≥ 65 years with high post-discharge death rate, OAT was associated, among other multiple factors, with reduced mortality.

### Value of adding the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score to the GRACE score for mortality risk prediction in patients with acute coronary syndrome [^115LmuVV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score has been routinely used for risk stratification of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. We aimed to examine whether the addition of the CHA2DS2-VASc score to the GRACE score improves risk stratification. Included were patients with ACS who were divided into high (> 140), intermediate (110 < GRACE score ≤ 140) and low (< 110) GRACE score. Each group was further divided into 3 subgroups categorized according to their CHA2DS2-VASc score: 0–1, 2–3, and ≥ 4. Management and Outcomes were compared for each GRACE score group and CHA2DS2-VASc score subgroups. Included 6,854 ACS patients, of them 3596 (52.5%) were classified as low risk, 1,937 (28.3%) were at intermediate risk and 1,321 (19.3%) were high-risk patients. In the intermediate risk group, patients with a higher CHA2DS2-VASc score more frequently underwent percutaneous coronary revascularization. For low risk patients, 30-day mortality rates were 0.8%, 1.5%, and 1.3% (p = 0.02), and 1-year all-cause mortality rates were 1.3%, 3%, and 2.6% (p = 0.002) for CHA2DS2-VASc score 0–1, 2–3, ≥ 4, respectively. For intermediate risk patients, 30-day mortality rates were 2.9%, 3.4%, and 3.8% (p = 0.8), and 1-year all-cause mortality rates were 6.4%, 7.8%, and 11.2% (p = 0.01) for CHA2DS2-VASc score 0–1, 2–3, ≥ 4, respectively. Among patients with a GRACE score < 140, each 1 point increase in the CHA2DS2-VASc score was associated with a 57% increase in 1-year mortality rates. In conclusion, the addition of the CHA2DS2-VASc score to the GRACE risk score in ACS patients improves risk stratification of patients with low and intermediate risk.

### Assessment of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score in predicting ischemic stroke, thromboembolism, and death in patients with heart failure with and without atrial fibrillation [^117ESp91]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The CHA2DS2-VASc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years [doubled], diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism [doubled], vascular disease [prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque], age 65–75 years, sex category [female]) is used clinically for stroke risk stratification in atrial fibrillation (AF). Its usefulness in a population of patients with heart failure (HF) is unclear.

Objective

To investigate whether CHA2DS2-VASc predicts ischemic stroke, thromboembolism, and death in a cohort of patients with HF with and without AF.

Design, Setting, and Population

Nationwide prospective cohort study using Danish registries, including 42 987 patients (21.9% with concomitant AF) not receiving anticoagulation who were diagnosed as having incident HF during 2000–2012. End of follow-up was December 31, 2012.

Exposures

Levels of the CHA2DS2-VASc score (based on 10 possible points, with higher scores indicating higher risk), stratified by concomitant AF at baseline. Analyses took into account the competing risk of death.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Ischemic stroke, thromboembolism, and death within 1 year after HF diagnosis.

Results

In patients without AF, the risks of ischemic stroke, thromboembolism, and death were 3.1% (n = 977), 9.9% (n = 3187), and 21.8% (n = 6956), respectively; risks were greater with increasing CHA2DS2-VASc scores as follows, for scores of 1 through 6, respectively: (1) ischemic stroke with concomitant AF: 4.5%, 3.7%, 3.2%, 4.3%, 5.6%, and 8.4%; without concomitant AF: 1.5%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 3.0%, 3.7%, and 7% and (2) all-cause death with concomitant AF: 19.8%, 19.5%, 26.1%, 35.1%, 37.7%, and 45.5%; without concomitant AF: 7.6%, 8.3%, 17.8%, 25.6%, 27.9%, and 35.0%. At high CHA2DS2-VASc scores (≥ 4), the absolute risk of thromboembolism was high regardless of presence of AF (for a score of 4, 9.7% vs 8.2% for patients without and with concomitant AF, respectively; overall P < .001 for interaction). C statistics and negative predictive values indicate that the CHA2DS2-VASc score performed modestly in this HF population with and without AF (for ischemic stroke, 1-year C statistics, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.65–0.68] and 0.64 [95% CI, 0.61–0.67], respectively; 1-year negative predictive values, 92% [95% CI, 91%-93%] and 91% [95% CI, 88%-95%], respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with incident HF with or without AF, the CHA2DS2-VASc score was associated with risk of ischemic stroke, thromboembolism, and death. The absolute risk of thromboembolic complications was higher among patients without AF compared with patients with concomitant AF at high CHA2DS2-VASc scores. However, predictive accuracy was modest, and the clinical utility of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in patients with HF remains to be determined.

### Predictive value of the HAS-BLED and ATRIA bleeding scores for the risk of serious bleeding in a "real-world" population with atrial fibrillation receiving anticoagulant therapy [^116yrRTe]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the clear net clinical benefit of oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the occurrence of major bleeding events may be devastating. The HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly) bleeding risk score was first described in 2010 and is recommended in European and Canadian guidelines to estimate major bleeding risk. In 2011, the Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) study group described a new bleeding risk scheme for AF, which includes five weighted risk factors: anemia, severe renal disease, age ≥ 75 years, previous hemorrhage, and diagnosed hypertension. We assessed the predictive value of the ATRIA bleeding score in a large cohort of patients with AF receiving anticoagulant therapy, compared with the well-validated HAS-BLED score.

Methods

We recruited consecutive patients with AF receiving anticoagulant therapy from our outpatient anticoagulation clinic with an INR between 2.0 and 3.0 during the previous 6 months' clinic visits. During follow-up, major bleeding events were assessed. We assessed both bleeding risk scores as quantitative variables or as dichotomized variables (low-moderate risk vs high risk). Model performance was evaluated by calculating C statistics, and the improvement in predictive accuracy was evaluated by calculating the net reclassification improvement (NRI) and the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).

Results

We included 937 patients (49% men; median age, 76 years). Median (interquartile range) follow-up was 952 (785–1,074) days, during which 79 (8%) suffered a major bleeding event (annual rate, 3.2%). The HAS-BLED score had a model performance (based on C statistics) similar to that of the ATRIA score as a quantitative variable (C statistic, 0.71 vs 0.68; p = 0.356) but was superior to the ATRIA score when analyzed as a dichotomized variable (C statistic, 0.68 vs 0.59; p = 0.035). Both NRI and IDI analyses demonstrated that the HAS-BLED score more accurately predicted major bleeding episodes than did the ATRIA risk score, as reflected in the percentage of events reclassified correctly.

Conclusion

The HAS-BLED score shows significantly better prediction accuracy than the weighted (and more complex) ATRIA score. Our findings reinforce the incremental usefulness of the simple HAS-BLED score over other published bleeding risk scores in patients with AF receiving anticoagulant therapy.

Stroke risk and risk score stratification in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation — nonvalvular atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke 5 times, and AF with mitral stenosis increases the risk 20 times; risk stratification frameworks cited include CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or TIA or thromboembolism [doubled]) and CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years [doubled], diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or TIA or thromboembolism [doubled], vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, sex category), and compared with the CHA2DS2 score the CHA2DS2-VASc score has a broader score range (0 to 9) and includes a larger number of risk factors (female sex, 65 to 74 years of age, and vascular disease); selection of an antithrombotic agent should be based on shared decision making that considers risk factors, cost, tolerability, patient preference, drug interactions, and time in the INR therapeutic range if previously on warfarin.

Restarting oral anticoagulation (OAC) after bleeding — indications and risk–benefit factors: In most cases, restarting OAC after a bleeding event provides net clinical benefit, and after a patient has a bleeding event on OAC, the indication for OAC should be reassessed to determine whether continued therapy is warranted on the basis of established clinical practice guidelines. Possible conditions for which OAC may no longer be indicated include nonvalvular AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score < 2 in men and < 3 in women, first time provoked VTE > 3 months ago, or bioprosthetic valve placement in the absence of AF > 3 months ago. If there is an ongoing indication for OAC, the clinician must evaluate the net clinical benefit of OAC in the context of a recent bleed, and this assessment should be conducted in consultation with other practitioners and in discussion with patients or caregivers; several validated bleeding assessment tools are available, but none has been studied in the specific situation of active or very recent bleeding. Reversible factors that may have contributed to the bleed, such as a high INR in a patient on a VKA, concomitant antiplatelet therapy, acute or worsening renal insufficiency leading to elevated OAC levels, or significant drug interactions that could increase DOAC levels, should be addressed prior to restarting therapy. If the patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy, re-evaluating whether aspirin can be discontinued is reasonable, and bleed characteristics that contribute substantially to risks with restarting anticoagulation include the location, the source and whether it was definitively identified and treated, the mechanism, and whether further surgical or procedural interventions are planned; patients who are at a high thrombotic risk will likely benefit from restarting anticoagulation even if the risk of rebleeding is high.

### Clinical utility of CHADS₂ and CHA₂DS₂-VASc scoring systems for predicting postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery [^111pcKos]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The presence of postoperative atrial fibrillation predicts a higher short- and long-term mortality rates; however, no scoring system has been used to discriminate patients at high risk for this complication. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores are useful risk assessment tools for new-onset atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery.

Methods

A total of 277 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery were prospectively included in this risk stratification study. We calculated the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores from the data collected. The primary end point was the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation within 30 days after cardiac surgery.

Results

Eighty-four (30%) of the patients had postoperative atrial fibrillation at a median of 2 days (range, 0–27 days) after cardiac surgery. The CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were significant predictors of postoperative atrial fibrillation in separate multivariate regression analyses. The Kaplan-Meier analysis obtained a higher postoperative atrial fibrillation rate when based on the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores of at least 2 than when based on scores less than 2 (both log rank, P < .001). In addition, the CHA2DS2-VASc scores could be used to further stratify the patients with CHADS2 scores of 0 or 1 into 2 groups with different postoperative atrial fibrillation rates at a cutoff value of 2 (12% vs 32%; p = 0.01).

Conclusions

CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were predictive of postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery and may be helpful for identifying high-risk patients.

### 2015 ACC / HRS / SCAI left atrial appendage occlusion device societal Overview [^115QghSn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) stroke prevention — current evidence and guidelines report that AF affects as many as 6.1 million individuals in the United States and may account for as many as 1 in 5 strokes in persons over 80 years of age, and that for patients with nonvalvular AF, the left atrial appendage (LAA) is the most common source of thrombus resulting in stroke. Chronic anticoagulation — traditionally with warfarin and more recently with direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors — has been established as the standard of care for stroke prevention in patients with AF who have an elevated stroke risk profile, provided that the risk of bleeding is not prohibitive, with stroke risk estimation using the CHA2DS2-VASc point score. The guideline includes a Class I recommendation for oral anticoagulation for patients with prior stroke or a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 (estimated annual stroke risk of 2.2%) in the context of shared decision making, and it does not formally include bleeding risk scores such as HAS-BLED in its recommendations. Guideline recommendations for LAA occlusion for stroke prevention are substantially more limited due to the lack of clinical trials data for any these devices aside from WATCHMAN.

### Quality indicators for the care and outcomes of adults with atrial fibrillation [^116oDNHQ]. Europace (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation quality indicators — Domain 01: Patient assessment (baseline and follow-up) — define performance measures as the proportion of patients with cardio-embolic risk assessment using CHA2DS2-VASc; bleeding risk assessment using a validated method such as HAS-BLED; measurement of serum creatinine or creatinine clearance; people ≥ 65 years of age or with risk factors for atrial fibrillation who have pulse check; patients with atrial high-rate episodes detected on implantable cardiac devices who undergo further cardiovascular evaluation; cryptogenic stroke patients screened for atrial fibrillation; patients with ECG documentation of atrial fibrillation; and patients engaged in shared decision making when deciding treatment strategy.
