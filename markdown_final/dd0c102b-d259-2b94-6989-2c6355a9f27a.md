## Question

Name aminoglycosides

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a list of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which agents are consistently named across authoritative sources. Then, I should verify which are currently approved or in clinical use versus historical or investigational. Next, I will organize them by structural class to reflect mechanism and resistance patterns. Finally, I should double-check for any omissions or misclassifications and correct them explicitly.

> Let me first confirm the core agents that repeatedly appear in clinical references. Gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, and paromomycin are consistently listed as aminoglycosides in multiple sources, including pediatric and infectious disease reviews and FDA labeling, so I should anchor on these as the canonical set [^dd1f1ff5] [^48d5fda8] [^dd1f1ff5].

> Wait, let me verify the status of plazomicin before I include it. Plazomicin is a next-generation aminoglycoside approved in 2018 for complicated urinary tract infections and is explicitly described as a semisynthetic aminoglycoside designed to evade common resistance mechanisms, so it belongs on the list of currently available agents [^dded3a36] [^8a77a9e5].

> I need to check the structural classification to ensure I'm not mixing categories. Aminoglycosides are broadly grouped into 2-deoxystreptamine-containing agents and the streptidine-containing streptomycin; within the 2-DOS class, 4,6-disubstituted agents include gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, kanamycin, and plazomicin, while 4,5-disubstituted agents include neomycin and paromomycin, which aligns with contemporary mechanistic and structural reviews [^41caa9de] [^4d25d5ed].

> Hold on, I should verify the historical and special-use agents so I don't overstate current availability. Streptomycin remains available and is used in select contexts such as plague and some MDR-TB regimens, though it is not first-line for TB in many settings, which confirms its inclusion among named aminoglycosides despite limited contemporary use [^356e3c3f] [^ce0a4d9a].

> Let me consider topical and locally administered forms to ensure completeness. Neomycin is widely used topically and is associated with notable contact allergy prevalence, and tobramycin is available as ophthalmic drops/ointment and inhaled formulations for cystic fibrosis, reinforcing that these are clinically relevant members of the class beyond parenteral therapy [^eaedd202] [^5db8f393] [^ae838c33].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought spectinomycin might belong here because it is sometimes grouped with aminoglycosides in older texts; but hold on, I should verify its mechanism and classification. Spectinomycin binds the 30S ribosome and inhibits translocation but lacks the 2-deoxystreptamine core and is not considered a true aminoglycoside in modern mechanistic and structural classifications, so I should exclude it from the list to avoid misclassification [^notfound].

> I should double-check that I've captured the agents used in MDR-TB and other niche indications. Amikacin and streptomycin are the principal injectable aminoglycosides used in MDR-TB when susceptibility permits, whereas kanamycin has fallen out of favor due to inferior outcomes, which supports including amikacin and streptomycin and noting kanamycin's limited role [^ce0a4d9a] [^bbc227b9].

> Let me reconsider the final synthesis to ensure balance between breadth and accuracy. The clinically relevant aminoglycosides that should be named are: gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, paromomycin, and plazomicin, organized by structure as streptidine-containing streptomycin and 2-DOS agents subdivided into 4,6-disubstituted (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, kanamycin, plazomicin) and 4,5-disubstituted (neomycin, paromomycin), which reflects current usage, approvals, and mechanistic groupings [^41caa9de] [^4d25d5ed] [^dded3a36].

---

Aminoglycosides are **broad-spectrum, bactericidal antibiotics** that inhibit protein synthesis by binding the 30S ribosomal subunit. They are **primarily used for severe Gram-negative infections** and are characterized by concentration-dependent killing and a post-antibiotic effect [^3059f099]. Key agents include **gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, paromomycin, and plazomicin** [^dd1f1ff5] [^dded3a36]. Major limitations are **nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity**, so monitoring and once-daily dosing are recommended when feasible [^d213923b] [^d977d72c].

---

## Classification and structure

Aminoglycosides are classified by their **core structure** and **substitution pattern**:

| **Subclass** | **Core structure** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Streptidine-containing | Streptidine ring | Streptomycin |
| 2-Deoxystreptamine (2-DOS) containing | 2-DOS ring with amino sugars | - Gentamicin <br/> - Amikacin <br/> - Tobramycin <br/> - Neomycin <br/> - Kanamycin <br/> - Paromomycin <br/> - Plazomicin |

---

## Mechanism of action

Aminoglycosides bind the **30S ribosomal subunit**, disrupting protein synthesis and causing misreading of mRNA, which leads to accumulation of toxic misfolded proteins and bacterial cell death [^e82ce882]. Their activity is **oxygen-dependent**, so they are inactive against anaerobes [^de687365].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

- **Absorption**: Poor oral bioavailability; administered IV/IM or topically/inhaled [^8380ea42].
- **Distribution**: Primarily extracellular; low CNS penetration.
- **Elimination**: Renal excretion; dose adjustment in renal impairment is required [^8380ea42].
- **Pharmacodynamics**: Concentration-dependent killing and post-antibiotic effect support once-daily dosing [^3059f099].

---

## Clinical indications

Aminoglycosides are **reserved for severe infections** when alternatives are unsuitable:

- **Severe Gram-negative infections**: Sepsis, pneumonia, endocarditis, and complicated UTIs [^68d4e015].
- **Combination therapy**: Synergy with beta-lactams for enterococcal or staphylococcal endocarditis [^e181a0ad].
- **Specialized uses**: Inhaled tobramycin for cystic fibrosis; streptomycin for plague and MDR-TB [^356e3c3f] [^ce0a4d9a].

---

## Adverse effects and monitoring

- **Nephrotoxicity**: 5–15% incidence; monitor renal function and drug levels [^72085fa6] [^609245a4].
- **Ototoxicity**: Cochlear and vestibular; often irreversible; monitor audiometry in high-risk patients [^e0338db1].
- **Neuromuscular blockade**: Risk with rapid IV push or concomitant neuromuscular blockers.
- **Pregnancy**: Contraindicated due to fetal ototoxicity [^089ea01b].

---

## Resistance mechanisms

Resistance arises via **enzymatic inactivation** (acetylation, phosphorylation, adenylation), **ribosomal target modification** (16S rRNA methylation), and **reduced permeability** (porin loss) [^de687365] [^0322e010]. Plazomicin was designed to overcome many of these mechanisms [^8a77a9e5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Avoidance**: Use only when no less nephrotoxic alternatives exist [^d213923b].
- **Once-daily dosing**: Preferred in patients with normal renal function to reduce toxicity [^d977d72c].
- **Monitoring**: Drug levels and renal function with therapy beyond 24–48 hours [^609245a4].

---

Aminoglycosides remain **essential for severe Gram-negative infections**, but their use requires careful selection, dosing, and monitoring to balance efficacy with toxicity [^773c467c].

### What do I need to know about aminoglycoside antibiotics? [^8380ea42]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2017). Low credibility.

The aminoglycosides are broad-spectrum, bactericidal antibiotics that are commonly prescribed for children, primarily for infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens. The aminoglycosides include gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, neomycin, and streptomycin. Gentamicin is the most commonly used antibiotic in UK neonatal units. Aminoglycosides are polar drugs, with poor gastrointestinal absorption, so intravenous or intramuscular administration is needed. They are excreted renally. Aminoglycosides are concentration-dependent antibiotics, meaning that the ratio of the peak concentration to the minimum inhibitory concentration of the pathogen is the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic index best linked to their antimicrobial activity and clinical efficacy. However, due to their narrow therapeutic index, the patient's renal function should be monitored to avoid toxicity, and therapeutic drug monitoring is often required. Here we provide a review of aminoglycosides, with a particular focus on gentamicin, considering their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and also practical issues associated with prescribing these drugs in a paediatric clinical setting.

### Back to the future: using aminoglycosides again and how to dose them optimally [^4d6f7ac8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Gram-negative organisms have become increasingly resistant to both beta-lactam antibiotics and fluoroquinolones. Consequently, aminoglycoside antibiotics have undergone a resurgence in use. Because of the known toxicities of aminoglycoside antibiotics, clinicians have avoided their use, unless no other alternatives were extant. Over the past 2 decades, we have learned much about the relationship between aminoglycoside exposure and the likelihood of a good clinical outcome or the occurrence of nephrotoxicity. For example, minimum inhibitory concentration values ≥ 2.0 mg/L lead to unacceptably low probabilities of a good clinical outcome, and infrequent administration of doses (i.e., intervals of 24 h and longer intervals for patients with compromised renal function) plays a central role in minimizing the likelihood of toxicity. Using these new insights, we suggest ways of evaluating the dose and schedule of administration of aminoglycosides in empirical therapy to obtain the highest likelihood of an efficacious and nontoxic therapy.

### New insights into the mechanism of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity: an integrative point of view [^52bef69a]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Nephrotoxicity is one of the most important side effects and therapeutical limitations of aminoglycoside antibiotics, especially gentamicin. Despite rigorous patient monitoring, nephrotoxicity appears in 10–25% of therapeutic courses. Traditionally, aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity has been considered to result mainly from tubular damage. Both lethal and sub-lethal alterations in tubular cells handicap reabsorption and, in severe cases, may lead to a significant tubular obstruction. However, a reduced glomerular filtration is necessary to explain the symptoms of the disease. Reduced filtration is not solely the result of tubular obstruction and tubular malfunction, resulting in tubuloglomerular feedback activation; renal vasoconstriction and mesangial contraction are also crucial to fully explain aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. This review critically presents an integrative view on the interactions of tubular, glomerular, and vascular effects of gentamicin, in the context of the most recent information available. Moreover, it discusses therapeutic perspectives for prevention of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity derived from the pathophysiological knowledge.

### Pharmacodynamics and dosing of aminoglycosides [^3059f099]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Aminoglycosides are concentration-dependent killing agents whose pharmacodynamic predictors of efficacy are the area-under-the-curve to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio and the peak to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio. Prospective studies have shown that these agents can be given once-daily or less frequently in most clinical settings, with equal efficacy and possible reduced toxicity. Dosages for different clinical settings have been studied and methods are available to monitor once-daily dosing.

### Streptomycin [^446ebb15]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DESCRIPTION

Streptomycin is a water-soluble aminoglycoside derived from Streptomyces griseus. It is marketed as the sulfate salt of streptomycin. The chemical name of streptomycin sulfate is D-Streptamine, O -2-deoxy-2-(methylamino)- α -L-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)- O -5-deoxy-3- C -formyl- α -L-lyxofuranosyl-(1→4)- N, N 1-bis(aminoiminomethyl)-, sulfate (2:3) (salt). The molecular formula for Streptomycin Sulfate is (C21H39N7O12)2• 3H2SO4and the molecular weight is 1457.41. It has the following structural formula:

Streptomycin for Injection, equivalent to 1 gram streptomycin/vial, is supplied as a sterile nonpyrogenic lyophilized cake for intramuscular use after reconstitution. The lyophilized cake may reduce to a powder during shipping.

After reconstitution, the pH range for Streptomycin for Injection should be between 4.5 and 7 in a solution containing 200 mg of streptomycin activity per mL.

*Each vial of Streptomycin for Injection contains streptomycin sulfate equivalent to 1 gram of streptomycin.

### Side effects of aminoglycosides on the kidney, ear and balance in cystic fibrosis [^e21341b9]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

Aminoglycoside antibiotics are a central component of the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (CF) and slow the decline in lung function which ultimately causes the death of most patients. The prognosis of CF has improved, and thus side effects of treatments have become increasingly important. Observational studies suggest that the morbidity from side effects of aminoglycosides is disturbingly common, and that aggressive treatment may lead to more side effects. This review of the current literature on side effects of aminoglycosides considers the pathophysiological mechanisms, epidemiology and risk factors, investigation of side effects and preventative strategies. Treatments which have shown early promise are identified and areas of future research are discussed.

### Chemically related 4, 5-linked aminoglycoside antibiotics drive subunit rotation in opposite directions [^8d4aea26]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Aminoglycoside antibiotics are potent, broad-spectrum bactericidal agents that inhibit cell growth by targeting functional centres within the bacterial ribosome to alter global aspects of the translation mechanism. However, despite their clinical effectiveness, aminoglycosides are commonly restricted to topical applications. Oral administration is typically a last resort to fight multi-drug-resistant pathogens due to their propensities to elicit adverse side effects in patients, including oto- and nephrotoxicities. The molecular origins of aminoglycoside toxicities and their bactericidal activities are currently a matter of significant debate.

Initiatives spanning the past half century indicate that aminoglycosides with a 2-deoxystreptamine ring target the conserved helix 44 (h44) messenger RNA (mRNA) 'decoding site' region of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) within the small (30S) subunit of the bacterial ribosome, reducing translational fidelity by promoting the promiscuous incorporation of near- and non-cognate aminoacyl-transfer RNAs (tRNAs) (miscoding). Investigations of RNA oligonucleotide model systems, ribosomal subunitsand intact ribosomessuggest that aminoglycosides do so by binding the major groove of h44 to shift the position and dynamics of two universally conserved residues (A1492 and A1493) responsible for the recognition of the mRNA codon-aminoacyl–tRNA (aa–tRNA) complex.

### Aminoglycosides: a practical review… [^48d5fda8]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The first aminoglycoside, streptomycin, was isolated from Streptomyces griseus in 1943. Neomycin, isolated from Streptomyces fradiae, had better activity than streptomycin against aerobic gram-negative bacilli but, because of its formidable toxicity, could not safely be used systemically. Gentamicin, isolated from Micromonospora in 1963, was a breakthrough in the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections, including those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other aminoglycosides were subsequently developed, including amikacin, netilmicin and tobramycin, which are all currently available for systemic use in the United States. 1 The purpose of this article is to provide family physicians with a review of the aminoglycosides and their role in the treatment of infectious diseases.

Despite the introduction of newer, less toxic antimicrobial agents, aminoglycosides continue to serve a useful role in the treatment of serious enterococcal and gram-negative bacillary infections. Clinical Uses Aminoglycosides display bactericidal, concentration-dependent killing action and are active against a wide range of aerobic gram-negative bacilli. They are also active against staphylococci and certain mycobacteria. Aminoglycosides are effective even when the bacterial inoculum is large, and resistance rarely develops during the course of treatment. These potent antimicrobials are used as prophylaxis and treatment in a variety of clinical situations. 4 Tobramycin may be the aminoglycoside of choice for use against P. aeruginosa because it has shown greater in vitro activity. Nevertheless, the clinical significance of this activity has been questioned.

1 Amikacin is particularly effective when used against bacteria that are resistant to other aminoglycosides, since its chemical structure makes it less susceptible to inactivating enzymes. 4 Depending on local patterns of resistance, amikacin may be the preferred agent for serious nosocomial infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. Table 2 lists the cost of various antibiotics used to treat gram-negative infections. 9 Nephrotoxicity results from renal cortical accumulation resulting in tubular cell degeneration and sloughing. Examination of urine sediment may reveal dark-brown, fine or granulated casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis but not specific for aminoglycoside renal toxicity.

### GENTAMICIN SULFATE INJECTION, USP 80mg / 2mL… [^767d2301]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Gentamicin is classified as an aminoglycoside antibiotic and is derived from Micromonospora purpurea, an actinomycete. The chemical name for gentamicin C1A is: 0-3-Deoxy-4-C-methyl-3 — β-L-arabinopyranosyl — 0–2-deoxy-D-streptamine. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Gentamicin, an aminoglycoside, binds to the prokaryotic ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis in susceptible bacteria. It is bactericidal in vitro against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Resistance. Aminoglycosides are known to be not effective against Salmonella and Shigella species in patients. Therefore, in vitro susceptibility test results should not be reported. Interaction With Other Antimicrobials. In vitro studies show that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell wall synthesis may act synergistically against some enterococcal strains.

The combination of gentamicin and penicillin G has a synergistic bactericidal effect against strains of Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and E. durans. An enhanced killing effect against many of these strains has also been shown in vitro with combinations of gentamicin and ampicillin, carbenicillin, nafcillin or oxacillin. The combined effect of gentamicin and carbenicillin is synergistic for many strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vitro synergism against other Gram-negative organisms has been shown with combinations of gentamicin and cephalosporins. Gentamicin may be active against clinical isolates of bacteria resistant to other aminoglycosides. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. Patients should be well hydrated during treatment.

Although the in vitro mixing of gentamicin and carbenicillin results in a rapid and significant inactivation of gentamicin, this interaction has not been demonstrated in patients with normal renal function who received both drugs by different routes of administration. A reduction in gentamicin serum half-life has been reported in patients with severe renal impairment receiving carbenicillin concomitantly with gentamicin.

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin) [^f90248c8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Hypersensitivity to gentamicin is a contraindication to its use. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to other aminoglycosides may contraindicate use of gentamicin because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class.

### Prevalence of contact allergy to neomycin in dermatitis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2dfcf497]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic commonly used in topical formulations. Although beneficial for infection control, neomycin is a recognised allergen, and exposure may cause contact allergy (CA) in both adults and children. Neomycin can be administered orally, whereas topical formulations are available for localised use. Neomycin is found in over‐the‐counter and prescription products worldwide, such as antibiotic ointments, eye drops, eardrops, and as an excipient in vaccines widely utilised for its antimicrobial properties. Antibiotic resistance is often highlighted as an argument for restrictive antibiotic use; however, contact allergy to antibiotics is another issue that needs to be addressed. In the European baseline series, neomycin has been tested in 20% pet. and neomycin is also part of the TRUE test system.

Little is known about the worldwide prevalence of CA to neomycin in adults and children. While individual studies have explored the prevalence of CA to neomycin, a comprehensive synthesis of this evidence is lacking. The aim of this study is to establish prevalence estimates of CA to neomycin in adults and children and investigate the prevalence in different geographical regions.

### Tobramycin sulfate (tobramycin) [^2bd60844]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS:

A hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside is a contraindication to the use of tobramycin. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reactions to aminoglycosides may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs in this class.

---

### Streptomycin [^78255ba9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Streptomycin is indicated for the treatment of individuals with moderate to severe infections caused by susceptibile strains of microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below:

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of streptomycin and other antibacterial drugs, streptomycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^609245a4]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to prevention of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity, KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend to obtain drug level monitoring when multiple daily dosing of aminoglycosides is used for > 24 hours.
Consider obtaining drug level monitoring when single-daily dosing of aminoglycosides is used for > 48 hours.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^4747428b]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) prevention — aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity use restrictions and risk factors: We suggest not using aminoglycosides for the treatment of infections unless no suitable, less nephrotoxic, therapeutic alternatives are available. (2A). Aminoglycosides should be used for as short a period as possible because repeated administration over several days or weeks can result in accumulation within the renal interstitium and tubular epithelial cells and a higher incidence of nephrotoxicity with repeated exposure. Reported AKI frequency with aminoglycosides is up to 25% in some series and has prompted guidance that they should no longer be added to other standard antimicrobial agents for empirical or directed therapy of severe Gram-positive or Gram-negative infections. Higher-risk groups include older patients (> 65 years), patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction, and septic patients with intravascular volume depletion, with additional risk factors including diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs, prolonged use, excessive blood levels, or repeated exposure to separate courses over a short time interval.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^d213923b]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO AKI — aminoglycoside use and monitoring — We suggest not using aminoglycosides for the treatment of infections unless no suitable, less nephrotoxic, therapeutic alternatives are available (2A). We suggest that, in patients with normal kidney function in steady state, aminoglycosides are administered as a single dose daily rather than multiple-dose daily treatment regimens (2B). We recommend monitoring aminoglycoside drug levels when treatment with multiple daily dosing is used for more than 24 hours (1B), and we suggest monitoring aminoglycoside drug levels when treatment with single-daily dosing is used for more than 48 hours (2C). We suggest using topical or local applications of aminoglycosides (e.g., respiratory aerosols, instilled antibiotic beads), rather than i.v. application, when feasible and suitable (2B).

### Animal ototoxicity of topical antibiotics and the relevance to clinical treatment of human subjects [^08631432]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature on animal ototoxicity from ototopical medications. A secondary objective was to assess the relevance of animal data to the use of ototopical drops in clinical situations involving humans.

Study Design

We performed a MEDLINE search of the published literature using appropriate search terms to identify pertinent articles, which were reviewed, summarized, and tabulated.

Results

One hundred seventy-three articles were reviewed; 61 articles were appropriate to the study question and were further analyzed.

Conclusions

Virtually all studies demonstrate that aminoglycoside antibiotics, when applied topically into the middle ear space, are ototoxic in experimental animals.

### Translation error clusters induced by aminoglycoside antibiotics [^e82ce882]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Aminoglycoside antibiotics target the ribosome and induce mistranslation, yet which translation errors induce bacterial cell death is unclear. The analysis of cellular proteins by quantitative mass spectrometry shows that bactericidal aminoglycosides induce not only single translation errors, but also clusters of errors in full-length proteins in vivo with as many as four amino acid substitutions in a row. The downstream errors in a cluster are up to 10,000-fold more frequent than the first error and independent of the intracellular aminoglycoside concentration. The prevalence, length, and composition of error clusters depends not only on the misreading propensity of a given aminoglycoside, but also on its ability to inhibit ribosome translocation along the mRNA. Error clusters constitute a distinct class of misreading events in vivo that may provide the predominant source of proteotoxic stress at low aminoglycoside concentration, which is particularly important for the autocatalytic uptake of the drugs.

### Once-daily versus multiple-daily dosing with intravenous aminoglycosides for cystic fibrosis [^5e5e7072]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

People with cystic fibrosis, who are chronically colonised with the organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa, often require multiple courses of intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics for the management of pulmonary exacerbations. The properties of aminoglycosides suggest that they could be given in higher doses less often. This is an update of a previously published review.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of once-daily versus multiple-daily dosing of intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics for the management of pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cystic Fibrosis Specialist Register held at the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's editorial base, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and handsearching abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 31 January 2019. We also searched online trial registries. Date of latest search: 25 February 2019.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials, whether published or unpublished, in which once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides has been compared with multiple-daily dosing in terms of efficacy or toxicity or both, in people with cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently selected the studies to be included in the review and assessed the risk of bias of each study; authors also assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Data were independently extracted by each author. Authors of the included studies were contacted for further information. As yet unpublished data were obtained for one of the included studies.

Main Results

We identified 15 studies for possible inclusion in the review. Five studies reporting results from a total of 354 participants (aged 5 to 50 years) were included in this review. All studies compared once-daily dosing with thrice-daily dosing. One cross-over trial had 26 participants who received the first-arm treatment but only 15 received the second arm. One study had a low risk of bias for all criteria assessed; the remaining included studies had a high risk of bias from blinding, but for other criteria were judged to have either an unclear or a low risk of bias. There was little or no difference between treatment groups in: forced expiratory volume in one second, mean difference (MD) 0.33 (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.81 to 3.48, moderate-quality evidence); forced vital capacity, MD 0.29 (95% CI -6.58 to 7.16, low-quality evidence); % weight for height, MD -0.82 (95% CI -3.77 to 2.13, low-quality evidence); body mass index, MD 0.00 (95% CI -0.42 to 0.42, low-quality evidence); or in the incidence of ototoxicity, relative risk 0.56 (95% CI 0.04 to 7.96, moderate-quality evidence). Once-daily treatment in children probably improved the percentage change in creatinine, MD -8.20 (95% CI -15.32 to -1.08, moderate-quality evidence), but showed no difference in adults, MD 3.25 (95% CI -1.82 to 8.33, moderate-quality evidence). The included trials did not report antibiotic resistance patterns or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Once- and three-times daily aminoglycoside antibiotics appear to be equally effective in the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. There is evidence of less nephrotoxicity in children.

Aminoglycosides — local application (Recommendation 3.8.5): We suggest using local applications of aminoglycosides rather than i.v. application when feasible and suitable (2B). Rationale includes that local instillation can concentrate aminoglycoside levels at specific tissue sites; aminoglycoside-loaded beads are used for prevention and treatment of bone and joint infections; aerosol delivery systems provide high intrapulmonary antibiotic levels with minimal systemic and kidney concentrations and have been used successfully in cystic fibrosis, although significant nephrotoxicity with inhaled tobramycin has been described in at least two cases.

### Basis for selective drug evasion of an aminoglycoside-resistance ribosomal RNA modification [^4d25d5ed]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Aminoglycosides are broad-spectrum ribosome-targeting antibiotics with activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Currently, aminoglycosides are in clinical use as last-resort antibiotics for patients with severe or complicated infections (e.g. sepsis, infective endocarditis), including multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative infections, and for long-term treatment of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections associated with cystic fibrosis. Broader application has been limited by aminoglycoside toxicity relative to other treatment options, but increasing resistance to these other drug classes has led to a reevaluation of aminoglycoside use –. However, continued use of aminoglycosides is also threatened by multiple resistance mechanisms, including efflux and chemical modification of either the drugs or their ribosomal binding site –.

Aminoglycosides bind 16S rRNA helix 44 (h44) at the aminoacyl-tRNA site (A site) within the conserved decoding center of the bacterial ribosome and typically induce mRNA misreading to disrupt the fidelity of protein synthesis, eventually resulting in cell death. Aminoglycosides are polycationic oligosaccharides, with most containing a common 2-deoxystreptamine (2-DOS) ring (Ring II) appended with additional aminosugar rings (Fig. 1). The 2-DOS ring is connected at position 4 via a glycosidic bond to a modified α-glucose unit (Ring I) to form the disaccharide core that comprises the minimal fragment specifically able to bind to h44. Different classes of aminoglycosides are then distinguished based on the additional sugar linkages to the 2-DOS unit. A second modified α-glucose unit (Ring III) at position 6 of the 2-DOS ring forms the 4,6-DOS aminoglycosides, including kanamycin (Kan) and the clinically important drugs amikacin (Amk), tobramycin (Tob), gentamicin C1A (Gen), and plazomicin (Plz). Alternatively, appending the position 5 of the 2-DOS ring with a β-D-ribosyl moiety forms the scaffold of the 4,5-DOS class of aminoglycosides, including the trisaccharides ribostamycin and butirosin, tetrasaccharides neomycin (Neo) and paromomycin (Par; Fig. 1), and the pentasaccharide lividomycin.

### Current use for old antibacterial agents: polymyxins, rifampin, and aminoglycosides [^f566f7ef]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

This article discusses three classes of antibacterial agents that are uncommonly used in bacterial infections (other than mycobacterial infections) and can be thought of as special-use agents. These are the polymyxins, rifampin, and the aminoglycosides.

### Aminoglycosides for the treatment of septic shock: a propensity-based study [^baaa5027]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Aminoglycosides harbor potent antimicrobial properties including bactericidal activity, synergy with beta-lactams, post-antibiotic effect, and broadening the antibacterial spectrum. However, the evidence of benefit in septic shock is scarce, based on controversial meta-analysis and retrospective studies. Despite the combination antibiotherapy improved the adequacy of initial antibiotic treatment, it did not translate into improved survival. However, the high incidence of aminoglycosides underdosing argues for accurate antimicrobial drug monitoring in further interventional trials.

### Chemically related 4, 5-linked aminoglycoside antibiotics drive subunit rotation in opposite directions [^adfec905]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

While these investigations have greatly advanced our understanding of the molecular determinants of ribosome binding, they fall short of elucidating how the aminoglycosides affect each stage of the translation mechanism — initiation, elongation, termination and recycling. They are also unable to fully explain how subtle chemical distinctions between structurally related aminoglycosides give rise to unique inhibition and resistance profiles. Furthermore, a miscoding mechanism of action is at odds with observations that bacterial strains harbouring error-prone ribosomes are viableand evidence that specific aminoglycosides inhibit protein synthesis while exhibiting little, to no, miscoding. A comprehensive understanding of aminoglycoside action on the ribosome must provide a rationale for these observations, as well as data suggesting that 2-deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides may operate through more than one functional site on the bacterial ribosome.

Crystal structures of intact 70S Escherichia coli (E. coli) ribosomes have recently revealed that aminoglycosides bind to sites in both the small and large (50S) subunit of the bacterial ribosome. We have shown that neomycin, the most potent and toxic member of the 4,5-linked aminoglycoside class(Fig. 1a), promotes translational miscoding and shutdown by simultaneously binding to the h44-decoding site and the major groove of H69 within the 30S and 50S subunits, respectively(Fig. 1b). These conserved rRNA elements, which comprise the central intersubunit bridge B2, undergo marked structural rearrangements during small-subunit rotation, a process underpinning multiple aspects of the translation cycle. It is not presently known whether, and to what extent, chemically related 4,5-linked aminoglycosides within the neomycin class impact the dynamics of subunit rotation.

### 4'-O-substitutions determine selectivity of aminoglycoside antibiotics [^538a7a3f]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The structural basis for the altered specificity of the series of modified aminoglycosides is unclear. Globally, the crystal structures of the bacterial 30S subunit in complex with compounds 1, 30, 37 and 39 resemble the structures of available 30S–aminoglycoside complexes, in particular the 30S–apramycin complex, even if subtle differences are present (see Results and Fig. 4). This work exemplifies the difficulty of predicting specificity at the typical resolutions of ~3 Å as for current ribosomal crystal structures. Such specificity may arise as the result of subtle energetics that cannot easily be deduced from the structures. A more thorough understanding of the structural basis for the compounds' selectivity will require a careful comparison with structures of both higher eukaryotic cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomes in complex with 2-deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides, preferably at higher resolutions than possible to date. Such structures are currently not feasible because the appropriate experimental conditions have not been established. At the functional level, misreading-inducing activity on bacterial ribosomes but not on eukaryotic ribosomes (Fig. 5) and the compounds' unique structure–activity profiles of drug–mutant ribosome interaction (Table 3) differentiates them from available aminoglycosides, and establishes the series of 4′ modifications as a novel chemotype with a unique mode of interaction with h44.

Interest in aminoglycosides has recently seen a revival not least because structural details of drug–target interactions and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes have provided a wealth of knowledge, facilitating hypothesis-driven approaches to developing aminoglycosides recalcitrant to resistance determinants. The description of aminoglycoside–ribosome complexes at atomic resolutionhas greatly stimulated efforts at structure-based design of new bioactive derivatives. However, rational design of specificity using these structures is limited by the current resolution of crystallographic analysis and an incomplete understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic factors involved in antibiotic binding. These limitations in understanding small molecule–RNA interactions and the constraints imposed by the limited sequence polymorphism in the drug-binding pocket make it a formidable challenge to synthesize aminoglycosides that are more selective at the drug-target level. The combined chemical synthesis, structural analysis, genetics and functional studies employed here have enabled us to manipulate a complex biological system of drug–target interaction. By introducing defined substitutions we have identified a new chemotype of aminoglycosides with increased selectivity and little activity for any of the human drug-binding pockets, an important step towards the development of less toxic aminoglycosides.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^b1feca5b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Aminoglycoside hypersensitivity — epidemiology, testing approach, and management: The prevalence of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) to neomycin sulfate ranged from 7.2% to 13.1%. IgE-mediated reactions to aminoglycosides are uncommon. For intradermal testing in patients with prior anaphylaxis, one may consider beginning with a 10-fold dilution. Avoidance of the offending agent is recommended for type IV hypersensitivity; in the setting of negative skin testing and low clinical suspicion for IgE-mediated allergy, a graded challenge can be performed; and rapid desensitization is recommended when an IgE-mediated allergy exists and no suitable alternative antibiotic is available.

### 4'-O-substitutions determine selectivity of aminoglycoside antibiotics [^7f64aabd]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Selectivity is of particular concern for ribosomal antibioticsas the ribosome is present in all three domains of life and is a relatively conserved structure. Among this class, aminoglycosides are listed by the WHO as critically important antimicrobials for human therapy. Their high efficacy, broad-spectrum antibacterial potency and lack of drug-related allergy are well-known features and make aminoglycosides a common choice for the treatment of serious infections including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. A major drawback of aminoglycosides relates to their adverse effects. Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity, that is, the compounds' ability to cause irreversible hearing loss due to destruction of inner ear sensory hair cells, occurs in a sporadic, dose-dependent manner. In addition, inherited forms of hypersensitivity to aminoglycoside ototoxicity exist, which are linked to point mutations in mitochondrial rRNA, such as A1555G and C1494U. Recent evidence converges on mitochondrial function as a key element in aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity, as experimental evidence was provided for both aminoglycoside-induced dysfunction of the mitochondrial ribosome and A1555G/C1494U-linked mitochondrial hypersusceptibility to aminoglycoside antibiotics. These findings suggest that aminoglycoside ototoxicity is directly related to the drugs' mechanism of action on the eukaryotic ribosome.

The 2-deoxystreptamine aminoglycoside antibiotics bind to helix 44 (h44) of 16S rRNA, which is part of the decoding site of the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, thereby decreasing translational fidelity and inhibiting translocation. The interaction core formed by rings I and II is mainly responsible for drug binding. Ring I intercalates into the internal loop formed by A1408, A1492, A1493 and the base pair C1409–G1491. Here ring I becomes properly positioned by stacking interaction with G1491 and the formation of hydrogen bonds with A1408 (Fig. 1). Despite variations in chemical composition, ring I always binds in the same orientation and forms a pseudo base-pair interaction with the Watson–Crick edge of adenine 1408. The ring oxygen of ring I accepts a hydrogen bond from the N6 of adenine, and the amino- or hydroxyl-group at position 6′ donates a hydrogen bond to the N1 of adenine. Additional hydrogen bonds link the hydroxyl groups at positions 3′ and 4′ of ring I to the phosphate groups of the two bulged adenine bases 1492 and 1493, further stabilizing the position of ring I.

### Translation error clusters induced by aminoglycoside antibiotics [^8f55ace8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Aminoglycoside antibiotics (AGAs) are positively charged oligosaccharides that target bacterial ribosomes. AGAs induce misreading of the mRNA, resulting in the incorporation of incorrect amino acids into protein, and/or inhibit translocation, the movement of the ribosome along the mRNA –. Many AGAs, such as paromomycin (Par), tobramycin (Tob), neomycin (Neo), gentamicin (Gen), kanamycin (Kan), or amikacin (Amk), are clinically important as broad-spectrum antibiotics. On the other hand, their propensity to induce translation errors can be utilized to alleviate the symptoms of human genetic diseases (e.g. Duchenne muscular dystrophy) by increasing readthrough of premature stop codons. The negative side effect of AGA treatment is its unfavorable effect on translation in mitochondria –. In particular, the high oto- and nephrotoxicity due to targeting of mitoribosomes often hampers systemic administration of AGAs.

Although misreading is the key element of the AGA action, we know surprisingly little which types of errors are induced and how they affect the proteome and the fitness of bacterial cells. AGAs preferentially induce a subset of errors that result from a misreading of the third position of the mRNA codon, but errors in the first and second position can also occur –. The type of most prevalent errors depends on the drug, e.g. streptomycin (Str) is less efficient than other AGAs in inducing U-G mismatches in the second position or G-U mismatches at any position of the codon–anticodon complexes. Severe mistranslation leads to growth arrest or cell death in bacteria –. However, the AGA-induced error load alone cannot explain their bactericidal effects. In fact, ribosomal ambiguity (ram) mutants, with alterations in ribosomal protein S4, also cause increased misreading, but grow at almost wild-type (wt) rates. This led to the notion that there is something particular to the bactericidal effect of AGAs, but what causes their detrimental effect on bacterial fitness and cell viability remains unclear.

### We give aminoglycoside antibiotics at the end of hemodialysis [^2ce35b8e]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

We often administer dialyzable medications after dialysis to ensure that adequate concentrations are maintained in the body until the next session. In the case of aminoglycosides, we may have the opportunity to dose more aggressively predialysis, and then use the clearance of the drug by dialysis to limit toxicities. Predialysis aminoglycoside dosing is intriguing, although studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of this approach are necessary before it can be used routinely.

### Selective silencing of antibiotic-tethered ribosomes as a resistance mechanism against aminoglycosides [^e5fce8e2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose an increasing threat to human health, ranking globally as the third leading cause of death in 2019. Most aminoglycoside antibiotics (AGAs) are bactericidal, broad-spectrum antimicrobials that reduce the speed and fidelity of translation (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c) –. In Gram-negative bacteria, AGAs must cross both the outer and inner membranes to reach the ribosome, with the inner membrane representing a major permeability barrier for these cationic, hydrophilic compounds. According to the current uptake model –, AGAs enter the periplasm through porin channels or by disrupting the outer membrane. Aided by the membrane potential, they then seep into the cytoplasm, where they bind to a few ribosomes and induce mRNA misreading, by stabilizing an error-prone ribosome conformation. Even single amino acid substitutions can render proteins nonfunctional; however, when AGA-bound ribosomes continue translation in the error-prone conformation, they can accumulate consecutive amino acid substitutions known as error clusters, further compounding the loss of protein function. Error clusters potentiate proteotoxic error burden at the onset of AGA treatment, when only a small fraction of ribosomes is corrupted by the drug. The accumulation of faulty membrane proteins – and misreading-induced metabolic by-products, makes the inner membrane permeable to AGAs. As more and more AGAs enter the cell, more ribosomes bind AGAs and become corrupted. Over time, this self-promoted uptake leads to a massive influx of AGAs, resulting in a burst of translation errors, proteostasis collapse, and an accumulation of reactive by-products. These factors damage macromolecular structures, disrupt metabolism, and cause membrane voltage dysregulation, ultimately leading to cell death.

### Aminoglycosides in hemodialysis patients: is the current practice of post dialysis dosing appropriate? [^fb3c3a23]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Aminoglycosides have been widely used in end-stage renal failure patients for the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus. Traditionally, these agents are administered post dialysis to avoid premature dialytic clearance, although no studies have been performed to confirm that this dosing strategy represents the optimal treatment regimen. In recent years, a more complete understanding of the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of aminoglycosides has led to a global change in clinical practice from multiple to once-daily dosing in patients with normal renal function with the aim of providing intermittent pulses to maximize the peak concentration relative to overall drug exposure. These same considerations strongly support administration of aminoglycosides before, rather than after, hemodialysis. This study will review the key pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerations in aminoglycoside dosing, the relationship between serum aminoglycoside concentrations and efficacy/toxicity, the influence of renal function and hemodialysis on aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and the mounting population pharmacokinetic and clinical study evidence supporting a paradigm shift in aminoglycoside dosing from post dialysis to predialysis.

### Overview of changes in the clinical and laboratory standards institute performance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing: M100 32nd and 33rd editions [^dded3a36]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aminoglycoside P. aeruginosa breakpoints differ among breakpoint setting organizations. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), CLSI, and EUCAST each have different P. aeruginosa breakpoints for amikacin and tobramycin. Gentamicin P. aeruginosa breakpoints still exist for FDA and USCAST, while they do not for CLSI and EUCAST. The various breakpoints, or the lack thereof, are indicative of difficulties in setting breakpoints for aminoglycosides. Laboratories should discuss these issues with their clinical providers, infectious diseases pharmacists, and other healthcare providers, review applicable treatment guidelines released by professional organizations, and together determine approaches to testing and reporting of aminoglycosides for P. aeruginosa.

Plazomicin received FDA approval in 2018 for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections in adults. It was developed to treat infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. Its structure protects it from degradation by most aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. Plazomicin has little added activity compared to other aminoglycosides against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. and thus, there are no breakpoints for those organisms. MIC and disk diffusion breakpoints for plazomicin and Enterobacterales (excluding the Morganellaceae family, which includes Proteus, Providencia, and Morganella spp.) were published in the M100 33rd edition. Isolates of the Morganellaceae family display elevated MICs against plazomicin, which extend beyond the wild type.

### Basis for selective drug evasion of an aminoglycoside-resistance ribosomal RNA modification [^6af972df]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Aminoglycosides disrupt the fidelity of bacterial protein synthesis, but their potent antibacterial activity is threatened by multiple resistance mechanisms, including methylation of their ribosomal RNA (rRNA) binding site. However, the impact of one such resistance-conferring methylation on N1 of helix 44 nucleotide A1408 (m 1 A1408) is highly variable with some aminoglycosides retaining significant potency. Here, we examine bacterial susceptibility to diverse aminoglycosides, determine high-resolution electron cryomicroscopy structures of m 1 A1408-modified 70S ribosome-aminoglycoside complexes, and perform molecular dynamics simulations to decipher the key determinants of such "resistance evasion". Collectively, these analyses reveal how some aminoglycosides adapt their conformation to accommodate m 1 A1408, including the roles of specific ring substituents, balancing ligand strain and maintaining favorable interactions, as well as interactions made by additional functional groups that compensate for those disrupted by the modification. This work provides design principles that can guide future rational development of aminoglycosides refractory to resistance conferred by rRNA modifications.

### Is deafness mutation screening required in cystic fibrosis patients? [^3403cbd1]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Aminoglycosides are widely used in cystic fibrosis management. The m.1555A > G mutation predisposes to aminoglycoside ototoxicity. It may cause later onset hearing loss in the absence of aminoglycosides use and gradual hearing loss may be an inevitable consequence of the mutation. Given that aminoglycoside therapy forms the backbone of IV protocols in CF, this article recommends screening for this mutation to allow informed decision-making prior to aminoglycoside administration, to avoid preventable deafness.

### Beta lactam antibiotic monotherapy versus beta lactam-aminoglycoside antibiotic combination therapy for sepsis [^ab991f1f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal antibiotic treatment for sepsis is imperative. Combining a beta lactam antibiotic with an aminoglycoside antibiotic may provide certain advantages over beta lactam monotherapy.

Objectives

Our objectives were to compare beta lactam monotherapy versus beta lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy in patients with sepsis and to estimate the rate of adverse effects with each treatment regimen, including the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics.

Search Methods

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 11); MEDLINE (1966 to 4 November 2013); EMBASE (1980 to November 2013); LILACS (1982 to November 2013); and conference proceedings of the Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (1995 to 2013). We scanned citations of all identified studies and contacted all corresponding authors. In our previous review, we searched the databases to July 2004.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing any beta lactam monotherapy versus any combination of a beta lactam with an aminoglycoside for sepsis.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure, superinfections and adverse events. Two review authors independently collected data. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the fixed-effect model. We extracted outcomes by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

We included 69 trials that randomly assigned 7863 participants. Twenty-two trials compared the same beta lactam in both study arms, while the remaining trials compared different beta lactams using a broader-spectrum beta lactam in the monotherapy arm. In trials comparing the same beta lactam, we observed no difference between study groups with regard to all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.30) and clinical failure (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.29). In studies comparing different beta lactams, we observed a trend for benefit with monotherapy for all-cause mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01) and a significant advantage for clinical failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.84). No significant disparities emerged from subgroup and sensitivity analyses, including assessment of participants with Gram-negative infection. The subgroup of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections was underpowered to examine effects. Results for mortality were classified as low quality of evidence mainly as the result of imprecision. Results for failure were classified as very low quality of evidence because of indirectness of the outcome and possible detection bias in non-blinded trials. We detected no differences in the rate of development of resistance. Nephrotoxicity was significantly less frequent with monotherapy (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.39). We found no heterogeneity for all these comparisons. We included a small subset of studies addressing participants with Gram-positive infection, mainly endocarditis. We identified no difference between monotherapy and combination therapy in these studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The addition of an aminoglycoside to beta lactams for sepsis should be discouraged. All-cause mortality rates are unchanged. Combination treatment carries a significant risk of nephrotoxicity.

### Chemically related 4, 5-linked aminoglycoside antibiotics drive subunit rotation in opposite directions [^72f2c195]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Here, we present a detailed examination of structure–function relationships in chemically related 4,5-linked aminoglycosides to reveal that neomycin and paromomycin, which differ by only a single functional group, bind h44 and H69 to drive subunit rotation in opposite directions. These data, which include an analysis of both ribosome- and drug-resistance mutations, indicate that the distinct impacts of aminoglycosides on the collective motions of bridge B2 play a central role in their mechanisms of action. By solving the structure of the paromomycin–ribosome complex to 3.1 Å resolution, we show that such distinctions hinge on interactions of paromomycin with the apical tip of H69 via its 6′-hydroxyl moiety from within its canonical h44-binding site. These findings provide compelling evidence that mechanisms describing the potency and selectivity of this important class of anti-infective agents must include their capacity to alter the dynamic properties of bridge B2 via interactions with H69 of the large subunit.

### Aminoglycoside resistance: updates with a focus on acquired 16S ribosomal RNA methyltransferases [^0322e010]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical usefulness of aminoglycosides has been revisited as an effective choice against β-lactam-resistant and fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections. Plazomicin, a next-generation aminoglycoside, was introduced for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and acute pyelonephritis. In contrast, bacteria have resisted aminoglycosides, including plazomicin, by producing 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methyltransferases (MTases) that confer high-level and broad-range aminoglycoside resistance. Aminoglycoside-resistant 16S rRNA MTase-producing gram-negative pathogens are widespread in various settings and are becoming a grave concern. This article provides up-to-date information with a focus on aminoglycoside-resistant 16S rRNA MTases.

### Tobramycin sulfate (tobramycin) [^45f6f15c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tobramycin injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When tobramycin injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Pregnancy Category D

Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If tobramycin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking tobramycin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.

### 4'-O-substitutions determine selectivity of aminoglycoside antibiotics [^33f169f1]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical use of 2-deoxystreptamine aminoglycoside antibiotics, which target the bacterial ribosome, is compromised by adverse effects related to limited drug selectivity. Here we present a series of 4',6'-O-acetal and 4'-O-ether modifications on glucopyranosyl ring I of aminoglycosides. Chemical modifications were guided by measuring interactions between the compounds synthesized and ribosomes harbouring single point mutations in the drug-binding site, resulting in aminoglycosides that interact poorly with the drug-binding pocket of eukaryotic mitochondrial or cytosolic ribosomes. Yet, these compounds largely retain their inhibitory activity for bacterial ribosomes and show antibacterial activity. Our data indicate that 4'-O-substituted aminoglycosides possess increased selectivity towards bacterial ribosomes and little activity for any of the human drug-binding pockets.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^9e045c82]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Aminoglycosides — research recommendations: No standard method exists for therapeutic drug monitoring with single-daily dosing, and uniform guidance based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies of timing and method would be of greatest assistance. Patients receiving extended-dosing interval aminoglycosides should have even greater dosing intervals if mild or moderate renal impairment exists, and optimal therapeutic monitoring for infrequent dosing in CKD needs to be standardized. The impact of IHD and high-flux CRRT on efficacy and toxicity of extended-duration aminoglycoside dosing needs further study, potentially via RCTs comparing standard versus individualized regimens with frequent drug-level monitoring and kidney injury markers as outcomes. Interactions with nephrotoxic agents such as vancomycin, amphotericin B, cephalosporins, extended-spectrum penicillins, colistin, loop diuretics, clindamycin, cisplatin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents need more careful observational examination.

### 4'-O-substitutions determine selectivity of aminoglycoside antibiotics [^86d3f33c]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical use of 2-deoxystreptamine aminoglycoside antibiotics, which target the bacterial ribosome, is compromised by adverse effects related to limited drug selectivity. Here we present a series of 4′,6′- O -acetal and 4′- O -ether modifications on glucopyranosyl ring I of aminoglycosides. Chemical modifications were guided by measuring interactions between the compounds synthesized and ribosomes harbouring single point mutations in the drug-binding site, resulting in aminoglycosides that interact poorly with the drug-binding pocket of eukaryotic mitochondrial or cytosolic ribosomes. Yet, these compounds largely retain their inhibitory activity for bacterial ribosomes and show antibacterial activity. Our data indicate that 4′- O -substituted aminoglycosides possess increased selectivity towards bacterial ribosomes and little activity for any of the human drug-binding pockets.

### Beta lactam antibiotic monotherapy versus beta lactam-aminoglycoside antibiotic combination therapy for sepsis [^bf585c7b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal antibiotic treatment for sepsis is imperative. Combining a beta-lactam antibiotic with an aminoglycoside antibiotic may have certain advantages over beta-lactam monotherapy.

Objectives

We compared clinical outcomes for beta lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy versus beta lactam monotherapy for sepsis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2004); MEDLINE (1966 to July 2004); EMBASE (1980 to March 2003); LILACS (1982 to July 2004); and conference proceedings of the Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (1995 to 2003). We scanned citations of all identified studies and contacted all corresponding authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing any beta-lactam monotherapy to any combination of one beta-lactam and one aminoglycoside for sepsis.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome was all-cause fatality. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure, superinfections, colonization, and adverse events. Two authors independently collected data. We pooled relative risks (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the fixed effect model. We extracted outcomes by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

We included 64 trials, randomizing 7586 patients. Twenty trials compared the same beta-lactam in both study arms, while the remaining compared different beta-lactams using a broader spectrum beta-lactam in the monotherapy arm. In studies comparing the same beta-lactam, we observed no difference between study groups with regard to all-cause fatality, RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.75–1.35) and clinical failure, RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.95–1.29). In studies comparing different beta-lactams, we observed an advantage to monotherapy: all cause fatality RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.71–1.01), clinical failure RR 0.77 (95% CI 0.69–0.86). No significant disparities emerged from subgroup and sensitivity analyses, including the assessment of patients with Gram-negative and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. We detected no differences in the rate of resistance development. Adverse events rates did not differ significantly between the study groups overall, although nephrotoxicity was significantly more frequent with combination therapy, RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.23–0.39). We found no heterogeneity for all comparisons. We included a small subset of studies addressing patients with Gram-positive infections, mainly endocarditis. We identified no difference between monotherapy and combination therapy in these studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The addition of an aminoglycoside to beta-lactams for sepsis should be discouraged. All-cause fatality rates are unchanged. Combination treatment carries a significant risk of nephrotoxicity.

### Translation error clusters induced by aminoglycoside antibiotics [^049b6a97]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

AGAs are polycationic molecules that bind to the negatively charged outer membrane of bacteria and enter the periplasm via porin channels. Once in the cytosol, AGAs bind to the ribosome and induce misreading by stabilizing an error-prone conformation of the decoding center of the ribosome –. Accumulation of translation errors in membrane proteins leads to the disintegration of membrane structures, renders the membrane permeable for small molecules, and allows for a massive influx of AGAs. However, how sub-lethal intracellular AGA concentrations and the associated mild increase in mistranslation cause damage of membrane proteins is unknown. At bactericidal concentrations, proteotoxic stress induces the heat shock response, aggregation of specific sub-proteomes, including membrane and metabolic proteins, protein oxidation and carbonylation, and inclusion body formation. Further downstream effects of AGA treatment are dramatic changes of the cell metabolism, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and ultimately cell death –. In contrast, sub-lethal AGA concentrations may even be beneficial for bacteria, as they help cells to adapt to stress conditions, change to a more drug-resistant lifestyle (e.g. biofilm formation), or acquire antibiotics resistance –.

The majority of AGAs affect both decoding and translocation steps of translation. The efficacy of AGAs is often attributed to their ability to induce misreading, rather than to their effect on translocation. In fact, Str, which is bactericidal and induces misreading, has no effect on translocation. Vice versa, spectinomycin (Spc), an AGA that causes a translocation defect without inducing misreading, is bacteriostatic. One potential exception is apramycin (Apr) which is bactericidal, although recent studies suggested that it does not induce misreading. This is important, because Apr is less ototoxic than other AGAs in model organisms, presumably because its antibacterial and anti-mitoribosomal activities are uncoupled. Moreover, due to its unique structure, Apr is not susceptible to many prevalent resistance mechanisms and is thus a promising drug for the treatment of multiresistant bacteria –. Somewhat paradoxically, the bactericidal effect of AGAs is lost when a translation is blocked by bacteriostatic antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol.

IDSA 2023 guidance — aminoglycoside breakpoints and cystitis management for difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa notes that as of 2023 there are no longer breakpoints for gentamicin for P. aeruginosa; tobramycin breakpoints are available for P. aeruginosa (susceptible ≤ 1 μg/mL) and amikacin breakpoints are only available for infections originating from urinary sources (susceptible ≤ 16 μg/mL), while plazomicin has neither CLSI nor FDA breakpoints. For DTR P. aeruginosa cystitis, colistin, but not polymyxin B, is an alternate consideration as it converts to its active form in the urinary tract, and clinicians should remain cognizant of the associated risk of nephrotoxicity. The panel does not suggest the use of oral fosfomycin for DTR P. aeruginosa cystitis as it may be associated with a high likelihood of clinical failure, in part due to the presence of the fosA gene, which is found in the genome of almost all P. aeruginosa isolates.

### Can we make human plague history? A call to action [^356e3c3f]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Improvement of case management

Streptomycin is highly effective and has long been considered the first choice for the treatment of most forms of plague. Nevertheless, it has a number of constraints, including adverse effects (deafness and renal toxicity), and must be administered carefully to children and pregnant women. Furthermore, since streptomycin is administered via intramuscular injection, it poses logistical problems in poor-resource settings. Indeed, treating a large number of patients with streptomycin in the context of an outbreak can be a major challenge. Since it is no longer used as a first-line treatment of tuberculosis, streptomycin is not widely available, and its distribution may cease within a few years. In addition, the lack of specific clinical and reliable onsite diagnostics for pneumonic plague could be responsible for an important number of misdiagnoses and, consequently, inadequate treatment of common respiratory infections with streptomycin. Other drugs have been successfully used for the treatment of plague and are recommended in treatment guidelines, including quinolones, gentamicin, doxycycline and chloramphenicol. These recommendations are based on animal studies, case reports, case series and one, small, randomised controlled trial of doxycycline versus gentamicin in 2002. New clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the efficacy of antibiotics with a more attractive safety, cost and availability profile than currently used regimens for both the treatment and prophylaxis of plague. To date, antibiotic resistance in Y. pestis has been described in three unrelated strains isolated from rats, carried by plasmids which included resistances to streptomycin and doxycycline. Therefore, given the ability of the Enterobacteriaceae family members to acquire any sort of antibiotic resistance and the extreme virulence of Y. pestis, it is essential to maintain a reliable antibiotic resistance monitoring system.

### Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^72085fa6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Aminoglycosides and capreomycin — toxicity, monitoring, and dosing in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). All aminoglycosides and capreomycin share important toxicities, especially nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and electrolyte disturbances. For aminoglycosides in general, the estimated frequency of nephrotoxicity is 5% to 15% and of ototoxicity 2% to 14%, including 2% to 10% cochlear and 3% to 14% vestibular; a survey reported amikacin nephrotoxicity 8.7%. Reported series note significant hearing impairment exceeds 50%, renal dysfunction approaches 60%, and vestibular dysfunction as high as 20%, and in children hearing loss has been documented in up to 24% of cases. Ototoxicity may be severe and irreversible, nephrotoxicity is often reversible, and ototoxicity can progress even after the drug is stopped. When injectables are used, serum creatinine, electrolyte measurements, clinical assessment for vertigo and tinnitus, high-quality audiometry (including hearing frequency range of 6,000–8,000 Hz, as high-frequency hearing loss is seen initially), and clinical examinations should be conducted at least monthly, or more frequently if adverse effects occur. Dose range of amikacin should be 15 to 20 mg/kg as single daily dose; because antibacterial activity is concentration dependent, high peak levels and single daily dosing are preferred, and toxicity can be minimized by allowing trough levels between doses to remain below detectable levels for many hours.

### Position statement and practice guidelines on ototoxicity monitoring [^e0338db1]. AAA (2009). Medium credibility.

Patient identification and testing management — ototoxicity monitoring emphasizes proactive baseline and follow-up scheduling for patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy or aminoglycoside antibiotics. It states that it is absolutely critical to obtain a baseline evaluation prior to the patient receiving the monitored drug therapy, and because cisplatin can cause marked hearing loss following a single administration, the importance of pre-drug baseline testing cannot be emphasized enough. For emergent aminoglycoside use, kanamycin, one of the most notorious aminoglycosides, generally does not cause demonstrable cochleotoxicity for at least 72 hours after administration; consequently, baseline testing may be effectively administered within this 2-day grace period, supported by efficient identification/referral, and when a baseline is missed it could prove beneficial to ask the patient or a family member about the availability of audiometric records. For platinum-based chemotherapy, follow-up evaluations then should occur just prior to each course and a follow-up test should also occur a few months after chemotherapy treatment is completed; if the patient also received head and neck radiation, monitoring for the next year or two is advisable. For aminoglycoside antibiotics, weekly or biweekly monitoring is recommended, ideally, and follow-up testing should also be scheduled a few months after drug discontinuation. Programmatically, regularly scheduled clinical ototoxicity monitoring is usually limited to those two drug classes; although automated referral generation seems practical in principle, at this writing, no such system has been described in the literature, so the audiologist needs to develop excellent working relationships with oncologists and infectious-disease specialists for referrals.

### Prevalence of contact allergy to neomycin in dermatitis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^eaedd202]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Neomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic frequently employed in topical formulations, is a recognised allergen that is part of many baseline series and can cause contact allergy (CA) in both adults and children. It is an allergen of interest as it has a widespread use in over‐the‐counter and prescription products globally, but geographical variations may exist. This study aimed to establish prevalence estimates of CA to neomycin in dermatitis patients and to investigate potential geographical variations. Three databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) were screened, revealing 70 included studies comprising 456 372 adults and 17 720 children who underwent patch testing. The pooled prevalence of CA to neomycin was found to be 3.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6%–3.8%) in adults and 4.3% (95% CI: 2.65%–6.3%) in children. The highest prevalences were observed in North America (adults: 6.4%; children: 8.1%) and South Asia (adults: 4.9%), while Europe showed lower rates (adults: 2.5%; children: 0.8%). Studies after the year 2000 indicated a prevalence of 2.1% in adults and 5.1% in children across geographical regions. These findings highlight a public health concern, particularly in regions with high prevalence rates. The study underscores the need for more restrictive use of neomycin to reduce the incidence of neomycin‐induced CA.

### Translation error clusters induced by aminoglycoside antibiotics [^986fb6a5]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Here we used quantitative mass spectrometry to correlate the AGA-dependent cell growth inhibition, miscoding burden, and stress responses, and to obtain insights into the bactericidal effects of AGAs. We found that AGA binding induces not only single errors, but clusters of errors with two, three or four amino acid substitutions located close to each other in the protein sequence. We characterize this type of misreading events for a variety of AGAs and show that their prevalence depends not only on the misreading propensity of a given AGA but also on its ability to inhibit translocation. We also show that Apr, an AGA which is thought not to cause misreading, induces frequent translation errors. These results reveal an additional, unexpected aspect of AGA action in bacteria, suggest how antibiotics cause proteotoxic stress, and provide a simple explanation as to why some misreading-inducing antibiotics are bactericidal.

### Streptomycin [^af391961]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including streptomycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When streptomycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by streptomycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Drug Interactions

The ototoxic effects of the aminoglycosides, including streptomycin, are potentiated by the coadministration of ethacrynic acid, furosemide, mannitol and possibly other diuretics.

Nursing Mothers

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from streptomycin, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

### Tobramycin (Bethkis) [^bbe9f2c3]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibacterial, acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis in the bacterial cell which eventually leads to death of the cell. Tobramycin has activity against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa. It is bactericidal at or above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed to inhibit growth of bacteria.

Mechanism of Resistance

The predominant mechanism of resistance to tobramycin in P. aeruginosa isolated from CF patients is impermeability and to a lesser extent enzymatic modification and other mechanisms which cumulatively lead to decreased susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to tobramycin.

Cross Resistance

Cross resistance between aminoglycosides exists but the cross resistance is variable.

Development of Resistance

Treatment for six months with BETHKIS in one clinical trial did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients.

Susceptibility Testing

The clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative results of the in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physicians as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial.

### Molecular basis of the pleiotropic effects by the antibiotic amikacin on the ribosome [^5d7d4d84]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Aminoglycosides are a class of antibiotics that bind to ribosomal RNA and exert pleiotropic effects on ribosome function. Amikacin, the semisynthetic derivative of kanamycin, is commonly used for treating severe infections with multidrug-resistant, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Amikacin carries the 4-amino-2-hydroxy butyrate (AHB) moiety at the N 1 amino group of the central 2-deoxystreptamine (2-DOS) ring, which may confer amikacin a unique ribosome inhibition profile. Here we use in vitro fast kinetics combined with X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM to dissect the mechanisms of ribosome inhibition by amikacin and the parent compound, kanamycin. Amikacin interferes with tRNA translocation, release factor-mediated peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, and ribosome recycling, traits attributed to the additional interactions amikacin makes with the decoding center. The binding site in the large ribosomal subunit proximal to the 3'-end of tRNA in the peptidyl (P) site lays the groundwork for rational design of amikacin derivatives with improved antibacterial properties.

### Chemically related 4, 5-linked aminoglycoside antibiotics drive subunit rotation in opposite directions [^127025e1]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Functional investigations aimed at quantifying the impact of small-molecule inhibitors on the mechanism of protein synthesis face significant challenges when examined in the context of full-length protein production. This is due to the fact that mechanisms of action may be masked by additive or synergistic effects on multiple steps of protein synthesis. Inhibition of functional protein production may arise through impacts on any aspect of the system including translation, transcription, protein folding or by promoting protein inactivation or non-specific aggregation. Our examination of the 4,5-linked aminoglycosides in reconstituted protein translation reactions using purified components revealed direct evidence of hidden and complex modes of inhibition, as each of the 4,5-linked aminoglycosides examined, with the exception of neamine, exhibited IC 50 values (14–130 nM) that were lower (2–18-fold) than the ribosome concentration in the reaction (250 nM). Moreover, both neomycin and paromomycin were observed to exhibit nearly indistinguishable IC 50 values (Fig. 1d; Supplementary Table 1) despite their apparently distinct impacts on the dynamics of subunit rotation (Figs 2 and 3). By contrast, isolated structural investigations provide only snapshots of a drug's impact on its target. Indeed, our comparison of neomycin- and paromomycin-bound ribosome structures revealed just a single obvious distinction: the position and dynamics of residue A1913 (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. 12). These findings provide a compelling argument that single-molecule imaging methods offer a means to bridge these distinct approaches to generate insights into dynamic structural processes directly related to function.

### Inhaled antibiotic therapy: what drug? What dose? What regimen? What formulation? [^78ce198b]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2002). Low credibility.

Early studies of the use of antibiotics in patients with cystic fibrosis suggested that they would be of benefit in preventing or reducing infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In seeking to optimize treatment, factors such as the drug used, the dose, the regimen and the formulation must be considered. Aminoglycosides are ideal for aerosolization because they have a long post-antibiotic effect and have an acceptable taste. Tobramycin is one of the aminoglycosides with the lowest systemic toxicity, which enables the aerosol delivery of doses high enough to overcome the antagonistic effects of the sputum. The most dramatic benefits from inhaled tobramycin have been shown to occur in the first 2–4 weeks of administration. Continual administration for longer periods can result in the development of resistance and loss of the improvement in lung function. However, this resistance is transient, and susceptibility to tobramycin returns after a short drug holiday. Optimal drug administration therefore consists of a 4-week on, 4-week off cycle. Such a cycle also helps to maintain patient compliance. Successful drug delivery also depends upon a formulation that does not provoke bronchoconstriction, which demands a formulation that is both preservative free, and osmotically and pH balanced. This research has enabled the development of a novel formulation of tobramycin optimized for use as an inhalation therapy in cystic fibrosis.

Aminoglycosides

streptomycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, neomycin, amikacin, kanamycin, plazomicin, paromomycin

Overview

Structure:

Aminoglycosides have a hexose ring with amino group substituents to which various amino sugars are attached via glycosidic linkages. Aminoglycosides are classified into two main structural groups including the streptidine group consisting of streptomycin and the deoxystreptamine group consisting of gentamicin, tobramycin, neomycin, amikacin, kanamycin, plazomicin, and paromomycin (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Chemical structure of aminoglycosides. Structural groups: a streptidine; b, c, and d deoxystreptamines

Mechanism:

Aminoglycosides are bactericidal and inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.

Indications:

Aminoglycosides are particularly useful for infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli including Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, and Haemophilus influenzae. When combined with other agents, aminoglycosides can have effects against gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci, and Enterococci. Some aminoglycosides, particularly streptomycin and amikacin, are also active against mycobacteria. In addition to oral and intravenous (IV) administration for systemic infections, many aminoglycosides come in other forms. For example, gentamicin and tobramycin are available in topical forms to treat ophthalmic, otic, and skin infections. Tobramycin and amikacin are available in inhaled forms, such as nebulized solutions and inhalation powders or suspensions to treat pulmonary infections.

Known Pharmacologic Adverse Reactions:

The primary toxicities of aminoglycosides are nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Given the need for serum drug concentration monitoring and the availability of alternative and less toxic agents, the widespread use of aminoglycosides is limited.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Allergic reactions to aminoglycosides occur infrequently but are most commonly found to cause allergic contact dermatitis. Other cutaneous reactions as well as systemic reactions including anaphylaxis have been published in case reports.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary exacerbations — aminoglycoside dosing and monitoring: Once-daily aminoglycoside dosing achieves higher peaks and longer drug-free intervals than divided dosing (for tobramycin, "a dose of 10 mg/kg/d tobramycin given every 24 hours is effective… to produce a peak blood level of 25–35 μg/ml and a 9- to 10-hour period with the drug concentration below detectable levels", whereas the same "10 mg/kg/d tobramycin given every 8-hour intervals will yield only a 1- to 2-hour period" below detection), and a meta-analysis "found that once daily administration of aminoglycosides was as effective as multiple daily dosing, with a lower risk of nephrotoxicity". The committee "identified five trials" in CF and advises monitoring: "patients treated with frequent courses of aminoglycosides should receive periodic monitoring of drug concentration… [and] periodic assessment of toxicity such as audiograms and measurement of serum creatinine are also recommended". Formal recommendation: "The CF Foundation recommends that once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides is preferable to 3-times daily dosing for treatment of an acute exacerbation of pulmonary disease. (Grade C recommendation.)".

### Molecular basis of the pleiotropic effects by the antibiotic amikacin on the ribosome [^41caa9de]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The nature of the 2-DOS core ring structure and types of chemical substitutions allow to broadly classify aminoglycosides into four subclasses: (i) no 2-DOS (e.g. streptomycin), (ii) mono-substituted 2-DOS (e.g. apramycin), (iii) 4,5-di-substituted 2-DOS (e.g. neomycin, paromomycin), and (iv) 4,6-di-substituted 2-DOS (e.g. gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin). Despite their similar chemical structures, aminoglycoside antibiotics exert pleiotropic effects on ribosome function. For instance, neomycin and paromomycin, both belonging to the 4,5-di-substituted subclass, promote 30S subunit rotation in the opposite direction relative to the usual ratcheting motion observed during translation. The unique inhibition profile of aminoglycosides may be due to additional binding sites in the ribosome other than the primary site in h44 of the 30S subunit. To this effect, neomycin interferes with ribosome recycling through its association with 23S rRNA helix H69, helping to maintain the inter-subunit bridge between H69 and h44. Aminoglycosides also stabilize the classic state of tRNA binding, providing a basis by which they inhibit tRNA translocation.

### 4'-O-substitutions determine selectivity of aminoglycoside antibiotics [^ef58e3bd]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The use of 2-deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides as antimicrobial agents builds upon the compounds' preferential activity for the prokaryotic versus the eukaryotic ribosome. At the structural level, the selectivity of these compounds rests upon two residues in the drug-binding pocket — residues 1408 and 1491 (refs). Residue 1408 is an adenine in bacterial and mitochondrial ribosomes as compared with a guanine in cytosolic ribosomes. Residue 1491 is a guanine in bacterial ribosomes, but a cytosine in mitochondrial and an adenine in cytosolic ribosomes. Both these changes disrupt the bacterial C1409–G1491 base-pair interaction (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for a comparison of bacterial and eukaryotic drug-binding pockets). A guanine at residue 1408 mainly affects 2-deoxystreptamines with a 6′NH 2 as it would preclude the proper insertion of a corresponding ring I into the binding pocket, that is, the 6′ ammonium group cannot accept hydrogen bonds from the Watson–Crick sites of the guanine residue, and additionally its positive charge would create repulsion against the N1 and N2 amino groups. In contrast, 2-deoxystreptamines with a 6′OH group are less affected by a 1408G as the 6′ hydroxyl group could still become an acceptor of a hydrogen bond from N1 or N2 (ref.; Fig. 1). A C1409–C1491 opposition mainly affects 2-deoxystreptamines with a 6′OH but much less so compounds with a 6′NH 2. Possibly, the 6′OH–N1 A1408 interaction is less stable as compared with the 6′NH 2 –N1 A1408 interaction, making 6′OH 2-deoxystreptamines highly dependent on proper stacking interaction with residue 1491 (refs).

Here we address the question of whether the specificity of the 2-deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides can be modified to increase selectivity at the drug-target level in spite of the constraints imposed by the high conservation of the drug-binding pocket. We focus on ring I, as it interacts with phylogenetically variable 16S rRNA residues 1408 and 1491. As we expected, structural modifications on ring I affect drug selectivity. In addition, our results reveal the unanticipated finding that well-known synthetic intermediates can show promising biological properties.

### Aminoglycoside resistance: the emergence of acquired 16S ribosomal RNA methyltransferases [^b90673bb]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Aminoglycoside-producing Actinobacteria are known to protect themselves from their own aminoglycoside metabolites by producing 16S ribosomal RNA methyltransferase (16S-RMTase), which prevents them from binding to the 16S rRNA targets. Ten acquired 16S-RMTases have been reported from gram-negative pathogens. Most of them posttranscriptionally methylate residue G1405 of 16S rRNA resulting in high-level resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and plazomicin. Strains that produce 16S-RMTase are frequently multidrug-resistant or even extensively drug-resistant. Although the direct clinical impact of high-level aminoglycoside resistance resulting from production of 16S-RMTase is yet to be determined, ongoing spread of this mechanism will further limit treatment options for multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant gram-negative infections.

BREAKPOINTS

Breakpoints discussed below are revisions of prior breakpoints, with the exception of plazomicin, for which new breakpoints have been set. New and revised breakpoints are presented in Table 1.

Aminoglycosides, including plazomicin, for Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa

In 2022, CLSI underwent a major review of the aminoglycoside breakpoints for Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa to update gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints and publish new breakpoints for plazomicin for Enterobacterales. The aminoglycoside class binds the 30S ribosome of many bacteria, inhibiting protein synthesis. Activity is oxygen dependent, resulting in no activity against anaerobic bacteria. Other notable organisms for which aminoglycosides show gaps in activity include Salmonella, Shigella, Stenotrophomonas, Burkholderia, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus. Resistance to the aminoglycosides in gram-negative bacteria occurs by three primary pathways: enzymatic inactivation of the aminoglycoside by the bacterium through acetylation, phosphorylation, or adenylation; alteration of the bacterial ribosomal target site through methylation; and decrease in cell wall permeability to the aminoglycosides, particularly for P. aeruginosa.

Breakpoints for the aminoglycosides were first published by CLSI (then called the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) in 1979. At the time, very little data were available on the pharmacodynamics (PD) of the aminoglycosides, and the breakpoints were based on wild-type minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions and minimal pharmacokinetic (PK) information. Concerns were noted about the breakpoints as early as the 1980s, as achievable serum levels of aminoglycosides, when administered using package insert dosing regimens, were viewed as too low to cover all susceptible isolates. However, no changes to the breakpoints were made. In 2018, CLSI evaluated plazomicin, a novel aminoglycoside, which led to the recognition that breakpoints for the other aminoglycosides likely required revision. Specifically, contemporary aminoglycoside dosing, using high-dose, once-daily extended-interval regimens as opposed to multiple daily dosing as listed in the prescribing information, has been shown to mitigate adverse events associated with aminoglycoside use. It also results in a different exposure of aminoglycoside, implying that a breakpoint evaluation was needed, per CLSI M23 criteria.

### Aminoglycosides and capreomycin in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: individual patient data meta-analysis of 12 030 patients from 25 countries, 2009–2016 [^bbc227b9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

As new drugs are developed for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), the role of currently used drugs must be reevaluated.

Methods

We combined individual-level data on patients with pulmonary MDR-TB published during 2009–2016 from 25 countries. We compared patients receiving each of the injectable drugs and those receiving no injectable drugs. Analyses were based on patients whose isolates were susceptible to the drug they received. Using random-effects logistic regression with propensity score matching, we estimated the effect of each agent in terms of standardized treatment outcomes.

Results

More patients received kanamycin (n = 4330) and capreomycin (n = 2401) than amikacin (n = 2275) or streptomycin (n = 1554), opposite to their apparent effectiveness. Compared with kanamycin, amikacin was associated with 6 more cures per 100 patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 4–8), while streptomycin was associated with 7 (95% CI, 5–8) more cures and 5 (95% CI, 4–7) fewer deaths per 100 patients. Compared with capreomycin, amikacin was associated with 9 (95% CI, 6–11) more cures and 5 (95% CI, 2–8) fewer deaths per 100 patients, while streptomycin was associated with 10 (95% CI, 8–13) more cures and 10 (95% CI, 7–12) fewer deaths per 100 patients treated. In contrast to amikacin and streptomycin, patients treated with kanamycin or capreomycin did not fare better than patients treated with no injectable drugs.

Conclusions

When aminoglycosides are used to treat MDR-TB and drug susceptibility test results support their use, streptomycin and amikacin, not kanamycin or capreomycin, are the drugs of choice.

### Innovative perspectives on the discovery of small molecule antibiotics [^8a77a9e5]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Innovation 4: absence of cross-resistance

New antibiotics can be rationally re-designed for modifications that avoid emerging resistance to the previous drug. These new generations of existing classes of antibiotics address the immediate and crucial need to overcome clinical resistance. A remarkable example is cefiderocol, a siderophore of cephalosporin that uses the bacterial iron uptake system to enter cells, bypassing common resistance mechanisms and demonstrating low cross-resistance with other β-lactams –. Also, plazomicin, a next-generation aminoglycoside derived from sisomicin, incorporates synthetic modifications that allow it to bind a different site of the bacterial ribosome compared to older aminoglycosides. These chemical alterations enable plazomicin to bypass nearly all clinically relevant resistance mechanisms, primarily those mediated by aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. Plazomicin is effective against clinically relevant drug-resistant bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. While cefiderocol and plazomicin received approval from the US agency Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, Achaeogen, the drug development company behind plazomicin, went bankrupt, highlighting the current paradox in antibacterial drug development, when antibiotics are reserved for the most severe cases to prevent the rise of new antibiotic resistance. We conclude that decreasing the chance of rapid selection of new resistance mechanisms seems as important as avoiding cross-resistance with current antibiotics. The development of such resistance mechanisms can be minimized by seeking compounds that have multiple effects, targeting more than one molecular element or combining single-target antibiotics that have additive or synergistic mechanisms. While beyond the scope of this review, the polypharmacology approach to antibiotic discovery is promising and has been described extensively elsewhere.

### Aminoglycosides… [^dd1f1ff5]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Aminoglycosides were first introduced in the 1940s and are used widely for specific and empiric treatment of infections caused by aerobic gram-negative organisms. The suffix of each agent in the class denotes its origin: – mycin indicates aminoglycosides derived from Streptomyces species, whereas
- micin identifies derivation from Microsporum species. Aminoglycosides currently approved for use in the United States are gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, and paromomycin. Aminoglycosides inhibit protein synthesis by binding irreversibly to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. Their passage through the cell wall is facilitated by concomitant therapy with β-lactam antibiotics or vancomycin. The attachment to the ribosomal subunit requires energy and oxygen and is inhibited by hyperosmolarity, low pH, and anaerobic conditions.

Aminoglycosides are administered intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes for traditional three times a day dosing, and, to minimize their toxicity, over 30 to 60 minutes for higher-volume once-daily dosing. After. Comments.

### Current use for old antibacterial agents: polymyxins, rifamycins, and aminoglycosides [^b3122e9d]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

This article reviews three classes of antibacterial agents that are uncommonly used in bacterial infections and therefore can be thought of as special-use agents. The polymyxins are reserved for gram-negative bacilli that are resistant to virtually all other classes of drugs. Rifampin is used therapeutically, occasionally as a companion drug in treatment of refractory gram-positive coccal infections, especially those involving foreign bodies. Rifaximin is a new rifamycin that is a strict enteric antibiotic approved for treatment of traveler's diarrhea and is showing promise as a possible agent for refractory Clostridium difficile infections. The aminoglycosides are used mainly as companion drugs for the treatment of resistant gram-negative bacillary infections and for gram-positive coccal endocarditis.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa HAP/VAP — aminoglycosides and polymyxins rationale: The aminoglycosides are the only exceptions with regard to the panel not making a recommendation for or against a specific antibiotic class in HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa, and the panel chose to recommend against aminoglycoside monotherapy for 2 reasons; first, aminoglycosides penetrate the lung poorly, requiring high peak serum concentrations to achieve alveolar activity, which increases the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, and studies have found no detectable antipseudomonal activity within bronchial secretions despite therapeutic serum levels; second, there is a lack of studies evaluating aminoglycoside monotherapy in HAP/VAP. Occasionally, routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing identifies no antibiotics to which P. aeruginosa is susceptible, intravenous polymyxins (colistin or polymyxin B) may be an option, and the panel agreed that polymyxin susceptibility should be routinely assessed for Pseudomonas isolates in settings with a high prevalence of extensively resistant organisms; the panel also recognized that as many as two-thirds of patients with HAP/VAP caused by P. aeruginosa have antibiotic resistance.
