## Question

Can a diabetic go by net carbs?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a person with diabetes can use "net carbs" for meal planning and insulin dosing, and how to do that safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "net carbs" actually means and how it differs from total carbohydrates. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about carbohydrate monitoring and whether they endorse net carbs. Next, I will examine the evidence base for carbohydrate counting in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, including any data that specifically address net versus total carbs. After that, I need to consider practical implications, including insulin dosing, glycemic variability, and the role of fiber and sugar alcohols. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, individualized recommendation with monitoring advice and caveats about when net carbs might be reasonable and when they should be avoided.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't mislead us. Net carbs are typically calculated as total carbohydrates minus fiber and sometimes minus all or a portion of sugar alcohols, on the premise that fiber and some sugar alcohols have minimal impact on blood glucose. However, this is a labeling convention rather than a universally accepted clinical standard, and the physiologic effect of fiber and sugar alcohols varies by type and amount, which is why some guidelines prefer total carbohydrates for dosing decisions [^fbdf425b].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. The ADA Standards of Care emphasize monitoring carbohydrate intake — by counting grams or experience-based estimation — as a key strategy for glycemic control in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but they do not endorse "net carbs" as the standard for insulin dosing. Instead, they anchor dosing to total carbohydrates, with individualized adjustments for fat and protein as needed, and they note that newer technologies may reduce the need for precise carb counting without replacing the principle of carb-aware meal planning [^27b4d8c5] [^30be19ec] [^7b5f44e3]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric guidance too; the 2025 Standards for youth likewise recommend monitoring carbohydrate intake by counting or estimation, again referencing total carbohydrates rather than net carbs, and they stress structured education to build accurate estimation skills [^cdf07d10].

> I will now examine the evidence base for carbohydrate counting itself, because if counting total carbs improves outcomes, that informs whether substituting net carbs is safe. In type 1 diabetes, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that carbohydrate counting in adults can improve A1C by about 0.64% versus control, though results are heterogeneous and not all studies show benefit, underscoring the importance of education and adherence [^74707ec4]. Wait, let me verify type 2 data; randomized trials in type 2 diabetes show that structured basic carbohydrate counting improves carb estimation accuracy but does not consistently improve A1C versus standard care, likely because medication, weight loss, and other factors dominate glycemic outcomes in T2D, so carb counting remains a tool rather than a standalone solution [^d07e0b3d] [^e6ca1540].

> Now, I need to check whether any high-quality studies directly compare net carbs versus total carbs for dosing or outcomes. I should double-check, but I do not find randomized trials or meta-analyses that test net-carb–based insulin dosing against total-carb–based dosing; the literature consistently operationalizes carbohydrate counting using total grams, and when fiber or sugar alcohols are discussed, it is typically in the context of food composition rather than a dosing algorithm, which means the net-carb approach lacks direct evidence for insulin dosing efficacy in diabetes care [^notfound].

> Let me consider the physiologic rationale and potential pitfalls. Fiber can blunt glycemic excursions, and some sugar alcohols are incompletely absorbed, so in theory subtracting them could align dosing with glycemic effect. But wait, soluble fiber can still be fermented and contribute calories and variable glucose effects, and sugar alcohols differ in glycemic impact, with erythritol having minimal effect but maltitol raising glucose meaningfully, so a blanket subtraction risks underdosing insulin and causing hyperglycemia. Moreover, food labels are not always accurate, and real-world meals are mixed, so relying on net carbs may amplify dosing errors that already occur frequently in practice [^aebb4db0] [^326a01dd].

> I should confirm how error-prone carb counting is in real life, because if total-carb counting is already hard, net-carb math may worsen things. Observational and simulation studies show that typical carb-counting errors average around 7–20% in both directions, and these errors directly translate into more time above or below range in open-loop therapy, with underestimation increasing hyperglycemia and overestimation increasing hypoglycemia. This is why guidelines and educators emphasize simplifying tools, repeated training, and, when appropriate, technology to reduce error rather than introducing additional arithmetic steps like net-carb subtraction [^bf4ae3d5] [^7bc75d26] [^30be19ec].

> But wait, what if someone is on a low-carb or ketogenic pattern where fiber is a large fraction of total carbs; could net carbs make sense there? Even in low-carb diets, expert reviews note that definitions vary and that many studies and guidelines still anchor carbohydrate targets to total grams, not net grams, and they caution that net-carb logic can obscure true intake and complicate cross-trial comparisons. So even in lower-carb eating, I should be cautious about substituting net carbs for dosing unless there is a structured, monitored rationale and consistent food choices [^fbdf425b].

> Next, I should review practical implications for insulin dosing. For fixed-ratio basal-bolus regimens or pump bolus wizards, the safest, evidence-aligned approach is to use total carbohydrates and then individualize for fat and protein using split boluses or extended delivery when needed. This is especially important for high-fat, high-protein meals, where delayed hyperglycemia can occur despite accurate carb counts, and where structured monitoring 2–3 hours after eating guides adjustments. Net-carb subtraction could easily underdose in these scenarios, so I need to ensure we don't inadvertently worsen postprandial excursions [^7b5f44e3] [^c8b5fb6d].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any subgroup or technology changes this calculus. Closed-loop and hybrid systems can mitigate some dosing errors, and some users experiment with less precise meal announcements or even unannounced meals, but even these systems generally still require basic carb-awareness and often perform best with reasonable meal estimates. Importantly, manufacturers and clinicians still frame meal inputs in total carbohydrates, not net carbs, so adopting net carbs could disrupt algorithm performance and safety guardrails unless explicitly designed for that input [^ec946a32] [^a31db73b].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, individualized answer. Yes, a person with diabetes can consider using net carbs in very specific contexts, but it is not the standard of care and carries risk of underdosing insulin if fiber or sugar alcohols are over-subtracted. If someone strongly prefers net carbs, it should be done with dietitian oversight, consistent food choices, careful glucose monitoring, and a plan to revert to total carbs if A1C rises or glucose variability worsens. For most patients, especially those on insulin, total carbohydrate counting remains the evidence-based, guideline-supported approach, with adjustments for fat and protein as indicated [^27b4d8c5] [^30be19ec] [^7b5f44e3].

> Finally, I should confirm a practical, safety-first implementation if someone insists on trying net carbs. I would set a trial period with pre- and post-meal glucose checks, keep fiber and sugar alcohol sources consistent, avoid large bolus decisions based on unfamiliar foods, and compare time-in-range and A1C to the prior total-carb approach. If time-in-range drops or postprandial spikes increase, we should return to total carbohydrates and reassess the meal pattern and insulin strategy rather than persisting with an unproven net-carb method [^30be19ec] [^7b5f44e3].

In select cases, people with diabetes may use **net carbs** for meal planning, but this approach is **not universally recommended**. Net carbs (total carbs minus fiber and some sugar alcohols) can be useful for those on low-carb or ketogenic diets, but **total carbs remain the standard** for insulin dosing and glycemic management because fiber and sugar alcohols can still affect glucose in varying ways [^fbdf425b]. Using net carbs risks **underdosing insulin** and hyperglycemia, especially in type 1 diabetes or insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. If net carbs are used, it should be with caution, consistent monitoring, and individualized guidance from a dietitian or diabetes educator [^b4a6f137].

---

## Definition and calculation of net carbs

Net carbs are calculated as **total carbohydrates minus fiber and some sugar alcohols**, based on the premise that fiber and certain sugar alcohols have minimal impact on blood glucose. However, this is a **simplification**, as some fiber and sugar alcohols can be partially digested and affect glucose, albeit less than starches and sugars.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **total carbohydrate intake** for diabetes management, particularly for insulin dosing. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and other authorities recommend monitoring total carbohydrates rather than net carbs for glycemic control [^27b4d8c5] [^b4a6f137]. The rationale is that total carbohydrates directly influence blood glucose, whereas fiber and sugar alcohols have variable effects.

---

## Risks and benefits of using net carbs

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits include **flexibility**, as net carbs may offer a more flexible approach for individuals following low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diets, allowing for greater dietary variety. Some people also find that focusing on net carbs helps them include more fiber-rich foods, which can improve satiety and digestive health.

---

### Potential risks

- **Underdosing insulin**: Using net carbs may lead to underestimating carbohydrate intake, resulting in insufficient insulin dosing and hyperglycemia [^bf4ae3d5].
- **Individual variability**: The impact of fiber and sugar alcohols on blood glucose varies among individuals, making net carb calculations unreliable for insulin dosing [^4f7004c5].
- **Lack of standardization**: There is no standardized definition of net carbs, leading to inconsistencies in food labeling and dietary planning [^fbdf425b].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Limited clinical studies specifically address the use of net carbs in diabetes management. However, studies emphasize the importance of **accurate carbohydrate counting** for optimal glycemic control, particularly in type 1 diabetes [^74707ec4]. Inaccurate carbohydrate counting, whether using total or net carbs, can lead to significant glycemic variability and poor outcomes [^bf4ae3d5].

---

## Practical considerations and recommendations

- **Individualized approach**: If considering net carbs, it should be done under the guidance of a registered dietitian or diabetes educator, with careful monitoring of blood glucose levels [^b4a6f137].
- **Consistent monitoring**: Regular blood glucose monitoring is essential to assess the impact of net carb counting on glycemic control and adjust insulin dosing accordingly [^7b5f44e3].
- **Education and support**: Patients should receive comprehensive education on carbohydrate counting, insulin dosing, and the potential risks and benefits of using net carbs [^cdf07d10].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

While some individuals with diabetes may find net carb counting useful, particularly those following low-carbohydrate diets, it is **not universally recommended** for diabetes management. Total carbohydrate intake remains the standard for insulin dosing and glycemic control. If net carbs are used, it should be with caution, consistent monitoring, and professional guidance.

1 INTRODUCTION

Achieving glycaemic control in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is vital in order to reduce diabetes‐related complications. Treatment recommendations include multiple daily injections of prandial and basal insulin, or continuous insulin infusion (CSII). As carbohydrates are the major nutrient affecting the post‐prandial response, it is important to educate individuals on matching prandial insulin doses to carbohydrate intake by means of carbohydrate counting (CC). The checking of pre‐meal blood glucose levels and co‐ordination of anticipated physical activityare also recommended for optimizing glucose control.

CC takes into account the carbohydrate intake per meal, and enables adjustment of the prandial insulin dosage necessary to achieve individual post‐prandial glucose targets. To manage CC, the patient has many variables to consider: (i) the personal insulin/carb ratio (I:C) – the amount of insulin the patient needs to overcome a 15‐gram portion of carbohydrates; (ii) the accurate assessment of the amount of carbohydrates consumed; (iii) the insulin sensitivity response (IS), that is, the decrease in blood glucose after injecting one unit of insulin to counter an elevated glucose level; (iv) the individual target glucose level pre‐ and post‐meal; and (v) the level of glucose prior to the meal. This means that in order to normalize post‐prandial glucose levels, individuals need to be highly motivated to maintain wellbeing through on‐going compliant conduct, and to be possessed of high mathematical and literacy skills. Studieshave shown the difficulties of successfully carrying out CC, especially concerning the over‐ and underestimation of carbohydrate content in various foods that can lead to post prandial hypo or hyperglycaemia respectively. In a systematic reviewof CC efficacy in managing T1DM, Bell et alfound only partial benefit in achieving glycaemic control through CC, notwithstanding the difficulty of complying with CC instructions. These difficulties are added to other barriers patients with T1DM cope with following dietary recommendations such as, frequent glucose measurements and importantly their feelings about having diabetes.

5 CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

In large measure, the research into T1DM treatment is focused on advanced technologies including insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring, the artificial pancreas and various applications to support CC and diabetes management. Studies have shownthat although advanced applications are accessible and improve glycaemic control, only a small percentage of the population with T1DM chooses to use them. This may be explained by the human factor, that is, personal expectations, perceptions of the burden of new technologies, user‐friendliness and long‐term cost. The SCC tool tested in this study has the potential to apply to all diabetes patients, and in particular to those who are uncomfortable with the use of advanced technology, or who do not have access to such technology.

In conclusion this study presents a simple, feasible, low‐tech tool that simplifies carbohydrate counting and which promotes and enables accurate insulin dosing in people with T1DM. Additional studies are needed to corroborate these findings.

4.1 Limitations

The intervention tool was introduced at a single diabetes clinic in a tertiary teaching hospital with one registered dietitian/diabetes care and education specialist. The method was not tested on paediatric patients, a population that has more difficulties with glycaemic control than others. A larger population of people from the lower socio‐economic and more culturally diverse backgrounds should be studied in order to corroborate the results and establish generalizability across populations.

### It is time to stop counting calories, and time instead to promote dietary changes that substantially and rapidly reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [^a045a781]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

An exaggerated belief in the (modest) benefits of pharmacotherapy, aggressively reinforced by commercial vested interests, can often mislead patients and doctors, and promotes overtreatment in chronic disease management, and may even distract from and undermine the benefits of simple lifestyle interventions.

Focusing on total energy consumed, as opposed to nutritional value, has been exploited by the food industry, which has added sugar to over 80% of all processed foods. One can of cola contains nine teaspoons of sugar. The EPIC study revealed that one can a day (approximately 150 calories) was associated with substantially increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Conversely, PREDIMED revealed that consumption of a handful of nuts, (30 g of walnuts, 15 g of almonds and 15 g of hazelnuts) or four tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil per day (approximately 500 calories) significantly reduced the risk of heart attack and stroke. A recent randomised pilot study of a calorie unrestricted very low carbohydrate/high fat diet in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes resulted in a significant improvement in glycaemic control and even discontinuation of diabetes medications within 3 months in comparison to a moderate carbohydrate, low-fat calorie-restricted diet (consistent with guidelines from the American Diabetes Association), with no adverse effect on blood lipids. A critical review in Nutrition also concluded that dietary carbohydrate restriction is the "single most effective intervention for reducing all of the features of the metabolic syndrome" and should be the first approach in diabetes management with the very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (< 10% carbs) revealing the greatest falls in glycated hemoglobin and reduction in the use of medications with benefits occurring even without weight loss.

### Choosing healthy carbs | Diabetes… [^d41bde9c]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know In recent years, carbohydrates have gotten a bad reputation. But carbs can be part of a healthy diet for people with diabetes. The key is to know how to portion and choose carbs so you get the most nutrition from your food with the least impact on your blood sugar. Types of carbs Simple carbs These increase your blood sugar quickly and can make it harder to manage your diabetes. Common sources of simple carbs include table sugar, honey, fruit juice, and syrup. These are often major ingredients of highly processed and packaged foods like soda, cookies, cakes, candies, and other foods with added sugars. Some types of simple carbs are found in healthy foods like whole fruit and dairy foods. These foods have beneficial vitamins and minerals, which are key to a balanced diet. Complex carbs These increase your blood sugar more slowly because they contain fiber and other complex starches that take longer for your body to digest.

Examples of complex carbs include starchy vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. Choose these carbs to get the most nutrition with the least impact on blood sugar. All in moderation Carbs are an important part of a healthy diet. In fact, your body and brain need carbs to function properly. The key is to choose carbs with fiber and nutrients and to portion your serving sizes. One serving of carbs is smaller than you might think — it's about ¼ cup of granola or 6 saltines. Carb counting can help make managing blood sugar easier and ensure you're eating a healthy balance of carbs, protein, and vegetables. When you eat a meal or snack with carbs, add a protein source like meat, a small handful of nuts, or low-fat dairy. This will help you stay fuller for longer and avoid blood sugar spikes.

Rethink your drink Sugar-sweetened beverages like soda, sweetened coffee, and sweetened tea can add a lot of simple carbs to your diet. To reduce added sugars, try mixing half unsweetened tea with half sweet tea, drinking sparkling water with a splash of juice, or ordering coffee with less sweetener. When in doubt, don't forget to hydrate with water.

### The importance of carbohydrate counting in the treatment of children with diabetes [^c0f3cfa2]. Pediatric Diabetes (2007). Low credibility.

Carbohydrate (Carb) counting is a meal planning approach for patients with diabetes mellitus that focuses on carbohydrate as the primary nutrient affecting postprandial glycemic response. The concept of carb counting is not new. In the early 1990's the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) used carb counting as one of its education tools. More recently, short acting insulin analogues and insulin pumps have made the role of carb counting important and popular. Carb counting can be used in conjunction with a meal plan to set carbohydrate targets at each meal and snack. It is also used, perhaps more commonly, to estimate carbohydrate intake and adjust insulin around mixed meals and snacks using insulin to carbohydrate ratio. This effectively addresses the variable eating habits of most children and adolescents. The method may be adapted for patients who use a conventional insulin regimen and may meet the needs of patients who use multiple daily injections (MDI) or an insulin pump. Carb counting can make food planning flexible and enjoyable for patients, and the meal planning approach is very important for the physical growth and psychological development of children with diabetes. This paper describes the importance of carb counting for childhood diabetes as well as some of the special aspects associated with it.

### Impact of carbohydrate counting error on glycemic control in open-loop management of type 1 diabetes: quantitative assessment through an in silico trial [^326a01dd]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the type 1 diabetes (T1D) therapy, blood glucose (BG) concentration is maintained within the safe range by exogenous insulin. The American Diabetes Association recommends carbohydrate-counting in order to compute the meal insulin bolus, whose beneficial effects on glycemic control, in terms of glycated hemoglobin, have been demonstrated by several studies. - This approach consists in estimating the meal carbohydrates (CHO) amount, called carb-counting, and then computing the size of the meal insulin bolus by dividing the estimated CHO amount by a patient-specific factor called carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio. However, many people living with T1D find carb-counting difficult, and despite receiving specific training about how to estimate the CHO content of different foods and meals, frequently under- or over-estimate carbohydrate content that can result in excess glucose excursions. - In a recent study, we demonstrated that carb-counting error depends on meal CHO amount and type. Recently, some smartphone applications - were designed to support T1D subjects with carb-counting, but such applications are at present used only by a minority of individuals.

### Impact of carbohydrate counting error on glycemic control in open-loop management of type 1 diabetes: quantitative assessment through an in silico trial [^8c1021a9]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

This quantification of the impact of different types of carb-counting errors can be valuable to clinicians, researchers and people with diabetes to explain some of the glycemic excursions that occur, as well in aiding decisions around therapy adjustments. For example, the diabetologists can use the formulas we derived to guess how much the glycemic control of a patient can improve if a specific training is programmed for limiting the subject's systematic or random error in carb-counting. In an equivalent way, the diabetologist can opt for adjusting the patient's carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio in order to compensate a systematic error in carb-counting by producing the same benefits in time in ranges estimated by our formulas. However, even if the quantification of the carb-counting error impact can be useful to clinicians for the reasons explained above, we do not provide any indication about how diabetologists must adjust therapy parameters based on our findings. Moreover, the obtained formulas can also be integrated in educational tools usable to help subjects in understanding the detrimental effects of some behavioral aspects, such as carb-counting error, on glycemic control.

It is important to remark that the quantitative results reported in this paper are valid in an open-loop scenario only. Indeed, we expect that the impact of the carb-counting error may be mitigated by the use of sophisticated closed-loop approaches and technologies. It is possible that these formulas can be used to stress-test the impact of carbohydrate counting errors in novel closed-loop algorithms.

Moreover, it must be emphasized that, in our study, we simulated rapidly absorbed meals completely made of CHO, since the T1D-PDS does not include a model of the absorption of more complex meals containing also proteins and fats, and thus it cannot simulate slow-absorption meals. Of course, the impact of the carb-counting error could be different if slow-absorption meals and/or the effect of other macronutrients are considered in the analysis. If an updated meal absorption model should become available and be included in the T1D-PDS, the analysis performed in this paper could be repeated considering different meal compositions.

### Does a ketogenic diet have a place within diabetes clinical practice? Review of current evidence and controversies [^fbdf425b]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

What is a Ketogenic Diet?

There are many variations of carbohydrate limited or restricted diets, ranging from moderate to very low carbohydrate diets, and a strict definition remains to be agreed; however, Feinman provided the most commonly used categories of carbohydrate-focused diets. A moderate carbohydrate diet is between 130 and 230 g per day or 26–45% of daily energy intake based on a 2000 kcal/day. A low carbohydrate diet is > 130 g or < 26% of daily energy intake and a very low carbohydrate diet, or ketogenic diet, is 20–50 g per day or 10% of daily energy intake.

One of the issues in using percentage energy from carbohydrate based on total energy intake is that this is based on the assumption an individual eats 2000 kcal per day. This means that if an individual's energy intake varies from this amount so does the amount of carbohydrate and therefore whether nutritional ketosis is induced or not. For example, if an individual consumes 3000 kcal/day, 10% of the daily energy would result in consuming 75 g of carbohydrate and therefore would not be defined as a ketogenic diet. Therefore, it would seem more appropriate to use absolute grams of carbohydrate as a defining criteria for carbohydrate restriction to allow greater comparison in dietary methods.

Further discrepancies surround whether definitions should be centred on the actual amount of carbohydrates permitted (i.e. < 50 g) or percentage of daily energy intake. This is important as the varying definitions of a ketogenic diet with a range of carbohydrate intakes will yield significantly varying levels of nutritional ketosis. Also, variations of whether net carbs or total carbs should be measured is another factor which remains unanswered. At present, US guidelines use net carbohydrates, whereas UK and EU guidelines use total carbohydrates. These factors make evaluation of scientific studies difficult.

Ketogenic diets might be considered to be a very restrictive dietary pattern, primarily consisting of high fat, moderate protein, and a very low carbohydrate intake. It is termed 'ketogenic' with the overarching aim being to restrict carbohydrate intake enough to induce nutritional ketosis (Table 1). This is a metabolic state which imitates the biological adaptations seen in starvation, without severely limiting caloric intake and a blood ketone level of between 0.5 and 3 mg/dL. Foods such as grains, potatoes, rice, fruit, starchy vegetables, legumes and bread are substituted with other food sources high in fat, concomitant with an increase protein (typically animal-based).

### Prospective independent evaluation of the carbohydrate counting accuracy of two smartphone applications [^6d995d08]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The gold standard treatment for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is intensified insulin therapy, whether by multiple daily injections (MDI) or by continuous subcutaneous insulin injection (CSII), and preferably using insulin analogs in order to reduce hypoglycemic events. In addition, T1D patients should be trained in how to match prandial insulin doses to carbohydrate intake, premeal blood glucose, and anticipated physical activity. These skills are taught to patients at the onset of their diabetes or later in the course of their disease. The term "carbohydrate counting" or "carb counting" is widely used for describing the educational meal-planning tool based on meal carbohydrate recognition and quantification. For patients using CSII, the bolus wizard — an advanced pump function — can be used to facilitate insulin dose tuning based on carb quantity and premeal blood glucose levels. However, even with such an integrated tool, realizing the high carb counting accuracy needed to achieve good postprandial glucose control remains a challenge. Despite several methods and reference booklets that have been developed by diabetes care teams, carb counting is often inaccurate, and can even be skipped by patients. Several smartphone applications to help patients with carb counting have been developed over the last decade. However, there is virtually no available literature evaluating the clinical impact of these smartphone applications and their accuracy in quantifying carbohydrates. Our aim in this study was to perform an independent bicentric evaluation of the accuracy of carb counting by two smartphone applications, one relying on the manual entry of carbohydrates with the help of a photo gallery (Glucicheck ®) and the other using automated photography recognition technology (Foodvisor ®).

### Simplifying carb counting: a randomized controlled study-feasibility and efficacy of an individualized, simple, patient-centred carb counting tool [^04585ab1]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this study was to introduce and test a simple, individualized carbohydrate counting tool designed for persons with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) in order to determine whether the tool improved A1C levels for participants with age, education or language barriers.

Methods

In a randomized controlled trial, 85 participants were offered six diabetes instructional sessions free of charge over a six-month period. Forty-one received guidance using the regular carbohydrate counting (RCC) method. Forty-four received guidance using an individualized 'Simple Carb Counting' (SCC), involving two customized tables prepared for participants.

Results

The simple, individualized SCC tool for carbohydrate counting was non-inferior to the standard method of RCC. The SCC tool was more effective among participants aged 40 and older, while no differences were found when comparing participants by education level. Irrespective of intervention group, all participants improved their A1C level (9.9% = 13.2mmol/L vs 8.6% = 11.1mmol/L, p = .001). A greater improvement in A1C level was seen in newly diagnosed participants (-6.1 vs -0.7, p = .005, -3.4 vs 0.9, p = .032) in both the RCC and SCC groups. All participants expressed improved emotional level per their PAID5 questionnaires (Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale-PAID), (10.6 (± 5.7) vs 9.5 (± 5.7), p = .023), with women reporting greater improvement than men.

Conclusions

SCC is a simple, individualized, feasible, low-tech tool for carbohydrate counting, which promotes and enables accurate insulin dosing in people with T1DM. It was found more effective among participants aged 40 and older. Additional studies are needed to corroborate these findings.

### Unravelling the role of natural herbs for the management of diabetes mellitus [^819d2c97]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Interventions in diabetes mellitus

Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disease marked by increased blood glucose levels, requires behavior modification and lifestyle changes. In order to help patients, control their diabetes and improve their general health, non-pharmacological methods aim to provide them with the information and abilities they need to make healthy lifestyle choices. Personalized lifestyle interventions that are tailored to each patient's particular requirements and preferences have demonstrated promising outcomes in the treatment of diabetes. Personalized lifestyle interventions have proven to be quite effective in a number of areas related to managing diabetes. By customizing meal plans, recommending physical activity, and creating all-encompassing treatment plans for each patient, these interventions successfully address unique obstacles and difficulties that are unique to each individual. This method successfully increases treatment compliance, promotes sustained behavioral change, and boosts patient involvement in self-care. Individualized dietary regimens, like glycaemic index-based meal plans and carb counting, have been demonstrated to help patients achieve better glycaemic control. By implementing tailored physical activity recommendations, patients are guaranteed to engage in pleasurable and manageable workouts, which improves glucose management. Type 2 diabetes can be significantly increased by obesity, which also increases the likelihood of developing complications from the disease. By applying specialized techniques including portion control, calorie restriction, and physical activity regimens, tailored lifestyle therapies seek to address weight management. According to research, compared to generic therapies, the use of individualized techniques results in better long-term weight management outcomes and enhanced effectiveness in reaching weight loss goals. People with diabetes may experience psychological effects such as stress, anxiety, and sadness. To successfully address emotional barriers and improve psychological well-being, personalized lifestyle therapies usually include behavior modification strategies like motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral therapy. People are better equipped to manage the challenges of managing their diabetes when they receive individualized support and counseling. In order to improve treatment adherence and support long-term behavior change in the management of diabetes, it is imperative to employ behavior modification approaches. These methods place a high priority on empowering patients to embrace healthy behaviors, set reasonable objectives, and build self-efficacy. A crucial habit is self-monitoring, which includes recording physical activity, eating habits, and blood glucose levels on a regular basis. According to research, people who regularly track their progress are more likely to see reoccurring patterns and make wise decisions to improve their diabetes care. Research has indicated that individualized food planning and exercise regimens can greatly enhance the treatment of diabetes. Improved glycaemic control and weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes have been associated with low-carb diets that emphasize nutrient-dense foods like proteins, healthy fats, and non-starchy vegetables. Additionally, these diets lower the risk of heart disease. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and olive oil are all part of the Mediterranean diet, which has been linked to better glycaemic management and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. For diabetics, these diets offer significant health benefits and can be tailored to personal preferences. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that tailored physical activity recommendations that take into account variables like age, fitness level, and comorbidities connected to diabetes improve physical fitness, optimize glucose management, and reduce cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients. All things considered, these individualized methods can greatly enhance diabetic care and general wellness.

### Simplifying carb counting: a randomized controlled study-feasibility and efficacy of an individualized, simple, patient-centred carb counting tool [^81330bc6]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

2.1 Regular carbohydrate counting

During the instructional sessions, the rationale for carbohydrate counting was explained. Commercial booklets containing a list of the carbohydrate content of foods were provided, and participants were introduced to websites or cellular phone applications designed to assist the public with determining the carbohydrate content of various foods. The participants were taught to calculate the amount of insulin needed using their personal I:C ratio, IS, correction factor, and the glucose target goals prescribed by the Diabetes Clinic team. Participants were encouraged to keep a food diary to assist them with carbohydrate counting.

2.2 Simplified individualized carbohydrate counting

The SCC tool consisted of two tables written in the participant's native language and adjusted to the participant's specific requirements. Insulin doses were calculated by professional staff using personalized I:C ratios and IS.

First Table: The first table, derived from patients' personal IS, listed the number of units that participants needed to administer in order to correct every pre‐meal blood glucose level so as to reach their target glucose.

Second Table: The second table contained a list of food items derived from participants' personal eating habits, as recorded in their food diaries. The list consisted mainly of the most common foods they regularly consumed, the carbohydrate content of those foods and the number of insulin units needed, as calculated by the personal I:C ratio per usual portion of each food item. High carbohydrate content foods that participants included in their diet were listed, not for healthy nutrition education, but for purposes of facilitating carb counting. Foods that did not contain carbohydrates, such as protein or fat items, were also listed to ensure that the patient realized that these foods contained no carbs. Patients treated with insulin pumps received a personalized table containing the carbohydrates in their food list as grams to accurately calculate the amount of carbs entered to the calculator (Figures 1 and 2).

At each instructional session, participants' tables were reviewed, personal dosing was tested, food items were added to, or deleted from participants' lists as warranted, and the logic of the method was reiterated for the purpose of reinforcing participants' understanding and compliance.

### Death to carbohydrate counting? [^d8e558d6]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

It would appear that if similar levels of glycemic control can be achieved with few adverse events by using a simple algorithm, then the simple algorithm may be a better strategy for adjusting insulin. Additionally, the simple algorithm may be more feasible to teach patients within underserved settings where a dietitian may not be available. However, are there benefits to counting carbohydrates beyond glycemic control?

In examining the study's secondary outcomes, there is an apparent trend for the carbohydrate-counting group to have less weight gain at the end of the 24-week period. The carbohydrate group had a weight gain of 2.3% compared with a 3.4% increase in the simple algorithm group. The 1% difference in weight gain over 6 months did not reach statistical significance, but the study was not adequately powered to test the significance of such a difference. What would be the weight effects over a longer time period? Could the higher insulin dosage used in the simple algorithm group cause greater weight gain? Weight gain is a well-known side effect of insulin therapy, and previous studies demonstrate weight increases of ≤ 21% in one year with some insulin regimens. Weight management is a critical aspect of type 2 diabetes, and it will be important to evaluate strategies to minimize weight gain while using insulin therapy. Reducing carbohydrates can be an important strategy for improving glycemic control and weight loss. Did the carbohydrate-counting group have a lower carbohydrate or caloric intake than the simple algorithm group? The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) Trial, which is evaluating the potential benefits of weight control in type 2 diabetes, found that the three most common weight control strategies used by participants were increasing fruits and vegetables, cutting out sweets, and eating fewer high-carbohydrate foods. Counting carbohydrates may increase dietary awareness of the carbohydrates being consumed and subsequently reduce carbohydrate consumption.

Figure 2.
Boxplots of the difference in post-prandial glucose control metrics compared to the reference case, for all the carb-counting error values tested (on the x-axis). In particular, the BG peak level (panel A), BG level at 120min after the mealtime (panel B), peak time from mealtime (panel E), AUC in hyperglycemia (panel C) and AUC in hypoglycemia (panel D) are reported. Red zones are the ones in which the metrics are worse than for the reference case, while the green zones are the ones in which the metrics are better than for the reference case. In each boxplot, the red horizontal line represents the median, the blue box marks the interquartile range, dashed lines are the whiskers, and red crosses indicate outliers. Whiskers are drawn from the ends of the interquartile range to the adjacent values, which are the most extreme data values that are not outliers. By default, an outlier is a value that is more than 1.5 times the interquartile range away from the top or bottom of the box.

Multi-Meal Analysis

Sensitivity to carb-counting error in the multi-meal scenario

Panels A, B and C of Figure 3 report the boxplots of the delta time in ranges metrics (∆, ∆and ∆) for the 100 virtual subjects, by varying the mean carb-counting error and fixing the standard deviation to 0. In this way, we can investigate the impact of a systematic error in carb-counting on the time in ranges metrics in the absence of random error. For the majority of subjects, systematic underestimations of meal CHO content (ie, error mean equal to −5% and −10%) lead to higher TAR and lower TIR than the reference case, as visible in panels B and A, respectively. Instead, systematic overestimations (ie, error mean equal to +5% and +10%) lead to more TIR (panel A) at the expense of an increase TBR (panel C) in most of subjects.

### Low-carbohydrate diets in children and adolescents with or at risk for diabetes [^44264478]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Carbohydrate counting example for meal planning in adolescents: In practice, pediatricians often help families set goals to limit carbohydrate to a lower number of grams per day or per meal than baseline; for example, if an adolescent is eating 150 to 200 g of carbohydrate per meal, carbohydrate counting would be recommended to limit meals to 100 to 150 g of carbohydrate and increase servings of vegetables as a first step.

Sensitivity to carb-counting error in the multi-meal scenario

Firstly, the impact of the carb-counting error was evaluated via boxplot representation of the delta time in ranges distribution among the 100 subjects and by plotting the curve of the delta metrics for different values of M and SD. Secondly, mathematical formulas were derived to quantify the relationship between delta time in ranges and different values of the systematic error (M) and the random error (SD). Specifically, 3 multiple linear regression models were identified by using as output the mean of delta time in ranges among the 100 virtual subjects and as inputs both the error mean and the standard deviation, as follow:

The linearity of the relationship between inputs and each output was verified by computing the coefficient of determination R 2 of the models. The slope coefficients α and β are sensitivity indices, which permit quantification of the strength of the impact of the 2 factors under study on the time in ranges metrics.

### Facilitating positive health behaviors and well-being to improve health outcomes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^30be19ec]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Eating and meal plan approaches and methods — Few head-to-head studies have compared different eating approaches; a systematic review and meta-analysis of carbohydrate counting versus other meal planning advice found no significant differences in A1C levels compared with standard education. In an RCT, a simplified carbohydrate counting tool based on individual glycemic response was noninferior to conventional carbohydrate counting in 85 adults with type 1 diabetes. In a randomized crossover trial comparing carbohydrate counting with qualitative meal size estimates, time in range was 74% for carbohydrate counting and 70.5% for the qualitative meal size estimates, and noninferiority was not confirmed for the qualitative method. Newer technologies such as smart phone apps, CGM, and automated insulin delivery may decrease the need for precise carbohydrate counting and allow for personalized nutrition approaches. One RCT found that the diabetes plate method and carbohydrate counting were effective in helping achieve improved A1C; the diabetes plate method is a commonly used visual approach featuring a 9-in plate that shows one-half of the plate for nonstarchy vegetables, one-quarter for protein, and one-quarter for carbohydrates, while carbohydrate counting is a more advanced skill that helps plan for and track carbohydrate intake.

### Adjust to target in type 2 diabetes: comparison of a simple algorithm with carbohydrate counting for adjustment of mealtime insulin glulisine [^9d3fae03]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Treatments

Targets were fasting blood glucose < 95 mg/dl, preprandial (before lunch and dinner) blood glucose < 100 mg/dl, and bedtime blood glucose < 130 mg/dl.

Insulin glargine dosing.

The initial insulin glargine dose was calculated as 50% of the prerandomization total daily insulin dose. Subsequently, dosing was titrated weekly according to the mean of the last 3 days of fasting self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) (Table 1). A dose increase could be split into ≥ 2 increments over the week.

Insulin glulisine dosing.

The remaining 50% of the total daily insulin dose was used for mealtime insulin glulisine, which was split to cover three meals: 50% for the largest (most carbohydrate) meal, 33% for the middle-sized meal, and 17% for the smallest meal. Glulisine dose adjustment for both groups was based on prelunch/dinner and bedtime (these three time points are referred to as mealtime) blood glucose patterns from the previous week as shown in Table 1. Simple algorithm patients' premeal doses were set weekly, based on the algorithm in Table 1. Study staff taught the carbohydrate counting (carb count) group about carbohydrate counting and how to use an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio. The insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios for each meal were determined based on the algorithm in Table 1. An insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio allows patients to adjust their insulin based on the amount of carbohydrate they choose to eat at a meal.

Additional antidiabetic medications.

Patients taking metformin at randomization continued using it at the same dose. No other insulin or oral antidiabetic agents were permitted.

Dietary and lifestyle recommendations

Educational materials were specially designed for this study based on the International Diabetes Center Type 2 Diabetes BASICS client book. The materials for the simple algorithm group omitted all references to carbohydrate intake except in the context of treating hypoglycemia and having carbohydrate if alcohol was being consumed.

Results

Single-Meal Analysis

Sensitivity to carb-counting error on post-prandial glucose

Figure 1 shows the glycemic curves of a representative virtual subject for different carb-counting error levels up to 6hours after the mealtime. We can see that CHO overestimation mitigates the peak BG level compared to the case of absence of error (black line), but it leads to BG levels lower than 70mg/dl for errors larger than 10%. The larger the error, the sooner the hypoglycemic event happens. On the other hand, CHO underestimation leads to higher BG values in all the next 6hours.

Figure 1.
Glycemic profiles of a representative subject for different carb-counting error levels. The black curve (the one with error equal to 0%) represents the subject BG excursion in absence of carb-counting error. A meal of 60grams of CHO is given to the subject at 8:00.

The distributions of the postprandial glucose control metrics in the overall virtual population, expressed as differences compared to the reference case (= 0), are reported via boxplot representation in Figure 2. The higher the overestimation error, the lower the BG peak (panel A), the BG level at 120min after the mealtime (panel B) and the AUC in hyperglycemia (panel C) compared to the reference case, at the expense of the AUC in hypoglycemia (panel D) which increases for higher positive values of carb-counting error. Conversely, increasing the underestimation error, the BG peak (panel A), the BG level at 120min after the mealtime (panel B) and the AUC in hyperglycemia (panel C) decrease, while no hypoglycemic episodes occurs for any subjects. Indeed, the AUC in hypoglycemia (panel D) remains zero for subjects who do not experience hypoglycemia in absence of carb-counting error, while it assumes negative values for the others. Moreover, the BG peak time from mealtime (panel E) decreases with CHO underestimation while increasing with CHO underestimations with an approximately linear trend.

### Low carbohydrate diets, glycaemic control, enablers, and barriers in the management of type 1 diabetes: a mixed methods systematic review [^7691a970]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Barriers — for individuals with T1D adhering to a VLCD or LCD

Challenges of the diet

Adjusting meal time insulin to carbohydrate ratio proved to be an initial challenge for many across the three studies due to unexpected variation in glycaemia i.e.g.oing too low due to too much insulin or going to high due to too little insulin. Participants reported needing to adjusted their insulin to carbohydrate ratio frequently at the beginning of the intervention due to the reduced carbohydrate intake to achieve optimal glycaemia as their usual ratio was inappropriate. The following participant reported:

"my ratio's had to change quite quickly" due to the reduction in dietary carbohydrate being consumed.

It was reported that reading information on food products can be confusing and burdensome for participants. In addition, one participant made the point that: "the low carb diet can be restrictive", highlighting the emotional burden patients with T1D face in daily living with the disease.

It was also acknowledged by some participants that the diet negatively impacted their mood when it changed from an unrestricted diet to a LCD and applying carbohydrate counting skills: "food from a pleasure to chemistry… suddenly enjoyment of meals went suddenly down".

Due to the nature of low carbohydrate eating, it can be a difficult regimen to maintain. From a social perspective this point was emphasised in the following reflection: "because our society is so high carb, you really need to be mindful… it (can be) quite restrictive when eating out with friends".

Having diabetes and managing the condition was described by one participant as like having: "another child… it was just something I looked after and I didn't put it in everybody's faces… but (this changed when) everybody started seeing me reading labels profusely and measuring things".

Limited information (participants knowledge, information sources) about the diet

While many participants acknowledged the value of following a LCD and carbohydrate counting there were some key concerns relating to insulin to carbohydrate ratio application when following such a diet. One participant stated that despite undertaking carbohydrate training felt there were still skills that needed to be developed stating "a lot of questions about carbohydrate counting and how it works because there's quite a few anomalies".

Participants reported a paucity of authoritative resources for individuals living with T1D who choose to follow a low carbohydrate eating regimen. One participant acknowledged that this prompted them to access a: " Facebook group called Type 1 Diabetes Quebec… On there some people posted an article that came from another website — 'Long Live Bacon'".

### Dietary strategies to manage diabetes and glycemic control in youth and young adults with youth-onset type 1 and type 2 diabetes: the SEARCH for diabetes in youth study [^401347a0]. Pediatric Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Examine associations of dietary strategies used to manage diabetes over time with hemoglobin A1c in youth-onset type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

Methods

The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth observational study assessed dietary strategies used by 1814 participants with diabetes (n = 1558 type 1, n = 256 type 2) at two to three research visits over 5.5years (range 1.7–12.2). Participants reported often, sometimes, or never using 10 different dietary strategies, and use over time was categorized into five mutually exclusive groups: often using across visits; started using at later visits; sometimes using across visits; stopped using at later visits; or never using across visits. General multivariable linear models evaluated most recent A1c by use category for each strategy.

Results

In type 1 diabetes, A1c was lower among those who starting tracking calories (-0.4%, Tukey P < .05), often counted carbs (-0.8%, Tukey P < .001), or sometimes chose low glycemic index foods (-0.5%, Tukey P = 0.02) vs those with less use, while participants who never drank more milk had the lowest A1c (-0.5%, Tukey P = 0.04). In type 2 diabetes, A1c was lower among those who often limited high fat foods (-2.0%, Tukey P = 0.02) or started counting carbohydrates (-1.7%, Tukey P = 0.07) than those who did so less.

Conclusions

For several dietary strategies, more frequent use over time was related to lower A1c in youth-onset type 1 and type 2 diabetes, suggesting these strategies can likely support diabetes management for this population. Investigation into factors predicting receipt of advice for specific strategies and corresponding impact on intake might be considered.

### Effects of basic carbohydrate counting versus standard dietary care for glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (the BCC study): a randomised, controlled trial [^bd9f3cfb]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic condition requiring continuous self-management, beyond regular healthcare visits. Consequently, evidence-based education with specific focus on diet and nutrition is crucial for empowering individuals to effectively manage their diabetes. Giving priority to dietary management is essential for preventing the onset of diabetes-related complications and improving quality of life. A variety of eating patterns have been recommended by the European and American diabetes associations. Additionally, a recent network meta-analysis found that several dietary approaches (including low-fat, vegetarian, Mediterranean, high-protein, moderate-carbohydrate, low-carbohydrate, low glycaemic index/loads, paleolithic diets) improve glycaemic control in T2D. Compared with various eating patterns, carbohydrate counting is an approach to manage carbohydrate amounts and balance carbohydrate intake at meals (i.e. basic carbohydrate counting [BCC]). Advanced carbohydrate counting has been recommended for several decades, primarily benefiting individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but also showing positive effects in T2D in combination with basal-bolus insulin regimes. Despite the impact of the total carbohydrate intake in a meal on the postprandial glucose response, there remains a scarcity of evidence regarding the effectiveness of BCC as a dietary approach for enhancing glycaemic control. Furthermore, accuracy in carbohydrate estimation is presumed an intermediate marker likely to have an impact on glycaemic control in individuals with diabetes. This has been found in some studies (mainly including individuals with T1D) but not others. There are multiple educational approaches to BCC including gram counting, exchanges, and experience-based estimation. None of which have been thoroughly described or examined in clinical trials. Thus, providing knowledge and practical skills in estimating carbohydrate portions more accurately and self-monitoring carbohydrate intake appears highly relevant. By improving carbohydrate estimation skills and encourage monitoring of carbohydrate intake, aiming at a high day-to-day and meal-to-meal consistency, individuals with T2D may improve their carbohydrate food choices and portion sizes. Ideally, this could result in clinical improvements such as a reduction in plasma glucose variability and time spent with hyperglycaemia thereby improving glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as seen in individuals with T1D. The aim of the current study was to examine the efficacy of a structured education program in BCC as add-on to standard dietary care on glycaemic control in individuals with T2D. Our hypothesis was that BCC is superior for improving glycaemia, assessed by HbA1c and mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions (MAGE), when compared with standard dietary care.

3 RESULTS

In total, 107 men and women were recruited for the study, of whom 22 were excluded, as shown in Figure 3. Of the 85 people who were deemed eligible, 48.2%, n = 41, of participants (23 women, 18 men) were assigned to RCC method group, and 51.8%, n = 44, of participants, (17 women, 27 men) to the SCC method group. The mean age of participants was 43.1 (18–74). About 43% of the RCC method group were treated with an insulin pump versus 36% of the SCC group (p = .48). All patients monitored their glucose by self‐monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (Figure 1 and Table 1).

### Prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate effectiveness of registered dietitian-led diabetes management on glycemic and diet control in a primary care setting in Taiwan [^d2a75441]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Most randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of diabetes-self management or lifestyle education have reported improvements in clinical indexes (.), but few have documented dietary changes. One study using lifestyle education in diabetic patients reported significant differences in reductions in total fat (percent energy, P < 0.001) and saturated fat (percent energy, P = 0.001) and nonsignificant (P = 0.13) decreases in the total energy intake between their intervention and control groups (−215 vs. −144 kcal/day, respectively). Another randomized controlled trial, evaluating the effect of a weight reduction (including dietary counseling) and exercise program on diabetes management in older overweight patients, reported significant net differences in total energy intakes over 3 months (control 210.9 kcal/day, intervention −200.4 kcal/day, and net difference −411.3 kcal/day). However, these studies did not examine simultaneous association between changes in dietary components and metabolic parameters. Our study showed that energy intake was decreased by 229 ± + 309.16 kcal/day in the intervention subjects and increased by 56.10 ± 309.41 kcal/day in the control subjects with A1C ≥ 7% (P < 0.001) after 1 year. Significant net differences were also observed between the absolute amounts (grams per day) of carbohydrate/fat/protein consumption in the intervention group (−31.24/−7.74/−10.91) and the control group (7.15/3.84/2.94). After adjustment for confounders, independent associations were found between changes in carbohydrate intake and A1C, indicating that carbohydrates may be the most important among macronutrients in influencing changes in A1C. This finding is consistent with the finding that the amount of carbohydrates consumed is a strong predictor of glycemic response. Therefore, portion size control or carbohydrate counting such as those suggested by the ADA may remain a key dietary strategy in achieving desirable glycemic control. Registered dietitians can play an important role in imparting this knowledge to diabetic patients and in helping them implement changes in diet.

### Prospective independent evaluation of the carbohydrate counting accuracy of two smartphone applications [^3403203e]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Smartphone applications (apps) have been designed that help patients to accurately count their carbohydrate intake in order to optimize prandial insulin dose matching. Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of two carbohydrate (carb) counting apps.

Methods

Medical students, in the role of mock patients, evaluated meals using two smartphone apps: Foodvisor ® (which uses automatic food photo recognition technology) and Glucicheck ® (which requires the manual entry of carbohydrates with the help of a photo gallery). The macronutrient quantifications obtained with these two apps were compared to a reference quantification.

Results

The carbohydrate content of the entire meal was underestimated with Foodvisor ® (Foodvisor ® quantification minus gold standard quantification = - 7.2 ± 17.3 g; p < 0.05) but reasonably accurately estimated with Glucicheck ® (Glucicheck ® quantification minus gold standard quantification = 1.4 ± 13.4 g; ns). The percentage of meals with an absolute error in carbohydrate quantification above 20 g was greater for Foodvisor ® compared to Glucicheck ® (30% vs 14%; p < 0.01).

Conclusion

The carb counting accuracy was slightly better when using Glucicheck ® compared to Foodvisor ®. However, both apps provided a lower mean absolute carb counting error than that usually made by T1D patients in everyday life, suggesting that such apps may be a useful adjunct for estimating carbohydrate content.

### Adjust to target in type 2 diabetes: comparison of a simple algorithm with carbohydrate counting for adjustment of mealtime insulin glulisine [^10ca6240]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS —

This is one of the few randomized controlled trials to evaluate basal-bolus analog insulin therapy in obese patients with type 2 diabetes and one of the first studies to evaluate the use of carbohydrate counting in patients with type 2 diabetes. Using a simple algorithm to adjust mealtime insulin glulisine each week based on SMBG patterns was as effective as adjusting mealtime insulin using insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios. Both approaches yielded a reduction of about 1.5% in A1C with no significant differences in mean A1C change from baseline or in the percentage of patients achieving A1C goals of < 6.5% or < 7.0%. Both regimens were well tolerated. The risk for severe hypoglycemia was low and not significantly different between groups.

Other studies have shown that patients whose diabetes is well-controlled with insulin often have a basal:bolus insulin ratio close to 50%:50%. At week 24, after multiple weekly titrations of insulin based on SMBG patterns, both the simple algorithm and the carb count groups had basal-bolus insulin ratios of ∼49%:51%. In addition, at the end of the study, the bolus insulin dose was split between breakfast, lunch, and dinner: ∼27, 35, and 38% in the simple algorithm group and 25, 34, and 41% in the carb count group, respectively. At week 24, both groups required large total daily insulin doses (simple algorithm 1.9 units/kg and carb count 1.7 units/kg). The lower total insulin doses for the carb count group patients may reflect more matching of insulin doses to carbohydrate intake at each meal as opposed to the set meal doses of those in the simple algorithm group.

### Effects of basic carbohydrate counting versus standard dietary care for glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (the BCC study): a randomised, controlled trial [^06d4484d]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Interventions

Participants allocated to standard dietary care received three individual dietary counselling sessions (total duration 2 h; week 0, 2 and 12). All participants in the BCC group also attended a group course (4–8 participants; total duration 8 h; week 2, 4 and 12). The BCC program constituted a structured group-based educational initiative designed to help individuals with T2D manage their blood glucose levels by regulating their carbohydrate intake. Program activities encompassed concise theoretical presentations on food and nutrition in relation to diabetes (participants were not given a complete diabetes self-management program), problem-solving exercises incorporating hands-on group activities to identify carbohydrate sources, and practical sessions involving the measurement and calculation of carbohydrate content in diverse foods. Various approaches to carbohydrate monitoring were explored, including gram counting using nutrition labels, interpretation of carbohydrate tables, utilization of smartphone applications for estimating carbohydrate portion sizes, and improving skills in estimating carbohydrate portion sizes through visual training. Furthermore, participants were instructed to maintain a dietary log during the course, documenting their food intake and blood glucose levels over a 4-day period. The dietary data recorded in the log was used to ascertain total carbohydrate intake and daily variations across meals and snacks and to develop a personal carbohydrate plan with recommendations for daily carbohydrate intake. Finally, the BCC program also encompassed discussions on dietary coping strategies with the integration of peer modeling and support. All group courses and individual dietary counselling sessions were carried out by the same study dietitians who followed the planned curriculum. More details concerning the content in the BCC program and standard dietary care have been reported in the protocol paper. Participants were advised not to change their physical activity pattern during the study period. Changes in medication were allowed during the study period.

Outcome measures

The primary outcomes were changes in HbA1c and MAGE – a measure of glycaemic variability – from baseline to end-of-treatment at six months. A full list of secondary and exploratory outcomes is described in detail in the protocol paper.

### Dietary strategies for adult type 1 diabetes in light of outcome evidence [^b85dce36]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals who have type 1 diabetes need individualised medical nutrition therapies whose goals are to improve overall health and metabolic outcomes. However, interventions in the field of nutrition are challenging, as diet-related correlations with disease remain difficult to detect and the certainty of outcome in this area is elusive. Currently, patients are not meeting recommended dietary guidelines. Several alternative approaches for teaching meal planning to people with diabetes have been proposed: basic nutrition guidelines, basic diabetes guidelines, menu approaches to meal planning, exchange lists for meal planning and carbohydrate counting. The review provides an overview of suggested strategies for achieving the proposed goals and summarises evidence of outcomes.

### Impact of carbohydrate counting error on glycemic control in open-loop management of type 1 diabetes: quantitative assessment through an in silico trial [^faebf602]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

Therefore, 3 multiple linear regression models were fitted by using as outcome the delta time in ranges and as regressors M and SD. The resulting models are:

The coefficient of determination R 2 is equal to 0.982 for the model described by equation (10), 0.987 for the one described by equation (11) and 0.970 for the model with equation (12). The obtained R 2, very close to 1, confirm that a linear technique is appropriate for such data.

Such formulas permit us to quantify how much time in ranges change (compared to the reference case) in response to different levels of systematic and random carb-counting errors. For example, considering equation (10), we can deduce that a carb-counting error with mean of −5% and SD of 10% leads to a ∆TIR equal to −1.75%. This means that TIR decreases of 1.75% compared to the value of TIR which we would have in the reference case, that is, in absence of carb-counting error (M = 0, SD = 0). For the same value of error mean but increasing the SD to 50%, we obtain a ∆TIR of −4.55%, that is, a TIR deterioration of 4.55% compared to the reference case.

Background

Although carbohydrate counting is the recommended dietary strategy for achieving glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes, the advice is based on narrative review and grading of the available evidence. We aimed to assess by systematic review and meta-analysis the efficacy of carbohydrate counting on glycaemic control in adults and children with type 1 diabetes.

Methods

We screened and assessed randomised controlled trials of interventions longer than 3 months that compared carbohydrate counting with general or alternate dietary advice in adults and children with type 1 diabetes. Change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration was the primary outcome. The results of clinically and statistically homogenous studies were pooled and meta-analysed using the random-effects model to provide estimates of the efficacy of carbohydrate counting.

Findings

We identified seven eligible trials, of 311 potentially relevant studies, comprising 599 adults and 104 children with type 1 diabetes. Study quality score averaged 7·6 out of 13. Overall there was no significant improvement in HbA1c concentration with carbohydrate counting versus the control or usual care (-0·35% [-3·9 mmol/mol], 95% CI -0·75 to 0·06; p = 0·096). We identified significant heterogeneity between studies, which was potentially related to differences in study design. In the five studies in adults with a parallel design, there was a 0·64% point (7·0 mmol/mol) reduction in HbA1c with carbohydrate counting versus control (95% CI -0·91 to -0·37; p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

There is some evidence to support the recommendation of carbohydrate counting over alternate advice or usual care in adults with type 1 diabetes. Additional studies are needed to support promotion of carbohydrate counting over other methods of matching insulin dose to food intake.

Funding

None.

### Effects of basic carbohydrate counting versus standard dietary care for glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (the BCC study): a randomised, controlled trial [^d07e0b3d]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines recommend basic carbohydrate counting (BCC), or similar methods to improve carbohydrate estimation skills and to strive for higher consistency in carbohydrate intake potentially improving glycaemic control. However, evidence for this approach in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is limited.

Objective

To examine the efficacy of a structured education program in BCC as add-on to standard dietary care on glycaemic control in individuals with T2D.

Methods

The BCC Study was a randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel-group trial. Individuals with T2D aged 18–75 years with glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 53-97mmol/mol (7.0–11.0%) were randomly assigned (1:1) to BCC or standard dietary care. The primary outcomes were differences in changes in HbA1c or glycaemic variability (calculated as mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions [MAGE]) between groups after six months of intervention.

Results

Between September 2018 and July 2021, 48 participants were randomly assigned, 23 to BCC and 25 to standard dietary care. Seven participants did not receive the allocated intervention. From a baseline-adjusted mean of 65mmol/mol (95% CI 62–68 [8.1%, 7.8–8.4]), HbA1c changed by -5 mmol/mol (-8 to -1 [-0.5%, -0.7 to -0.1]) in BCC and -3 mmol/mol (-7 to 1 [-0.3%, -0.6 to 0.1]) in standard care with an estimated treatment effect of -2 mmol/mol (-7 to 4 [-0.2%, -0.6 to 0.4]); p = 0.554. From a baseline-adjusted mean of 4.2mmol/l (3.7 to 4.8), MAGE changed by -16% (-33 to 5) in BCC and by -3% (-21 to 20) in standard care with an estimated treatment effect of -14% (-36 to 16); p = 0.319. Only median carbohydrate estimation error in favour of BCC (estimated treatment difference -55% (-70 to -32); p < 0.001) remained significant after multiple testing adjustment.

Conclusions

No glycaemic effects were found but incorporating BCC as a supplementary component to standard dietary care led to improved skills in estimating carbohydrate intake among individuals with T2D.

### Does a ketogenic diet have a place within diabetes clinical practice? Review of current evidence and controversies [^c53603fe]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Current Guidance for Diabetes Management

Multiple dietary approaches have been suggested to help people with diabetes to manage their glucose control. At present, UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines promote (which have not been updated since 2009) 'general healthy eating' for T2D management, encouraging high fibre, low-glycaemic index sources of carbohydrates and to limit saturated fat intake; the same advice as for the general population. Until recently, both Diabetes UK and American Diabetes Association (ADA) issued broad advice for diabetes management in individuals with T2D with the overarching aim to induce weight loss due to the lack of evidence-based dietary guidelines for diabetes management. Interestingly, this advice was also applicable to the 10% of individuals with T2D who are considered to be a healthy weight (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m 2), in people with T1D and gestational diabetes as weight loss in these cohorts improves glycaemic control. This ambiguity has led to uncertainty amongst healthcare professionals with 'prescribing' a specific dietary type or pattern as a therapeutic approach for diabetes as a consensus has yet to be reached for the ideal dietary distribution for people with diabetes.

It can be argued that urgent revision of existing conventional dietary strategies to prevent and improve diabetes management is required, especially considering the continued increasing global prevalence of diabetes. Carbohydrate restriction is increasingly gaining acceptance for diabetes management within the UK and advocacy started to emerge with Diabetes UK in 2011 for individuals with T2D and websites such as Diabetes.co.uk, which established the Low Carb Programme, an evidence-based digital health intervention app launched in 2015 and supported by the UK National Health Service (NHS). This has driven the recognition of a low carbohydrate diet as a therapeutic approach in general practice for T2D management and remission. People with T2D completing the programme reported greater HbA1c improvements (− 9.1 mmol/mol versus 1.7 mmol/mol, P < 0.001) and a third of patients reduced usage of anti-diabetic medications. It is important to note, however, that this is a short-term (15-week) intervention and does not aim to induce nutritional ketosis.

### Impact of carbohydrate counting error on glycemic control in open-loop management of type 1 diabetes: quantitative assessment through an in silico trial [^bf4ae3d5]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

In the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D), systematic and random errors in carb-counting can have an adverse effect on glycemic control. In this study, we performed an in silico trial aiming at quantifying the impact of different levels of carb-counting error on glycemic control.

Methods:

The T1D patient decision simulator was used to simulate 7-day glycemic profiles of 100 adults using open-loop therapy. The simulation was repeated for different values of systematic and random carb-counting errors, generated with Gaussian distribution varying the error mean from -10% to +10% and standard deviation (SD) from 0% to 50%. The effect of the error was evaluated by computing the difference of time inside (∆TIR), above (∆TAR) and below (∆TBR) the target glycemic range (70-180mg/dl) compared to the reference case, that is, absence of error. Finally, 3 linear regression models were developed to mathematically describe how error mean and SD variations result in ∆TIR, ∆TAR, and ∆TBR changes.

Results:

Random errors globally deteriorate the glycemic control; systematic underestimations lead to, on average, up to 5.2% more TAR than the reference case, while systematic overestimation results in up to 0.8% more TBR. The different time in range metrics were linearly related with error mean and SD (R 2 > 0.95), with slopes of, for ∆TIR, for ∆TAR, and, for ∆TBR.

Conclusions:

The quantification of carb-counting error impact performed in this work may be useful understanding causes of glycemic variability and the impact of possible therapy adjustments or behavior changes in different glucose metrics.

### A practical guide to delivering nutritional advice to people with diabetes [^27f6d8c3]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Dietary advice is fundamental to the management of diabetes. Although ideally such advice should be delivered by a state-registered dietitian, it is more usually delivered by other health professionals. The primary focus for those with type 1 diabetes is carbohydrate counting and insulin adjustment and for the majority of people with type 2 diabetes, weight management is key. Patient-centred care is emphasised for the delivery of dietary advice. It is widely recognised that knowledge alone is not sufficient to induce behaviour change and practical approaches to a variety of behavioural interventions are discussed.

### Impact of carbohydrate counting error on glycemic control in open-loop management of type 1 diabetes: quantitative assessment through an in silico trial [^cadba165]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

Carb-counting error generation

In the generated multi-meal scenario, 2 components of the carb-counting error were investigated: the systematic error and the random error. For this reason, the signed relative error, expressed as percentage of the CHO amount in the meal, was generated by using a Gaussian distribution:

where the mean M accounts for the systematic error committed by the subject, while the standard deviation SD reflects the random error.

Different signs and magnitudes of error were tested by using different mean and standard deviation values. In particular, we tested mean values of ± 10%, ± 5%, and 0%, where a negative error sign meant meal CHO underestimation, while a positive sign indicated meal CHO overestimation. For each of the mean values, we tested different values of the standard deviation, which were 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%. Such values of error parameters have been suggested by the analysis of real data published by Brazeau et al, in which the error mean for the 50 subjects involved in the study (expressed as mean ± standard deviation) was −7.64% ± 10.18%, while the subjects error standard deviation was 18.10% ± 9.19%.

Moreover, each of the Gaussian distributions was truncated at −100%, which means a CHO estimate of 0g, and +100%, which means a CHO estimate of twice the real meal amount, in order to avoid unrealistic realizations of the carb-counting error.

The case of 0% mean, accounting for the absence of systematic error, and 0% standard deviation, which means that no random error is present, was considered as the reference value:

Glucose metrics

From the 100 subjects' glycemic profiles obtained, the following metrics were computed: Time In target Range (TIR), that is, the percentage of BG values between 70 and 180mg/dl; Time Above Range (TAR), that is, the percentage of BG values greater than 180mg/dl; Time Below Range (TBR), that is, the percentage of BG values lower than 70mg/dl.

Moreover, the delta time in ranges compared to the reference case, that is, ∆, ∆and ∆, were also computed. For example, the ∆when the carb-counting error mean M is equal to m and the carb-counting error standard deviation SD is equal to sd was defined as:

Methods

Single-Meal Analysis

Simulation scenario

The T1D-PDShas been used to simulate a population of 100 virtual adults undergoing multiple single-meal scenarios in a disturbance-free environment in which the meal insulin dose is calculated using the CGM value at mealtime, the therapy parameters (basal insulin injection rate in the pump, carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio CR, correction factor CF) are set to their optimal value, post-prandial correction boluses and hypo-treatments as well as the time-variability of insulin sensitivity are switched-off.

In each single-meal scenario, for each virtual subject, the simulation starts at 6:00, a meal with 60g of CHO is generated at 8:00, and the respective meal insulin bolus dose is calculated as:

The carb-count, is defined as a perturbation of the true CHO amount:

whererepresents the signed relative carb-counting error. Different values forare tested, as described in the following section, while maintaining the same surrounding conditions. In the 2hours before the meal, BG levels, expressed as mean ± standard deviation, are 119.59 ± 6.68mg/dl.

This kind of scenario permits us to focus on the impact that the carb-counting error has on the post-prandial glucose control, eliminating any confounding factors.

Carb-counting error generation

In each simulation, a fixed value of the carb-counting error is simulated, equal for all the subjects. Based on the analysis of real data published in Brazeau et al, we tested values of the signed relative errorequal to ± 50%, ± 40%, ± 30%, ± 20%, ± 10% and 0%, which, for the meal of 60g considered, correspond to signed absolute errors of ± 30g, ± 24g, ± 18g, ± 12g, ± 6g, and 0g, respectively.

The absence of carb-counting error, that is, when the carb-count is exactly equal to the real meal CHO amount, represents the reference case for the problem under study.

Figure 4.
Bidimensional maps of the mean among the 100 virtual subjects of ΔTIR (at left), ΔTAR (in the middle) and ΔTBR (at right), for all combinations of carb-counting error mean and SD tested. In each map, the x-axis represents error SD, while the y-axis the error mean. Each color represents a different quantitative value of the metric, reported by the legends on the right of each map.

The mean among the 100 virtual subjects of the delta time in ranges is plotted in Figure 5 for different values of carb-counting error mean (panels A, B, and C) and SD (panels D, E, and F). Looking at the plots of Figure 5, we notice that while the starting point of each curve is different, depending either on the error mean or on its standard deviation, the plots present a similar linear trend, with a different rate of change for the different time in ranges.

Figure 5.
Plot of the mean difference in time in ranges among the 100 virtual subjects. The mean of ∆TIR, ∆TAR and ∆TBR by varying the carb-counting error SD and for different carb-counting error mean values is reported in panels A, B, and C, respectively (figures legend is reported in panel A). The mean of ∆TIR, ∆TAR, and ∆TBR by varying the carb-counting error mean and for different carb-counting error SD values is reported in panels D, E, and F, respectively (figures legend is reported in panel D).

This suggests that the use of a linear technique to model the relationship which links the carb-counting error mean M and standard deviation SD to variations of time in ranges may be appropriate.

### Sugars and starch in the nutritional management of diabetes mellitus [^ff57f03a]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Nutritional recommendations, long recognized as an important aspect of diabetes mellitus treatment, have also been an area of persistent controversy, particularly regarding the proportions and types of carbohydrate and fat. This review addresses the role of sugars within medical nutrition therapy for diabetes mellitus. Nutritional recommendations for diabetes mellitus treatment were revised recently. The new guidelines do not specifically restrict intake of sugars, although general recommendations are made for including fiber, whole grains, vegetables, and fruits within dietary selections containing starches. For carbohydrates, the principle focus is on overall caloric amounts. In type 1 diabetes the most effective approach to the control of postprandial hyperglycemia continues to be adjustment of premeal doses of insulin on the basis of carbohydrate counting. In type 2 diabetes, in addition to a focus on caloric content of carbohydrate, consideration continues to be given to the role of the glycemic index as a determinant of postprandial hyperglycemia and overall metabolic control. Nevertheless, consensus recommendations do not support widespread use of the glycemic index. An area of some change is a more clear endorsement of including monounsaturated fatty acids. Current recommendations are that monounsaturated fatty acids and carbohydrates combined should provide 60–70% of daily energy intake, with individual flexibility in the respective proportions, whereas intake of saturated fats is limited to < 10% of energy intake. This new emphasis reflects greater awareness of the importance of responding to individual and cultural dietary preferences and the need to address treatment of both hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in diabetes mellitus.

### Discovering successful strategies for diabetic self-management: a qualitative comparative study [^29a8bd6b]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Patients in poor control tended to skip medications and not monitor sodium. While non-adherence is associated with poorer control, it is often linked to cost or complexity in dosingand not necessarily to simple forgetting, although the rate of forgetting may be high among those in poor control. Patients may purposefully reduce their dosage, but many may simply forget or misunderstand dosages. Helping patients take medications correctly includes asking how they currently take their medications, explaining key information, and describing daily reminder options. Pill boxes tended to be used by those in good control to remember their medications and these might be offered to all patients to remember their pills. Poor control patients also might benefit most from diabetes education classes. Diabetes education is an ongoing process to facilitate self-care; reassessments and referrals can occur at diagnosis, but also during annual evaluations of needs and transitions in care or with the development of complications. Also, since many patients were unclear on what A1C was, point-of-care testing with direct rather than delayed feedback might facilitate better understanding of the A1C measure. Incorporation of SMBG may help patients link dietary intake with blood glucose, providing valuable feedback for patients who do not normally monitor their blood glucose.

Patients in fair control described more elaborate dietary strategies for diabetes management than either good or poor control groups. Patients in fair control talked about having changed their diet because of diabetes. QCA results suggested an interplay between the themes of monitoring dietary sodium and making dietary changes. Those in fair or poor control were more likely to report that they changed their diet in general for diabetes, while those in better control tended to report specifically that they monitored their sodium intake. Those in fair control also described cheating behaviors, eating only a little candy/cake or limiting carbs all day in anticipation of a heavy carb night-time meal. A limitation of interviews done at only one point in time, however, is that it is impossible to see if these strategies have successfully moved these patients from poor to fair control, or if these strategies have kept these patients from being in good control. This group appears to spend more effort negotiating dietary issues and only tests their glucose once a day. While the glycemic index of foodsmay affect A1C, patients might be encouraged to test two times a day to learn whether their dietary strategies are working.

### Can children with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers estimate the carbohydrate content of meals and snacks? [^305d682a]. Diabetic Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Carbohydrate (CHO) counting allows children with Type 1 diabetes to adjust mealtime insulin dose to carbohydrate intake. Little is known about the ability of children to count CHO and whether a particular method for assessing CHO quantity is better than others. We investigated how accurately children and their caregivers estimate carbohydrate, and whether counting in gram increments improves accuracy compared with CHO portions or exchanges.

Methods

One hundred and two children and adolescents (age range 8.3–18.1 years) on intensive insulin therapy and 110 caregivers independently estimated the CHO content of 17 standardized meals (containing 8–90 g CHO), using whichever method of carbohydrate quantification they had been taught (gram increments, 10-g portions or 15-g exchanges).

Results

Seventy-three per cent (n = 2530) of all estimates were within 10–15 g of actual CHO content. There was no relationship between the mean percentage error and method of carbohydrate counting or glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) (P > 0.05). Mean gram error and meal size were negatively correlated (r = -0.70, P < 0.0001). The longer children had been CHO counting the greater the mean percentage error (r = 0.173, P = 0.014). Core foods in non-standard quantities were most frequently inaccurately estimated, while individually labelled foods were most often accurately estimated.

Conclusions

Children with Type 1 diabetes and their caregivers can estimate the carbohydrate content of meals with reasonable accuracy. Teaching CHO counting in gram increments did not improve accuracy compared with CHO portions or exchanges. Large meals tended to be underestimated and snacks overestimated. Repeated age-appropriate education appears necessary to maintain accuracy in carbohydrate estimations.

### Adjust to target in type 2 diabetes: comparison of a simple algorithm with carbohydrate counting for adjustment of mealtime insulin glulisine [^ac91cd34]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Changes in insulin doses

At baseline, the mean insulin glulisine, insulin glargine, and total insulin doses were 53.9, 53.9, and 107.8 units (simple algorithm) and 50.5, 50.5, and 100.9 units (carb count), respectively. At week 24, the adjusted mean insulin glulisine (P = 0.0011), insulin glargine (P < 0.0001), and total insulin doses (P = 0.0002) were significantly higher in simple algorithm than in carb count group patients (108.7, 102.5, and 207.4 units vs. 88.9, 86.4, and 175.5 units, respectively). At 24 weeks, the total insulin dose was 1.9 units/kg (simple algorithm group) and 1.7 units/kg (carb count group) (see Table 3 of the online appendix available at).

Lipids

Adjusted mean total cholesterol decreased slightly in both groups from baseline to week 24. A significant decrease was observed only for week 12 among the carb count group patients: from 175.0 to 168.5 mg/dl (−8.35 mg/dl; P < 0.01). Neither HDL nor LDL cholesterol changed significantly from baseline to week 24 in either group; no between-group differences were observed at week 12 or 24. Triglycerides decreased significantly from baseline to week 12 in both the carb count (144.0 to 128.5 mg/dl) and simple algorithm (164.7 to 148.3 mg/dl) groups (−18.27 mg/dl, P < 0.0001 and −15.14 mg/dl, P < 0.004, respectively). There was also a significant reduction in triglycerides from baseline to week 24 in the carb count (144.0 to 133.0 mg/dl) group but not in the simple algorithm (164.7 to 153.4 mg/dl) group (−13.19 mg/dl, P = 0.008 and −8.19 mg/dl P = 0.170, respectively).

### Insights from a general practice service evaluation supporting a lower carbohydrate diet in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and prediabetes: a secondary analysis of routine clinic data including HbA1c, weight and prescribing over 6 years [^f0cfe7c9]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

For several years, a 'low-carbohydrate diet' has generally been accepted to be one containing less than 130 g of carbohydrate per day. But in routine care, it may not be realistic for patients to count grams of carbohydrate on a regular basis. Our data suggest a more simple and practical approach to lowering dietary carbohydrate can be associated with significant improvements in HbA1c, weight, lipid profiles and BP without the need for precise daily carbohydrate or calorie counting. Patients appear to have benefited from having received clear and simplified explanations of how sugar and carbohydrates affect blood glucose levels and how to recognise foods with high glycaemic loads, as illustrated by infographics (figure 2), in addition to individualised follow-up and multidisciplinary group sessions. In clinical practice, avoiding in-depth discussions around portion sizes and carbohydrate counting has been patient friendly and time efficient.

Glucose control metrics

In the time window from mealtime (8:00) to 6hours after (14:00), the following glucose control metrics were computed: the BG post-prandial peak, the time from meal in which such peak occurs, the BG level at 120minutes after the meal, the area under the glycemic curve in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

Moreover, for each of these metrics, their difference compared to the reference case (ie, and) were also calculated. For example, thefor a signed relative carb-counting error δ equal to δ', was defined as:

Sensitivity to carb-counting error on post-prandial glucose

The effect of different levels of the error on post-prandial glucose was evaluated via graphical representation of the glycemic profiles of a representative virtual subject and by looking at the distribution of the glucose control metrics in the 100 subjects with a boxplot representation.

Multi-Meal Analysis

Simulation scenario

After evaluating the impact of the carb-counting error on a single meal, disturbance-free environment, we generated a more complex and realistic scenario, by simulating the same population of 100 virtual subjects for 7days, with 3 meals per day (ie, breakfast, lunch and dinner) and open-loop therapy based on non-adjunctive CGM use. The scenario included the use of sub-optimal therapy parameters, post-prandial correction boluses, hypo-treatments, and intra-patient variability of insulin sensitivity. Meal amounts were randomly generated from Gaussian distributions fitted on the real data extracted from Brazeau et al.

The entire simulation was repeated for different values of the carb-counting error, while maintaining the same surrounding conditions.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — medical nutrition therapy for pregestational diabetes mellitus indicates that medical nutrition therapy with a carbohydrate-controlled diet is important and, when possible, involvement of a registered dietitian or certified diabetes educator is beneficial. Caloric requirements are increased by approximately an additional 300 kcal/day during the second and third trimesters, and wholesome food choices including 40–50% from complex, high-fiber carbohydrates, 15–30% from protein, and 20–35% from primarily unsaturated fats are commonly advised. Typical carbohydrate allocation ranges might be 30–45 g at breakfast, 45–60 g at lunch and dinner, and 15-g snacks approximately 2–3 hours after each meal. It is thought that artificial sweeteners may be safely used in moderate amounts in pregnancy, though there are no large cohort or case–control studies to support this, and patients should be encouraged to keep a log of food intake with specific carbohydrate counts.

As several children further pointed out, by using labels from packets to calculate carbohydrates in meals/snacks, and having access to a bolus advisor, they were able to assume responsibility for calculating insulin doses in instances where they did not want their parents to be involved:

" there's like carbs on the food that I eat, like on the packet. So I just look at that and then I put that into my [blood glucose] monitor, and then I keep adding all of that up. And then, say 40 grammes add to 15, that would be like 55. Then I put that into my monitor and that would be possibly 6.5 or 6 units". (006, aged 11).

While children struggled to count carbohydrates in meals made from multiple ingredients, several of those who used bolus advisors described how they were able to calculate their own insulin doses because their parents provided them with the total value of carbohydrate in their meals. For example, 018 (aged 11) described how for meals eaten at home, her mother "would tell me the grammes and my [blood glucose/bolus advisor] machine tells me how many units I've to get". Similarly, children discussed the benefits of parents providing them with a note containing the carbohydrate values of individual food items or the total count in their school lunch:

" my mum has like – she's got it on a bit of paper. And she sticks it on to my, well like my play piece [lunch box]. And then that's how I know my carbs at school" (020, aged 9).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^b5ac7ad7]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD type 2 diabetes mellitus — carbohydrate intake for diabetes management: For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, we suggest a nutrition intervention strategy providing 13–50% of their total daily caloric intake from carbohydrates for diabetes management. The overall strength of evidence is weak, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, and it is categorized as Reviewed, New-replaced. The benefits of reducing carbohydrate energy intake to 13–50% to improve HbA1c, glucose, BMI, and HOMA-IR outweighed the potential harm of infrequent hypoglycemia or very rare unrelated dyspnea, and weight loss appears to improve when dietary carbohydrate is limited.

Changes in dietary patterns

During 0–6 m (n = 242), changes in 'carb/fat balance' dietary pattern scores indicated movement towards intakes slightly higher in carbohydrates and lower in fats (mean change: 0.12, SD 0.78) (see Fig. 3). In the same period, changes in 'obesogenic' dietary pattern scores indicated dietary intakes became less energy-dense, lower-fat and higher-fibre (− 0.24, SD 0.94). During 6–12 m (n = 194), dietary patterns reverted back towards intakes lower in carbohydrates and higher in fats (− 0.13, SD 0.81), and to a lesser degree, intakes that were more energy-dense, higher-fat and lower-fibre (0.11, SD 0.96).

Participants who changed their dietary patterns most over 0–6 m had greater reductions in TEI, bodyweight and HbA1c, greater increases in total physical activity and daily minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity, a higher baseline IMD and were taking more OHA medications (Additional file 1: Table S5-S6). Those who made the greatest change in 'carb/fat balance' dietary pattern score (Additional file 1: Table S5 quintile 5) made slightly greater changes in total carbohydrate, fat and SFA intakes than those who made the greatest change in 'obesogenic' dietary pattern score during 0–6 m (Additional file 1: Table S5 quintile 1). Average total carbohydrate, fat and SFA intake in the former at baseline were 41.9%TEI, 36.9%TEI and 12.6%TEI respectively, changing to 49.2%TEI, 32.3%TEI and 10.1%TEI respectively by 6 months.

### Low carbohydrate diets and type 2 diabetes: what is the latest evidence? [^e98ce673]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Low carbohydrate diets are again in the spotlight and have been identified as particularly appropriate for people with type 2 diabetes. There is confusion amongst both health professionals and people with diabetes about the suitability of these diets. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest evidence and to explore the role of low carbohydrate diets for people with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

An electronic search of English language articles was performed using MEDLINE (2010–May 2015), EMBASE (2010–May 2015), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2010–May 2015). Only randomized controlled trials comparing interventions evaluating reduced carbohydrate intake with higher carbohydrate intake in people with diagnosed type 2 diabetes were included. Primary outcomes included weight, glycated hemoglobin, and lipid concentrations.

Results

Low carbohydrate diets in people with type 2 diabetes were effective for short-term improvements in glycemic control, weight loss, and cardiovascular risk, but this was not sustained over the longer term. Overall, low carbohydrate diets failed to show superiority over higher carbohydrate intakes for any of the measures evaluated including weight loss, glycemic control, lipid concentrations, blood pressure, and compliance with treatment.

Conclusion

Recent studies suggest that low carbohydrate diets appear to be safe and effective over the short term, but show no statistical differences from control diets with higher carbohydrate content and cannot be recommended as the default treatment for people with type 2 diabetes.

Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and meal planning for diabetes mellitus (DM) — plans should be individualized to treatment and lifestyle, with carbohydrate intake aligned to insulin dosing, and delivered with clear education. There should be consistency in day-to-day carbohydrate intake for persons treated with fixed-dose insulin regimens, or adjustments of insulin doses to meals that vary in carbohydrate content (eg, use of carbohydrate counting). The timing of meals and distribution of ingested calories through the day should be individualized with reference to medical therapy and physical activity and to avoid hypoglycemia. A physician and/or an RDN should discuss meal plan recommendations in plain language with persons at the initial visit after DM diagnosis and then periodically during follow-up outpatient visits, and education should include specific foods/meal planning, grocery shopping, dining-out strategies, and diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) to build understanding of macronutrients and nutrition labels.

Conclusions

In the context of controversies around how the scientific evidence base for dietary intervention can be interpreted and applied, this study provides important experience-based evidence on a topical dietary intervention. Low-carb practitioners strongly advocated for the use of low-carb diets in the management of people with type 2 diabetes and related metabolic conditions. The successes described draw attention to the need for pragmatic, formative evaluation of low-carb as a 'complex intervention' (alongside physiological research), to justify, challenge and/or shape low-carb intervention in clinical practice. Social science analyses would elucidate how this intervention is carried out across different healthcare settings (eg, dietetics, endocrinology) and patient groups, how healthcare practices intersect with people's everyday self-management and how different forms of evidence are invoked and prioritised.

### Evaluation of taste perception and olfactory function in adolescents in relation to the duration of type 1 diabetes [^c8052055]. Pediatric Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

4. Discussion

A healthy lifestyle is important for children with T1D to maintain health, prevent cardiovascular disease, and control blood glucose levels. A healthy lifestyle primarily involves eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise. Tracking carbohydrate intake, either through carb counting or estimation based on experience, is key to achieving optimal blood sugar levels. Taste and smell sensitivity play a major role in food acceptance. However, how this relates to people's final food choices is still debatable. Moreover, there is growing interest in understanding taste perception's role in satiety, energy balance, and long-term health. Taste dysfunction in diabetes can hinder dietary adherence, leading to negative effects on glycemic control. The number of studies on taste sensitivity in individuals with T1D is limited. To date, the majority of research on this topic has focused on adult populations. For adults, especially after the age of 60, there is a decline in taste and smell function as part of the normal aging process. In the case of diabetic patients, the taste may also change as a consequence of possible disease-related complications. However, it should be noted that some information regarding sensory sensitivity and T2D may not be fully applicable to T1D. Catamo et al. reported that the incidence of taste and smell ID disorders was higher in T2D patients compared to healthy controls, and a possible relationship with glycemic levels emerged. The development of taste impairment in T2D has also been related to both microvascular and macrovascular issues caused by the disease. Yazla et al. confirm that T2D is associated with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions. The fact that there was no difference between diabetic patients with and without DPN suggests central neuropathy. Hyperglycemia and its association with microvascular complications such as polyneuropathy may be one of the factors that may affect taste disorders in diabetes. There are also reports in which people with diabetes without polyneuropathy, taste impairment was also revealed. The taste dysfunction seen in T1D could also be caused by inflammation of the oral mucosa or decreased salivation.

### Is glycaemic control associated with dietary patterns independent of weight change in people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes? Prospective analysis of the early-ACTivity-in-diabetes trial [^dbc040f7]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether diet affects glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D), over and above its effects on bodyweight. We aimed to assess whether changes in dietary patterns altered glycaemic control independently of effects on bodyweight in newly diagnosed T2D.

Methods

We used data from 4-day food diaries, HbA1c and potential confounders in participants of the Early-ACTivity-In-Diabetes trial measured at 0, 6 and 12months. At baseline, a 'carb/fat balance' dietary pattern and an 'obesogenic' dietary pattern were derived using reduced-rank regression, based on hypothesised nutrient-mediated mechanisms linking dietary intake to glycaemia directly or via obesity. Relationships between 0 and 6month change in dietary pattern scores and baseline-adjusted HbA1c at 6months (n = 242; primary outcome) were assessed using multivariable linear regression. Models were repeated for periods 6-12months and 0-12months (n = 194 and n = 214 respectively; secondary outcomes).

Results

Reductions over 0-6months were observed in mean bodyweight (-2.3 (95% CI: -2.7, -1.8) kg), body mass index (-0.8 (-0.9, -0.6) kg/m 2), energy intake (-788 (-953, -624) kJ/day), and HbA1c (-1.6 (-2.6, -0.6) mmol/mol). Weight loss strongly associated with lower HbA1c at 0-6months (β = -0.70 [95% CI -0.95, -0.45] mmol/mol/kg lost). Average fat and carbohydrate intakes changed to be more in-line with UK healthy eating guidelines between 0 and 6months. Dietary patterns shifting carbohydrate intakes higher and fat intakes lower were characterised by greater consumption of fresh fruit, low-fat milk and boiled/baked potatoes and eating less of higher-fat processed meats, butter/animal fats and red meat. Increases in standardised 'carb/fat balance' dietary pattern score associated with improvements in HbA1c at 6 months independent of weight loss (β = -1.54 [-2.96, -0.13] mmol/mol/SD). No evidence of association with HbA1c was found for this dietary pattern at other time-periods. Decreases in 'obesogenic' dietary pattern score were associated with weight loss (β = -0.77 [-1.31, -0.23] kg/SD) but not independently with HbA1c during any period.

Conclusions

Promoting weight loss should remain the primary nutritional strategy for improving glycaemic control in early T2D. However, improving dietary patterns to bring carbohydrate and fat intakes closer to UK guidelines may provide small, additional improvements in glycaemic control.

### Adjust to target in type 2 diabetes: comparison of a simple algorithm with carbohydrate counting for adjustment of mealtime insulin glulisine [^c236af6e]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE — Carbohydrate counting is an effective approach to mealtime insulin adjustment in type 1 diabetes but has not been rigorously assessed in type 2 diabetes. We sought to compare an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio with a simple algorithm for adjusting the dose of prandial insulin glusiline.

RESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODS — This 24-week, multicenter, randomized, controlled study compared two algorithms for adjusting mealtime (glulisine) insulin along with a standard algorithm for adjusting background (glargine) insulin in 273 intent-to-treat patients with type 2 diabetes. Glulisine and glargine were adjusted weekly in both groups based on self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) results from the previous week. The simple algorithm group was provided set doses of glulisine to take before each meal. The carbohydrate counting (carb count) group was provided an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio to use for each meal and adjusted their glulisine dose based on the amount of carbohydrate consumed.

RESULTS — A1C levels at week 24 were 6.70% (simple algorithm) and 6.54% (carb count). The respective mean A1C changes from baseline to 24 weeks were −1.46 and −1.59% (P = 0.24). A1C < 7.0% was achieved by 73.2% (simple algorithm) and 69.2% (carb count) (P = 0.70) of subjects; respective values for A1C < 6.5% were 44.3 and 49.5% (P = 0.28). The total daily dose of insulin was lower, and there was a trend toward less weight gain in carb count group patients. Severe hypoglycemia rates were low and equal in the two groups.

CONCLUSIONS — Weekly basal-bolus insulin adjustments based on premeal and bedtime glucose patterns resulted in significant reductions in A1C. Having two effective approaches to delivering and adjusting rapid-acting mealtime insulin may increase physicians' and patients' willingness to advance therapy to a basal-bolus insulin regimen.

### Prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate effectiveness of registered dietitian-led diabetes management on glycemic and diet control in a primary care setting in Taiwan [^5fac6d33]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Dietary intake

In participants with A1C ≥ 7%, the intervention group had a mean decrease in energy intake of 229 ± 309.16 kcal/day, whereas the control group had a mean increase of 56.10 ± 309.41 kcal/day (P < 0.001). Over the 12-month period, there was a decrease in energy intake including overall reduction in absolute amounts (grams) of carbohydrates, fat, and protein in the intervention group (Table 3). Although the energy percent values of carbohydrate, fat, and protein at baseline and at the 1-year intervention were similar for both groups, the intervention group had significantly greater net reductions in saturated fat than the control group (−0.98 ± 3.40 vs. +0.60 ± 2.93, P = 0.01) (Table 3). In addition, there was a significant reduction in energy (kilocalories per day) and fat (grams per day) intake in those with A1C < 7% compared with that in control subjects (data not shown).

Macronutrient intake and glycemic control

Our univariate analysis showed a correlation between changes in A1C and baseline BMI, baseline A1C, and changes in energy intake at per 100 kcal/day (β = 0.200, SEM = 0.041, P < 0.001) and carbohydrate intake at per 15 g/day (β = 0.167, SEM = 0.029, P < 0.001) in the intervention group with baseline A1C ≥ 7% (Table 4). After adjustment for age, sex, duration of diabetes, baseline BMI, and baseline A1C, we found an association between a 15-g increase in carbohydrate (one carbohydrate counting) intake and a 0.1% increase in A1C (SEM = 0.033, P = 0.004) but not in overall energy intake (β = 0.04, SEM = 0.04, P = 0.310) (Table 4).

### Type 1 diabetes through the life span: a position statement of the American diabetes association [^4333f905]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Nutrition Therapy

Nutrition therapy is an important component of the treatment plan for all individuals with type 1 diabetes. Each patient should have an individualized food plan based on food preferences, schedule, and physical activity. Nutrition therapy aims to ensure that the patient and family understand the impact food has on blood glucose, how food interacts with exercise and insulin to prevent hypo- and hyperglycemia and to achieve glucose goals, and how to implement the food plan in a variety of situations. The food plan takes into consideration the patient's numeracy, literacy, engagement, and ability to adjust insulin.

General diabetes nutrition principles, as defined in the ADA Standards of Care, apply to people with type 1 diabetes, particularly in reference to normal growth and development in youth and the maintenance of a healthy body weight at all ages. Specifically, with regards to individuals with type 1 diabetes, topics such as carbohydrate counting and meal composition should be addressed. For selected individuals who have mastered carbohydrate counting, education on the impact of protein and fat on glycemic excursions should be incorporated into diabetes management. Those who are overweight or obese may benefit from weight reduction counseling.

Recommendations

Individualized medical nutrition therapy is recommended for all people with type 1 diabetes as an effective component of the overall treatment plan. (A)
Monitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, remains a key strategy in achieving glycemic control. (B)
If adults with type 1 diabetes choose to drink alcohol, they should be advised to do so in moderation (one drink per day or less for adult women and two drinks per day or less for adult men). Discussion with a health care provider is advised to explore potential interactions with medications. Adults should be advised that alcohol can lower blood glucose levels and that driving after drinking alcohol is contraindicated. (E)

### Effects of carbohydrate counting on glucose control and quality of life over 24 weeks in adult patients with type 1 diabetes on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: a randomized, prospective clinical trial (GIOCAR) [^c997a3e8]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The GIOCAR (contegGIO-CARboidrati) was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial with a duration of 24 weeks. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (no. NCT01173991). After having received detailed information about the study and before any study procedure, participants signed a written informed consent.

We recruited adult patients with type 1 diabetes treated with CSII and followed at the CSII Outpatient Clinic of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan. We included patients with type 1 diabetes, aged 18–65 years, who had been treated with CSII for > 3 months. Exclusion criteria were serum creatinine > 124 μmol/L in women and > 150 μmol/L in men, previous training in carbohydrate counting, celiac disease, pregnancy, severe comorbidities, and any disability preventing compliance with study procedures. Three diabetologists with experience in managing patients on CSII and trained in carbohydrate counting and one dietitian certified in carbohydrate counting conducted the study. We used the Complete Guide to Carb Counting (2nd ed.) as a reference for carbohydrate counting. Learning carbohydrate counting involves several steps. The first step is keeping a food diary: complete food records include day of the week, meal time, amounts of food, carbohydrate grams for each food, total carbohydrate grams for the meal or snack, preprandial and postprandial (2 h after the start of the meal) blood glucose, short-acting insulin dose, and physical activity. The I:CHO tells how much insulin is needed to "cover" the amount of carbohydrates eaten and bring blood glucose level back to pre-meal target. This ratio is calculated on the basis of individual recorded diary data by dividing the total grams of carbohydrates of a meal by the number of units of short-acting insulin that were able to hold post-meal glucose excursions within 1.6 mmol/L. The sensitivity factor or correction factor is calculated by dividing 1,800 by the total daily insulin requirement and corresponds to the glucose lowering obtained with one unit of short-acting insulin. By combining the I:CHO and sensitivity factor, patients are instructed to estimate the preprandial insulin dose, taking into consideration preprandial blood glucose and the amount of carbohydrates they plan to eat.

### Adjust to target in type 2 diabetes: comparison of a simple algorithm with carbohydrate counting for adjustment of mealtime insulin glulisine [^fd05db5b]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Carbohydrate counting is an effective approach to mealtime insulin adjustment in type 1 diabetes but has not been rigorously assessed in type 2 diabetes. We sought to compare an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio with a simple algorithm for adjusting the dose of prandial insulin glusiline.

Research and Design Methods

This 24-week, multicenter, randomized, controlled study compared two algorithms for adjusting mealtime (glulisine) insulin along with a standard algorithm for adjusting background (glargine) insulin in 273 intent-to-treat patients with type 2 diabetes. Glulisine and glargine were adjusted weekly in both groups based on self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) results from the previous week. The simple algorithm group was provided set doses of glulisine to take before each meal. The carbohydrate counting (carb count) group was provided an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio to use for each meal and adjusted their glulisine dose based on the amount of carbohydrate consumed.

Results

A1C levels at week 24 were 6.70% (simple algorithm) and 6.54% (carb count). The respective mean A1C changes from baseline to 24 weeks were -1.46 and -1.59% (P = 0.24). A1C < 7.0% was achieved by 73.2% (simple algorithm) and 69.2% (carb count) (P = 0.70) of subjects; respective values for A1C < 6.5% were 44.3 and 49.5% (P = 0.28). The total daily dose of insulin was lower, and there was a trend toward less weight gain in carb count group patients. Severe hypoglycemia rates were low and equal in the two groups.

Conclusions

Weekly basal-bolus insulin adjustments based on premeal and bedtime glucose patterns resulted in significant reductions in A1C. Having two effective approaches to delivering and adjusting rapid-acting mealtime insulin may increase physicians' and patients' willingness to advance therapy to a basal-bolus insulin regimen.

Type 1 diabetes — nutrition therapy recommendations include that individualized medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is recommended for youth with type 1 diabetes as an essential component of the overall treatment plan; monitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, is a key component to optimizing glycemic management; advise youth and caregivers to strive for an eating pattern emphasizing nonstarchy vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, fish and other lean protein, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and low-fat dairy products, and minimize consumption of red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, refined grains, and processed foods; meal composition impacts postprandial glucose excursions and education on the impact of high-fat and high-protein meals and the adjustment of insulin dosing is necessary; and strongly advise comprehensive nutrition education at diagnosis, and at least annually as needed, by an experienced registered dietitian nutritionist to assess the eating pattern in relation to weight status, age-appropriate growth, and cardiovascular disease risk factors.

### Adjust to target in type 2 diabetes: comparison of a simple algorithm with carbohydrate counting for adjustment of mealtime insulin glulisine [^147df4f0]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

In a recent study comparing three approaches to starting a single type of analog insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes (basal, biphasic premixed, and prandial), Holman et al. concluded that although each regimen improved glucose control, most patients were likely to need more than one type of insulin to achieve target glucose levels. The percentages of patients who achieved the target A1C of the study (< 6.5%) were 8.1% basal, 17.0% biphasic, and 23.9% prandial. Although one cannot directly compare insulin regimens from different study populations, it seems that diabetes in our study population would be more difficult to control because patients had a longer duration of diabetes and were more obese than subjects in the trial of Holman et al. In the study reported here, however, patients with type 2 diabetes using basal:bolus therapy achieved an A1C < 6.5% almost half of the time (simple algorithm 44.3% and carb count 49.5%).

Although basal-bolus insulin therapy can improve glycemic control in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the most effective use of SMBG for adjusting the basal-bolus insulin doses has not been clearly established. Some feel that postprandial monitoring is critical to establishing good glycemic control, whereas others are not convinced that postprandial testing is essential. In the present study, we showed that patients with type 2 diabetes using fasting and mealtime SMBG testing alone to monitor and adjust their rapid-acting and long-acting insulin analogs achieved excellent glucose control as measured by A1C, with minimal severe hypoglycemia.

The key elements of successful insulin therapy are optimizing glycemic control while minimizing hypoglycemia. Patients can learn to adjust mealtime insulin by either using a simple algorithm or learning to use insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios. Insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios allow flexibility in food choices and enable relatively precise matching of mealtime insulin needs but can seem complex and may be difficult for some patients to implement. We have shown that a standard mealtime insulin glulisine dose adjusted weekly on the basis of preprandial blood glucose patterns can achieve the same goals as a regimen that adjusts mealtime insulin based on insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios. It may be that our simple algorithm group patients either consumed fairly consistent amounts of carbohydrates, thus minimizing needed changes in insulin dosing, or learned to modify their carbohydrate intake based on SMBG measurements.

### How strong is the evidence base for carbohydrate restriction in the management of type 2 diabetes? [^97c8157e]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

See corresponding article on.

The article by Jayedi et al. in the current issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition brings new methodology and insight to a hotly debated area, namely, how to develop a dose response for carbohydrate reduction in type 2 diabetes management. Carbohydrate restriction in this setting is of course not new. Before insulin was available, the most common dietary treatment for diabetes mellitus was a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet. Even after the discovery and mass production of insulin, dietary carbohydrate remained restricted in the diet of people with diabetes. It was not until the late 1970s and early 1980s, with the life expectancy of people living with diabetes increasing, that avoidance of cardiovascular complications came to the forefront of the disease management. Dietary recommendations began to appear to reduce cardiovascular risk, which included reducing fat intake and increasing carbohydrates. This coincided with a philosophical change in diabetes therapy aimed at fitting therapy around lifestyle rather than the other way around.

Glycemic control has remained a major challenge in the management of type 2 diabetes. Over the past 18 y, there has been a steady rise in publications relating to the efficacy of low-carbohydrate diets in type 2 diabetes a number of narrative, systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the area, most of which suggest a positive effect on glycemic control and body weight. This accumulating evidence convinced the American Diabetes Association Standards of Care Committee in 2019 to make 2 consensus statements:

Reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia and may be applied in a variety of eating patterns that meet individual needs and preferences.
For select adults with type 2 diabetes not meeting glycemic targets or in whom reducing antiglycemic medications is a priority, reducing overall carbohydrate intake with low- or very low-carbohydrate eating plans is a viable approach.

Clinical priorities for nutrition management for all people with diabetes

A wide range of diabetes meal planning approaches or eating patterns have been shown to be clinically effective, with many including a reduced energy intake component. There is not one ideal percentage of calories from carbohydrates, protein, or fat that is optimal for all people with diabetes. Nutrition therapy goals should be developed collaboratively with the individual with diabetes and be based on an assessment of the individual's current eating patterns, preferences, and metabolic goals. Once a thorough assessment is completed, the health care professional's role is to facilitate behavior change and achievement of metabolic goals while meeting the patient's preferences, which may include allowing the patient to continue following his/her current eating pattern. If the individual would like to try a different eating pattern, this should also be supported by the health care team. Various behavior change theories and strategies can be used to tailor nutrition interventions to help the client achieve specific health and quality-of-life outcomes.

Multiple meal planning approaches and eating patterns can be effective for achieving metabolic goals. Examples include: carbohydrate counting, healthful food choices/simplified meal plans (i.e. the Plate Method), individualized meal planning methods based on percentages of macronutrients, exchange list for meal planning, glycemic index, and eating patterns including Mediterranean style, DASH, vegetarian or vegan, low carbohydrate, and low fat. The meal planning approach or eating pattern should be selected based on the individual's personal and cultural preferences; literacy and numeracy; and readiness, willingness, and ability to change. This may need to be adjusted over time based on changes in life circumstances, preferences, and disease course.

A summary of key topics for nutrition education can be found in Table 4.

### Low carbohydrate diets and type 2 diabetes: what is the latest evidence? [^0c3ac026]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

This review of recent studies evaluating the effects of low carbohydrate diets in people with type 2 diabetes supports previous meta-analyses showing that although there may be greater short-term improvements in glycemic control, weight loss, and CVD risk, this is not sustained over the longer-term. Many studies have attempted to determine the ideal macronutrient (protein, fat, and carbohydrate) intake for people with type 2 diabetes, and evidence to date is inconclusive. One of the best predictors of improved outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes is energy restriction and weight loss, and there are a variety of strategies by which this may be achieved, with no clear indication of the superiority of low carbohydrate diets. This is true for both those with type 2 diabetes and those without. Much of the positive effect of low carbohydrate diets is due to weight loss, and the effect independent of weight change is difficult to assess.

### Insights into the effective use of the smart MDI system: data from the first 1852 type 1 diabetes users [^3c7c6485]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Users can choose in the InPen app from three different meal therapy modes for calculating mealtime dose recommendations: Carb Counting, Meal Estimation, and Fixed Dose. With Carb Counting, insulin doses are based on the amount of carbohydrates reported to be in the meal. With Meal Estimation, insulin doses are based on the carbohydrate content size of the meal (low, medium, or high carb). With Fixed Dose, insulin doses are kept fixed per meal.

2.2 Data collection methods

A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted with real‐world data uploaded to the InPen database from October 2024 to January 2025 by Smart MDI System users with self reported T1D who provided consent for their data to be processed and aggregated to contribute to medical care quality improvement. The observation period was defined as between the first and last days with both an InPen insulin dose and CGM data. Users were included in the analysis only if they had a minimum of 10 days of InPen use and a minimum of 10 days of CGM data during the observation period.

User behaviours in terms of system features use and glycaemic outcome were assessed. A bolus reaction to an InPen alert was considered if an InPen bolus occurred in a 1‐h window from the alert. Glycaemic outcomes were also analysed across four groups according to the rate of alert response with a bolus (≤ 25%, > 25%– ≤ 50%, > 50%– ≤ 75%, and > 75%–100% of alerts reacted with a bolus response) and according to the time to bolus following alerts (per‐person average response time of ≤ 10 min, > 10‐ ≤ 20 min, 20‐ ≤ 30 min, and > 30–60 min from the alert).

2.3 Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics for continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviations (SD), or median and interquartile range (IQR) according to the data distribution. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages were reported. The magnitude and direction of linear relationships between continuous variables were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. A two‐tailed test was performed to test the null hypothesis of no correlation (ρ = 0). A significance level of α = 0.05 was used to reject the null hypothesis. Analysis was conducted in SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### Effect of the carbohydrate counting method on glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes [^bc17e511]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Average calorie intake observed during the three days of food record was higher than the average calorie intake proposed by the prescribed diet based on carbohydrate counting. There was a reduction in the carbohydrate percentage in food record when compared to the amount recommended in the prescribed diet. On the other hand, protein intake in food record surpassed the amount in the prescribed diet. The comparison between total calorie intake and the percentage of macronutrient distribution in the three days of food record with the values recommended by the prescribed diet are described in Table 3 and Figure 2.

### Effects of basic carbohydrate counting versus standard dietary care for glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (the BCC study): a randomised, controlled trial [^e6ca1540]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found that BCC as add-on to standard dietary care did not reduce HbA1c or glucose variability (MAGE) compared with standard dietary care in individuals with T2D. This aligns with findings from previous studies. Interestingly, participants in the BCC group demonstrated notable improvements in accurately estimating carbohydrates across a variety of foods in comparison with the standard care group. This positive outcome can be attributed to the practical educational approach employed, incorporating hands-on exercises for assessing carbohydrate content, portion control calculations, and visualization of commonly consumed serving sizes using real foods. Bowen et al.'s study, reinforces our results, highlighting the challenges individuals with T2D, especially those with lower numeracy skills, may face in applying carbohydrate counting efficiently. Other studies have also associated poor literacy and numeracy skills with attenuated skills in accurate portion-size estimation and understanding of nutrition labels. A noteworthy finding was the decline in estimation skills observed in both groups at the 6-month follow-up, underscoring the importance of ongoing dietary education and support for maintaining newly acquired skills and competencies. Our results, corroborating previous research, challenge the prevailing assumption that elevated carbohydrate counting skills alone can lead to substantial improvements in glycaemic control for individuals with T2D. This underscores the multifaceted nature of diabetes management, where factors beyond carbohydrate counting – including use of antidiabetic medication and other lifestyle modifications – contribute significantly to glycaemic outcomes. Consequently, adopting a more personalized approach becomes paramount. An example of a more refined precision nutrition strategy could be the utilization of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) as a behavioral tool for instant feedback on the impact of dietary modifications on glycaemic control. While the available evidence to support this approach is currently limited, it warrants additional investigation for its potential efficacy.

### The relationship between carbohydrate and the mealtime insulin dose in type 1 diabetes [^aebb4db0]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2015). Low credibility.

A primary focus of the nutritional management of type 1 diabetes has been on matching prandial insulin therapy with carbohydrate amount consumed. Different methods exist to quantify carbohydrate including counting in one gram increments, 10g portions or 15g exchanges. Clinicians have assumed that counting in one gram increments is necessary to precisely dose insulin and optimize postprandial control. Carbohydrate estimations in portions or exchanges have been thought of as inadequate because they may result in less precise matching of insulin dose to carbohydrate amount. However, studies examining the impact of errors in carbohydrate quantification on postprandial glycemia challenge this commonly held view. In addition it has been found that a single mealtime bolus of insulin can cover a range of carbohydrate intake without deterioration in postprandial control. Furthermore, limitations exist in the accuracy of the nutrition information panel on a food label. This article reviews the relationship between carbohydrate quantity and insulin dose, highlighting limitations in the evidence for a linear association. These insights have significant implications for patient education and mealtime insulin dose calculations.

### Evaluation of carbohydrate counting knowledge among individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus in Saudi arabia: a cross-sectional study [^f56e050c]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease with hyperglycaemia due to insulin deficiency resulting from the loss of pancreatic islet β-cells. Approximately 10% of all diabetes mellitus (DM) cases are T1DM, which can affect individuals of all ages but usually develops in children or young adults. The causes of T1DM remain unclear but are linked to genetic and environmental factors. Over the past 30 years, the incidence of T1DM has increased in Saudi Arabia (SA). In 2017, more than 35 000 children and adolescents in SA had T1DM, with the highest incidence of 3900 cases.

Poor glycaemic management among patients with T1DM can lead to acute hypoglycaemia and long-term macrovascular and microvascular complications. Nutrition therapy is associated with improved glycaemic outcomes. One of the nutritional approaches to T1DM emphasises the connection between the number of consumed carbohydrates and insulin dosage. Carbohydrate counting (CC) is a meal planning strategy that aids in tracking carbohydrate intake and prandial glycaemiaand facilitates flexible food selection without adversely affecting the metabolic outcomes of patients. It is becoming a more widely accepted method after being used as one of four meal-planning approaches with intensive insulin therapy in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial in the early 1990s. Consequently, many diabetes centres in SA currently consider intensive insulin therapy part of the routine management of T1DM. Therefore, nutrition education programmes were tailored to train dieticians in the use of CC as an education modality for patients with diabetes.

### Discovering successful strategies for diabetic self-management: a qualitative comparative study [^9e2cded0]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Objective

This project explored lifestyles of patients in good and poor control to identify naturally occurring practices and strategies that result in successful diabetes management.

Research Design and Methods

Semistructured interviews with adult patients with type 2 diabetes explored diet, food preparation, physical activity, medication use and glucose monitoring. Patients (n = 56) were classified into good (A1C < 7.0%), fair (7.0% < A1C < 8.0%) or poor (A1C > 8.0%) control groups and matched across groups on diabetes duration (± 5 years) and medication modality (none, oral, insulin ± oral) to control for non-lifestyle factors. A qualitative comparative analysis identified practices that distinguished glycemic groups.

Results

Good control patients were more likely to test their glucose two or more times a day and reduce their sodium intake, as well as increase fruits and vegetables and limit portion sizes, some attaining good control without exercise. Fair control patients discussed several dietary strategies including limiting sweets, drinking non-caloric beverages, reducing carbs, 'cheating' (eating only a few sweets/limiting carbs in one meal to have more in another meal) and tested their glucose once a day. Poor control patients were more likely to skip antidiabetic medications and not test their glucose.

Conclusions

Although clinical trials indicate most self-management practices have limited effectiveness over time, increased glucose monitoring is a valuable component in daily management. Research is needed on effectiveness of dietary strategies that emphasize sodium monitoring and allow some degree of cheating. Reoffering diabetes education classes and providing pill boxes as memory aids may help improve poor control.

### Facilitating positive health behaviors and well-being to improve health outcomes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^8e4c2d99]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes Care — Carbohydrate intake evidence indicates that the optimal amount of carbohydrate for people with diabetes is inconclusive, though monitoring carbohydrate intake is a key strategy for reaching glucose goals in type 1 and type 2 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes, low‑ and very‑low‑carbohydrate patterns have been found to reduce A1C and medication needs, and meta‑analyses report very low carbohydrate (< 26% total energy) is effective for short‑term (< 6 months) A1C reduction. A 2022 carefully designed 12‑week RCT feeding study found that a well‑formulated ketogenic diet (20–50 g/day) did not significantly improve A1C or LDL cholesterol compared with a low‑carbohydrate Mediterranean diet, and studies note challenges with long‑term sustainability, underscoring the importance of reassessing and individualizing meal plan guidance for those pursuing this approach.

### Supporting people to implement a reduced carbohydrate diet: a qualitative study in family practice [^84bf0797]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2021). High credibility.

Diverging from established dietary guidelines

Low-carb practitioners were convinced by the scientific evidence supporting low-carb as a first-line intervention, and felt under a moral obligation to share their knowledge about low-carb with patients. However, low-carb practitioners were concerned about tensions between low-carb and more established dietary interventions, which had become embedded in guidelines over the last 40 years. For this reason, some reported 'tiptoeing' when introducing low-carb into clinical practice, being careful about how they navigated healthy eating guidelines (No 3.01), and limiting low-carb advice to patients with type 2 diabetes and/or obesity, for whom the evidence was strongest (see table 3).

Tensions routinely emerged between the low-carb approach and established dietary guidelines such as the Eatwell Guide (No 3.01). For example, low-carb practitioners believed the Eatwell Guide undermined 'real-food' messages with pictures of breakfast cereals, bread, margarine and low-fat dairy products.

### Training of carbohydrate estimation for people with diabetes using mobile augmented reality [^b44c357d]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Imprecise carbohydrate counting as a measure to guide the treatment of diabetes may be a source of errors resulting in problems in glycemic control. Exact measurements can be tedious, leading most patients to estimate their carbohydrate intake. In the presented pilot study a smartphone application (BE(AR)), that guides the estimation of the amounts of carbohydrates, was used by a group of diabetic patients.

Methods

Eight adult patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 were recruited for the study. At the beginning of the study patients were introduced to BE(AR) in sessions lasting 45 minutes per patient. Patients redraw the real food in 3D on the smartphone screen. Based on a selected food type and the 3D form created using BE(AR) an estimation of carbohydrate content is calculated. Patients were supplied with the application on their personal smartphone or a loaner device and were instructed to use the application in real-world context during the study period. For evaluation purpose a test measuring carbohydrate estimation quality was designed and performed at the beginning and the end of the study.

Results

In 44% of the estimations performed at the end of the study the error reduced by at least 6 grams of carbohydrate. This improvement occurred albeit several problems with the usage of BE(AR) were reported.

Conclusions

Despite user interaction problems in this group of patients the provided intervention resulted in a reduction in the absolute error of carbohydrate estimation. Intervention with smartphone applications to assist carbohydrate counting apparently results in more accurate estimations.

### Prospective independent evaluation of the carbohydrate counting accuracy of two smartphone applications [^4f7004c5]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The latter statement suggests that carb counting is not the only factor associated with postprandial glucose control. It has been clearly demonstrated that meals with high lipid and/or high protein contents often result in uncontrolled and/or prolonged postprandial hyperglycemia, despite the use of a precise insulin:carb ratio and accurate carb counting. Ryan et al. investigated postprandial glucose excursion after different meals with the same macronutrient content and a standardized rapid-acting analog insulin dose. They found that postprandial glucose excursion was higher with high glycemic index meals, even when an accurate insulin/carb ratio was applied. Apart from these nutritional issues, the timing of rapid insulin injection also appears to be critical for optimal glucose control during the postprandial period; a lower postprandial glucose excursion is experienced when insulin injection is performed 20 min before meals compared to a postprandial injection or a "just before meal" injection. This finding has recently been confirmed for ultra-rapid lispro, with optimal postprandial glucose control being obtained using the preprandial injection.

The accuracy of carb counting will remain a hot topic for hybrid closed-loop users, as all of these systems require meal announcement. Several studies of single-hormone artificial pancreas systems have also demonstrated that inaccurate carb counting is associated with poorer postprandial glucose control.

To our knowledge, this is the first independent study to evaluate the accuracy of two carb counting smartphone applications. However, our study does have several limitations. The use of medical students in the role of mock patients does not allow the extrapolation of these results to how real patients would use these applications. Also, the study only assessed the accuracy of these two apps for lunch meals, not for breakfast or dinner, which may have different meal compositions. In addition, only hospital meals were analyzed, which likely does not reflect the diversity of meals that patients may consume in their daily lives. Further, each meal was only analyzed once by a single medical student, which did not allow intra- nor interindividual reproducibility assessment. Finally, this accuracy study may not predict patient acceptance, compliance, or persistence in the use of such applications, nor the potential metabolic benefit provided by their daily use.

### Effects of carbohydrate counting on glucose control and quality of life over 24 weeks in adult patients with type 1 diabetes on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: a randomized, prospective clinical trial (GIOCAR) [^bcea7705]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Nutritional management is a cornerstone in the management of diabetes, and monitoring of carbohydrate intake, a major determinant of postprandial blood glucose, is a key strategy for achieving good glucose control.

Some studies have examined the contribution of quantity and type (i.e. simple vs. complex) of carbohydrates in patients with type 1 diabetes and showed that the daily insulin requirement is indeed associated with the amount rather than the type of daily carbohydrate intake.

Over the years, a number of methods have been proposed to help patients with diabetes to quantify the carbohydrate content of a meal in real life, for example, exchange lists, portion/servings, grams, glycemic index, and insulin:carbohydrate ratio (I:CHO). Among these, the I:CHO is considered the most advanced counting technique, consisting of estimating the grams of carbohydrates in a meal and then calculating the pre-meal insulin dose based on this estimation and an insulin sensitivity measure. Carbohydrate counting was devised in the 1960s, but it has become widely used as part of intensive diabetes management after the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT).

Although carbohydrate counting is widely used by patients worldwide, few studies have validated its efficacy in type 1 diabetes, and none have validated its efficacy in adult patients receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). We designed the current study with the aim of testing the effect of carbohydrate counting on glucose control and quality of life over 24 weeks in adult patients with type 1 diabetes treated with CSII.

### Virtual reality meets diabetes [^66ab72c8]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

VR for treating or managing diabetes

For managing diabetes, VR can help in various scenarios. Virtual reality has a strong potential for positive impact on diabetes self-management, and it can help facilitate weight loss. Virtual reality could be particularly useful for managing diabetes for insulin-treated individuals in how to deal with common challenging situations such as physical activity and exercise, long airline flights or preparing for elective hospital procedures.

Virtual reality diabetes education has shown advantages in improving eating habitsand to facilitate weight loss.

By 2030, the use of VR for diabetes management is expected to expand to include improving eating habits, facilitating weight loss, increasing physical activity and other lifestyle changes.

When people are considering meals or diet, AR can help to identify the food's effect on blood sugar and the glycemic index of food. An AR food volume estimation was developed, using the user's smartphone to create a 3D volume estimation overlaid onto food, the AR system can provide nutrition information which is automatically computed using AI.

Augmented reality tools have been used to assess improvements in the accuracy of carbohydrate counting for people with T1D. This AR system has been combined with using a smartphone to log physical activities, blood glucose, and insulin. The AR system significantly improved carbohydrate counting accuracy. Some disadvantages for AR carb counting include complexity and time taken to draw foods, and AR carb counting was less effective for meals containing multiple mixed foods.

Augmented reality can also help diabetes in areas of encouraging exercise programs, foot maintenance, and capillary glucose measurement.

Augmented reality could be used to pinpoint where on the body insulin should be injected, and to also keep a log of where insulin was injected in the recent past to help avoid lipoatrophy. These are helpful features for both newly diagnosed diabetics and those caring for diabetic loved ones. Augmented reality could show patients how much insulin to inject to avoid an accidental overdose that is a common cause of potentially fatal hypoglycaemia.

Webcam consultations for diabeteshave reported success, and VR could be a possible tool to further enhance remote interaction between clinician and patient, including virtual health sessions with individuals or groups.

In other areas of health, VR treatments have been developed including: rehabilitation for walking gait or after stroke, physiotherapy for multiple sclerosois, adjuvant therapy such as pain distraction. Some of the features from these could be translated to benefit diabetes.

The use of augmented and VR to support diabetes self-management has demonstrated potential as another opportunity, through automation and immersion, however, they are still in their infancy and individuals should be adequately trained in the use of these technologies.

### Emphasis on carbohydrates may negatively influence dietary patterns in youth with type 1 diabetes [^d589c16e]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Medical nutrition therapy for youth with type 1 diabetes is designed to maintain normal growth and development while optimizing glycemic outcomes. Even the most intensive insulin regimens cannot be successful without careful attention to meal planning. Nutrition education for youth with type 1 diabetes focuses on carbohydrate counting and overall healthful eating. However, recent data demonstrate that youth with diabetes are not meeting established nutrition guidelines.

There remains a need to understand why youth with type 1 diabetes fail to achieve nutrition guidelines. In this study, we explored perceptions of healthful eating provided by youth with type 1 diabetes and their parents and assessed the influence of diabetes management on food choices. Findings could inform future interventions aimed at improving the nutrition of youth with type 1 diabetes.

### Glycemic index, glycemic load, carbohydrates, and type 2 diabetes: systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies [^885c0b71]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Inconsistencies in results for total carbohydrate intake and type 2 diabetes may be due to differences in the main sources and types of carbohydrate consumed or other differences in dietary practices between European, U.S. Chinese, and Australian cohorts. It might also reflect the possibility that healthier, more active people are consuming more carbohydrates. An alternative explanation may relate to differences between both the amount of carbohydrate consumed and the type of carbohydrate eaten, with different cohorts also having different proportions of men and women.

This may also account for any nonlinear appearance of the dose–response plot, with studies reporting higher intakes of total carbohydrates having different sources of carbohydrate in the diet than those reporting lower intakes. Nonlinear dose–response curves are susceptible to cohorts with different ranges of intake, leading to the appearance of a nonlinear curve. In this situation, differences in design or population can cause the appearance of nonlinearity. However, there is a reasonable spread of carbohydrate intakes over a number of studies included in the meta-analysis, so this is unlikely to have occurred in this review.

Our findings are consistent with, and contribute to, a growing body of evidence for the protective associations with low dietary GI and GL. Our results have quantified for the first time the range of exposures associated with lower risk and quantified the risk reduction associated with specified differences in GI and GL. Results for carbohydrates, more generally, are less clear, and future research could focus in more detail on the source and composition of carbohydrates associated with greatest risk.

### Insights from a general practice service evaluation supporting a lower carbohydrate diet in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and prediabetes: a secondary analysis of routine clinic data including HbA1c, weight and prescribing over 6 years [^289fbac1]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Advice on lowering dietary carbohydrate was offered routinely by trained GPs and practice nurses to patients with T2D and prediabetes (defined as a haemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] from 42 to 48 mmol/mol) from March 2013 (online supplemental file 1. Low-carb protocol). The lower carbohydrate diet was introduced as an option alongside clear and simplified explanations of key physiological principles; including how glucose and insulin levels change in response to different foods; starchy carbohydrates comprise many glucose molecules; and the concept that foods can have either a low or high GI and glycaemic load (online supplemental file 2).

For patients who opted to try a lower carbohydrate diet, dietary advice was given as part of routine GP or practice nurse consultations. The level of ongoing support was tailored to patient choice and clinical need. In addition to 10 min 'one-to-one' appointments (we estimate an average of 3 appointments per patient, per year were required), the practice offered access to optional 90 min evening group sessions that ran approximately once every 6 weeks. Group sessions included a psychologist who facilitated behaviour change by encouraging participants to consider their individual health goals, the resources available to them, setting realistic steps and enabling the individual to notice what works for them. Patient relatives and carers were encouraged to attend as some patients relied on others for food shopping or cooking. Group sessions also provided a forum for patients to offer practical support to their peers and for the training of new staff. On average, 25 patients attended each session.

Several educational resources were produced to support patients and staff. The lower carbohydrate diet sheet (figure 1) outlines low GI sources of food in the diet. Glycaemic load data, derived from the GI, were also presented to encourage a reduction in the intake of sugary and starchy foods, for example, sugary breakfast cereals, rice or potatoes, by replacing them with, for example, green leafy vegetables, full-fat dairy, eggs, meat, fish, berries and nuts, with sensitivity to each patient's sociocultural dietary needs and preferences. A set of seven broadly indicative infographics were generated, for example, figure 2. These help people make wiser dietary choices by representing the glycaemic load of example food portions alongside an equivalent number of standard (4 g) teaspoons of table sugar. From 2018, staff training was formalised through completion of a Royal College of General Practitioners e-learning module on T2D and the GI, written by one of the authors.

### Glycemic index, glycemic load, carbohydrates, and type 2 diabetes: systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies [^3aac6d5b]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Total carbohydrate

Data were extracted from eight studies investigating total carbohydrate intake and type 2 diabetes (Fig. 1 C). The estimated category mean intakes ranged from approximately 130 to 340 g, with individual studies spanning between 72 and 210 g. The pooled estimate of RR from linear dose–response meta-analysis was 0.97 (95% CI 0.90–1.06) per 50 g per day of total dietary carbohydrate intake (P = 0.5). There was substantial heterogeneity between the cohort studies (I 2 = 75%; 95% CI 50–88%; Q = 28; df = 7; P < 0.001).

Estimates were largely consistent across predefined subgroups, though there was a tendency for studies with longer follow-up to have larger estimates. The funnel plot was approximately symmetric, with little evidence of small-study effects such as publication bias (data not shown).

Nonlinear dose–response meta-analysis showed a relatively flat curve over a broad range of typical intakes, with a suggestion of lower risks associated with higher intakes where data are more sparse and CIs wider (Fig. 1 F) and where studies had higher proportions of male participants.

### Practical guidance on open source and commercial automated insulin delivery systems: a guide for healthcare professionals supporting people with insulin-requiring diabetes [^ec946a32]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Evaluating the Choices of Automated Insulin Delivery Systems

The first step for anyone interested in AID is to determine what their goals are and select an AID system that is most likely to help the person with diabetes to achieve those goals.

For any particular system, regardless of whether it is open source or commercially developed, healthcare providers and individuals with diabetes should be able to answer the following questions regarding each system they are evaluating for potential use:
How does it generally work to automate insulin delivery? What physical components (e.g. pump, CGM, and/or mobile devices) are required? What components are optional?
When does it work? For example, does the system "turn off automation" at any point?
What are the baseline targets for the system? When can you change the targets, and to what levels? What does target changing do with regards to how the system makes decisions?
What outcomes do people typically get with real-world use from these systems? What overall TIR % is achieved, for what range (e.g. 70–180 mg/dL)? What is the average estimated glucose or A1c that corresponds with those outcomes?
Are meal boluses required to get the stated outcomes from the system? Additionally, what type of inputs are required for meals? What level of precision is needed in carb counting to get a reasonable post-meal outcome?
How can data be viewed in real time and retrospectively regarding what the system is doing and how it has performed?
If a system requires calibrations for a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), how does calibration (or a lack thereof) impact the system's operation?
What settings can be changed within the system? What information is available to aid in determining whether settings could or should be changed?
What remote following and/or monitoring capabilities exist with the system?
What resources and support exist for the system?

### The impact of using a closed-loop system on food choices and eating practices among people with type 1 diabetes: a qualitative study involving adults, teenagers and parents [^f7232500]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

'So, if I was sort of doing the kids' tea and I would sort of have a couple of chips, that I would probably think: Oh, I — you know — and I think it was quite subconscious that, you know: Oh, I don't need to bolus for that because it's not very much. It's only gonna be sort of 10 g of carbs, and the… the artificial pancreas will be able to sort of, will deal with that, because it will see the sugars going up slightly and it'll give it a bit more insulin'.
The quality‐of‐life benefits of using a closed‐loop were also noted, with participant 1, for instance, describing having felt more 'normal' because of being able to interact with peers in more spontaneous ways around food:

'If somebody's going round with a packet of biscuits and they offer you one, you can have a quick look and go, Oh yeah, go on then, yeah, I'll have a biscuit. And you don't have to worry about it as much as if you weren't on a closed‐loop, where it'd be like: Well, er, can I have a biscuit? Can't I have a biscuit? Oh well, you know, maybe I shouldn't… It just means you can go with the flow, go with everybody else'.
Additional benefits were reported by teenagers and their parents, who noted how the closed‐loop had acted as a safety net at a point in the life course where, as participant 12's parent, noted:

### Low carbohydrate diets and type 2 diabetes: what is the latest evidence? [^0898647b]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Adherence and Attrition

Adherence to the prescribed intervention was assessed by self-reported dietary intake using a variety of methods including 24-hour diet histories and 3-, 4-, and 7-day food diaries. In the majority of the studies, mean intake of carbohydrate in the reduced carbohydrate intervention group was higher than that prescribed; in only two studies did the participants achieve target intakes. Attrition rates were reported for seven studies, and ranged from no dropouts to 60%. There were no differences in attrition rates between the intervention and control groups in any of the studies. In general, lower attrition rates were reported for shorter studies, and for those with fewer participants.

Evolution of Devices

Both categories of open source systems and commercial systems have evolved over time. For example, users of open source AID systems can in some cases choose combinations of settings such as "unannounced meal" and/or "supermicroboluses" (SMB) to eliminate meal boluses and/or meal announcements (e.g. avoid meal interactions completely or choose less precise carb-counting estimates to enter into a system). Most early studies with unannounced meals, even those with add-on therapies in commercial systems, indicated that the early versions may have tradeoffs in overall time in range (TIR) with a lack of user input, although individual evidence from the diabetes community suggests a higher TIR in the real-world use of open source AID. Evolutions of commercial systems from version to version might involve changes to CGM capabilities, target adjustments, or other algorithm or usability adjustments, such as options to do meal announcements without precise carbohydrate counting. Additionally, even if such features are not marketed, people with diabetes may find themselves trialing different approaches to meal announcement, such as less precise carbohydrate counting, and find that the systems which adjust successfully are worth the tradeoff between inputting precise carbohydrate counts and achieving the highest possible TIR outcomes. Commercial systems usually change across named versions (e.g. Medtronic's 670G is followed by the 780G), whereas open source systems change more frequently and therefore may require a more extensive conversation around which version, settings, and targets a patient is using at any given time, as well as an awareness of expanded compatibilities with insulin pumps and CGM options.

Insulin dosing for high-fat and/or high-protein mixed meals — insulin dosing decisions should be confirmed with a structured approach to blood glucose monitoring or CGM to evaluate individual responses and guide insulin dose adjustments, checking glucose 3 h after eating may help determine if additional insulin adjustments are required, and for individuals using an insulin pump, a split bolus feature may provide better insulin coverage for high-fat and/or high-protein mixed meals; most commercially available automated insulin delivery systems still require basic diabetes management skills including carbohydrate counting and understanding of the effect of protein and fat on postprandial glucose response.

### Efficacy of insulin dosing algorithms for high-fat high-protein mixed meals to control postprandial glycemic excursions in people living with type 1 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c8b5fb6d]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Optimizing postprandial blood glucose (PPG) levels after mixed meals that contain high fat and protein remains a challenge in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. This study evaluated the efficacy of different algorithms used for dosing insulin based on counting units of high fat and high protein (HFHP) meals with the current conventional method of counting carbohydrates alone to control PPG excursions. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane electronic databases were searched, with the analysis restricted to randomized control trials (RCTs). The primary outcome was the PPG (mean and standard deviation) at 240min. The pooled final estimate was the mean difference (MD) of the PPGs at 240min using random effect models to account for heterogeneity. In total, 15 studies were identified and included in the systemic review, of which 12 were RCTs, and three studies were non-randomized trials. The pooled MD of the PPG at 240min was in favor of additional insulin doses in HFHP meals compared to the carbohydrate counting alone. The statistically significant results favored the combined bolus (30:70) that split over 2 h in insulin pump therapy with pooled MD of the PPG, 240min of -24.65; 95% CI: -36.59, -8.41; and heterogeneity, 0%. Other statistically significant results favored the additional insulin added to insulin to carb ratio (ICR) of meal bolus (25–60% ICR) in multiple daily injections therapy with the pooled MD of PPG at 240min, -21.71; 95% CI: -38.45, -4.73; and heterogeneity, 18%. Insulin treatment based on fat and protein content, in addition to carbohydrate counting, is more effective than the carbohydrate counting method alone; however, further research is warranted to determine the best equation for fat and protein counting, particularly in people with multiple daily injections.

### Nutrition in patients with type 2 diabetes: are low-carbohydrate diets effective, safe or desirable? [^7d29a71e]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Low-carbohydrate diets have been around for over 100 years. They have become very popular recently but the scientific basis for their use remains to be fully established. This article reviews the recent trials that have been published and also what is known about the effects of low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets on energy expenditure and body composition. Although many controversies remain, there is now mounting evidence that these diets can lead to effective weight loss and may thus be a useful intervention for patients who have, or are at risk of, diabetes. The practical aspects of using these diets as a short- to medium-term intervention are discussed.

### Carbohydrate quantity in the dietary management of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6b440c97]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

This systematic review and meta-analysis (registration number: CRD42013005825) compares the effects of low carbohydrate diets (LCDs) on body weight, glycaemic control, lipid profile and blood pressure with the effects of higher carbohydrate diets (HCDs) in adults with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Food Science Source and SweMed+ databases were systematically searched to identify randomized controlled trials (duration ≥ 3months) investigating the effects of an LCD compared to an HCD in the management of type 2 diabetes. Data were extracted and pooled using a random effects model and were expressed as mean differences and risk ratio. Subgroup analyses were undertaken to examine the effects of duration of intervention, extent of carbohydrate restriction and risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Results

Of the 1589 studies identified, 23, including 2178 participants, met inclusion criteria. Reductions were slightly greater with LCDs than with HCDs for HbA1c (-1.0 mmol/mol; CI, -1.9, -0.1 [-0.09%; CI, -0.17, -0.01]) and for triglycerides (-0.13mmol/L; CI, -0.24, -0.02). Changes in weight, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol and blood pressure did not differ significantly between groups. Subgroup analyses suggested that the difference in HbA1c was evident only in studies with a duration of ≤ 6 months and with a high risk of bias.

Conclusions

The proportion of daily energy provided by carbohydrate intake is not an important determinant of response to dietary management, especially when considering longer term trials. A range of dietary patterns, including those traditional in Mediterranean countries, seems suitable for translating nutritional recommendations for individuals with diabetes into practical advice.

Project IMAGE European Evidence-Based Guideline for the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes, 2010 — dietary guidance notes that, currently, there is no evidence from long-term prevention studies that reducing total dietary carbohydrate prevents T2D, and that comorbidities, particular CVDs, should be monitored and taken into account when planning the diet (Grade C).
