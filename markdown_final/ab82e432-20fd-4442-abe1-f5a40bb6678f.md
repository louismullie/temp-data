## Question

Statin in primary prevention of ASCVD Guidelines

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about statin use for primary prevention of ASCVD across major guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching prevention framework and risk assessment tools. Then, I should verify how guidelines categorize risk and map to statin intensity. Next, I will examine special high-risk conditions that bypass routine risk scoring. After that, I need to check the role of risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium to refine decisions. I will then compare major guidelines and reconcile differences, including the USPSTF perspective. Finally, I should review implementation gaps, monitoring, and synthesize a practical decision algorithm with caveats for older adults and diverse populations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework: prevention is risk-based, not LDL-C target–based, and anchored in a clinician–patient risk discussion before pharmacotherapy, with lifestyle as first-line and lifelong therapy. I need to ensure I'm using the correct risk estimator for the right population; for US adults 40–75 years, the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) are standard, while younger adults should have risk factors assessed every 4–6 years and lifetime risk considered when 10-year risk is low. Wait, I almost said "lifetime risk for all", but that would be imprecise; the guidance emphasizes lifetime estimation particularly when 10-year risk is < 7.5% in adults 20–59 years, not universally for everyone. I should double-check that nuance and keep it in mind as I proceed [^111Ksvaj] [^1135p1LP] [^111fccwi].

> Next, I should review risk categories and corresponding statin intensity. Adults 40–75 years without diabetes and with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL are stratified as low (< 5%), borderline (5– < 7.5%), intermediate (7.5– < 20%), or high (≥ 20%) 10-year ASCVD risk. For high risk, a high-intensity statin to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50% is recommended; for intermediate risk, a moderate-intensity statin to lower LDL-C by ≥ 30% is recommended after a risk discussion; for borderline risk, a risk discussion with consideration of risk enhancers is advised, and statins may be reasonable in selected cases. Hold on, I should verify the intensity language: yes, the ACC/AHA documents specify percent LDL-C reduction rather than numeric LDL-C goals, which operationalizes the fixed-intensity strategy from 2013 onward [^1171dFqY] [^111CzrrQ] [^113wVuy7].

> I will now examine special high-risk conditions that bypass routine risk scoring. Adults 40–75 years with diabetes should receive at least moderate-intensity statins regardless of calculated risk, with high-intensity reasonable when multiple risk factors are present. Adults 20–75 years with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL should receive maximally tolerated statin therapy, typically high-intensity, given their genetic and event risk. Let me verify the diabetes age range; I initially thought "all adults with diabetes", but wait, the formal recommendation is for ages 40–75 years, so I should correct that and keep initiation outside this range individualized and evidence-limited [^111CzrrQ] [^115ETCBW] [^115FsguN].

> Next, I should review risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium (CAC) to refine borderline and intermediate risk decisions. Risk enhancers include family history of premature ASCVD, LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL, high-sensitivity CRP ≥ 2 mg/L, chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, premature menopause, and certain ancestries; their presence can support statin initiation in otherwise borderline-risk adults. CAC testing is reasonable when the statin decision remains uncertain after risk discussion; CAC = 0 allows deferring statins in many cases and reassessing in 5–10 years, CAC 1–99 favors statins especially after age 55, and CAC ≥ 100 or ≥ 75th percentile supports statin initiation. I should confirm the CAC thresholds and caveats; yes, these are consistent across ACC/AHA documents and help personalize risk [^111urNer] [^115c4Mvu] [^1177TNkm].

> Now, let me compare major guidelines and reconcile differences. ACC/AHA 2018/2019 and NICE/UK adopt lower risk thresholds and broader eligibility, whereas ESC/EAS historically used higher thresholds and fewer eligible patients. USPSTF 2022 recommends statins when 10-year risk is ≥ 10% with at least one risk factor, and selectively at 7.5–10%, reflecting a more conservative stance than ACC/AHA. Wait, I should double-check the performance metrics: comparative studies show ACC/AHA, CCS, and NICE identify more future events with similar 10-year NNTs (~20–30) compared with USPSTF and ESC/EAS, supporting the efficiency of broader eligibility. I need to ensure I cite the highest-quality comparative data; the JAMA Cardiology 2019 and 2022 analyses support this conclusion [^116dx7ZW] [^114NmGvK] [^115Afh8d] [^115HpJdw].

> I should confirm the USPSTF position and its implications. USPSTF gives a B recommendation for adults 40–75 with ≥ 1 risk factor and 10-year risk ≥ 10%, a C recommendation for 7.5–10% risk, and an I statement for adults ≥ 76 years due to insufficient evidence. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; this does not contradict ACC/AHA but reflects a more restrictive interpretation of net benefit and evidence quality, particularly in older adults. I need to ensure I communicate that clinicians may reasonably follow ACC/AHA for broader prevention while acknowledging USPSTF's caution in older age groups [^115HpJdw] [^113Sp72L] [^115RDxGq].

> Next, I should review implementation and adherence gaps, because guidelines do not implement themselves. Real-world data show that many eligible patients are not prescribed statins, and when they are, there is often a delay to guideline-directed statin intensity, with higher observed ASCVD and mortality in nonadherent groups. I need to check whether team-based care and shared decision-making are emphasized; yes, ACC/AHA explicitly recommends these to close gaps and address social determinants that impede adherence [^115vBTsv] [^111CHprD] [^1154Wfh7].

> Let me consider monitoring and follow-up. I should confirm that percent LDL-C reduction is used to gauge response rather than treating to an arbitrary LDL-C target. Inadequate reduction (< 30% on moderate intensity) should prompt reassessment of adherence, interactions, and consideration of intensification. Wait, I should verify whether nonfasting lipids are acceptable; yes, the 2018 ACC/AHA multisociety guideline allows nonfasting lipid measurements to simplify monitoring and improve uptake [^1138QxsW] [^1156932H].

> I will now examine special populations and caveats. For adults ≥ 76 years, evidence is limited; decisions should be individualized, with consideration of life expectancy, frailty, comorbidities, and patient preferences. For adults 20–39 years, routine pharmacotherapy is not indicated unless LDL-C is very high or there is a strong family history; lifetime risk assessment and lifestyle are prioritized. I should double-check that these age-specific nuances are consistent with ACC/AHA; yes, they are explicitly addressed in the 2019 primary prevention guideline [^116TMavT] [^115steWo] [^111Ksvaj].

> But wait, what about risk estimator calibration and overestimation, especially in diverse populations? The PCE may overestimate risk in some groups; therefore, I need to ensure that risk enhancers and, when needed, CAC are used to refine decisions, and that clinicians remain cautious at borderline thresholds. Let me verify that this caveat is acknowledged; yes, ACC/AHA and the National Lipid Association highlight the role of CAC and the limits of risk calculators, reinforcing the need for clinical judgment and shared decision-making [^116CRKPi] [^111urNer].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical decision pathway. Calculate 10-year ASCVD risk with PCE for adults 40–75 years. If risk is ≥ 20%, recommend high-intensity statin. If 7.5– < 20%, recommend moderate-intensity statin after risk discussion. If 5– < 7.5%, discuss risk enhancers and consider CAC to individualize. If < 5%, emphasize lifestyle and reassess periodically. For adults with diabetes aged 40–75, use at least moderate-intensity statins. For LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, use high-intensity statins. Throughout, anchor decisions in shared decision-making, address barriers, and monitor percent LDL-C reduction to ensure therapeutic response. Hold on, I should verify alignment with the cited recommendations. This synthesis matches ACC/AHA 2018/2019 and integrates USPSTF's more conservative stance for 7.5–10% risk and older adults [^1171dFqY] [^111CzrrQ] [^115HpJdw].

Statins are recommended for primary prevention of ASCVD in adults aged 40–75 years with **LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL** [^1138QxsW] and **≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk** [^111Ksvaj], with moderate-intensity therapy for intermediate risk (7.5–19.9%) and high-intensity for high risk (≥ 20%) or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL [^111CzrrQ]. For adults 40–75 with diabetes, **moderate-intensity statins are indicated regardless of calculated risk** [^111CzrrQ]; high-intensity is reasonable with multiple risk factors [^117SzPjZ]. In borderline risk (5– < 7.5%), use risk enhancers [^115c4Mvu] and consider CAC scoring [^111urNer] to guide decisions [^1138QxsW]. For adults ≥ 76, individualize decisions based on comorbidities, life expectancy, and patient preference [^116TMavT]. Lifestyle remains foundational for all risk categories [^112WJ31f].

## Risk assessment and stratification

- **Age 40–75 years**: Calculate 10-year ASCVD risk using the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) [^111Ksvaj] [^1167FpAL].
- **Age 20–39 years**: Assess risk factors every 4–6 years; consider lifetime risk if 10-year risk is low [^111fccwi] [^1167FpAL].
- **Risk categories**: Low (< 5%), borderline (5– < 7.5%), intermediate (7.5– < 20%), high (≥ 20%) [^1171dFqY].

---

## Statin therapy recommendations by risk category

| **Risk category** | **Recommendation** | **Statin intensity** |
|-|-|-|
| High (≥ 20%) | Initiate statin therapy | High-intensity (reduce LDL-C ≥ 50%) [^111CzrrQ] |
| Intermediate (7.5– < 20%) | Initiate statin therapy after risk discussion | Moderate-intensity (reduce LDL-C 30–49%) [^1171dFqY] |
| Borderline (5– < 7.5%) | Consider statin if risk enhancers present or CAC ≥ 1 | Moderate-intensity [^111urNer] |
| Low (< 5%) | Lifestyle therapy | None [^1171dFqY] |

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Diabetes mellitus (age 40–75)**: Moderate-intensity statin indicated; high-intensity reasonable with multiple risk factors [^111CzrrQ] [^117SzPjZ].
- **LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL**: High-intensity statin indicated regardless of calculated risk [^115steWo].
- **Age ≥ 76 years**: Individualize based on comorbidities, life expectancy, and patient preference [^116TMavT] [^115steWo].

---

## Role of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring

CAC scoring is **reasonable in intermediate-risk adults** [^111urNer] or selected borderline-risk adults when the decision remains uncertain [^1167FpAL]. Interpretation: CAC = 0 allows deferral and reassessment in 5–10 years if higher-risk conditions are absent; CAC 1–99 favors statin initiation, especially if age ≥ 55; CAC ≥ 100 or ≥ 75th percentile supports statin initiation [^115c4Mvu].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle therapy is **foundational for all risk categories** [^112WJ31f], with emphasis on diet, physical activity, weight management, and smoking cessation [^117CHTFV].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Obtain **lipid panels 4–12 weeks** after initiation or dose change, then every 3–12 months to assess adherence and response [^1119L2xg]. Continue to reinforce lifestyle and medication adherence at each visit [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Age 40–75 years**: Use PCE to calculate 10-year ASCVD risk; initiate statins based on risk category and LDL-C levels [^111Ksvaj].
- **High risk (≥ 20%) or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL**: High-intensity statin [^115steWo].
- **Intermediate risk (7.5– < 20%)**: Moderate-intensity statin after risk discussion [^111CzrrQ].
- **Borderline risk (5– < 7.5%)**: Consider statin if risk enhancers present or CAC ≥ 1 [^111urNer].
- **Diabetes (age 40–75)**: Moderate-intensity statin; high-intensity if multiple risk factors [^117SzPjZ].
- **Age ≥ 76 years**: Individualize based on comorbidities, life expectancy, and patient preference [^116TMavT].

### Preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease using American college of cardiology and American Heart Association prevention guidelines: some good news, but caveats remain [^117JusFY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

It is axiomatic that you can be logical and factual, but if your assessment is incomplete, you can be misled.

That is why it is important to look carefully at papers that comment on the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) cholesterol 1 and risk assessment 2 guidelines and the use of the pooled cohort equations for risk assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). An important attribute of the current ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines is close adherence to the evidence derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or meta‐analyses of these RCTs. This approach emanated from important restraints imposed on the guidelines process from the start. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken in response to critical questions chosen by the panel. The literature search of RCTs and meta‐analyses of these RCTs was performed by an independent contractor chosen by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This contractor, devoid of any conflicts with industry, graded the papers that the panel could consider for quality. Poor‐quality data were not considered, and the accumulated evidence was compiled into evidence tables. The cholesterol guideline recommendations were made from those tables. Importantly, > 50% of the large and diverse guidelines panel reported no conflicts during this process, which focused on evidence over expert opinion.

Primary prevention — 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk categories in adults are used to guide statin decisions for Age 40–75 y and LDL-C 70–190 mg/dL (1.8–4.9 mmol/L) without diabetes mellitus. The risk strata are < 5% "Low Risk", 5% - < 7.5% "Borderline Risk", ≥ 7.5% - < 20% "Intermediate Risk", and ≥ 20% "High Risk", with corresponding actions: "Risk discussion: Emphasize lifestyle to reduce risk factors (Class I)", "Risk discussion: If risk enhancers present then risk discussion regarding moderate-intensity statin therapy (Class IIb)", "Risk discussion: If risk estimate + risk enhancers favor statin, initiate moderate-intensity statin to reduce LDL-C by 30% - 49% (Class I)", and "Risk discussion: Initiate statin to reduce LDL-C ≥ 50% (Class I)". If risk decision is uncertain, the pathway states: "Consider measuring CAC in selected adults: CAC = zero (lowers risk; consider no statin, unless diabetes, family history of premature CHD, or cigarette smoking are present) CAC = 1–99 favors statin (especially after age 55) CAC = 100+ and/or ≥ 75th percentile, initiate statin therapy".

### Effects of race on statin prescribing for primary prevention with high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in a large healthcare system [^114R4KCL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary prevention of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is explained by traditional risk factors, such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking status, and diabetes mellitus. 1 Statins remain one of the most effective therapies to prevent ASCVD. Since the 2013 update, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of blood cholesterol have identified 4 statin benefit groups: clinical ASCVD, severe hypercholesterolemia (low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL‐C] ≥ 190 mg/dL), diabetes mellitus in adults, and those with an ASCVD 10‐year risk ≥ 7.5%. 2 Although these guidelines recommend statins with a high level of evidence, prescribing disparities still exist. 3, 4, 5

Improved efforts for primary prevention of ASCVD are even more paramount in blacks. Blacks often have a higher incident rate of stroke and coronary artery disease compared with whites. 6, 7, 8, 9 This excess risk is directly related to the elevated risk factors, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, and diabetes mellitus, in black individuals. In the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) Study, the proportion of blacks with optimal risk factors was 3.8% compared with 7.5% in white participants. 5 Furthermore, ≈90% of the ASCVD events in blacks compared with ≈70% of the events in white participants were explained by risk factors.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of race on statin prescribing for primary prevention with high ASCVD risk in a large healthcare system. These results could provide valuable insights for future interventions to improve statin prescribing in various primary prevention groups.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol guideline and implications for healthy people 2020 cardiovascular disease prevention goals [^116ZyzwG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

A prior analysis indicated that full implementation of the 2013 Cholesterol Guideline would prevent an additional ≈475 000 cardiovascular events over 10 years compared with full implementation of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP)‐3 Guideline. 9 A cost‐effectiveness analysis suggested that lowering the threshold for intervention from a 10‐year ASCVD risk (ASCVD 10) from ≥ 7.5% to ≥ 3.0% would prevent an additional 161 650 ASCVD events over 10 years and was cost effective, especially with low‐cost statins. 11 In both reports, only adults aged 40 to 75 years were included, and statins were assumed to reduce CHD by 25% and stroke by 17%, given a 39‐mg/dL reduction in low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C).

The 2013 Cholesterol Guideline extends to a broader age range than 40 to 75 years for adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) ≥ 190 mg/dL. 6 Moreover, the percentage and absolute reduction in LDL‐C are dose dependent with high‐intensity statins more effective than moderate‐intensity statins in reducing ASCVD, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 although adverse effects also increase. 16, 17, 18, 19 The current and previous cholesterol guidelines also identified a favorable risk:benefit ratio for statins in adults aged ≥ 75 years with clinical ASCVD. 6, 20, 21

Given the importance of ASCVD prevention, we examined the impact of implementing the 2013 Cholesterol Guideline on 2 key outcomes. One outcome was to estimate the number of ASCVD events that could be prevented in the United States by providing statins to currently untreated but statin‐eligible adults 21 to 79 years old. A second outcome was to calculate absolute risk reduction (ARR) and 10‐year number needed‐to‐treat (NNT) to prevent a major ASCVD event. This information is important for assessing clinical resource requirements and risk:benefit ratio. Study findings have potentially important implications for healthcare delivery, policy, and payment to enhance cardiovascular health promotion and disease prevention.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115RDxGq]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — statin primary prevention recommendations state that the USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10% or greater; the USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin for adults aged 40 to 75 years with 1 or more CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 7.5% to less than 10%, noting that the likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group than in persons with a 10-year risk of 10% or greater; and for adults 76 years or older the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — risk-enhancing factors for intermediate risk indicates that knowledge of risk-enhancing factors is useful for all individuals but particularly for those at intermediate risk (ASCVD risk of 7.5% to ≤ 20%). An example cited is that a family history of premature ASCVD identified women ≥ 60 years of age with elevated hs-CRP and without ASCVD who benefited from high-intensity statin therapy, and those with primary LDL-C elevations of ≥ 160 mg/dL (≥ 4.1 mmol/L) have elevated lifetime ASCVD risk.

### Statin use in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease according to 5 major guidelines for sensitivity, specificity, and number needed to treat [^116dx7ZW]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Five major guidelines on statin use for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) have been published since 2014: the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE; 2014), US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF; 2016), Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS; 2016), European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS; 2016), and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA; 2018).

Objective

To compare the sensitivity, specificity, and estimated number needed to treat (NNT10) to prevent 1 ASCVD event in 10 years according to statin criteria from the 5 guidelines.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Population-based contemporary cohort study. Analyses were performed in the Copenhagen General Population Study, with a mean follow-up time of 10.9 years. We included 45 750 individuals aged 40 to 75 years. The participants were enrolled between 2003 and 2009 and were all free of ASCVD at baseline. Data were analyzed between January 1, 2019, and August 4, 2019.

Exposures

Statin treatment according to guideline criteria. We assumed a 25% relative reduction of ASCVD events per 38 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity and specificity for ASCVD events and the NNT10 to prevent 1 ASCVD event according to guideline criteria.

Results

Median age at baseline examination was 56 years, and 43% of participants were men (n = 19 870 of 45 750). During follow-up, we observed 4156 ASCVD events. Overall, 44% of individuals in Copenhagen General Population Study were statin eligible with CCS (n = 19 953 of 45 750), 42% with ACC/AHA (n = 19 400 of 45 750), 40% with NICE (n = 19 400 of 45 750), 31% with USPSTF (n = 13 966 of 45 750), and 15% with ESC/EAS (n = 6870 of 45 750). Sensitivity and specificity for ASCVD events were 68% (n = 2815 of 4156) and 59% (n = 24 456 of 41 594) for CCS, 70% (n = 2889 of 4156) and 60% (n = 25 083 of 41 594) for ACC/AHA, 68% (n = 2815 of 4156) and 63% (n = 26 213 of 41 594) for NICE, 57% (n = 2377 of 4156) and 72% (n = 30 005 of 41 594) for USPSTF, and 24% (n = 1001 of 4156) and 86% (n = 35 725 of 41 594) for ESC/EAS. The NNT10 to prevent 1 ASCVD using moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin therapy, respectively, was 32 and 21 for CCS criteria, 30 and 20 for ACC/AHA criteria, 30 and 20 for NICE criteria, 27 and 18 for USPSTF criteria, and 29 and 20 for ESC/EAS criteria.

Conclusions and Relevance

With similar NNT10 to prevent 1 event, the CCS, ACC/AHA, and NICE guidelines correctly assign statin therapy to many more of the individuals who later develop ASCVD compared with the USPSTF and ESC/EAS guidelines. Our results therefore suggest that the CCS, ACC/AHA, or NICE guidelines may be preferred for primary prevention.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^117CHTFV]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease — The most important way to prevent atherosclerotic vascular disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation is to promote a healthy lifestyle throughout life. A team-based care approach is an effective strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and clinicians should evaluate the social determinants of health that affect individuals to inform treatment decisions. Adults who are 40 to 75 years of age and are being evaluated for cardiovascular disease prevention should undergo 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimation and have a clinician–patient risk discussion before starting on pharmacological therapy, such as antihypertensive therapy, a statin, or aspirin; the presence or absence of additional risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium scanning can help guide decisions. All adults should consume a healthy diet that emphasizes the intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, lean vegetable or animal protein, and fish and minimizes the intake of trans fats, red meat and processed red meats, refined carbohydrates, and sweetened beverages; for adults with overweight and obesity, counseling and caloric restriction are recommended for achieving and maintaining weight loss. Adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity. For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, if medication is indicated, metformin is first-line therapy, followed by consideration of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. All adults should be assessed at every healthcare visit for tobacco use, and those who use tobacco should be assisted and strongly advised to quit. Aspirin should be used infrequently in the routine primary prevention of ASCVD because of lack of net benefit. Statin therapy is first-line treatment for primary prevention of ASCVD in patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (≥ 190 mg/dL), those with diabetes mellitus, who are 40 to 75 years of age, and those determined to be at sufficient ASCVD risk after a clinician–patient risk discussion. Nonpharmacological interventions are recommended for all adults with elevated blood pressure or hypertension, and for those requiring pharmacological therapy, the target blood pressure should generally be < 130/80 mm Hg.

The US Preventive Services Task Force has updated recommendations pertaining to statin therapy use for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adults. 1, 2 For statin efficacy, the recommendations were based on an extensive updated evidence review that included 22 randomized clinical trials was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, revascularization, and the composite cardiovascular outcome. 1, 2 Insufficient data were available for older adults, especially individuals older than 75 years. Importantly, the evidence review did not find any significant harm associated with statin therapy, suggesting a significant overall net benefit in primary prevention in appropriate groups of individuals. 1, 2.

The evidence review2 led to 3 clinical recommendations1 that are consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendations on this topic. A B statement was made that clinicians initiate statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40 to 75 years with at least 1 CVD risk factor and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk 10% or greater. For example, the 10-year hard ASCVD event rates in 3 trials of pure primary prevention showed benefits of statin therapy ranging from 5. 1% to
7. 6%. 4 Indeed, statin therapy shows efficacy at even lower 10-year ASCVD risk levels, and there is some indication that the relative benefits of statin therapy may be higher among individuals with lower 10-year ASCVD risk. 5 For most therapies, treating individuals with lower ASCVD risk comes at a price of treating a large number of individuals for a longer period of time. It is said that guidelines do not implement themselves in clinical practice.

Statin therapy is a prime example of this failure to implement guidelines effectively in clinical practice. Study after study has shown that statin therapy use remains low in primary ASCVD prevention. 13 Clinical inertia, statin-associated adverse effects, and social media all play roles in suboptimal use of statin therapy in clinical practice. 14 System-level interventions are needed to assist clinicians in implementing evidence-based statin therapy use in primary prevention. Thoughtful conversations are also needed with patients to counter the misinformation about statin therapy that is pervasive in social media. 15.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116aU1uF]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — primary prevention statin recommendations — specify that for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more cardiovascular risk factors and an estimated 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk of 10% or greater: Initiate a statin (Grade B); for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more cardiovascular risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10%: Selectively offer a statin (Grade C); and for adults 76 years or older: The evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against starting a statin (I statement).

Patient-centered approaches to comprehensive ASCVD prevention — Shared decision-making should guide discussions about the best strategies to reduce ASCVD risk (COR I; LOE B-R). Decisions about primary prevention should be collaborative between a clinician and a patient, and collaborative decisions are more likely to address potential barriers to treatment options compared with treatment and guidance offered without patient input.

### Advances in lipid therapy: the role of lipid treatment in women in primary prevention [^114w9He1]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death for women. Given the overall prevalence of CVD and its risk factors in women, primary prevention is an important focus. In 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released guidelines for men and women on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk (ASCVD) in adults based on randomized-controlled trials. Fixed and appropriate intensity of a statin based on calculation of an individual's risk of ASCVD or in diabetics or those with severely elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol patients for primary prevention is recommended rather than cholesterol level goals. A more recent consensus statement regarding the role of non-statin therapies has been released, but like the prior guidelines released in 2013, there were no sex-specific recommendations. An evidence-based approach to ASCVD prevention should be used in women.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Assessment of cardiovascular risk — recommendations for adults. For adults 40 to 75 years of age, clinicians should routinely assess traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by using the pooled cohort equations (PCE). For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk-enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (e.g., statin therapy). In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) or selected adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), if risk-based decisions for preventive interventions remain uncertain, it is reasonable to measure a coronary artery calcium score to guide clinician–patient risk discussion. For adults 20 to 39 years of age and for those 40 to 59 years of age who have < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk, estimating lifetime or 30-year ASCVD risk may be considered.

### 5-year versus risk-category-specific screening intervals for cardiovascular disease prevention: a cohort study [^114MfdWq]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Many national and international guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease recommend the estimated risk of a major cardiovascular event as the best guide to intervention decisions. The 2016 European guidelines suggest screening every 5 years for men older than 40 years and women older than 50 years, whereas the 2013 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologists (AHA/ACC) guidelinesrecommend screening at 4–6-year intervals for individuals without cardiovascular disease whose 10-year risk of a major cardiovascular event is lower than 7·5%, as calculated with the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) algorithm. After the risk reaches 7·5%, the AHA/ACC guidelinesclassify individuals as being at high risk and recommend implementation of preventive interventions and more frequent risk-factor assessments. A 2018 New Zealand Guideline recommends risk-category-specific 10-year, 5-year, and 2-year screening intervals for low-risk, intermediate-low-risk, and intermediate-high-risk individuals for a composite outcome of hospitalisation or death from ischaemic heart disease (including unstable angina), stroke, transient ischaemic attack, heart failure, or peripheral vascular disease. However, none of these screening intervals are based on observed cardiovascular disease risk progression. Instead, they stem mainly from expert opinion.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors allows detection of high-risk individuals and determination of initiation of preventive interventions such as statin therapy, but optimal screening intervals for people with low or intermediate cardiovascular risk remain unclear. We searched PubMed for current cardiovascular disease risk-estimation guidelines and their screening recommendations on Sept 30, 2018, using the Medical Subject Headings search terms "myocardial infarct", "stroke", "guideline", and "risk assessment". Many primary prevention guidelines recommend use of estimated 10-year risk of major cardiovascular events to guide initiation of interventions and screening decisions. The most common recommendation was 5-yearly screening for all individuals at low or intermediate risk, although other screening intervals, such as 10-yearly and 2-yearly screenings, were also recommended. These intervals were expert recommendations rather than based on evidence from observed cardiovascular disease risk progression.

### Preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease using American college of cardiology and American Heart Association prevention guidelines: some good news, but caveats remain [^1178A2Zg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

To put this in perspective, the following caveats are noted. It is important to emphasize that the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines did not mandate that all lower risk primary prevention patients with ≥ 7.5% ASCVD 10‐year risk receive a statin. The threshold of ≥ 7.5% was intended to start the risk discussion and was useful in epidemiological studies for determining the potential value of statin treatment in such patients. Pencina and colleagues indicated that, based on the guidelines determination of 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%, the guidelines could be projected to save 450 000 lives. 9 They also correctly noted, however, that the guidelines did not equate an ASCVD risk of ≥ 7.5% with automatic statin assignment; the guidelines recommended a clinician–patient risk discussion (CPRD) first.

The recommendation of a CPRD before statin prescription in lower risk primary care is crucial because it helps address the potential for inaccuracy of global risk estimation. The guidelines are based on data from 3 solely primary prevention RCTs to support treating at a 10‐year ASCVD risk of ≥ 7.5%. There was benefit down to 5%, but the guidelines panel chose the higher cutoff so that patients who had a lower risk due to ASCVD risk overestimation would still be in a statin‐benefit risk group. Consequently, the guidelines advise that statin treatment should be individualized within the context of a risk discussion enabling joint decision making. The CPRD was described in the table of recommendations as well as in the explanatory text and accompanying figures. This description addresses control of other ASCVD risk factors and the need for optimal lifestyle, the potential for benefit of statin therapy versus the potential for adverse effects and drug–drug interactions, and the inclusion of informed patient preference in final decision making. Further papers described techniques for making the CPRD truly effective. 10, 11

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111QWr6D]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### Primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention: optimally active, agile, and accountable [^111tuzpR]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) affects 24 million adults (1 in every 10) in the United States. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a main causal risk factor for ASCVD, such that there is an estimated 22% relative risk reduction of ASCVD events for every 39 mg/dL LDL-C lowering with statin therapy. Statins remain the foundation of ASCVD prevention and likely confer pleiotropic effects beyond lipid-lowering. Nonetheless, challenges remain with respect to the optimal implementation of guideline-directed approaches to statin initiation.

The 2018 Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol provides a Class I recommendation for the initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention in adults aged 40 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL as well as those with an intermediate risk (7.5–20%), or high risk (≥ 20%) based on the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) risk calculator. Among select adults with a borderline risk (5–7.5%) or all adults with an intermediate risk (7.5%-20%), there is a Class IIa recommendation to measure coronary artery calcium (CAC) to facilitate clinician-patient risk discussions regarding consideration of statin therapy for primary prevention. Measurement of CAC has been shown to help reclassify risk and better identify those most likely to derive net clinical benefit from statin therapy, as the 10-year number needed to treat to prevent 1 ASCVD event is more than 2-fold lower for statin-eligible candidates with incident CAC vs long-term absence of CAC.

### Statinopause [^115kh8SZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Statins are the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention. The 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines represent a fundamental shift in how statins will be prescribed. The new guidelines recommend statins for nearly all older patients up to age 75 years, including healthy adults with low normal lipid levels and no atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors other than age. Under the 2013 guidelines, age becomes a main determinant for initiating statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults. Specifically, according to the new guidelines, white males aged 63–75, white females aged 71–75, African American males aged 66–75, and African American females aged 70–75 with optimal risk factors would be recommended for statin treatment for primary prevention. Based on the new guidelines, one could term these older adults as having "statin deficiency", a condition warranting statin treatment. We call this putative condition of age-related statin deficiency "statinopause". After careful examination of the trial evidence, we find very little support for the new recommendations for primary prevention. The lack of evidence underscores the need for clinical trials to determine the risks and benefits of statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — coronary artery calcium (CAC)–guided statin decisions — in intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD] risk) adults or selected borderline-risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults in whom a CAC score is measured for the purpose of making a treatment decision, if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years so long as higher-risk conditions are absent; if the CAC score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; and if the CAC score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy. Additionally, in intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy.

### Evaluation of statin prescribing for secondary prevention in primary care following new guideline recommendations [^111CgJkK]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol recommends high-intensity statin therapy for most patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) versus previously recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. The impact of the ACC/AHA guidelines on prescribing patterns in primary care is uncertain.

Objective

To describe the prescribing habits of statin therapy in primary care patients with ASCVD before and after the ACC/AHA guidelines were published.

Methods

This retrospective observational study evaluated patients with ASCVD who were seen in at least 1 of 8 primary care clinics in the University of Colorado Health system. It received expedited approval by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with established ASCVD prescribed high-intensity statin therapy within 1 year before or after guideline release.

Results

In total, 220 patients were included in the analysis with 110 in the before and 110 in the after cohort. For the primary outcome analysis, the rate of high-intensity statin utilization in the before versus after groups was significantly greater (25.5% vs 41.8%, P = 0.01). For ages 76 to 89 years, 36 of 37 and 29 of 30 patients in the before and after groups were receiving moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy (97.3% vs 96.7%, P = 0.99). Subgroup analysis in the after cohort for all ages showed no change in statin therapy for 77% of patients.

Conclusions

High-intensity statin prescribing increased in patients with ASCVD after release of the ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines. Our data indicate that national evidence-based guidelines may influence clinical practice in very high risk patients.

ACC/AHA primary prevention of ASCVD — Guideline methodology and evidence scope include evidence-based recommendations supported by an extensive review, a literature search in major databases between May and July 2018, and evaluation of multiple study designs across defined topics. The guideline continues the ACC and AHA effort to provide concise practical guidance, states that its recommendations are evidence based, and evaluates RCTs, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, large United States–based cohort studies, and observational studies addressing the following 9 topic areas: risk assessment, diet, exercise/physical activity, obesity and weight loss, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), blood cholesterol, hypertension, smoking cessation, and aspirin use.

Because of a variety of factors, changes to guidelines may not be efficiently adapted and implemented. 8 With significant changes such as with the cholesterol guideline, the uptake may be delayed as well as vary greatly in extent between regions, patient populations, and physician types. From a public health perspective, the impact of a change in guideline should be evaluated. To date, 2 studies have been published that assess the impact of the guideline on statin prescribing patterns in patients with an ASCVD diagnosis. Both of these studies were limited to a single health system, and neither assessed changes in statin treatment patterns for primary prevention of ASCVD. 9, 10 The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the new guideline on statin‐initiating treatment patterns with regard to statin intensity for primary and secondary ASCVD prevention in the 2 years following its release. This will provide useful insight to help inform healthcare decision makers with regard to the use of moderate‐ and high‐intensity statin therapies in the near and longer terms as this guideline becomes more thoroughly integrated into clinical practice.

### Statin use in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease according to 5 major guidelines… [^114NmGvK]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance With similar NNT10 to prevent 1 event, the CCS, ACC/AHA, and NICE guidelines correctly assign statin therapy to many more of the individuals who later develop ASCVD compared with the USPSTF and ESC/EAS guidelines. Our results therefore suggest that the CCS, ACC/AHA, or NICE guidelines may be preferred for primary prevention. The purpose of preventive statin guidelines is to reduce the burden of ASCVD in the population. Guidelines should therefore provide recommendations that target treatment to as many individuals as possible who are destined to develop ASCVD. In all 5 guidelines, treatment decisions are based on the predicted absolute ASCVD risk and/or on the presence of high-risk markers such as diabetes. 1–5 Owing to the growing evidence base, documented long-term safety, and available cheap generics, most guidelines have lowered the treatment threshold since 2013.

As a result, more ASCVD events are prevented by the CCS, ACC/AHA, and NICE guidelines, resulting somewhat surprisingly in NNT10 that is nearly identical to those achieved by the USPSTF and ESC/EAS guidelines. Thus, assuming negligible harm from statin therapy and low cost for the drugs, the CCS, ACC/AHA, and NICE strategies seem to be the superior guidelines for clinical practice for primary prevention of ASCVD. First, many individuals enrolled in RCTs are low-risk individuals who do not meet guideline treatment criteria. We have previously shown that the potential reduction of ASCVD events in the population is highest for the CCS, ACC/AHA, and NICE guidelines, where 32% to 34% of all ASCVD events would be prevented compared with 18% to 27% for ESC/EAS and USPSTF guidelines. 7 Our completely new analyses demonstrate that this is achieved with NNTs that are similar to those achieved by assigning statins according to the more statin-conservative guidelines.

Sensitivity and specificity for ASCVD events by assigning statin therapy according to the 5 major guidelines differ markedly. Compared with the USPSTF and ESC/EAS guidelines, the CCS, ACC/AHA, and NICE guidelines assign statin therapy to many more of the individuals who later develop ASCVD. Nevertheless, the estimated NNT to prevent 1 ASCVD event is nearly identical between the 5 major guidelines. Taken together, our results therefore suggest that the CCS, ACC/AHA, or NICE guidelines should be preferred in clinical practice for primary preven.

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease: highlights for the clinician of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines [^113e2uhq]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular disease, undoubtedly an emphasis of clinical care in 2014, will provide both opportunities and challenges to patients and their healthcare providers. The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70–189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a < 140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults. Clinicians and their patients deserve a well-researched concensus document.

### Guidelines versus trial-evidence for statin use in primary prevention: the copenhagen general population study [^113arCyL]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Guideline-recommended use of risk calculators to select for statin therapy in primary prevention has never been tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We determined the extent to which guideline-based statin recommendations from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), Canadian Cardiovascular Society(CCS), UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) is supported by available evidence from RCTs.

Methods

79,171 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study who were free of ASCVD and statin use at baseline were included. RCT evidence supporting guideline-recommended statin allocation and the estimated number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one ASCVD event were assessed.

Results

During 8.2 years of follow-up, 4031 ASCVD events occurred. Of individuals eligible for statin therapy with the ACC/AHA, CCS, NICE and ESC/EAS guidelines, 86%, 88%, 88% and 84% had direct RCT evidence of statin efficacy, respectively (guideline-positive&RCT-positive). This group represented 26–37% of all 79,171 individuals, while guideline-positive&RCT-negative individuals represented 5–7%, guideline-negative&RCT-positive individuals 28–39%, and guideline-negative&RCT-negative individuals represented 30–31%. The ASCVD events per 1000 person-years were 11.4–12.7 (guideline-positive&RCT-positive), 6.3–8.0 (guideline-positive&RCT-negative), 4.2–5.2 (guideline-negative&RCT-positive), and 2.3–2.5 (guideline-negative&RCT-negative), respectively, while the corresponding NNT to prevent one event in 10 years using high-intensity statin were 19–21, 30–32, 48–60, and 105–125, respectively.

Conclusions

The far majority of individuals eligible for guideline-recommended primary prevention with statins have direct RCT evidence supporting statin use. Allocating statins based on guideline-criteria is more efficient with lower NNT for preventing ASCVD events than allocating statin therapy based solely on RCT evidence.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113Sp72L]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations for statins in primary prevention — The USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater (B recommendation). The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10% (C recommendation), and states that the likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group than in persons with a 10-year risk of 10% or greater. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older (I statement).

Corresponding actions are: emphasize lifestyle to reduce risk factors (Class I) for low risk; if risk enhancers present then risk discussion regarding moderate-intensity statin therapy (Class IIb) for borderline risk; if risk estimate + risk enhancers favor statin, initiate moderate-intensity statin to reduce LDL-C by 30% - 49% (Class I) for intermediate risk; and initiate statin to reduce LDL-C ≥ 50% (Class I) for high risk.

Primary prevention risk assessment — Adults who are 40 to 75 years of age being evaluated for cardiovascular disease prevention should undergo 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimation and have a clinician–patient risk discussion before starting on pharmacological therapy; the presence or absence of additional risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium scanning can help guide decisions. A team-based care approach is an effective strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and clinicians should evaluate the social determinants of health that affect individuals to inform treatment decisions.

### Comparing eligibility for statin therapy for primary prevention under 2022 USPSTF recommendations and the 2018 AHA / ACC / multi-society guideline recommendations: from national health and nutrition examination survey [^115mjdgd]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The United States Preventive Services Taskforce (USPSTF) recently released recommendations for statin therapy eligibility for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We report the proportion and the absolute number of US adults who would be eligible for statin therapy under these recommendations and compare them with the previously published 2018 American Heart Association (AHA)/ American College of Cardiology (ACC)/ Multisociety (MS) Cholesterol guidelines.

Methods

We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017–2020 of adults aged 40–75 years without prevalent self-reported atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol < 190 mg/dL. The 2022 USPSTF recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥ 10% and ≥ 1 CVD risk factor (diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, or smoking). The 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guideline recommends considering statin therapy for primary prevention for those with diabetes mellitus, or 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 20% or 10-year ASCVD risk 7.5 to < 20% after accounting for risk-enhancers and shared decision making. Survey recommended weights were used to project these proportions to national estimates.

Results

Among 1799 participants eligible for this study, the weighted mean age was 56.0 ± 0.5 years, with 53.0% women (95% confidence interval [CI] 49.7, 56.3), and 10.6% self-reported NH Black individuals (95% CI 7.7, 14.3). The weighted mean 10-year ASCVD risk was 9.6 ± 0.3%. The 2022 USPSTF recommendations and the 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guidelines indicated eligibility for statin therapy in 31.8% (95% CI 28.6, 35.1) and 46.8% (95% CI 43.0, 50.5) adults, respectively. These represent 33.7 million (95% CI 30.4, 37.2) and 49.7 million (95% CI 45.7, 53.7) adults, respectively. For those with diabetes mellitus, 2022 USPSTF recommended statin therapy in 63.0% (95% CI 52.1, 72.7) adults as compared with all adults with diabetes aged 40–75 years under the 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guidelines.

Conclusion

In this analysis of the nationally representative US population from 2017 to 2020, approximately 15% (~16.0 million) fewer adults were eligible for statin therapy for primary prevention under the 2022 USPSTF recommendations as compared to the 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guideline.

### Comparison of five major guidelines for statin use in primary prevention in a contemporary general population [^112bK2jS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Five major organizations recently published guidelines for using statins to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD): in 2013, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA); in 2014, the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); and in 2016, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS).

Objective

To compare the utility of these guidelines for primary prevention of ASCVD.

Design

Observational study of actual ASCVD events during 10 years, followed by a modeling study to estimate the effectiveness of different guidelines.

Setting

The Copenhagen General Population Study.

Participants

45 750 Danish persons aged 40 to 75 years who did not use statins and did not have ASCVD at baseline.

Measurements

The number of participants eligible to use statins according to each guideline and the estimated number of ASCVD events that statins could have prevented.

Results

The percentage of participants eligible for statins was 44% by the CCS guideline, 42% by ACC/AHA, 40% by NICE, 31% by USPSTF, and 15% by ESC/EAS. The estimated percentage of ASCVD events that could have been prevented by using statins for 10 years was 34% for CCS, 34% for ACC/AHA, 32% for NICE, 27% for USPSTF, and 13% for ESC/EAS.

Limitation

This study was limited to primary prevention in white Europeans.

Conclusion

Guidelines recommending that more persons use statins for primary prevention of ASCVD should prevent more events than guidelines recommending use by fewer persons.

Primary Funding Source

Treatment and statin intensity — dose selection for primary prevention: The USPSTF notes there are limited data directly comparing the effects of different statin intensities on health outcomes, that a majority of trials reviewed used moderate-intensity statin therapy, and that based on available evidence, use of moderate-intensity statin therapy seems reasonable for the primary prevention of CVD in most persons.

Assessment of cardiovascular risk — 2019 ACC/AHA primary prevention guideline: For adults 40 to 75 years of age, clinicians should routinely assess traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by using the pooled cohort equations (PCE). For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk-enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (e.g., statin therapy).

Assessment of cardiovascular risk (2019 ACC/AHA) — For adults 40 to 75 years of age, clinicians should routinely assess traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculate 10-year risk of ASCVD by using the pooled cohort equations (PCE). For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10‑year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk‑enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (eg, statin therapy). In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10‑year ASCVD risk) or selected adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10‑year ASCVD risk), if risk‑based decisions for preventive interventions (eg, statin therapy) remain uncertain, it is reasonable to measure a coronary artery calcium score to guide clinician–patient risk discussion. For adults 20 to 39 years of age and for those 40 to 59 years of age who have < 7.5% 10‑year ASCVD risk, estimating lifetime or 30‑year ASCVD risk may be considered; among those at borderline (5% to < 7.5%) and intermediate (≥ 7.5% to < 20%) risk, further testing to document subclinical coronary atherosclerosis is reasonable to more accurately reclassify the risk estimate upward or downward.

### A point-by-point response to recent arguments against the use of statins in primary prevention: this statement is endorsed by the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^112yqeQY]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, a debate over the merits of statin therapy in primary prevention was published in the Wall Street Journal. The statin opponent claimed that statins should only be used in secondary prevention and never in any primary-prevention patients at risk for cardiovascular events. In this evidence-based rebuttal to those claims, we review the evidence supporting the efficacy of statin therapy in primary prevention. Cardiovascular risk is a continuum in which those at an elevated risk of events stand to benefit from early initiation of therapy. Statins should not be reserved until after a patient suffers the catastrophic consequences of atherosclerosis. Contrary to the assertions of the statin opponent, this principle has been demonstrated through reductions in heart attacks, strokes, and mortality in numerous randomized controlled primary-prevention statin trials. Furthermore, data show that once a patient tolerates the initial treatment period, the few side effects that subsequently emerge are largely reversible. Accordingly, every major guidelines committee endorses statin use in secondary prevention and selectively in primary prevention for those with risk factors. The foundation for prevention remains increased physical activity, better dietary habits, and smoking cessation. However, prevention of heart attacks, strokes, and death from cardiovascular disease does not have to be all or none-all statin or all lifestyle. In selected at-risk individuals, the combination of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle changes is more effective than either alone. Future investigation in prevention should focus on improving our ability to identify these at-risk individuals.

### Hyperlipidemia: drugs for cardiovascular risk reduction in adults [^1119L2xg]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) indicate that lipid-lowering drugs have benefit for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. The evidence is strongest for statins. ACC/AHA, NICE, and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend statin therapy based on patients' risk of an ASCVD event, rather than treating to specific lipid levels. For patients with no previous ASCVD event, risk calculators should be used to determine the 10-year risk of ASCVD. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends starting moderate- to high-intensity statins if the risk is 7.5% or greater, whereas the NICE and USPSTF guidelines recommend statins if the risk is 10% or greater. Patients with known ASCVD should receive high-intensity statins unless they fall into special categories (e.g., older age) or do not tolerate high-intensity statins, in which case moderate-intensity statins are appropriate. Liver transaminase levels should be checked before starting statins; guidelines vary on if and when to recheck them in the absence of symptoms. Lipid levels should be rechecked one to three months after starting statins, although guidelines differ on subsequent checks. Other lipid-lowering drugs (e.g., bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe) can be considered if patients do not tolerate statins. Niacin should not be used. Some evidence supports adding ezetimibe to statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome or chronic kidney disease. The role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors is unclear, but initial studies suggest a decrease in the rate of acute ASCVD events in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

### Comparison of ACC / AHA and ESC guideline recommendations following trial evidence for statin use in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: results from the population-based rotterdam study [^116hvtiV]. JAMA Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines both recommend lipid-lowering treatment for primary prevention based on global risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for statin use have included participants with specific risk-factor profiles.

Objective

To evaluate the overlap between the ACC/AHA and ESC guideline recommendations and available evidence from RCTs for statin use in primary prevention of CVD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We calculated the 10-year risk for hard atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) following the ACC/AHA guideline, 10-year risk of CVD mortality following the ESC guideline, and we determined eligibility for each of 10 major RCTs for primary prevention of CVD. Conducted from July 2014 to August 2015, this study included 7279 individuals free of CVD, aged 45 to 75 years, examined between 1997 and 2008 for the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Proportions of individuals qualifying for lipid-lowering treatment per guidelines, proportions of individuals eligible for any of the 10 RCTs, overlap between these groups, and corresponding ASCVD incidence rates.

Results

Of the 7279 individuals included in the study, 58.2% were women (n = 4238) and had a mean (SD) age of 61.1 (6.9) years. The ACC/AHA guidelines would recommend statin initiation in 4284 participants (58.9%), while the ESC guidelines would in 2399 participants (33.0%) (overlapping by 95.8% with ACC/AHA). A total of 3857 participants (53.0%) met eligibility criteria for at least 1 RCT. Recommendations from both guidelines and trial evidence overlapped for 1546 participants (21.2%), who were at high risk for ASCVD (21.5 per 1000 person-years). A further 1703 participants (23.4%) would be recommended for statins by the guidelines in the absence of direct trial evidence, while 1176 (16.2%) would have been eligible for at least 1 trial without being recommended statin treatment by any guideline. Finally, 1719 participants (23.6%) would not be recommended a statin, nor would qualify for any of the trials. These individuals had low incidence of ASCVD (3.3 per 1000 person-years).

Conclusions and Relevance

Based on this European population study, ACC/AHA and ESC prevention guidelines often did not align at the individual level. However, for one-fifth of the general population, guidelines on both sides of the Atlantic recommend statin initiation, with trial data supporting the efficacy. There should be no controversy about providing optimal preventive medication to these individuals.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of zero — examples of candidates who might benefit from knowing their CAC score is zero and related caveats are provided: Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely; patients concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms; older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy; and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with PCE-calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5%, with factors that increase their ASCVD risk, although they are in a borderline risk group. Caveats state that if a coronary artery calcium score of zero is obtained at intermediate risk and a risk decision is uncertain, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the coronary artery calcium score in 5 to 10 years, and that CAC testing should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

### Optimisation of lipids for prevention of cardiovascular disease in a primary care [^115NExkL]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

The ACC/AHA guidelines focus on ASCVD risk reduction, advocating for the use of evidence-based doses of HMG-CoA-enzyme reductase inhibitors (statins) as first-line therapy and using a Pooled Cohort Equation risk calculator to calculate a patient's 10-year risk score, which is used to guide initiation of statin therapy. Based on this 10-year percent risk, patients are stratified into high-risk, moderate-risk or low-risk categories and are accordingly started on high-intensity or medium-intensity statin medications. Therefore, identification of patients who are eligible to receive statin therapy as per current ACC/AHA guidelines is not possible without calculation of the Pooled Cohort ASCVD risk score.

Primary prevention of ASCVD includes a heart healthy lifestyleas well as the use of medications, including lipid lowering statins, which target modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and have been shown to reduce coronary artery disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. There are multiple comorbidities that are significant risk factors for coronary artery disease, including obesity and hyperlipidaemia, and predispose patients to future cardiovascular events. Over 70% of the Internal Medicine Clinic patient population has a diagnosis of hypertension and obesity (body mass index of 30 or greater). The majority of these patients have associated comorbidities that include type 2 diabetes mellitus and nicotine dependence. Many of these patients have undiagnosed hyperlipidaemia and are at risk for major cardiovascular mortality and morbidities such as coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure and premature death. Therefore, diagnosing comorbidities and implementing statin therapy based on an ASCVD risk score is crucial to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Since the majority of the Internal Medicine Clinic patients did not have ASCVD risk score assessment, the aim of this quality improvement project was to increase ASCVD risk score assessment in patients between the ages of 40 and 75 years from a baseline rate of less than 1% to 10%, within 12 months. The ultimate goal was improving treatment of blood cholesterol for the primary prevention of ASCVD in the Internal Medicine Clinic.

Cholesterol reduction — statin initiation and targets (ages 40–75): In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL, we recommend high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction of ≥ 50%. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 70 to 189 mg/dL, we recommend a 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease should be calculated; without diabetes and a 10-year risk ≥ 7.5%, we recommend high-intensity statin therapy to achieve either a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal < 100 mg/dL or a reduction of ≥ 50%, and with a 10-year risk of 5% to 7.5%, we recommend moderate statin therapy as an option to achieve either a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal < 130 mg/dL or a reduction of 30% to 50% after consideration of risk reduction, adverse events, drug interactions, and individual preferences.

### Cardiovascular disease risk-based statin utilization and associated outcomes in a primary prevention cohort: insights from a large health care network [^115vBTsv]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend using the 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk to guide statin therapy for primary prevention. Real-world data on adherence and consequences of nonadherence to the guidelines in primary are limited. We investigated the guideline-directed statin intensity (GDSI) and associated outcomes in a large health care system, stratified by ASCVD risk.

Methods

Statin prescription in patients without coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or ischemic stroke were evaluated within a large health care network (2013–2017) using electronic medical health records. Patient categories constructed by the 10-year ASCVD risk were borderline (5%-7.4%), intermediate (7.5%-19.9%), or high (≥ 20%). The GDSI (before time of first event) was defined as none or any intensity for borderline, and at least moderate for intermediate and high-risk groups. Mean (± SD) time to start/change to GDSI from first interaction in health care and incident rates (per 1000 person-years) for each outcome were calculated. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios for incident ASCVD and mortality across risk categories stratified by statin utilization.

Results

Among 282298 patients (mean age ≈50 years), 29134 (10.3%), 63299 (22.4%), and 26687 (9.5%) were categorized as borderline, intermediate, and high risk, respectively. Among intermediate and high-risk categories, 27358 (43%) and 8300 (31%) patients did not receive any statin, respectively. Only 17519 (65.6%) high-risk patients who were prescribed a statin received GDSI. The mean time to GDSI was ≈2 years among the intermediate and high-risk groups. At a median follow-up of 6 years, there was a graded increase in risk of ASCVD events in intermediate risk (hazard ratio = 1.15 [1.07–1.24]) and high risk (hazard ratio = 1.27 [1.17–1.37]) when comparing no statin use with GDSI therapy. Similarly, mortality risk among intermediate and high-risk groups was higher in no statin use versus GDSI.

Conclusions

In a real-world primary prevention cohort, over one-third of statin-eligible patients were not prescribed statin therapy. Among those receiving a statin, mean time to GDSI was ≈2 years. The consequences of nonadherence to guidelines are illustrated by greater incident ASCVD and mortality events. Further research can develop and optimize health care system strategies for primary prevention.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115HRh7E]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and death in the US and is the cause of more than 1 of every 4 deaths. Coronary heart disease is the single leading cause of death and accounts for 43% of deaths attributable to CVD in the US. In 2019, an estimated 558 000 deaths were caused by coronary heart disease and 109 000 deaths were caused by ischemic stroke.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of statins for reducing CVD-related morbidity or mortality or all-cause mortality.

Population

Adults 40 years or older without a history of known CVD and who do not have signs and symptoms of CVD.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to less than 10% has at least a small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of CVD for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin for the primary prevention of CVD for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10%. The likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group than in persons with a 10-year risk of 10% or greater. (C recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older. (I statement).

### 2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines: synopsis of the 2018 American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / multisociety cholesterol guideline [^1138QxsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

In November 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) released a new clinical practice guideline on cholesterol management. It was accompanied by a risk assessment report on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Methods

A panel of experts free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts was chosen to carry out systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were used for estimation of ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence about the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy compared with receiving statin therapy alone in persons who have or are at high risk for ASCVD.

Recommendation

The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce lifetime risk for ASCVD. It contains several new features compared with the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may be candidates for adding nonstatin medications (ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is still strongly recommended before a decision is made about statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator first triages patients into 4 risk categories. Those at intermediate risk deserve a focused clinician-patient discussion before initiation of statin therapy. Among intermediate-risk patients, identification of risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium testing can assist in the decision to use a statin. Compared with the 2013 guideline, the new guideline gives more attention to percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a treatment goal and to long-term monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. To simplify monitoring, nonfasting lipid measurements are allowed.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^115e1AQY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Preceding the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood cholesterol guidelines (hereafter referred to as the "2013 guidelines" or simply "guidelines"), LDL‐C goals were < 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) for patients with a single CVD risk factor, < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for patients with 2 or more risk factors, and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for patients with known CVD or risk factor equivalent. 4 The guidelines were revised in 2013 to recommend moving away from a "treating to goal" approach with respect to LDL‐C 1 and instead focus on treating with the most appropriate statin intensity based on the patient's risk. The 4 statin benefit groups described in the guidelines are (1) patients with clinical ASCVD, (2) adult patients with LDL‐C ≥ 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), (3) patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL), and (4) patients with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to less than 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL; primary prevention). 1 With some exceptions for age and risk, in general, high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for those in statin benefit groups 1 and 2, whereas moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for most patients in statin benefit group 3. For statin benefit group 4, the recommendation is to estimate 10‐year ASCVD risk and engage in patient‐clinician discussions to determine an appropriate course of action. 5 In addition, the 2013 guidelines no longer recommend monitoring LDL‐C to assess achievement of a particular LDL‐C goal, but instead recommend monitoring LDL‐C to determine adherence and anticipated therapeutic response.

### Limitations of the SCORE-guided European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention [^115CRBoy]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Recently, primary prevention with statins was liberalized in the USA and UK but restricted in many comparable European countries. Supported by risk-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses, the 2013 ACC/AHA (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association)and 2014 UK-NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence)risk assessment and prevention guidelines lowered the risk threshold above which primary prevention with statins should be considered. In contrast, the 2016 update of the European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice, issued jointly by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and nine other societies, continued a conservative position on statin use in primary prevention by preserving the high-risk decision threshold introduced in 2003: 5% 10-year risk for fatal atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) estimated by SCORE (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation).

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^113mhgJf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.

### New cholesterol guidelines and primary prevention in women [^111TrNMY]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death for women in the United States. The role of primary prevention of CVD is a necessary focus of healthcare, given the overall prevalence of CVD and its risk factors in women. In 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released new guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk (ASCVD) in adults that were based on results of randomized controlled trials. These guidelines apply to both men and women. Achievement of a target cholesterol level is no longer part of the guidelines. Rather, the guidelines recommend an appropriate and fixed intensity of a statin based on calculation of an individual׳s risk of ASCVD or in diabetics or those with severely elevated LDL-C for primary prevention. The new guidelines emphasize statin therapy over other lipid-lowering therapy. The new guidelines are evidence-based, coming from randomized control trials that have clearly demonstrated improved outcomes using statin therapy in those with ASCVD and those at high risk of ASCVD, not based on LDL targets but rather LDL lowering. This evidence-based approach to ASCVD prevention should be used in women. There were no specific sex differences in the new guidelines, and the focus of this article is to provide the evidence to support the use of these guidelines in women.

### Implications of the new American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines for primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event prevention in a multi ethnic cohort: multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) [^111L2tex]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of replacing the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)/Adult Treatment Program (ATP) III cholesterol guidelines with the new 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is unclear.

Methods

We used risk factor and 10-year clinical event rate data from MESA, combined with estimates of efficacy of moderate and high-intensity statin therapy from meta-analyses of statin primary prevention trials to estimate (a) the change in number of subjects eligible for drug therapy and (2) the anticipated reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events and increment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) associated with the change in cholesterol guidelines.

Results

Of the 6,814 MESA participants, 5,437 were not on statins at baseline and had complete data for analysis (mean age 61.4 ± 10.3). Using the NCEP/ATP III guidelines, 1,334 (24.5%) would have been eligible for statin therapy compared with 3,015 (55.5%) under the new ACC/AHA guidelines. Among the subset of newly eligible, 127/1,742 (7.3%) had an ASCVD event during 10years of follow-up. Assuming 10years of moderate-intensity statin therapy, the estimated absolute reduction in ASCVD events for the newly eligible group was 2.06% (number needed to treat [NNT] 48.6) and the estimated absolute increase in T2DM was 0.90% (number needed to harm [NNH] 110.7). Assuming 10years of high-intensity statin therapy, the corresponding estimates for reductions in ASCVD and increases in T2DM were as follows: ASCVD 2.70% (NNT 37.5) and T2DM 2.60% (NNH 38.6). The estimated effects of moderate-intensity statins on 10-year risk for ASCVD and T2DM in participants eligible for statins under the NCEP/ATP III were as follows: 3.20% (NNT 31.5) and 1.06% (NNH 94.2), respectively.

Conclusion

Substituting the NCEP/ATP III cholesterol guidelines with the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines in MESA more than doubled the number of participants eligible for statin therapy. If the new ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines are adopted and extend the primary prevention population eligible for treatment, the risk-benefit profile is much better for moderate-intensity than high-intensity statin treatment.

### Primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: controversies and clinical considerations [^111tGkFj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

A new guideline for the treatment of blood cholesterol was recently released by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), serving as an update to the National Cholesterol Education Program's (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III cholesterol guideline first released in 2001. With significant changes to key definitions, treatment strategy, and therapy selection, the guideline has transformed the treatment of blood cholesterol and also created controversy within the health care community. This controversy is largely focused on appropriate identification and treatment of patients for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Whereas statins play an integral role in the treatment and secondary prevention of ASCVD, their use for primary prevention is less clearly defined. It is imperative that health care providers are well versed in the concepts and controversies of the new guideline recommendations for primary prevention of ASCVD and can effectively assess the risks and benefits of statin therapy in this patient population.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^114Vmw9G]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — lifestyle and risk-based care — emphasizes that tobacco avoidance is critically important; all adults should strive to engage in regular brisk physical activity most days of the week and adhere to a healthy dietary pattern, with a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and fish, legumes, and poultry as preferred protein sources while minimizing trans fats, added sugars (including sugar-sweetened beverages), red meats, sodium, and saturated fats. Clinicians should work in partnership with patients to assess readiness for sustained lifestyle improvements, identify barriers, encourage measurable goals, and monitor progress, and social determinants of ASCVD risk — and their impact on the patient's ability to prevent or treat risk factors — must be taken into account; clinicians need to consider patients' health literacy and education levels and assess patients' motivation to improve their lifestyle habits. The goal of the clinician is to match the intensity of preventive efforts with an individual's absolute risk of a future ASCVD event and willingness and capacity to implement preventive strategies, recognizing that risk estimation is imperfect and based on group averages. The clinician must balance estimated ASCVD risk with potential benefits and adverse risk from pharmacological therapy during a risk discussion, and when appropriateness of therapy remains unclear after quantitative risk estimation, risk-enhancing factors or selective use of a coronary artery calcium measurement can inform decision-making for cholesterol-lowering or antihypertensive medication use in intermediate-risk individuals.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Statin therapy — Statin therapy is first-line treatment for primary prevention of ASCVD in patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (≥ 190 mg/dL), those with diabetes mellitus, who are 40 to 75 years of age, and those determined to be at sufficient ASCVD risk after a clinician–patient risk discussion.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116iJYWW]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Statin therapy as primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in people with HIV — For those aged 40–75 years with 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%, the Panel recommends initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy (AI); recommended options are pitavastatin 4 mg once daily (AI), atorvastatin 20 mg once daily (AII), and rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily (AII). When 10-year ASCVD risk estimates are < 5%, the Panel favors initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy (CI), using the same options for moderate-intensity statin therapy as recommended for 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%. The absolute benefit from statin therapy is modest in this population; therefore, the decision to initiate a statin should take into account the presence or absence of HIV-related factors that can increase ASCVD risk. For people aged < 40 years, data are insufficient to recommend for or against statin therapy as primary prevention of ASCVD in people with HIV. Estimates are based on the ASCVD Risk Estimator from the American College of Cardiology (ACC).

### Preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease using American college of cardiology and American Heart Association prevention guidelines: some good news, but caveats remain [^115JB2ct]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

A criticism of the method of risk assessment that surfaced after the ACC/AHA prevention guidelines were published was that the pooled cohort equations used by the ASCVD risk estimator are inaccurate for some multiethnic populations. The concern is whether this requires recalibration if a decision point of 7.5% ASCVD risk is used to determine automatic statin assignment in lower risk patients for primary prevention. 3, 4, 5 In contrast, the usefulness of the 7.5% ASCVD 10‐year risk cutoff is that investigators can look at the utility of this cutoff in predictions of ASCVD on individual and population bases.

In this issue, the Journal of the American Heart Association published 2 papers that support the guidance provided by the ACC/AHA guidelines. In addition, they provide insights useful for addressing the concern noted above. Egan et al used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to determine the impact of treating US adults based on their estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk. 6 The authors determined that treating statin‐eligible untreated adults could achieve more than three‐quarters of the of the Healthy People 2020 ASCVD prevention goal. This benefit was accrued by treating all adults with 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%. Cho et al looked at the application of the ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines to 1246 asymptomatic middle‐aged primary prevention Korean participants who underwent repeated coronary artery calcium score measurements during routine health examinations. 7 They found that more participants were statin eligible as defined by the ACC/AHA guidelines (54.7%) than by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) guidelines (20.5%). 8 They then judged the performance of both guidelines by their ability to predict persons at increased risk for coronary artery calcium score progression. Participants considered statin eligible under the ACC/AHA guidelines had a significantly higher odds ratio for coronary artery calcium score progression than those considered statin eligible under the ATP III guidelines. Because coronary artery calcium score is indicative of the underlying process of atherosclerosis, the authors noted that their study showed that the method of risk estimation used in the ACC/AHA guidelines addressed this important indicator of atherosclerotic risk better than the prior ATP III guidelines.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1147bDQZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL‐C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^112WJ31f]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — Prevention emphasizes lifestyle first, with medications considered only when risk is sufficiently high within shared decision-making. The most important way to prevent ASCVD is stated as promoting a healthy lifestyle throughout life, and prevention strategies must include a strong focus on lifestyle optimization to minimize future ASCVD events. Only when a person's risk is sufficiently high should medications to reduce ASCVD risk be considered as part of a shared decision-making process, and even if BP-, lipid-lowering, or diabetes medication is ultimately prescribed, lifestyle goals should be emphasized on a regular basis.

### Statin therapy for primary prevention in men: what is the role for coronary artery calcium? [^1148ZTyk]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). Medium credibility.

Current cholesterol guidelines for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) base statin treatment decisions on multiple risk factor algorithms (e.g. Pooled Cohort Equations [PCEs]). By available PCEs, most older middle-aged men are statin eligible. But several studies cast doubt on predictive accuracy of available PCEs for ASCVD risk assessment. Recent studies suggest that accuracy can be improved by measurement of coronary artery calcium (CAC). This method has the advantage of identifying men at low risk in whom statin therapy can be delayed for several years, provided they are monitored periodically for progression of CAC. Thus, there are two approaches to statin therapy in men ≥ 55 years: first all men could be treated routinely, or second, treatment can be based on the extent of coronary calcium. The latter could allow a sizable fraction of men to avoid treatment for several years or indefinitely. Whether with initial CAC scan or with periodic rescanning, a CAC score ≥ 100 Agatston units is high enough to warrant statin therapy. In otherwise high-risk men (e.g., diabetes, severe hypercholesterolemia, 10-year risk by PCE ≥ 20%), a statin is generally indicated without the need for CAC; but in special cases, CAC measurement may aid in treatment decisions.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — intermediate and high risk targets: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended, and in intermediate risk patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more; for patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more.

### Are statins indicated in senior citizens? A review of statin therapy in the elderly [^113vETxB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of statin therapy in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has demonstrated substantial improvement in morbidity and mortality of the aging population. Despite exhaustive studies demonstrating the benefits of statin therapy linking lower cholesterol levels to decreased vascular events, statin guidelines vary greatly with age, and recommendations are unclear regarding initiation and discontinuation of statin therapy in patients 65 years and older. Data suggest that statins are highly effective at secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events and development of coronary heart disease in patients with a history of vascular disease or risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or smoking. Therefore, patients who meet these criteria, regardless of age, should begin statin therapy. There is also some evidence to suggest that statin therapy may be beneficial in primary prevention of major cardiovascular events, although these data are not as well studied as secondary prevention use of statin therapy, and should therefore be individualized for each patient.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^115HERYE]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — statin intensity and LDL-C lowering in primary prevention describes that an RCT enrolling men ≥ 55 years and women ≥ 65 years with at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor had placebo 10-year 'hard ASCVD' risk 8.7% and expanded endpoint 10%, and after 5.6 years rosuvastatin 10 mg per day produced significant absolute risk reduction. If maximal ASCVD risk reduction is desired, it is reasonable to use a high-intensity statin to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%, with increased benefit especially when 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 20%. In JUPITER, men ≥ 50 and women ≥ 60 with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2.0 mg/L and LDL-C < 130 mg/dL assigned rosuvastatin 20 mg per day achieved a median LDL-C reduction of 50% and highly significant ASCVD risk reduction at 1.9 years, and the magnitude of percent LDL-C reduction achieved determined benefit.

### Statin eligibility for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease according to 2021 European prevention guidelines compared with other international guidelines [^115Afh8d]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

For primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on statin use (hereafter European-ESC) recommend a new risk model (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 [European-SCORE2]) as well as new age-specific treatment thresholds (≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk if aged 40–49 years and ≥ 10% if aged 50–69 years).

Objective

To compare the clinical performance of the 2021 European-ESC, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (hereafter US-ACC/AHA), UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK-NICE), and 2019 ESC/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines in apparently healthy individuals.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based contemporary cohort study included 66 909 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study. Participants were aged 40 to 69 years and were free of ASCVD, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and statin use at baseline in 2003 to 2015. Mean follow-up time was 9.2 years. Data were analyzed from November 2021 to April 2022.

Exposures

Statin treatment according to guideline criteria.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Calibration of risk calculators, statin eligibility, sensitivity, and specificity for ASCVD events according to guideline criteria.

Results

During follow-up, a range of 2962 to 4277 nonfatal and fatal ASCVD events was observed, as defined by the 2021 European-SCORE2, US pooled cohort equations (PCE), and UK-QRISK3 models, and 180 fatal ASCVD events were noted as defined by the 2019 European-SCORE1 model. European-SCORE2 was slightly better calibrated with a predicted/observed ASCVD event ratio of 0.8 vs 1.3 for US-PCE, 1.3 for UK-QRISK3, and 5.8 for European-SCORE1. For primary prevention class I recommendations in individuals aged 40 to 69 years, 2862 of 66 909 (4%) qualified for statins according to the 2021 European-ESC guidelines compared with 23 029 (34%) with US-ACC/AHA, 17 659 (26%) with UK-NICE, and 13 496 (20%) with 2019 European-ESC/EAS guidelines, with associated sensitivities for detecting future European-SCORE2-defined ASCVD events of 12%, 60%, 51%, and 36%, respectively. The sensitivity of the European-ESC guidelines was improved considerably by lowering the treatment thresholds, resulting in smaller losses in specificity. To obtain similar clinical performance with the 2021 European-ESC guidelines as in the other guidelines, the threshold with European-SCORE2 should be reduced to 5% overall to match US-ACC/AHA, to 6% to match UK-NICE, and to 7% to match 2019 European-ESC/EAS guidelines.

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite an improved European-SCORE2 prediction model, the new treatment thresholds in the 2021 European-ESC guidelines dramatically reduce eligibility for primary prevention with statins in low-risk European countries. Using lower treatment thresholds can improve overall guideline performance.

### Association of primary care providers' beliefs of statins for primary prevention and statin prescription [^111CHprD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Cholesterol Management Guideline included major shifts in recommended approaches to primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1 The ACC/AHA guideline significantly expanded the population eligible for statin lipid‐lowering therapy for primary prevention, mainly by emphasizing recommendations based on estimated cardiovascular risk and abandoning low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. One study estimated that 12.8 million additional adults would be eligible for statin therapy compared with prior guidelines. 2 However, before initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention, the ACC/AHA guideline emphasized a clinician‐patient risk discussion. Although guidance has been published 3 detailing elements of discussions, little is known about how such discussions are currently being implemented in clinical practice or whether specific practices are associated with statin prescription.

Although the ACC/AHA guideline expanded the population eligible for statin therapy and recommended potentially higher doses of statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention, evidence to date indicates modest adoption in clinical practice. 4, 5, 6, 7 One study evaluated statin use in 161 cardiology practices before and after the ACC/AHA guideline, finding no significant difference in trends of use of moderate‐ to high‐intensity statins for eligible subgroups, with postguideline primary prevention use of 55.2% for diabetic patients and 46.9% for patients with no clinical ASCVD but elevated ASCVD risk. 8 A study using a national database of pharmacy and medical claims found that the ACC/AHA guideline publication was associated with a decrease in statin initiation. 9

Given that the current ACC/AHA guideline represented a substantial change in the approach to cholesterol management while also promoting individualized decision making, it is likely that clinician and patient beliefs impact decision making. The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the implementation of the ACC/AHA guideline from the perspective of primary care providers (PCPs), potentially helping to explain patterns of uptake as well as to identify potential barriers and solutions. We hypothesized that community PCPs hold varying beliefs of the risks and benefits of statin therapy and report varying approaches to statin risk discussions with patients. We further hypothesized that the following PCP survey responses, pertaining to recommended elements of informed discussions, would be associated with increased statin prescription for primary prevention: (1) greater reported statin efficacy; (2) fewer number of adverse effects believed to be caused by statins; (3) lower reported deviation from the guidelines because of other cardiovascular risk factors; and (4) lower reported discordance between PCP recommendations and patient preferences.

Primary prevention — age- and condition-specific branches identify additional statin pathways. Pediatric prevention emphasizes "Age 0–19 Lifestyle to prevent or reduce ASCVD". For young adults, "Age 20–39 y" advises to "Estimate lifetime risk to encourage lifestyle to reduce ASCVD risk" and to "Consider statin if family history premature ASCVD and LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL (≥ 4.1 mmol/L)". Very high LDL-C is addressed with "LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) No risk assessment; High-intensity statin (Class I)". Older adults follow "Age > 75 y Clinical assessment, Risk discussion". For diabetes at ages "40–75 y", guidance states "Moderate-intensity statin (Class I)" and "Risk assessment to consider high-intensity statin (Class IIa)".

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium (CAC) to guide statin therapy are outlined as follows: In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When CAC is measured to inform treatment, if the coronary artery calcium score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years when higher-risk conditions are absent; if the coronary artery calcium score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; and if the coronary artery calcium score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Primary prevention — borderline/intermediate ASCVD risk in adults aged 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD or diabetes: Patients with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL and 10-year ASCVD risk of 5% to < 7.5% were judged borderline and initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy may be considered, while those with 7.5% to < 20% are intermediate risk and the guideline recommends that such patients be considered for treatment with a moderate-intensity statin; in borderline or intermediate risk started on moderate-intensity statin, patients are recommended to achieve a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL; inadequate response is defined as < 30% reduction or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), for which routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted; if these thresholds are not achieved, the writing committee recommends consideration of escalation to a high-intensity statin.

### Evidence-based use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1135PJdz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely available, inexpensive, and represent a potent therapy for treating elevated cholesterol. Current national guidelines put forth by the Adult Treatment Panel III recommend statins as part of a comprehensive primary prevention strategy for patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at increased risk for developing coronary heart disease within 10 years. Lack of a clear-cut mortality benefit in primary prevention has caused some to question the use of statins for patients without known coronary heart disease. On review of the literature, we conclude that current data support only a modest mortality benefit for statin primary prevention when assessed in the short term (< 5 years). Of note, statin primary prevention results in a significant decrease in cardiovascular morbidity over the short and long term and a trend toward increased reduction in mortality over the long term. When appraised together, these data provide compelling evidence to support the use of statins for primary prevention in patients with risk factors for developing coronary heart disease over the next 10 years.

### Aspirin with or without statin in Individuals without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across risk Categories [^113xphh1]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The role of aspirin in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains controversial. In 2019, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommended considering prophylactic low-dose aspirin only among asymptomatic individuals at high risk of ASCVD events, low bleeding risk, and age < 70 years (IIb). In 2021, the European Society of Cardiology primary prevention guidelines endorsed a similar recommendation. More recently, the updated United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2022 guidelines recommended individualizing low-dose aspirin only among adults aged 40 to 59 years, if their 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 10% and they have low bleeding risk (Class C). In contrast, the guidelines recommend against the use of aspirin among adults ≥ 60 years (Class D). These recommendations stem from a USPSTF meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials demonstrating a significant reduction in major ASCVD events with aspirin at the cost of higher rates of major bleeding.

Statin is used as first-line therapy for the primary prevention of ASCVD due to cardiovascular benefits. Most randomized evidence favoring aspirin in primary prevention was conducted in the pre-statin era, whereas statin therapy use was more frequent at baseline in recent trials. For instance, the proportion of participants on a statin in ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly), ARRIVE (Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events), and ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes)trials were 65%, 43%, and 75%, respectively. Since statin therapy would mitigate baseline ASCVD risk, lower cardiovascular effects of aspirin in post-statin era trials might be attributable to the higher use of statin therapy. Furthermore, given a much more favorable risk-benefit profile, most patients considered for ASCVD risk reduction in current clinical practice would be expected to be on baseline statin therapy before entertaining a decision on possible aspirin initiation.

Prior studies, did not explore the potential impact of statin therapy on the net risk/benefit ratio of aspirin therapy. Therefore, this meta-analysis investigated the relative and absolute effects of aspirin in adults without ASCVD, stratified by statin use across different ASCVD risks.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111k11S8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### Primary prevention with statins in the Elderly [^112EBHgP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in high-income countries is mostly borne by the elderly. With increasing life expectancy, clear guidance on sensible use of statin therapy to prevent a first and potentially devastating ASCVD event is critically important to ensure a healthy aging population. Since 2013, 5 major North American and European guidelines on statin use in primary prevention of ASCVD have been released by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society. Guidance on using statin therapy in primary ASCVD prevention in the growing elderly population (> 65 years of age) differs markedly. The authors discuss the discrepant recommendations, place them into the context of available evidence, and identify circumstances in which uncertainty may hamper the appropriate use of statins in the elderly.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — ASCVD remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, and in the United States it is the leading cause of death with an estimated cost of > $200 billion annually in healthcare services, medications, and lost productivity. Most Americans who have had a myocardial infarction had unfavorable levels of at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor before their ASCVD event. The AHA's model of ideal cardiovascular health, referred to as Life's Simple 7, is presented, and an increasing number of ideal cardiovascular health factors have been associated with a lower prevalence and incidence of ASCVD events and other conditions; moving individuals toward ideal cardiovascular health is critically important for prevention of many important health conditions. The guideline consolidates existing recommendations and includes newly generated recommendations for aspirin use, exercise and physical activity, and tobacco use, along with recommendations related to team-based care, shared decision-making, and assessment of social determinants of health. Prevention strategies must include a strong focus on lifestyle optimization (improvements in diet, physical activity, and avoidance of tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke) to minimize the risk of future ASCVD events, and a comprehensive patient-centered approach that addresses all aspects of a patient's lifestyle habits and estimated risk of a future ASCVD event is the first step in deciding on where there may be a need for pharmacotherapy; even if a blood pressure (BP)–reducing medication, lipid-lowering medication, or diabetes medication is ultimately prescribed, lifestyle goals should be emphasized on a regular basis.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^116CRKPi]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) primary prevention risk estimation — randomized trials show statin therapy reduces ASCVD events even when control-group incidence is approximately 5.0%–7.5% 10-year risk. Thresholds referenced include ≥ 10% 10-year risk for a hard coronary heart disease (CHD) event using the ATP III Framingham Risk calculator (roughly equivalent to 15% ASCVD risk) and ≥ 15% 10-year risk for a hard ASCVD event using the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE). The PCE may overestimate risk, have not undergone a prospective 10-year validation, and measurement of coronary artery calcium (CAC) is described as useful when risk is 7.5% to 14.9% by PCE or between 5.0% and 9.9% by Framingham. Scoring calculators provide only an approximate risk estimate and there is no prospective evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that quantitative risk scoring is optimal for evaluating the need for lipid-altering therapies.

### ACC / AHA release updated guideline on the treatment of… [^117PWpLb]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

What Is New in the Guideline. FOUR STATIN BENEFIT GROUPS This updated guideline focuses on reducing the risk of ASCVD in four statin benefit groups: persons with clinical ASCVD but without clinical ASCVD; and persons without clinical ASCVD or diabetes who have LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL and an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of 7. 5% or greater. The guideline identifies high- and moderate-intensity statin therapy for use in primary and secondary prevention. Less evidence is available to support nonstatin therapy for ASCVD prevention.

The absolute risk reduction in ASCVD events associated with statin therapy can be estimated by multiplying the 10-year ASCVD risk by the anticipated relative risk reduction based on the intensity of the statin. The net ASCVD risk-reduction benefit is approximately the number of potential ASCVD events prevented with statin therapy vs. the number of potential excess adverse effects. The Expert Panel acknowledges that persons 70 years or older may have the greatest potential for risk reduction with statin use, even without other risk factors. For example, for persons in this age group, the estimated 10-year risk is 7. 5% or greater, which is a risk threshold for which a reduction in ASCVD events has been demonstrated in RCTs.

Although evidence supports continuing the use of statins beyond 75 years of age in those already tolerating the drugs, limited data were available to support the initiation of statins for primary prevention in patients older than 75 years without clinical ASCVD. PRIMARY PREVENTION IN PERSONS WITHOUT DIABETES AND WITH LDL-C LEVEL OF 70 TO 189 MG PER DL. If the 10-year risk of ASCVD is 5% to less than 7. 5%, treatment with a moderate-intensity statin is reasonable. Before initiating statin therapy, it is reasonable for clinicians and patients to engage in a discussion about the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction benefits, adverse events, drug-drug interactions, and patient preferences.

### American Heart Association national integrated ASCVD initiative: an implementation initiative to improve lipid management among patients with ASCVD [^111uQYrr]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimal management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, is a key clinical and public health priority. Cholesterol management is central to the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering being consistently proven to reduce rates of major adverse cardiovascular events. Clinical guidelines recommend lipid-lowering therapies for individuals at elevated cardiovascular risk, with therapeutic intensification to lower LDL-C targets in those with higher baseline risk, for whom the greatest absolute risk reduction is anticipated. For individuals with very high-risk ASCVD, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology Multisociety cholesterol guidelines recommend high-intensity statin therapy to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%, with the addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents if LDL-C remains at a threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. Despite extensive clinical trial evidence and strong guideline recommendations, many eligible individuals remain untreated or undertreated with statins and other lipid-lowering therapies. This indicates a need for an enhanced focus on implementation science to ensure that individuals at very high ASCVD risk receive appropriate lipid management.

### 2019 vs. 2016 ESC / EAS statin guidelines for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113FCGyS]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

The 2019 vs. 2016 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) dyslipidaemia guidelines contains new recommendations for primary prevention with statins; however, the potential impact of these changes is unclear. We compared the 2019 and 2016 guidelines regarding statin eligibility and potential impact on prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in the general population.

Methods and Results

We examined 45750 individuals aged 40–75 from the Copenhagen General Population Study, all free of ASCVD and statin use at baseline. During the 9.2-year follow-up, 3337 experienced ASCVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death). For Class I/A recommendations, 32.3% (95% confidence interval: 31.8–32.7) and 15.4% (15.1–15.7) of individuals were statin eligible according to the 2019 and 2016 guidelines. The increased statin eligibility by the 2019 guidelines was explained by lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) thresholds alone (explaining 33.2%), older age range alone (49.4%), older age range in combination with lower LDL-C thresholds (14.7%), and updated SCORE risk algorithm (2.8%). If fully implemented, the estimated percentage of ASCVD events that can be prevented by using high-intensity statins for 10years were 25% and 11% with the 2019 and 2016 guidelines. Mainly because of older age range in the 2019 guidelines, the corresponding estimated numbers needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one ASCVD event were 19 and 20.

Conclusion

Due to lower LDL-C threshold and older age range, the 2019 vs. 2016 ESC/EAS guidelines doubles the number of individuals eligible for primary prevention with statins. This considerably improves the potential for ASCVD prevention in the general population, with similar NNT to prevent one event.

### ACC / AHA guidelines superior to ESC / EAS guidelines for primary prevention with statins in non-diabetic Europeans: the copenhagen general population study [^112gizJJ]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is mainly caused by modifiable risk factors and is preventable. Nevertheless, ASCVD remains a leading cause of death, disability, and high healthcare costs worldwide. The first ASCVD presentation is often sudden and unexpected death, in which major advances in secondary prevention are of no help. Thus, the only efficient approach to restrict this undue loss of life, quality of life, and healthcare resources is primary prevention. For this purpose, public health initiatives are important, but so is personalized prevention for those at the highest risk.

The high risk strategy for primary prevention of ASCVD, including treatment of high blood cholesterol with statins, was revised recently in both the USA and Europe. These guidelines, issued by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) jointly with the American Heart Association (AHA) and by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) jointly with the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS), are all endorsing the principle of matching the intensity of preventive efforts with the absolute ASCVD risk of the individual. However, different risk prediction models are provided to estimate such risk, and different decision thresholds for, respectively, any ASCVD (ACC/AHA) and fatal ASCVD (ESC/EAS) are recommended for statin therapy. The risk prediction model recommended in the USA by the ACC and AHA is the newly introduced Pooled Cohort Equations (US-PCE) to predict any ASCVD, and in Europe by the ESC and EAS is the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation system (European-SCORE) to predict fatal ASCVD.

Which risk prediction model to prefer for optimal primary prevention of ASCVD is unknown because the US-PCE and European-SCORE prediction models have not been compared head-to-head in the target population. Despite this, a recent current opinion paper discussed the potential implications of adopting the ACC/AHA guidelines in Europe and concluded that the ESC/EAS guidelines using the European-SCORE model seem to be the most wide ranging, pragmatic, and appropriate choice for European countries. However, this conclusion was based on the opinion of experts, not a direct head-to-head comparison of the clinical performance of the guidelines using different risk prediction models and Class I and IIa recommendations. This is what we are providing in this study based on a large, contemporary, population-based European cohort.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA primary prevention scope — adults and targeted outcomes: The guideline addresses the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults (≥ 18 years of age) and focuses on outcomes of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) including acute coronary syndromes, myocardial infarction (MI), stable or unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial disease of atherosclerotic origin, and also includes heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It is intended to be a resource for the clinical and public health practice communities and presents recommendations related to lifestyle factors, other factors affecting CVD risk (eg, obesity, diabetes, blood cholesterol, high BP, smoking, aspirin use), patient-centered approaches, and considerations of the cost and value of primary prevention.

### Dyslipidemia management for cardiovascular disease… [^113kNSbh]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In primary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended when treatment is indicated.
- In secondary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended with intensification by increasing statin dose, adding ezetimibe, or adding a PCSK9 inhibitor in higher-risk patients.
- Because cholesterol values are stable over 10 years, new measurements are not needed for each risk assessment. Primary Prevention Without known cardiovascular disease, treatment decisions should be based on estimated 10-year risk calculators such as the pooled cohort equations. Treatment is recommended at a 10-year risk of 12%, which matches the populations that experienced benefit in clinical trials. People with diabetes mellitus and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least 190 mg per dL are also at high risk and should be offered treatment regardless of estimated risk.

Shared decision-making is recommended with 10-year risk between 6% and 12%, which represents populations less studied in clinical trials. Moderate-dose statins are the sole medication recommended for primary prevention. The group recommends against high-dose statins, citing lack of additional benefit and an increase in risks. The guideline does not suggest one statin over another. Because moderate dosing is recommended for all patients, the guideline does not recommend titrating dosage to a specific cholesterol level. There is no evidence that ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, icosapent ethyl, fibrates, bempedoic acid, or niacin is beneficial in primary prevention. Secondary Prevention Patients with known coronary artery disease are at high enough risk to require treatment. Moderate-dose statins are the baseline in this group because no other treatment has a greater impact on mortality.

The guideline recommends considering more intense treatment, especially in higher-risk patients. High-dose statin therapy reduced major cardiovascular events in the higher-risk patients studied. Adding ezetimibe to moderate- or high-dose statins reduces non-fatal cardiovascular events to a similar extent as high-dose statins. PCSK9 inhibitors also decrease nonfatal cardiovascular events in high-risk individuals on maximal tolerated therapy to a similar extent. Because of high cost and uncertain long-term safety, PCSK9 inhibitors are recommended only after increasing statin dose and adding ezetimibe.

### Primary prevention with statins: ACC / AHA risk-based approach versus trial-based approaches to guide statin therapy [^116VBM48]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend initiating primary prevention for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with statins based on absolute ASCVD risk assessment. Recently, alternative trial-based and hybrid approaches were suggested for statin treatment eligibility.

Objectives

This study compared these approaches in a direct head-to-head fashion in a contemporary population.

Methods

The study used the CGPS (Copenhagen General Population Study) with 37,892 subjects aged 40 to 75 years recruited in 2003 to 2008, all free of ASCVD, diabetes, and statin use at baseline.

Results

Among the population studied, 42% were eligible for statin therapy according to the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) risk assessment and cholesterol treatment guidelines approach, versus 56% with the trial-based approach and 21% with the hybrid approach. Among these statin-eligible subjects, the ASCVD event rate per 1,000 person-years was 9.8, 6.8, and 11.2, respectively. The ACC/AHA-recommended absolute risk score was well calibrated around the 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk treatment threshold and discriminated better than the trial-based or hybrid approaches. Compared with the ACC/AHA risk-based approach, the net reclassification index for eligibility for statin therapy among 40- to 75-year-old subjects from the CGPS was -0.21 for the trial-based approach and -0.13 for the hybrid approach.

Conclusions

The clinical performance of the ACC/AHA risk-based approach for primary prevention of ASCVD with statins was superior to the trial-based and hybrid approaches. Our results indicate that the ACC/AHA guidelines will prevent more ASCVD events than the trial-based and hybrid approaches, while treating fewer people compared with the trial-based approach.

### Personalizing treatment: between primary and secondary prevention [^116MmVat]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of patients with elevated blood cholesterol increasingly emphasize assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in deciding when to initiate pharmacotherapy. The decision to treat is based primarily on mathematical integration of traditional risk factors, including age, sex, race, lipid values, systolic blood pressure, hypertension therapy, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Advanced risk testing is selectively endorsed for patients when the decision to treat is otherwise uncertain, or more broadly interpreted as those patients who are at so-called "intermediate risk" of ASCVD events using traditional risk factors alone. These new guidelines also place new emphasis on a clinician-patient risk discussion, a process of shared decision making in which patient and physician consider the potential benefits of treatment, risk of adverse events, and patient preferences before making a final decision to initiate treatment. Advanced risk testing is likely to play an increasingly important role in this process as weaknesses in exclusive reliance on traditional risk factors are recognized, new non-statin therapies become available, and guidelines are iteratively updated. Comparative efficacy studies of the various advanced risk testing options suggest that coronary artery calcium scoring is most strongly predictive of ASCVD events. Most importantly, coronary artery calcium scoring appears to identify an important subgroup of patients with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis-who are "between" primary and secondary prevention-that might benefit from the most aggressive lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — management of primary severe hypercholesterolemia notes that patients with primary severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL [≥ 4.9 mmol/L]) have a high risk of ASCVD and premature and recurrent coronary events, and although no randomized, placebo-controlled trials have been done exclusively in this group, a placebo-controlled primary-prevention study in men with mean baseline LDL-C of 192 ± 17 mg/dL showed reduced MI and cardiovascular death with pravastatin 40 mg daily. These findings were extended in a post hoc analysis of 2,560 exclusively primary-prevention subjects and in a 20-year observational post-trial long-term follow-up study, and maximally tolerated statin therapy should be administered to patients with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115HpJdw]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) evidence assessment — The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit, and concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to less than 10% has at least a small net benefit; it concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older.

Lower-risk adults — statin value and CAC testing: Benefit from statin therapy is also seen in lower-risk individuals, and for those in the 5% to < 7.5% risk range, available generic statins are cost-effective; although a coronary artery calcium score can be useful in select individuals, it will be positive less often in this lower-risk group than in those with higher levels of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and is not recommended routinely.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^117SzPjZ]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — statins in diabetes states that most patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes are at intermediate or high risk (PCE ≥ 7.5% 10-year risk) of ASCVD events, and three of 4 double-blinded primary-prevention RCTs of moderate statin therapy in this age range showed significant reductions in ASCVD events. A meta-analysis found moderate-intensity statin therapy was associated with a risk reduction of 25%, similar to people without diabetes and with no apparent difference between type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM; therefore, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated for primary prevention in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes. Residual risk remained high in trials (e.g., 8.5% had major cardiovascular events in 3.8 years), no RCTs of high-intensity statin therapy have been carried out exclusively in diabetes, and high-intensity statin therapy is preferred in patients with diabetes as they develop risk modifiers.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^112S8QXr]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, preventing ASCVD requires a coordinated response across primary and secondary care to diagnose and manage patients according to their risk profile. As the major modifiable causal factor for atherosclerosis, lowering LDL-C is the primary target and appropriate modification of dietary and lifestyle risk factors is the starting point. The updated 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines recommend a move towards intensive lowering of LDL-C, which is warranted on scientific grounds and achievable in clinical practice. Implementation strategies are needed to apply current knowledge, guidelines and clinical judgement to the benefit of those at highest risk.

Coronary artery calcium measurement — selected candidates and caveats — Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely and those concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms are listed, as are older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with pooled cohort equations (PCE)–calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5% with factors that increase their ASCVD risk. Caveats include that if patient is at intermediate risk and if a risk decision is uncertain and a CAC score is obtained, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the CAC score in 5 to 10 years, and that, if CAC is recommended, it should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.
