## Question

A 48-year-old presents with acute, painful, asymmetric sensorimotor deficits involving the radial and peroneal nerves. Nerve conduction studies confirm mononeuritis multiplex, which is documented as the primary diagnosis for the encounter. Which ICD-10-CM code should be assigned for billing?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be assigned for billing when a 48-year-old presents with acute, painful, asymmetric sensorimotor deficits involving the radial and peroneal nerves and nerve conduction studies confirm mononeuritis multiplex as the primary diagnosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and whether the terminology maps directly to an ICD-10-CM code. Then, I should verify the exact ICD-10-CM code for mononeuritis multiplex and confirm whether it requires laterality or other extensions. Next, I will check for any etiologic codes that might take precedence if the cause is known, and finally, I will ensure the code is used appropriately as the primary diagnosis for billing and documentation purposes.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis. Mononeuritis multiplex is a multifocal neuropathy characterized by acute, painful, asymmetric involvement of multiple noncontiguous nerve trunks, which fits the description of radial and peroneal nerve deficits confirmed on nerve conduction studies, so the diagnostic label is accurate and specific enough for coding purposes [^fc214259] [^7c4b919f].

> Now, I need to find the exact ICD-10-CM code. Wait, let me verify the alphanumeric code. The correct ICD-10-CM code for mononeuritis multiplex is G58.7, and I should confirm that this code does not require laterality or a seventh character, which it does not, unlike some mononeuropathy codes that specify right, left, or bilateral with a seventh character [^fc214259] [^5e1c6ada].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I should check whether a more specific etiologic diagnosis is known that would change the primary code. If the mononeuritis multiplex is due to a systemic vasculitis, Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, or another identifiable cause, the etiologic code would typically be sequenced first with G58.7 as an additional code to capture the neuropathy phenotype; however, in this scenario, no specific cause is provided, so G58.7 stands as the most specific and appropriate primary diagnosis code for billing [^f6b4c714] [^09301243] [^639f9bad].

> I should confirm the coding hierarchy and billing implications. Since mononeuritis multiplex is documented as the primary diagnosis for the encounter, G58.7 should be listed first on the claim, and any secondary conditions or suspected etiologies can be added as additional diagnoses if supported by documentation, which aligns with standard ICD-10-CM sequencing and billing practices [^d06e16db].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code to assign for billing is G58.7 for mononeuritis multiplex, and no laterality or extension is required for this code [^fc214259].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for mononeuritis multiplex confirmed by nerve conduction studies is **G58.7** (Mononeuritis multiplex). This code should be used as the primary diagnosis for billing, with additional codes for any identified etiology (e.g. vasculitis, diabetes, Lyme disease) if known. If the etiology is unspecified, **G58.7 alone is appropriate**.

---

## ICD-10-CM code for mononeuritis multiplex

The ICD-10-CM code for mononeuritis multiplex is **G58.7**, defined as "Mononeuritis multiplex" [^fc214259]. This code encompasses multiple mononeuropathies involving two or more nerves in separate anatomical regions, consistent with the clinical scenario described.

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding relies on thorough clinical documentation. For mononeuritis multiplex, the following elements should be documented:

- **Clinical findings**: Detailed description of the asymmetric sensorimotor deficits, including the specific nerves involved (e.g. radial and peroneal nerves) [^7c4b919f].
- **Diagnostic confirmation**: Documentation of nerve conduction studies confirming mononeuritis multiplex [^fc214259].
- **Etiology**: If known, document the underlying cause (e.g. vasculitis, diabetes mellitus, Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, leprosy) [^f6b4c714] [^09301243] [^639f9bad] [^49436a89].

---

## Additional ICD-10-CM codes for underlying etiologies

If the underlying etiology of mononeuritis multiplex is known, it is important to code it in addition to G58.7. Common etiologies and their corresponding ICD-10-CM codes include:

| **Etiology** | **ICD-10-cm code** |
|-|-|
| Vasculitis (systemic or non-systemic) | G58.7 (primary) + M31.0-M31.9 (vasculitis codes) |
| Diabetes mellitus | G58.7 (primary) + E11.42 (diabetic polyneuropathy) |
| Lyme disease | G58.7 (primary) + A69.22 (Lyme disease) |
| Sarcoidosis | G58.7 (primary) + D86.89 (sarcoidosis with other organ involvement) |
| Leprosy | G58.7 (primary) + A30.9 (leprosy, unspecified) |

---

## Coding scenario: 48-year-old patient with mononeuritis multiplex

Given the clinical scenario of a 48-year-old patient presenting with acute, painful, asymmetric sensorimotor deficits involving the radial and peroneal nerves, confirmed by nerve conduction studies as mononeuritis multiplex, the appropriate ICD-10-CM code is **G58.7**. If the underlying etiology is identified during the encounter, the corresponding etiology code should be added as a secondary diagnosis.

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for mononeuritis multiplex confirmed by nerve conduction studies is **G58.7**. Accurate coding requires comprehensive clinical documentation, including the clinical findings, diagnostic confirmation, and any identified underlying etiology. If the etiology is known, additional codes should be included to provide a complete clinical picture.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19 [^511e7619]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

At the time of writing, 102 COVID-19-positive patients have been treated in the ICUs in our hospital, 44 of these have been discharged home, 14 have been transferred to other hospitals for further rehabilitation, 11 are still recovering in our hospital and 33 have died. Not all of the discharged patients have yet been seen for follow-up so additional cases of mononeuropathy may still come to light. Whilst mononeuropathies are a well-recognised complication of anaesthesia and intensive care, the number of affected patients (at least 16% of those discharged from ICU in our hospital), the number of nerves affected in each patient (an average of just over 3 per patient), and the particular nerves involved (such as the proximal sciatic) are all outside common experience. There have been previous descriptions of bilateral sciatic neuropathies resulting from intensive care, with the patient initially being mistakenly thought to have critical illness neuropathy, but such patients are sufficiently uncommon to warrant individual case reports.

### Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19 [^5a1fdcf1]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The prolonged mechanical ventilation that is often required by patients with severe COVID-19 is expected to result in significant intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) in many of the survivors. However, in our post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic we have found that, as well as the anticipated global weakness related to loss of muscle mass, a significant proportion of these patients also have disabling focal neurological deficits relating to multiple axonal mononeuropathies. Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such a mononeuritis multiplex. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to relate simply to "critical illness neuromyopathy". While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are surprisingly frequent and often disabling in patients recovering from severe COVID-19.

### Discovering monogenic patients with a confirmed molecular diagnosis in millions of clinical notes with monoMiner [^27f57a23]. Genetics in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cohort building is a powerful foundation for improving clinical care, performing biomedical research, recruiting for clinical trials, and many other applications. We set out to build a cohort of all monogenic patients with a definitive causal gene diagnosis in a 3-million patient hospital system.

Methods

We define a subset (4461) of OMIM diseases that have at least 1 known monogenic causal gene. We then introduce MonoMiner, a natural language processing framework to identify molecularly confirmed monogenic patients from free-text clinical notes.

Results

We show that ICD-10-CM codes cover only a fraction of monogenic diseases and that even where available, ICD-10-CM code‒based patient retrieval offers 0.14 precision. Searching by causal gene symbol offers great recall but has an even worse 0.07 precision. MonoMiner achieves 6 to 11 times higher precision (0.80), with 0.87 precision on disease diagnosis alone, tagging 4259 patients with 560 monogenic diseases and 534 causal genes, at 0.48 recall.

Conclusion

MonoMiner enables the discovery of a large, high-precision cohort of patients with monogenic diseases with an established molecular diagnosis, empowering numerous downstream uses. Because it relies solely on clinical notes, MonoMiner is highly portable, and its approach is adaptable to other domains and languages.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^77d27c46]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision) is the next major revision of the ICD by the World Health Organization (WHO). ICD-11 differs dramatically from historical versions, as it is based on an underlying semantic network of terms and meaning, called the Foundation. To function as a mutually exclusive and exhaustive statistical classification, ICD-11 creates derivative linearizations from the network that is a monohierarchy with residual categories such as Not Elsewhere Classified. ICD-11 also introduces the widespread post-coordination of terms, which allows for highly expressive representation of detailed patient descriptions. Phenotyping features are included in many subchapters or the signs and symptoms chapter. Composite phenotype descriptions of specific presentations or syndromes can be represented though post-coordination. Rare diseases are well represented in the Foundation, though not all appear in the relatively shallow linearization hierarchies.

### Coding long COVID: characterizing a new disease through an ICD-10 lens [^8b5d10be]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The recent release of ICD-10-CM code U09.9 to codify long COVID will undoubtedly assist with future case ascertainment and computable phenotyping. However, a large number of patients who developed long COVID prior to October 1, 2021, continue to be burdened with symptoms, and must also be included in data-driven cohort identification efforts for trial recruitment and retrospective analyses. Considering the caveats around the rate of uptake among clinicians and late timing of the code's release, we recommend that when characterizing long COVID using EHRs, U09.9 should not be used alone, but rather in combination with other strategies such as more complex computable phenotypes. Our findings from the characterization of patients with the U09.9 diagnosis may be of use in refining phenotypes to identify pre-U09.9 patients that might have long COVID. There is a clear utility to the characterization of early use of U09.9, as it represents the first "hook" in EHR data that can be used to identify and assess current diagnostic and treatment patterns at scale. Moreover, given the heterogeneous presentation of long COVID, clustering of co-existing conditions and potential symptoms may be valuable in informing future development of more detailed criteria for the diagnosis of long COVID and its subtypes.

### Classification and diagnosis of patients with medically unexplained symptoms [^82fb0e45]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) have little or no demonstrable disease explanation for the symptoms, and comorbid psychiatric disorders are frequent. Although common, costly, distressed, and often receiving ill-advised testing and treatments, most MUS patients go unrecognized, which precludes effective treatment. To enhance recognition, we present an emerging perspective that envisions a unitary classification for the entire spectrum of MUS where this diagnosis comprises severity, duration, and comorbidity. We then present a specific approach for making the diagnosis at each level of severity. Although our disease-based diagnosis system dictates excluding organic disease to diagnose MUS, much exclusion can occur clinically without recourse to laboratory or consultative evaluation because the majority of patients are mild. Only the less common, "difficult" patients with moderate and severe MUS require investigation to exclude organic diseases. By explicitly diagnosing and labeling all severity levels of MUS, we propose that this diagnostic approach cannot only facilitate effective treatment but also reduce the cost and morbidity from unnecessary interventions.

### Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19 [^71665520]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This series of cases highlights an important neurological complication occurring frequently in patients with severe COVID-19, which detrimentally affects long-term outcomes and markedly influences their rehabilitation needs. Given that, this complication is evident in a significant proportion of the patients discharged from the intensive care units of a single hospital (16% in our cohort of treated patients) and the rehabilitation burden globally could be substantial. Furthermore, given the high expectation of ICUAW, these focal deficits may go unnoticed.

The underlying aetiology of these neuropathies remains to be established. Mechanical factors related to patient handling and positioning are recognised to occasionally cause focal neuropathy, raising the possibility that perhaps patients with severe COVID-19 are very much more susceptible to such nerve injuries. Against this, we saw no evidence for the demyelinating features typically seen in such injuries, and many of our patients had neuropathies at sites that would be highly unusual for compression or traction (including musculocutaneous, proximal median and high sciatic neuropathies). From a clinical and electrophysiological perspective, the neurological deficits we have seen in our patients have much in common with vasculitic neuropathies such as lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (Bruns–Garland syndrome) and brachial neuritis (Parsonage–Turner syndrome). However, these syndromes are usually, but not always, proceeded by considerable pain, which was not a common feature in our cohort. However, since our patients developed their deficits while they were sedated and ventilated, this phase of the illness was necessarily obscured. Furthermore, post-mortem studies have confirmed that vasculitis is prominent in a range of tissues in patients dying from COVID-19, although peripheral nerve tissue has not yet been specifically examined. The aetiology of this vasculitis is also uncertain, but might relate to an endotheliopathy resulting from the "cytokine storm" that is so characteristic of these patients, or perhaps the microthrombi that are known to frequently occur in COVID-19. The elevations of Interleukin 6 and d-dimer seen in these patients are in keeping with these respective processes, but the broad ranges seen do not clearly support one above the other.

Arthritis Care & Research (2021). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for Lyme disease, more specifically with respect to indications for screening (neurological manifestations), AAN/ACR/IDSA 2021 guidelines recommend to test for Lyme disease in patients with epidemiologically plausible exposure to ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi and presenting with one or more of the following:

- acute meningitis

- painful radiculoneuritis

- mononeuropathy multiplex including confluent mononeuropathy multiplex

- acute cranial neuropathies (particularly VII, VIII, less commonly III, V, VI, and others)

- evidence of spinal cord (or rarely brain) inflammation, particularly in association with painful radiculitis involving related spinal cord segments.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

### Diagnostic characteristics of nerve conduction study parameters for vasculitic neuropathy [^fc214259]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

This study and its methods were approved by the institutional review board of the University of Michigan.

We conducted a case–control, hospital‐based study at the University of Michigan between January 2000 and April 2021. For the case subjects, we retrospectively identified all patients with a diagnosis of VN using the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD‐10) codes G58.7 (mononeuritis multiplex), G63 (polyneuropathy in disease classified elsewhere), and I77.6 (arteritis). For these patients we reviewed the electronic medical records to confirm diagnosis based on Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS) criteria as outlined below.

We included patient ages 18 and older who had NCS completed at our institution, including at least one nerve (sural, fibular motor, tibial motor, median sensory, median motor, ulnar sensory, ulnar motor, or radial sensory) on both sides. We selected the first NCS performed after symptom onset. If there were 2 NCS within 12 mo, we selected the NCS with the largest number of nerves that were studied bilaterally. A pathologist reviewed all the nerve biopsy reports and classified them as definite, probable, possible, or no VN according to the PNS pathological criteria. Patients had to meet criteria for pathologically definite VN or clinically probable VN established by the PNS. We classified the patients as systemic VN (SVN) and non‐systemic VN (NSVN).

For the control group, we used EMGPro, an institutional database of electrodiagnostic study results, to search for patients coded as 'axonal neuropathy' who had bilateral NCS and similar nerves tested to the cases, between January 2005 and April 2021. We reviewed their electronic medical records and selected the patients who had a clinical symmetric axonal polyneuropathy, with no concerns for vasculitic or another inflammatory etiology.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Risk of neuropathy among 28, 232 patients with biopsy-verified celiac disease [^f33e3551]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Earlier research on celiac disease (CD) and neuropathy has been hampered by the use of inpatient data, low study power, and lack of neuropathic characteristics.

Objective

To examine the relative risk and absolute risk of developing neuropathy in a nationwide population-based sample of patients with biopsy-verified CD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Between October 27, 2006, and February 12, 2008, we collected data on small-intestinal biopsies performed at Sweden's 28 pathology departments between June 16, 1969, and February 4, 2008. We compared the risk of neuropathy in 28,232 patients with CD (villous atrophy, Marsh 3) with that of 139,473 age- and sex-matched controls. Cox proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for neuropathy defined according to relevant International Classification of Diseases codes in the Swedish National Patient Register (consisting of both inpatient and outpatient data).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Neuropathy in patients with biopsy-verified CD.

Results

Celiac disease was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of later neuropathy (95% CI, 2.1–3.0; P < .001). We also found an increased risk (with results reported as HRs [95% CIs]) of chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (2.8; 1.6–5.1; P = 0.001), autonomic neuropathy (4.2; 1.4–12.3; P = 0.009), and mononeuritis multiplex (7.6; 1.8–32.4; P = 0.006), but no association between CD and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (0.8; 0.3–2.1; P = 0.68).

Conclusions and Relevance

We found an increased risk of neuropathy in patients with CD. This statistically significant association in a population-based sample suggests that CD screening should be completed in patients with neuropathy.

### Validation of international classification of diseases codes for the epidemiologic study of dermatomyositis [^b6acb104]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the validity of using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code 710.3 to identify adult patients with dermatomyositis in outpatient and inpatient settings.

Methods

Electronic medical records of adult patients with ICD-9 code 710.3 between January 2001 and November 2014 (n = 511) were examined. Physician diagnosis, clinical findings, and diagnostic testing results were recorded. A dermatomyositis rating scale was assigned based on classic cutaneous findings and at least 2 additional clinical and diagnostic findings from the Bohan criteria. Sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPVs) were determined. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the accuracy of multiple ICD-9 codes in the outpatient setting, as well as primary and secondary inpatient codes.

Results

The sensitivity and PPV for multiple 710.3 ICD-9 codes in the outpatient setting were 0.89 and 0.35, respectively. The PPV for primary and secondary 710.3 inpatient codes was 0.95 and as high as 0.8. However, the sensitivity of ICD-9 code 710.3 was poor in the inpatient setting (primary 0.23 and secondary 0.26). The most common reason for failure to meet appropriate dermatomyositis criteria was miscoding as diabetes mellitus (32%), followed by diagnosis at an outside institution (19%), dermatomyositis as a rule-out diagnosis (10%), cutaneous dermatomyositis (8%), and juvenile dermatomyositis (6%).

Conclusion

One or more occurrences of ICD-9 code 710.3 is insufficient to support the diagnosis of dermatomyositis in the outpatient setting. However, ICD-9 710.3 codes appear to be valid in the inpatient setting.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Coding long COVID: characterizing a new disease through an ICD-10 lens [^4f3f9073]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Naming diseases is an ever-present challenge, and there is no shortage of efforts that aim to better standardize, disambiguate, and keep track of disease nomenclature and definitions. Disease naming has long been controversial–for example, there are more than 400 names for syphilis dating back to the fifteenth century. Naming a disease requires defining it, and assigning a standard code to the disease facilitates research, care, and patient engagement due to the ease of patient classification and knowledge exchange. However, naming and coding a disease does not mean the disease did not exist prior to its naming or coding. For instance, although "SARS-CoV-2" and "COVID-19" were both coined on February 11, 2020, by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses and the World Health Organization (WHO), respectively, we know that cases of COVID-19 began to surface in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. In the USA, most diagnostic coding uses the International Classification of Diseases 10th edition, clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) terminology; however, the ICD-10-CM code for COVID-19, U07.1, was not made available for use until April 1, 2020. The implications of this naming delay are wide-ranging. To this day, US COVID-19 cases prior to April 1, 2020, are difficult to retrospectively ascertain. Even after that date, use of U07.1 for COVID-19 phenotyping came with caveats–use of the new code was inconsistent and of variable sensitivity and specificity, and studies have shown both underuse and overuse of U07.1 in different contexts and health systems.

### Use of the postacute sequelae of COVID-19 diagnosis code in routine clinical practice in the US [^52a97a6c]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

These findings present an early description of how physicians are using the post–COVID-19 condition ICD-10-CM code in routine care settings. This diagnosis code is being used to identify patients with illness following the acute phase of infection in patients of all ages. However, manifestations of post–COVID-19 include a wide range of conditions. Although this code could provide a quantifiable method to measure the burden of post–COVID-19 using clinical practice data, further use of this code for research is limited until a standard definition of post–COVID-19 is agreed upon by the medical and public health community. It will be important to monitor how the use of this code changes as the pandemic continues to evolve. Additional follow-up studies are warranted in other data sources as data becomes available.

### Neurosarcoidosis presenting as mononeuritis multiplex [^639f9bad]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, with prevalence ranging from 1 to 50 per 100,000. Neurologic involvement occurs in up to 5% of patients but can be the initial presentation of sarcoidosis in 50% of those affected by neurosarcoidosis. The authors report a case of mononeuritis multiplex of the ulnar and then the radial nerve that subsequently led to a diagnosis of sarcoidosis in a patient 8 mos after initial presentation. It is important that neurosarcoidosis be in the differential diagnosis of mononeuritis multiplex when other causes cannot be found because early treatment could help prevent progression to other nerves.

### Coding long COVID: characterizing a new disease through an ICD-10 lens [^cc8a076a]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Long COVID, which is included in the more general term of post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC), is also subject to the effects of delayed naming. By Spring of 2020, patients suffering from long COVID had coined various terms to describe the condition, including the COVID-19 long tail, long-haul COVID, and long COVID. Long COVID is defined by ongoing, relapsing, or new symptoms or other health effects occurring after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e. present four or more weeks after the acute infection). Heterogeneous symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fatigue, difficulty breathing, brain fog, insomnia, joint pain, and cardiac issues. As the impact of long COVID on health and quality of life became increasingly clear at a population level, patients worldwide came together to urge healthcare systems and policymakers to acknowledge this condition.

Despite the relatively early recognition of this condition, an ICD-10-CM code (U09.9, "Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified") was not made available for use in the clinical setting until October 2021. Moreover, this single code may prove insufficient: considering the phenotypic and severity variation seen in long COVID patients, it is likely that subtypes of long COVID exist, and such subtypes may correlate with specific underlying mechanisms that should be targeted by different interventions.

Regardless, the fact remains that there is more naming to be done, and a particular need to define and refine computable phenotypes for long COVID and its subtypes. As can be seen by the widely differing estimates of long COVID prevalence across many studies, a lack of definitional consistency is affecting the accuracy and reproducibility of otherwise robust research. Among other advantages, refined definitions will enable us to appropriately define cohorts for clinical studies, provide more precise treatment and clinical decision support, and accurately estimate long COVID's incidence and prevalence. This is a key priority for the parent program for this work, the NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, which seeks to understand, treat, and prevent PASC through a wide variety of research modalities, including electronic health record (EHR) and real-world data.

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^0c0feee4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The transition to ICD-10 afforded the potential of increased granularity of inflammatory arthritides diagnosis codes for clinical care, research, and billing purposes. This quality improvement study found that, despite a 30-fold increase in codes, adoption of ICD-10 has been poor; only 2.1% of available codes were used more than 1% of the time and were nonspecific. This may reflect the lack of financial incentive for accurate ICD-10 coding, because ICD-10 is not tied to reimbursement.

When assessed by year, the percentage of codes used with regularity did not increase. When assessed by clinician specialty, the percentage of codes used was not better for rheumatologists (who might be expected to be more refined users of such codes) than primary care clinicians. This study is limited by potential coding inaccuracies and cannot establish causality.

Overall, consistent with findings in other areas, the data suggest room for better application of inflammatory arthritis codes. This will be important in years to come if the benefits of ICD expansion are to be realized.

### Treatment for cutaneous arteritis patients with mononeuritis multiplex and elevated C-reactive protein [^1d3b46c9]. The Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Cutaneous arteritis (cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa, CA) is a necrotizing vasculitis of arteries within the skin. CA is a new classification under single-organ vasculitis, as adopted by the 2012 Chapel Hill consensus conference (CHCC 2012). Some patients originally diagnosed as having CA could develop additional disease manifestations that warrant reclassifying as systemic polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) according to the CHCC 2012. We retrospectively investigated 101 patients with CA seen at our department between 2003 and 2012. There was a significantly higher frequency of inflammatory plaques and leg edema in CA patients with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to CA patients with normal CRP. Similarly, there were significant differences in the incidence of arthralgia and mononeuritis multiplex between the two patient groups. We found significantly positive correlations between CRP and creatinine titers in serum in all 101 CA patients. Prednisolone was administrated in a significantly greater percentage of patients with elevated CRP compared to patients with normal CRP. Repeated i.v. cyclophosphamide pulse therapy (IV-CY) with prednisolone therapy at an early stage resulted in complete resolution without adverse effects or severe complications. We regard inflammatory plaques and leg edema with elevated serum CRP as an indication of a more severe condition, and treated them effectively with prednisolone. Assuming mononeuritis multiplex and/or arthritis exist with elevated CRP, we propose that earlier treatment by IV-CY with prednisolone should be indicated for CA patients who demonstrate these more severe manifestations to prevent progression to PAN.

### Coding long COVID: characterizing a new disease through an ICD-10 lens [^c21b8f63]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Naming a newly discovered disease is a difficult process; in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the existence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), which includes long COVID, it has proven especially challenging. Disease definitions and assignment of a diagnosis code are often asynchronous and iterative. The clinical definition and our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID are still in flux, and the deployment of an ICD-10-CM code for long COVID in the USA took nearly 2 years after patients had begun to describe their condition. Here, we leverage the largest publicly available HIPAA-limited dataset about patients with COVID-19 in the US to examine the heterogeneity of adoption and use of U09.9, the ICD-10-CM code for "Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified".

Methods

We undertook a number of analyses to characterize the N3C population with a U09.9 diagnosis code (n = 33,782), including assessing person-level demographics and a number of area-level social determinants of health; diagnoses commonly co-occurring with U09.9, clustered using the Louvain algorithm; and quantifying medications and procedures recorded within 60 days of U09.9 diagnosis. We stratified all analyses by age group in order to discern differing patterns of care across the lifespan.

Results

We established the diagnoses most commonly co-occurring with U09.9 and algorithmically clustered them into four major categories: cardiopulmonary, neurological, gastrointestinal, and comorbid conditions. Importantly, we discovered that the population of patients diagnosed with U09.9 is demographically skewed toward female, White, non-Hispanic individuals, as well as individuals living in areas with low poverty and low unemployment. Our results also include a characterization of common procedures and medications associated with U09.9-coded patients.

Conclusions

This work offers insight into potential subtypes and current practice patterns around long COVID and speaks to the existence of disparities in the diagnosis of patients with long COVID. This latter finding in particular requires further research and urgent remediation.

3.2. Case coding

One of the prepared cases referred to a diagnosis (Chronic peripheral neuropathic pain) that had not yet been implemented in the ICD-11 at the time of the field trial, and therefore was excluded from evaluation, leaving 13 pain diagnoses for 11 cases to be rated per participant. Taken together, the participants rated 1342 cases, each case was rated by between 67% (119/177) and 75% (132/177) of participants. Participants assigned the correct code for the pain diagnosis in 83.9% of cases, and in 98.4% of cases, participants reported having no difficulty in assigning the diagnosis (Table 2). The aggregated clinical utility (the mean for the individual facets) was high across all cases (4.3 ± 0.90) on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all useful) to 5 (very useful) and all single cases (Table 2).

Morbidity coding rules

Morbidity rule 1 (MB1): Several conditions recorded as the "main condition." Select the "main condition" for which the patient received care. Extension codes may be used to indicate different types of main condition (eg, reason for admission or main resource condition). In cases where the main condition cannot be determined based on documentation, select the condition that is mentioned first.
Morbidity rule 2 (MB2): Condition recorded as "main condition" is presenting symptom of diagnosed, treated condition. If a symptom or sign (ICD-11 chapter 21) or a problem (ICD-11 chapter 24) is recorded as the "main condition," and this is obviously a sign, symptom, or problem of a diagnosed condition coded elsewhere, and care was given to the latter, reselect the diagnosed condition as the "main condition."
Morbidity rule 3 (MB3): Signs and symptoms. When a symptom or sign is documented as the "main condition," and it is documented that it could be caused by either one condition or another, select the symptom or sign as "main condition."

Immune-related neuropathy (irNeuropathy)

Subtypes, evaluation and definitions of irNeuropathy syndromes are presented in table 5. The rationale for common, possible and uncommon disease-specific testing is outlined.

Table 5
irNeuropathy

Common

Serum testing evaluates for alternative causes of neuropathy and signs of autoimmunity/inflammation. Serum testing may be abnormal but not explain the clinical phenotype (ie, B 12 deficiency would not explain a demyelinating neuropathy; a mildly elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) would not explain an immune-mediated polyradiculopathy). Definite irNeuropathy can be achieved in such cases as long as concordance between clinical phenotype and testing is considered when applying the diagnostic criteria. EDX confirm or exclude large fiber neuropathy and characterize the type, severity, and chronicity of neuropathy if present (ie, sensory and/or motor, axonal and/or demyelinating, length-dependent or non-length-dependent). Demyelinating features or a non-length-dependent and/or asymmetric pattern of neuropathy can help distinguish irNeuropathies from chemotherapy-related neuropathies, which are more typically symmetric and axonal. EDX also evaluates for other etiologies (ie, focal entrapment neuropathy, radiculopathy, myopathy). Coexisting myopathy and NMJ disorders must be excluded in patients with prominent motor involvement with EDX and CK. Spinal imaging is often obtained to exclude metastatic disease, focal structural radiculopathy, and spinal stenosis; it may demonstrate spinal nerve root enhancement/enlargement in inflammatory radiculopathies. MRI brain with contrast is obtained when cranial nerve involvement is suspected, which may show smooth enhancement of cranial nerves.

Possible

If the diagnosis or the etiology is uncertain, LP with CSF analysis may provide further support of an immune-mediated process in certain neuropathy phenotypes (such as Guillain-Barré syndrome) and exclude infection or malignancy. CSF shows cytoalbuminologic dissociation in immune-mediated neuropathies; however, lymphocytic pleocytosis (white blood cell count < 50) is common in this patient group and cytoalbuminologic dissociation may be absent in the first week after symptom onset. Selected additional laboratory tests may be performed based on patient factors and the neuropathy phenotype (ie, mononeuritis multiplex would warrant a vasculitis workup) but are not required for all patients. Bedside pulmonary function tests and/or swallowing evaluation is obtained in patients with a Guillain-Barré phenotype to screen for or monitor respiratory dysfunction or dysphagia but are not included in the diagnostic criteria.

### Peripheral neuropathy in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides: insights from the DCVAS study [^7c4b919f]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Definition of VN

The presence of neuropathy and its phenotype were determined by the investigator without further guidance by the CRF. Nerve biopsy was performed at the discretion of the treating physician. In the DCVAS CRF, all biopsy diagnoses were coded as normal, nondiagnostic, consistent with vasculitis but not definite, definite vasculitis, or unspecified tissue inflammation. Criteria for these findings were not further defined in the CRF and therefore at the discretion of the local pathologist.

VN was defined using 3, nonmutually exclusive items of the DCVAS CRF ("mononeuritis multiplex", "sensory neuropathy", and "motor neuropathy") occurring in the context of the diagnosis of AAV, the nerve histology diagnosis, and the "peripheral neuropathy" entry in the VDI (completed by the investigator 6 months after diagnosis). Because of the low rate of biopsy-proven VN diagnosis, we performed a subset analysis by stratifying VN according to its level of diagnostic certainty into definite, probable, or possible categories. Definite VN required "definite" vasculitis by nerve biopsy. For probable VN, we required: (1) nerve biopsy "consistent with vasculitis but not definite" AND "sensory" or "motor neuropathy"; OR (2) "mononeuritis multiplex". Possible VN was assumed if (1) "sensory neuropathy" without "diabetes mellitus" OR "motor neuropathy" was recorded in the CRF; OR (2) "peripheral neuropathy" was marked in the VDI.

Neuropathic phenotypes were classified as a multiple mononeuropathy (mononeuritis multiplex checked on CRF, with or without concomitant coding of sensory neuropathy and motor neuropathy), sensory neuropathy (only sensory neuropathy checked on the CRF), motor neuropathy (only motor neuropathy checked on the CRF), diffuse sensorimotor polyneuropathy (sensory and motor neuropathy but not mononeuritis multiplex checked on the CRF), or unspecified (appeared in the VDI but not the CRF). The sensorimotor vs sensory vs motor character of the multifocal neuropathies was not consistently detailed in the CRF, precluding an overall assessment of functional modality involvement. EMG/NCS confirmation was not required but performed in 153 (57%) VN cases. Neuropathy "due to radiculopathy" was excluded.

### Recent developments in classification criteria and diagnosis guidelines for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^f53ac416]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

DIAGNOSIS

The newly developed classification criteria provide robust methods for identifying IIM cases for research purposes; however, their use is not designed nor recommended for use in clinical practice.

Accurate diagnosis of an IIM is key to appropriate treatment instigation, prognostication and prevention of complications. However, diagnosis and subtype identification in clinical settings can be challenging, in part due to potential multisystem involvement and wide variations between subtype manifestations. Currently, no clear diagnostic criteria for the IIMs exist. However, findings from clinically focused research studies can aid a clinician's diagnostic accuracy, identification of factors associated with prognosis and guide investigation of multisystem involvement.

A middle-aged man of South Asian decent presented with a 4-month history of bilateral sensory disturbance affecting the median nerve distribution and dorsum of both feet. Neurological examination was otherwise normal. A patchy absence of sensory responses was noted on nerve conduction studies and electromyogram (NCS/EMG). Over the next 3 months sensory symptoms progressed to involve median, radial, ulnar, sural and peroneal nerves bilaterally. Repeat NCS/EMG confirmed a mononeuritis multiplex predominantly involving the sensory fascicles. Areas of hypopigmentation, a right-lower motor facial weakness and ophthalmic branch trigeminal nerve involvement were noted on examination. Punch skin biopsy as well as sural nerve biopsy demonstrated chronic granulomatous inflammation without evidence of Mycobacterium. A slit skin smear test demonstrated Mycobacterium leprae consistent with a diagnosis of primary neuritic leprosy. In the appropriate clinical context, leprosy should be included in the differential diagnosis of mononeuritis multiplex.

Results

Case ascertainment

A total of 1637 potential cases were identified. After removal of duplicates, manual electronic patient record review and application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a cohort of 255 cases of expert-determined definite incident IIM was established (seefor details). All included cases had a minimum core set of data including a formal assessment of power (and distribution of weakness), a documented creatine kinase (CK) level, serological status, the presence or absence of dysphagia and biopsy status available to allow for the criteria to be applied. The more common underlying diagnoses in the excluded cases were inherited myopathies, such as a dystrophy or metabolic myopathy; primary neurological conditions with elevated CK levels, such as motor neurone disease; acquired causes of myositis that are not primarily immune mediated, such as toxic rhabdomyolysis or critical illness polyneuromyopathy; or simply an error in clinical episode coding. In addition, a substantial proportion of the MSA-positive cases were ultimately interpreted as false positives and excluded. 1

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity," and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity." Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice." New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness," and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs." To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service," exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms."

2.2.1. Line coding

For the line coding, 18 diagnostic terms ("lines") were selected to reflect the range of chronic pain conditions relevant for morbidity coding, and reference codes were prepared for the ICD-11 as well as for the ICD-10. For the ICD-11, reference standards were the 2017 MMS codes. For the ICD-10, only in 50% of the cases a reference standard existed; in the other cases, the "correct" diagnosis was an auxiliary way of expressing the syndrome in ICD-10. The auxiliary code consisted of a combination of etiological codes plus some code for chronic pain (R52.1 or R52.2) (cf S1, Supplementary information, available at). The auxiliary codes were allowed to give the ICD-10 the best chance despite the large number of missing diagnoses for chronic pain.

For each line presented, the participant had to determine the appropriate codes in the ICD-10 (using a link to the ICD-10 browser, 2016 version) and the ICD-11 (using a link to 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 MMS and a special coding tool). The starting point (ICD-10 or ICD-11) was randomized. After coding the lines, the participants were asked whether they had encountered any difficulty in assigning the code (yes or no); whether the level of specificity was appropriate (not detailed enough or just right or too detailed); and whether they had experienced any ambiguity in making the assignment (no or yes, because…).

### 2022 American College of Rheumatology / European alliance of associations for rheumatology classification criteria for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^4e41772b]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop and validate revised classification criteria for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).

Methods

Patients with vasculitis or comparator diseases were recruited into an international cohort. The study proceeded in 5 phases: 1) identification of candidate criteria items using consensus methodology, 2) prospective collection of candidate items present at the time of diagnosis, 3) data-driven reduction of the number of candidate items, 4) expert panel review of cases to define the reference diagnosis, and 5) derivation of a points-based risk score for disease classification in a development set using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression, with subsequent validation of performance characteristics in an independent set of cases and comparators.

Results

The development set for EGPA consisted of 107 cases of EGPA and 450 comparators. The validation set consisted of an additional 119 cases of EGPA and 437 comparators. From 91 candidate items, regression analysis identified 11 items for EPGA, 7 of which were retained. The final criteria and their weights were as follows: maximum eosinophil count ≥ 1×10 9 /liter (+5), obstructive airway disease (+3), nasal polyps (+3), cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) or anti-proteinase 3 ANCA positivity (-3), extravascular eosinophilic predominant inflammation (+2), mononeuritis multiplex/motor neuropathy not due to radiculopathy (+1), and hematuria (-1). After excluding mimics of vasculitis, a patient with a diagnosis of small- or medium-vessel vasculitis could be classified as having EGPA if the cumulative score was ≥ 6 points. When these criteria were tested in the validation data set, the sensitivity was 85% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 77–91%) and the specificity was 99% (95% CI 98–100%).

Conclusion

The 2022 American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria for EGPA demonstrate strong performance characteristics and are validated for use in research.

The authors describe a 25-year-old male with systemic vasculitis fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for both granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis) and polyarteritis nodosa. The patient was diagnosed with granulomatosis with polyangiitis following a mediastinal biopsy which revealed necrotising granulomas of the large airways, a positive cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and high antiproteinase 3 antibody titre. He then developed acute right-sided abdominal and testicular pain as well as areas of hyperaesthesia and parasthesiae on both lower limbs. He was found to have focal crescentic glomerulonephritis and mononeuritis multiplex, in keeping with his diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, as well as two areas of infarction in his right testicle and multiple aneurysms of his hepatic and right renal arteries, more typical of polyarteritis nodosa. His symptoms developed 6 weeks after hepatitis B vaccination, which may have played an aetiological role.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^d94d131b]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Others have similarly developed ICD-10-CM code sets for comorbidity indices developed during the ICD-9-CM era. Quan et al. constructed ICD-10-CM coding algorithms for the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities using Canadian administrative data. They found the frequency of most comorbidities to be similar between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM coding algorithms and the ICD-10-CM code set to either match or outperform the ICD-9-CM versions in predicting in-hospital mortality. As in our study, peptic ulcer disease was a condition that differed in frequency between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM. Glasheen et al. have since updated the ICD-10-CM coding for the Charlson Comorbidity Index, validating the predictive performance of ICD-10-CM codes for hospital admission and mortality. Sears and Rundell developed updated ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM code lists for the Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI), assessing concordance before and after the transition to ICD-10-CM. The frequency of individual comorbidities was consistent between coding algorithms for thirteen of eighteen comorbidities. While the Functional Comorbidity Index retained predictive value for hospital length of stay with ICD-10-CM codes, there was an interaction between the index and coding algorithm suggesting modest reduced performance with ICD-10-CM codes. Our findings are in agreement with these studies; appropriate ICD-10-CM code sets for comorbidity indices can have concordance with ICD-9-CM versions and retain predictive value for health outcomes.

Comorbidity burden is a crucial determinant of long-term outcomes that include mortality and functional status among people with rheumatic diseases (,–). Thus, we tested the validity of the ICD-10-CM codes by assessing the predictive ability of the RDCI score for mortality and functional status. As expected, higher RDCI scores, indicating a greater comorbidity burden, were associated with higher mortality risk and poorer functional status during follow-up in both the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM cohorts. Moreover, metrics of overall model performance (AIC, QICu) for predicting these same outcomes in each cohort also showed substantial improvement when the RDCI was included. Together, these findings demonstrate that the RDCI calculated with the proposed ICD-10-CM codes maintains expected predictive value for key long-term outcomes.

### Two algorithms for the reorganisation of the problem list by organ system [^7da01806]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2019). High credibility.

Others have introduced the idea of reorganising the problem list by organ system to improve usability. At least one terminology vendor has introduced software that will allow the reorganising of the problem list by organ system within some EHRs. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of reorganising the problem list by organ system. We have shown that when problems are mapped to either ICD-10-CM codes or SNOMED CT codes, approximately 75% of the problems on typical problem lists can be categorised by organ system (table 3). When we examined 2170 unique problems in use at our health centre, the ICD-10-CM grouping algorithm assigned all but 295 ICD-10-CM codes to an organ system, and the SNOMED CT grouping algorithm assigned all but 305 SNOMED CT codes to an organ system (tables 1 and 3). Of the 2170 unique problems examined, the algorithms were concordant for 1958 of the problems (90%). Reasons for lack of concordance between the two reorganising algorithms are twofold. First, ICD-10-CM is a monohierarchy, whereas SNOMED CT is a polyhierarchy. Diseases and disorders are assigned to only one organ system in ICD-10-CM, whereas they may be assigned to one, two or more organ systems in SNOMED CT (see table 5). For example, diabetic neuropathy (E13.42) in ICD-10-CM is assigned to endocrine disorders, whereas SNOMED CT (SCT 230572002) assigns diabetic neuropathy to both neurological disorder and endocrine disorder. Second, SNOMED CT and ICD-10-CM handle signs and symptoms somewhat differently. ICD-10-CM defines 'R' codes as 'less well-defined conditions and symptoms that, without the necessary study of the case to establish a final diagnosis, point perhaps equally to two or more diseases or two or more systems… '.SNOMED CT distinguishes between clinical findings and disorders. SNOMED CT defines clinical findings as 'normal/abnormal observations, judgments, or assessments of patients' and disorders as 'always and necessarily an abnormal clinical state'. In general, SNOMED CT is more conservative and will not assign a sign or symptom to an organ system if it is compatible with more than one organ system.

Aligning rare diseases to structured medical data

Based on previous work. we integrated multiple biomedical ontologies and terminologies to map rare diseases and their symptoms to structured medical data (i.e. diagnostic billing codes). To generate a set of rare diseases for analysis, we first used the Human Disease Ontologyto obtain mappings between the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) databaseand the ICD10-CM terminologies. Building on previous work, we curated the OMIM-to-ICD10-CM alignments, selecting and grouping ICD10-CM codes that reliably mapped to a single or homogenous set of OMIM diseases, ensuring that the disorders were also annotated within the Human Phenotype Ontology. This resulted in 166 rare, Mendelian conditions that were aligned to both the HPO and ICD10 terminologies (Supplementary Fig. 1). The 166 diseases were sorted according to their diagnostic prevalence in the UCSF-CDW; 50 disorders were selected for follow up testing (see Supplementary Methods; listed in Supplementary Data 1).

The HPO symptoms themselves were aligned to the ICD10-CM terminology in an automated fashion by integrating the information contained within multiple biomedical ontologies –. Details regarding the alignment are provided in the Supplementary Methods. This resulted in 1674 unique alignments between HPO terms and ICD10-CM codes (Supplementary Data 2). We assessed their performance by using them as features in a rare disease diagnosis prediction task (Supplementary Fig. 2). We found that prediction models constructed from the annotated, ICD10-CM-aligned HPO terms had performances that were similar to models constructed using the complete ICD10-CM codebook (see Supplementary Table 1).

Cryptic phenotype analysis

Cryptic phenotype analysis (CPA) refers to the process by which a set of symptoms is used to infer a univariate, quantitative trait that captures the clinical heterogeneity observed within a disease of interest. This quantitative but cryptic phenotype can be used to assess clinical variability in both the diagnosed cases and the more general population, enabling the types of analyses described above. CPA consists of two stages. In the first, the symptoms annotated to a particular disease are decomposed into a low-dimensional set of quantitative, latent phenotypes. In the second stage, the trait that best captures disease morbidity (i.e. its symptom expressivity) is identified, since multiple latent traits are often recovered from a single symptom matrix.

### Common genetic variation associated with mendelian disease severity revealed through cryptic phenotype analysis [^4f135a5f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Results

A phenotype-driven approach to identifying Mendelian disease modifiers

Figure 1 outlines the approach taken to identify common-variant modifiers of Mendelian disease severity. It assumes that the Mendelian disorder of interest maps to the severely affected extreme of a spectrum of phenotypic variation (Fig. 1a, upper left). This implies that disease-related morbidity is not limited to the Mendelian cases but is instead spread throughout a larger subset of the population. Critically, this spectrum of variation cannot be measured directly. Instead, the trait is analyzed implicitly by a clinician, who translates their observations into a set of symptoms (Fig. 1a, lower left). These symptoms are then documented in the medical record, typically as a combination of structured and unstructured data. Building upon previous work, we aligned structured electronic medical record (EMR) data (i.e. ICD10 diagnostic codes, see Supplementary Fig. 1 and the "Methods" section) to the symptoms annotated within the human phenotype ontology. This enabled us to construct a symptom matrix that encodes the severity of specific Mendelian diseases (Fig. 1a, right). This symptom matrix can then be used to recover cryptic, quantitative traits that summarize disease variability (Fig. 1b).

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^593e9e91]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study design and patient population

We performed a cohort study within the Veterans Affairs Rheumatoid Arthritis (VARA) registry. This study has been approved by the NWIHCS VA Subcommittee of Human Studies (IRB). The VARA registry is a multicenter prospective cohort of U.S. veterans, > 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with RA by a rheumatologist and fulfill the 1987 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. We assembled ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM cohorts within VARA over two separate time periods immediately before and after the transition to ICD-10-CM to represent the different classification eras in the U.S. (Figure 1). A subgroup of patients was included in both cohorts. Within each period, the initial two years were designated as comorbidity ascertainment (ICD-9-CM: October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2015; ICD-10-CM: January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017). Patients were then followed from the index date (ICD-9-CM: October 1, 2015; ICD-10-CM: January 1, 2018) up to December 31, 2021, termed the outcome observation period. A three-month gap between the introduction of ICD-10-CM in the U.S. and the start of our ICD-10-CM cohort was implemented to account for healthcare systems and providers acclimating to the new coding system.

For the current study, VARA participants were included if they were alive as of the index date, had enrolled in the VA at least two years prior to the index date, and had at least one VARA visit during the two years prior to the index date. Participants could contribute to both the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM cohorts.

Translating ICD-9-CM codes to ICD-10-CM codes

We translated the previously validated ICD-9-CM codes to ICD-10-CM codes using tools available from the websitesand. The websites are owned and operated by Alkaline Software and the tools provide comprehensive lists of ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes, as well as suggested conversions between the two classification systems. Utilizing these tools, a list of potential ICD-10-CM codes and their descriptions for each comorbidity in the RDCI was generated (Table 1). The list was reviewed by a physician for clinical relevance and accuracy.

### Frequency, diagnosis, and management of polymyalgia rheumatica in Germany-database analysis of medical insurance data [^8ca261b1]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Variables and measures

PMR patients were identified as such if at least one outpatient or inpatient main or secondary diagnosis ICD-10 GM code M35.3 was present in the respective study year. For additional validation of a first confirmed outpatient diagnosis, at least one further confirmed outpatient diagnosis, or an inpatient main or secondary diagnosis had to be present within three quarters after the index quarter (so called M2Q criterion). For patients with a first inpatient PMR diagnosis, the admission date of the respective hospital case was determined as the PMR index date. In the case of a first outpatient PMR diagnosis, the date of the first contact with the diagnosing physician (via the first billed code according to the uniform evaluation standard) was determined.

Patient characteristics include sex (female/male) and age. Age was defined as years on 1 January of the respective study year or at an index date (for incident patients only).

The main outcome is the 1-year prevalence and incidence of PMR according to the case definition of PMR patients. In addition, we reported predefined comorbidities of interest, defined by ICD-10 GM codes for inpatient or outpatient diagnoses. Data on comorbidities were gathered for each study year separately. Hence, not only pre-existing (before PMR diagnosis) but also newly diagnosed comorbidities were considered. Additionally, we evaluated predefined treatments, defined by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system, of which at least one prescription was filled in the respective year. As a further outcome, the specialist groups of the physicians who made the incident diagnosis were analysed. In addition, the groups of physicians who prescribed predefined medication to both prevalent and incident PMR patients were also analysed.

### Automated clinical coding: what, why, and where we are? [^23a3419f]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction: what is (automated) clinical coding?

Clinical coding is the task of transforming medical records, usually presented as free texts written by clinicians, into structured codes in a classification system like ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision). For example, in Scotland, this means to apply a standard process to classify information about patients into appropriate diagnosis and procedure codes in ICD and OPCS (OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures), finally contributing to the Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR01) national data set. The purpose of clinical coding is to provide consistent and comparable clinical information across units of care and over time. The resulting national data are used to support areas, such as health improvement, inform healthcare planning and policy and add to the epidemiological understanding of a wide variety of conditions, so confidence in the data is essential. Also, codes are mainly used for billing purposes in the US. For introductory slides about clinical coding in the UK provided by NHS Digital, see Clinical coding for non coders.

Clinical coding is a non-trivial task for humans. The process of coding usually includes data abstraction or summarisation. More specifically, an expert clinical coder is expected to decipher a large number of documents about a patient's episode of care, and to select the most accurate codes from a large classification system (or an ontology), according to the contexts in the various documents and the regularly updated coding guidelines. For example, coding in the US adopts the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), which has around 68,000 diagnosis codes; ICD-10 is also the main classification for coding in the UK. There is a standard process for manual coding to ensure data consistency: textual analysis, summarisation, and clearly defined steps to classification into codes (or the four steps of analyse, locate, assign, and verify as suggested by the NHS digital in the coding standard of 2021 [6, p.11]). The process minimises the risk of introducing variations caused by artefacts (potentially leading to wrong decision making), thus collecting and analysing data and applying the standard is important. There are regularly updated guidelines and standards for coding (e.g. in Public Health Scotland). Usually, it can take months or longer to train an expert clinical coder in the NHS (National Health Service) in the UK, and worldwide.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Localized neurological necrotizing vasculitides. three cases with isolated mononeuritis multiplex [^b2b95a71]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Localized vasculitic neuropathies are increasingly reported. We describe 3 cases of peripheral neuropathy with necrotizing vasculitis confined to nerves and muscles without systemic involvement. These neuropathies were severe and relapsing, in contrast to a usually benign prognosis. Our cases appear to be isolated vasculitic neuropathies, with vasculitis strictly limited to the peripheral neuromuscular system without nonspecific clinical and/or biological systemic involvement.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^7e2b2302]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update and validate the Rheumatic Disease Comorbidity Index (RDCI) utilizing International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes.

Methods

We defined ICD-9-CM (n = 1,068) and ICD-10-CM (n = 1,425) era cohorts (n = 862 in both) spanning the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition in a multicenter, prospective rheumatoid arthritis registry. Information regarding comorbidities was collected from linked administrative data over 2-year assessment periods. An ICD-10-CM code list was generated from crosswalks and clinical expertise. ICD-9- and ICD-10-derived RDCI scores were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). The predictive ability of the RDCI for functional status and death during follow-up was assessed using multivariable regression models and goodness-of-fit statistics (Akaike's information criterion [AIC] and quasi information criterion [QIC]) in both cohorts.

Results

Mean ± SD RDCI scores were 2.93 ± 1.72 in the ICD-9-CM cohort and 2.92 ± 1.74 in the ICD-10-CM cohort. RDCI scores had substantial agreement in individuals who were in both cohorts (ICC 0.71 [95% confidence interval 0.68–0.74]). Prevalence of comorbidities was similar between cohorts with absolute differences < 6%. Higher RDCI scores were associated with a greater risk of death and poorer functional status during follow-up in both cohorts. Similarly, in both cohorts, models including the RDCI score had the lowest QIC (functional status) and AIC (death) values, indicating better model performance.

Conclusion

The newly proposed ICD-10-CM codes for the RDCI-generated comparable RDCI scores to those derived from ICD-9-CM codes and are highly predictive of functional status and death. The proposed ICD-10-CM codes for the RDCI can be used in rheumatic disease outcomes research spanning the ICD-10-CM era.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^e325508b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### Epidemiology of adult idiopathic inflammatory myopathies in a U.S. managed care plan [^23fba243]. Muscle & Nerve (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies have a reported incidence of 0.1 to 1 per 100,000 person-years and prevalence of 0.55 to 6 per 100,000 in the United States.

Methods

We retrospectively examined medical claims for adults aged ≥ 18 years with myositis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 710.3 [dermatomyositis], 710.4 [polymyositis], and 728.81 [interstitial myositis]) from 2003 to 2008 in a large US managed care database.

Results

The incidence and prevalence cohorts comprised 1,941 and 3,112 subjects, respectively. From 2003 to 2008, the adjusted annual incidence of myositis ranged from 5.8 to 7.9 per 100,000 person-years, and the annual prevalence of myositis ranged from 14.0 to 17.4 per 100,000.

Conclusions

The incidence and prevalence of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies in the managed care plan studied was higher than previously reported in the United States. Because of the limitations inherent in claims analysis, additional research is needed to substantiate these results.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — coding and documentation: Women who meet the criteria for rUTI should have this diagnosis added to their problem list to help alert other providers and ensure best practices, and the International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is important for correct classification; the ICD-10 code of "positive urine culture" can be used instead of UTI or asymptomatic bacteriuria when a urine culture is positive but the clinical criteria are not met for a UTI.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^9939bc72]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

ICD-11

ICD-11 will succeed ICD-10 as the current version of the ICD managed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in June, 2018. ICD-10 was completed in 1990, making the interval between versions 28 years, the longest interval in the history of the ICD. Work began on ICD-11 in 2007, with the intention to make a more comprehensive and computable version of the ICD than previously available. As an aside, readers should be aware that many countries create an expanded version of the WHO ICD revision, such as the United States (ICD-10-CM), Australia (ICD-10-AM), Canada (ICD-10-CA), and Germany (ICD-10-GM). An aspiration is that ICD-11 many not require any country-specific extensions.

Foundation component

A key architectural component of the ICD is the presence of a semantic network of words and terms, which forms the backbone of all statistical tabulations of the ICD-11 that derives from it. This the Foundation component, which is a large and deep polyhierarchy of medical concepts without any residual terms. The Foundation clearly violates the two conditions of a statistical classification, which remains the core use-case of the ICD; thus, a statistical tabulation must be created to accommodate the requirements of a statistical classification (below). However, the Foundation persists as a rich resource of terms, concepts, multiply parented relationships, and detail that is far in excess of what would be sensible in a statistical classification. As a practical matter, the Foundation semantic network has superseded the historical ICD index and become a basis for semi-automatic and algorithmic coding of terms into ICD rubrics.

Another novel feature of Foundation terms is that each has a small information model of globally unique identifiers (URIs), fully specified terms, definitions, synonyms, language variants, and many axial properties, such as options for anatomy, severity, extent, or etiology.

### Neurologic disorders in immunocompetent patients with autochthonous acute hepatitis E [^023a6b0f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Mononeuritis Multiplex

Six patients (3 men and 3 women, patients 1–6) had mononeuritis multiplex; their median age was 54 years (range 25–77 years). Mononeuritis multiplex was defined by asymmetric, asynchronous involvement of the noncontiguous nerve trunks. All patients had experienced neuropathic pain and paresthesia in > 1 nerve segments with hyporeflexia or areflexia. For 3 patiens, an electromyogram showed asymmetric axonal neuropathy, and various patterns of nerve involvement were observed. Patients 1 and 6 had confluent but asymmetric (> 50%) lower-limb neuropathy (musculocutaneous and external saphenous). Patients 3 and 4 had multiple radicular or proximal troncular neuropathies, and patient 5 had troncular median and internal brachial cutaneous-nerve involvement. Three patients had asthenia and 1 had jaundice; HEV RNA was detected by PCR in serum samples from 4 patients (patients 1, 2, 5, 6).

One patient (patient 6) received specific antiviral treatment. He was given ribavirin, initially at a dose of 400 mg for 7 days (5.5 mg/kg/d) and was then given 600 mg/day (8.5 mg/kg/d) for 3 months. A serum specimen was negative for HEV after 10 days of treatment. Patient 3 was given corticosteroids for 10 weeks. Five patients had no sequelae at the last follow-up (median 33 weeks [range 4–157 weeks]). One patient (patient 2), at the last follow-up at 4 weeks, had ongoing paresthesia in a nerve segment in the lower limbs.

### Chronic pain as a symptom or a disease: the IASP classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^c86dbba0]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is a major source of suffering. It interferes with daily functioning and often is accompanied by distress. Yet, in the International Classification of Diseases, chronic pain diagnoses are not represented systematically. The lack of appropriate codes renders accurate epidemiological investigations difficult and impedes health policy decisions regarding chronic pain such as adequate financing of access to multimodal pain management. In cooperation with the WHO, an IASP Working Group has developed a classification system that is applicable in a wide range of contexts, including pain medicine, primary care, and low-resource environments. Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists or recurs for more than 3 months. In chronic pain syndromes, pain can be the sole or a leading complaint and requires special treatment and care. In conditions such as fibromyalgia or nonspecific low-back pain, chronic pain may be conceived as a disease in its own right; in our proposal, we call this subgroup "chronic primary pain". In 6 other subgroups, pain is secondary to an underlying disease: chronic cancer-related pain, chronic neuropathic pain, chronic secondary visceral pain, chronic posttraumatic and postsurgical pain, chronic secondary headache and orofacial pain, and chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain. These conditions are summarized as "chronic secondary pain" where pain may at least initially be conceived as a symptom. Implementation of these codes in the upcoming 11th edition of International Classification of Diseases will lead to improved classification and diagnostic coding, thereby advancing the recognition of chronic pain as a health condition in its own right.

### Exploring the utility of multiplex infectious disease panel testing for diagnosis of infection in different body sites: a joint report of the Association for Molecular Pathology, American Society for Microbiology, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and pan American society for clinical virology [^da8fbecf]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2023). High credibility.

Cost and reimbursement for multiplex infectious disease panel testing — mechanisms and challenges for inpatient and outpatient settings are described, with NTAP context and coverage nuances. The article explains that "costs associated with inpatient care are reimbursed on the basis of diagnosis-related group codes and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)/Procedure Coding System codes (Medicare part A coverage) and outpatient care from Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (Medicare part B coverage)," and notes that the New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) program "provides some support for new tests used for inpatient care" but "the NTAP payment is time limited." For outpatient testing and inpatient testing with an NTAP code, laboratories are "reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis," and reimbursement has transitioned from "stacking miscellaneous CPT codes" to "a limited number of analyte-specific CPT codes and American Medical Association–awarded proprietary laboratory analyses codes." Local coverage determinations "provide coverage of panel testing with limited, specific use cases for respiratory tract… and gastrointestinal tract panels," yet "tests with an assigned CPT code or a proprietary laboratory analysis code are not guaranteed reimbursement," and codes, coverage determinations, and prices "are separate processes." Tools to support access include "CPT or proprietary laboratory analyses codes, cost-effectiveness models, budget impact models, clinical utility studies, and clinical practice guidelines." In the absence of direct reimbursement or NTAP for inpatient testing, revenue may derive from "cost avoidance… or hospital cost savings associated with improved patient outcomes (eg, decreased length of stay, improved quality of care, and reduction in unnecessary antibiotic use)," but demonstrating such benefits "remains a significant challenge," and "the laboratory is in competition with other departments (cost centers)… Laboratory directors need to develop a business case to justify the new test in competition for available resources."

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^c3c19630]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A recent IASP consensus meeting in Valencia, Spain, addressed another important CRPS diagnostic subtype issue. In both the 1994 and 2012 versions of the IASP criteria, there was no CRPS subtype category to capture patients who had previously been diagnosed with CRPS, then improved sufficiently to no longer meet the full criteria but suffered from continued symptoms requiring ongoing care. This significant clinical issue prompted the proposal of a new formal CRPS subtype termed "CRPS with Remission of Some Features." This subtype will be included in the new ICD-11 version of the CRPS criteria. It should be applied only to patients who were documented to meet full CRPS criteria at an earlier point in time but who currently do not display sufficient signs and symptoms to meet full criteria. Patients in this category are not necessarily improved with regards to pain intensity nor are they free of all CRPS-related signs and symptoms, and they may "relapse." We empirically note the occasional patient who may fully meet diagnostic criteria one day and not the next. It is critical for legal and insurance reasons that temporarily not meeting criteria, for whatever reason, is not considered equal to a "cure" of the condition, particularly given the known lability of CRPS features.

A final CRPS subtyping issue is the distinction between CRPS-Type I (without "major nerve damage") and CRPS-Type II (with "major nerve damage"; see Table 2). This is an historical distinction carried over into the 1994 IASP CRPS criteria based on the previously separate diagnostic categories of RSD (now CRPS-Type I) and Causalgia (now CRPS-Type II). At the time of the Budapest consensus group meeting, there was broad agreement that problems do exist with creating this division given the large overlap in clinical features between them (i.e. the primary diagnostic criteria are identical). The group was concerned that these divisions are dependent on nebulous definitions of what constitutes "major nerve damage," and regarding what tests or criteria were necessary to make this distinction (e.g. electrodiagnosis, which is almost always too painful). Despite agreement that the CRPS-Type I vs. Type II distinction may neither be clinically significant nor affect the specific therapeutic method used, this distinction was retained by the Budapest group largely for historical reasons, and remains a formal subtype in the 2012 IASP CRPS criteria and the CRPS criteria to be included in the new ICD-11, pending more data.

### Peripheral neuropathy in systemic lupus erythematosus: what can neuromuscular ultrasonography (NMUS) tell us? A cross-sectional study [^ce5c83ed]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Forty-one patients with SLE were found to be eligible for the study, of whom four were excluded (two died and two refused to perform the NCS). Moreover, two healthy subjects refused the NCS examination.

The baseline characteristics of both groups are shown in table 1. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean values of age, height, weight, body mass index or gender between the two groups (p > 0.05). Fourteen patients (37.8%) had clinical peripheral polyneuropathy manifestations (paresthesia, allodynia or hyperalgesia, numbness, burning and tingling). Thirty-six patients had asymmetrical polyneuropathy (according to NCS). Of them, 29 (80.6%) had mixed polyneuropathy, 7 (19.4%) had sensory polyneuropathy while only 1 (2.7%) showed electrical changes of mononeuritis multiplex. The number of individual nerve affection based on patients' clinical examination is also listed in table 1.

Outcome

We defined three groups of neuroinflammatory events using the 10th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), together with a fourth definition combining the following three (ie, having at least one of them): (1) demyelinating events (DML), including DML of the central nervous system and optic neuritis (ICD-10 G35, G36.0, G36.8, G36.9, G37.1, G37.3, G37.5, G37.8, G37.9, G04.8, G04.9, H46 and H48.1); (2) IPN, including inflammatory and drug-induced polyneuropathies (ICD-10 G61.0, G61.8 and G61.9); and (3) MS (ICD-10 G35; also included in DML). For each treatment cohort, the first registration with any of the neuroinflammatory outcome diagnosis codes was retrieved from the National Patient Register, recorded as main or secondary diagnosis in outpatient care or hospitalisation.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Use of the postacute sequelae of COVID-19 diagnosis code in routine clinical practice in the US [^505766f9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A new International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code (U09.9 Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified) was introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on October 1, 2021.

Objective

To examine the use of the U09.9 code and describe concurrently diagnosed conditions to understand physician use of this code in clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study of US patients with an ICD-10-CM code for post-COVID-19 condition used deidentified patient-level claims data aggregated by HealthVerity. Children and adolescents (aged 0–17 years) and adults (aged 18–64 and ≥ 65 years) with a post-COVID-19 condition code were identified between October 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. To identify a prior COVID-19 diagnosis, 3 months of continuous enrollment (CE) before the post-COVID-19 diagnosis date was required.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Presence of the ICD-10-CM U09.9 code.

Results

There were 56 143 patients (7723 female patients [61.2%]; mean [SD] age, 47.6 [19.2] years) with a post-COVID-19 diagnosis code, with cases increasing in mid-December 2021 following the trajectory of the Omicron case wave by 3 to 4 weeks. The analysis cohort included 12 622 patients after the 3-month preindex CE criteria was applied. Among this cohort, the median (IQR) age was 49 (35–61) years; however, 1080 (8.6%) were pediatric patients. The U09.9 code was used most often in the outpatient setting, although 305 older adults (14.0%) were inpatients. Only 698 patients (5.5%) had at least 1 of the 5 codes listed as possible concurrent conditions in the coding guidance. Only 8879 patients (70.4%) had a documented acute COVID-19 diagnosis code (569 [52.7%] among children), and the median (IQR) time between acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 diagnosis codes was 56 (21–200) days. The most common concurrently coded conditions varied by age; children experienced COVID-19-like symptoms (eg, 207 [19.2%] had cough and 115 [10.6%] had breathing abnormalities), while 459 older adults aged 65 years or older (21.1%) experienced respiratory failure and 189 (8.7%) experienced viral pneumonia.

Conclusions and Relevance

This retrospective cohort study found patients with a post-COVID-19 ICD-10-CM diagnosis code following the acute phase of COVID-19 disease among patients of all ages in clinical practice in the US. The use of the U09.9 code encompassed a wide range of conditions. It will be important to monitor how the use of this code changes as the pandemic continues to evolve.

### Isolated sensory manifestations in neuralgic amyotrophy: report of eight cases [^9dc79431]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

A series of eight patients with isolated clinical and electrophysiological sensory deficit related to neuralgic amyotrophy (NA) is reported. NA was diagnosed by clinical and electrodiagnostic features and disease course. Imaging and laboratory investigations excluded other disorders. The results showed mild to severe involvement of eight individual sensory nerves: lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve lesions in three instances and partial lesions of the median nerve in five cases. Our findings suggest that isolated clinical and electrodiagnostic sensory involvement in NA is not exceptional but rather is unrecognized. The pattern of these nerve lesions agrees with the most typical pattern of NA, which is a mononeuritis or mononeuritis multiplex. The present study also shows that the spectrum of NA is diverse and may vary from pure motor to pure sensory deficit, according to the nature of the involved nerve fibers.

### Simulation of ICD-9 to ICD-10-CM transition for family medicine: simple or convoluted? [^3f7280a1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the transition from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to Interactional Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), on family medicine and to identify areas where additional training might be required.

Methods

Family medicine ICD-9-CM codes were obtained from an Illinois Medicaid data set (113,000 patient visits and $5.5 million in claims). Using the science of networks, we evaluated each ICD-9-CM code used by family medicine physicians to determine whether the transition was simple or convoluted. A simple transition is defined as 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to 1 ICD-10-CM code, or 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to multiple ICD-10-CM codes. A convoluted transition is where the transitions between coding systems is nonreciprocal and complex, with multiple codes for which definitions become intertwined. Three family medicine physicians evaluated the most frequently encountered complex mappings for clinical accuracy.

Results

Of the 1635 diagnosis codes used by family medicine physicians, 70% of the codes were categorized as simple, 27% of codes were convoluted, and 3% had no mapping. For the visits, 75%, 24%, and 1% corresponded with simple, convoluted, and no mapping, respectively. Payment for submitted claims was similarly aligned. Of the frequently encountered convoluted codes, 3 diagnosis codes were clinically incorrect, but they represent only < 0.1% of the overall diagnosis codes.

Conclusions

The transition to ICD-10-CM is simple for 70% or more of diagnosis codes, visits, and reimbursement for a family medicine physician. However, some frequently used codes for disease management are convoluted and incorrect, and for which additional resources need to be invested to ensure a successful transition to ICD-10-CM.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^b8d061e3]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2.2. Case coding

The case coding examined the ICD-11 alone. The main objective was testing the morbidity rule application concerning the chronic pain diagnoses. For this purpose, 12 short case vignettes (mean length = 78 words, range: 50–113 words) were prepared. Each vignette featured 2 or more health conditions, at least one of which was a chronic pain condition. The vignette stated a main condition and an "other condition," without listing the ICD-11 codes. (Table 1, vignette texts, cf supplementary information S2, available at).

Table 1
Chronic pain and other conditions featured in the vignettes in the case coding.

In 10 of the vignettes, the main condition was specified correctly according to the morbidity rules; in 2 of the vignettes, the rules had been misapplied intentionally to test the participants' application of the rules in connection with chronic pain. In a first step, the participants had to provide the appropriate ICD-11 codes for each condition. In a second step, they had to judge whether the main condition was identified correctly (yes or no). For each diagnosis, we recorded whether they met with any difficulty in finding the code. At the end of each vignette, the participants rated the clinical utility of the new chronic pain code (0 = not at all to 5 = very useful) according to 3 questions: How useful is this classification (1) to describe this case in communications to colleagues (communication), (2) in facilitating the management of patients (management), and (3) for the collection of data, eg, for clinical or population databases (documentation)?

2.2.3. General evaluation

After the participant had completed rating the lines or cases, an additional questionnaire became available in which the participant rated the overall coverage of the conditions in the ICD-11 (5 = very good or 1 = very poor), the level of detail (not detailed enough or just right or too detailed), and the ease of use (5 = very easy or 1 = very difficult). In addition, textboxes were provided for the participants to mention whether they perceived gaps and redundancies.

4. Real-world data analysis of health insurance administrative claims

4.1. Methods

4.1.1. Database description

Controversies on the overlap of CIDP within DM led us to investigate the prevalence of CIDP and DM in a "real-world" health insurance administrative claims database — the 2009–2013 Phar-Metrics Plus™Database (Watertown, MA, USA). Secondary objectives were to determine any impact of age on the diagnosis of CIDP patients both without and with DM and to highlight any differences in treatment patterns. This database represents a pooling of adjudicated medical and pharmacy claims for over 100 million patient lives from more than 90 different health plans across the United States. The database includes inpatient and outpatient diagnoses in International Classification of Diseases-9th Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) format; procedures in Current Procedural Terminology-4th Edition and the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System; and prescription records. It also includes demographic variables, product and insurance type, provider specialty, and dates inclusive of plan enrollment. This private database includes a limited number of patients enrolled in Medicaid or Medicare and, therefore, underrepresents the patient population older than 65 years. A typical limitation of any claims database analysis is that clinical data are unavailable for the diagnostic criteria by which the diagnoses of CIDP and DM were made. To ensure the robustness of this dataset, we applied stringent inclusion criteria. Patients were confirmed with DM if there were ≥ 2 claims based on ICD-9-CM code 250. For a CIDP confirmation, patients were required to have ≥ 2 CIDP claims (ICD-9-CM code 357.81) reported at least 90 days apart. Incident cases were defined as being free of a CIDP diagnosis during the 12-month baseline period before their index date.

4.1.2. Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to assess differences in the population. Chi-square tests were used to assess differences in age distributions between CIDP patients without and with DM. Statistical significance was set at an alpha level of 0.05. This study was exempt from any institutional review board review because the patient information within the database was de-identified.

### International classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification for the pulmonary, critical care, and sleep physician [^d06e16db]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

After a patient encounter, the physician uses two coding systems to bill for the service rendered to the patient. The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code is used to describe the encounter or procedure. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code is used to describe the diagnosis(es) of the patient. On October 1, 2015, ICD-9-CM coding will end, and all physicians will be required to use a new diagnostic coding system, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). This article describes the new diagnostic coding system and how it differs from the old system. There are resources and costs involved for physicians and physician practices to prepare properly for ICD-10-CM. Similar to other important events, the more thorough the preparation, the more likely a positive outcome will occur. Resource use is very important in preparation for the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Greater familiarity with ICD-10-CM plus a thorough, effective preparation will lead to reduced costs and a smooth transition. Coding descriptor changes and additional codes occur in ICD-10-CM for chronic bronchitis and emphysema, asthma, and respiratory failure. These changes will affect the coding of these diseases and disorders by physicians. Because the number of codes will increase more than fivefold, the complexity of documentation to support ICD-10-CM will increase substantially. The documentation in the patient's chart to support the ICD-10-CM codes used will need to be enhanced. The requirement for accurate and comprehensive documentation cannot be emphasized enough. All of the coding and documentation changes will be a challenge to pulmonary, critical care, and sleep physicians. They must be prepared fully when ICD-10-CM coding begins and ICD-9-CM coding stops abruptly on October 1, 2015.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics," crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one," and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^0c3ce87b]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

By definition, ICD-9/10 codes are intended to classify diseases or conditions; thus, some ICD-9/10 codes definitively identify specific genetic diseases whereas others indicate clinical presentations that may be an accepted indication to test for a genetic disease. As such, as described previously, ICD-9/10 codes were first categorized into three sets: (1) definite genetic disease; (2) probable genetic disease; and (3) possible genetic disease. The definite category was defined by ICD-9/10 codes that identify specific genetic diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome, specific inborn errors of metabolism). Probable genetic diseases were defined as ICD-9/10 codes that describe clinical presentations wherein a genetic etiology is likely to be achieved with appropriate genetic testing in > 30% of patients with these codes (e.g. neonatal intractable epilepsy). Finally, possible genetic diseases were defined as ICD-9/10 codes that describe clinical presentations wherein a genetic etiology is likely to be achieved with appropriate testing in ~10–30% of patients (e.g. most severe birth defects, such as congenital central nervous system, and cardiac malformations). We further identified ICD-9/10 codes where there are established and specific clinical and/or laboratory diagnostic criteria and availability of established and commonly administered targeted diagnostic tests (e.g. cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disorders, neurofibromatosis), and therefore patients with these codes would be less likely to present clinically as an undiagnosed genetic disease. CPT and HCPCS codes were categorized into two categories: (1) genetic tests (e.g. specific single-gene tests, molecular pathology, chromosomal microarray (CMA), ES); and (2) other procedures that are commonly used in the workup of patients with suspected genetic diseases (e.g. electrophysiologic tests, imaging, skin or muscle biopsies, etc), though we acknowledge this second category includes codes that are not specific to the workup of patients with suspected genetic diseases.

We used combinations of this curated code sets to group patients into three non-mutually exclusive cohorts for analysis [a complete list of codes and the algorithms for identifying each cohort (Supplementary Information) and an attrition table (Supplementary Table 1) can be found in the Supplementary Information].

### Association of the position of a hospital-acquired condition diagnosis code with changes in Medicare severity diagnosis-related group assignment [^425cbc80]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Incentives to improve quality include paying less for adverse events, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' policy to not pay additionally for events classified as hospital-acquired conditions (HACs). This policy is controversial, as variable coding practices at hospitals may lead to differences in the inclusion and position of HACs in the list of codes used for Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Group (MS-DRG) assignment.

Objective

Evaluate changes in MS-DRG assignment for patients with an HAC and test the association of the position of an HAC in the list of International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes with change in MS-DRG assignment.

Design and Setting

Retrospective analysis of patients discharged from hospital members of the University HealthSystem Consortium's Clinical Data Base between October 2007 and April 2008. Comparisons were made between the MS-DRG assigned when the HAC was not included in the list of ICD-9 diagnosis codes and the MS-DRG that would have been assigned had the HAC code been included in the assignment.

Results

Of the 7027 patients with an HAC, 13.8% changed MS-DRG assignment when the HAC was removed. An HAC in the second position versus third position or lower was associated with a 40-fold increase in the likelihood of MS-DRG change.

Conclusions

The position of an HAC in the list of diagnosis codes, rather than the presence of an HAC, is associated with a change in MS-DRG assignment. HACs have little effect on reimbursement unless the HAC is in the second position and patients have minor severity of illness.

### Monitoring new symptoms after COVID-19 infection among primary care patients in New York city [^50b4d8df]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19 affects multiple organ systems causing substantial long-term morbidity. The implications of the Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly for primary care, remain unknown. This cross-sectional study examines new symptoms reported at primary care encounters during three post-acute follow-up intervals after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods

Electronic health record data from the NYU Langone COVID Deidentified Dataset were queried for adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, and then restricted to those with a new ICD-10-CM code documented at a post-acute COVID-related primary care follow-up > 14 days after testing positive. New diagnoses and the corresponding Clinical Classifications Software Refined categories were assessed at the following intervals: 0.5–3 months ("subacute"), 3–6 months ("prolonged"), and 6–9 months ("persistent").

Results

Out of 3,154 patients, a new ICD-10-CM code was documented among 499 patients (∼16%). Respiratory complaints, including cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, were most common. Malaise and fatigue were reported consistently among 10–13% of patients at all three time-intervals. Musculoskeletal pain, circulatory symptoms, and sleep-wake disorders were also observed at primary care follow-up.

Conclusion

This cross-sectional study provides support of a post-acute COVID syndrome, demonstrating that patients continue to experience symptoms after the acute infection period. Extensive follow-up data allowed for examining new symptoms up to 9 months after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding of the course of multi-organ post-acute sequelae is restricted by cross-sectional study design limitations. Standardized, sequelae-related ICD-10-CM codes to specify the type and duration of post-acute COVID-related symptoms would enable better monitoring of the growing number of SARS-CoV-2 infection survivors.

CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid," and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1," "Right lower eyelid is always 2," "Left upper eyelid is always 4," and "Left lower eyelid is always 5." "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field;" if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters." For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality;" if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available." A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)."

### Preparing for international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification implementation: strategies for maintaining an efficient workflow [^204c5163]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is required to be used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services health care billing data starting in October 2015 in the United States. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is an update to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and contains approximately 70,000 codes compared with 14,000 codes. We aimed to discuss how our institution is updating the coding system in a manner that alleviates the possible burden placed on providers including more coding information required and longer load times. We performed a simulation test including testing the diagnosis calculator, timing, and how well the new and old codes mapped. We conducted a gap analysis to ensure that coding could begin in October of 2015 with minimal service interruptions. We will describe strategies and procedures to transition between systems while maintaining efficiency and helping to improve classification.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^4679ec01]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Traumatic aetiologies

In terms of traumatic cases, an APC subset of 202 (39%) cases had ICD-10-AM codes referencing the key terms "injury" and "spinal cord". These terms were taken to indicate a definitive diagnosis of a traumatic SCI or a spinal cord or cauda equina syndrome. In rank order, cervical cases were the most prevalent cause of SCI (135 [32%]) followed by thoracic (51 [10.1%]), and lumbar cases (16 [3.2%]). Table 2 presents the distribution and frequency of those traumatic cases identified and subsequently quantitated by ICD-10-AM code.

Non-traumatic aetiologies

ICD-10-AM codes identifying SCD epochs of care accounted for 115 [23%] of the 504 cases. Of these "vascular myelopathies", and "intraspinal abscess and granuloma" 28 [8.7%] were most frequently recorded. In terms of omissions, ethical constraints precluded the reporting of rare spinal or spinal cord aetiologies with < 5 recorded cases. Due to these constraints the cohort selected for analysis excluded ICD-10 codes for: (i) "Benign neoplasm of meninges: Spinal meninges"; and (ii) "Benign neoplasm of brain and other parts of central nervous system: Spinal cord."

Table 2 also presents ICD-10 codes for "Guillain-Barré syndrome" (22 cases). Of note, GB is a forme fruste diagnosis, and as such new index cases are; first, admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in our facility and secondly, consented to participate and recorded in the ASCIR. For the purpose of this study GB cases were retained for analysis.

Vertebral column injuries

The NLM descriptors/ search terms "fracture" and "neck", or "cervical spine", "thoracic spine" or "lumbar spine" and "fracture" were used in this study to define an epoch of inpatient care due to accidental (low or high impact trauma) or pathological fracture (data not shown). However, from these descriptors it is not reasonable to infer a sine qua non diagnosis of SCI/D. Radiological evidence of spinal canal compromise with concomitant spinal cord compression, together with an ISNCSCI physical examination would be necessary to be confident of sine qua non. These filters were rejected in the construction of the CONSORT framework (Fig. 1) but may inform future attempts to construct a spinal disorders registry.

### Survival strategies for tsunami of ICD-10-CM for interventionalists: pursue or perish! [^f1ee71f0]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The unfunded mandate for the implementation of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is scheduled October 1, 2015. The development of ICD-10-CM has been a complicated process. We have endeavored to keep Interventional Pain Management doctors apprised via a variety of related topical manuscripts. The major issues relate to the lack of formal physician participation in its preparation. While the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and American Hospital Association (AHA) as active partners in its preparation. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are major players; 3M and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association are also involved. The cost of ICD-10-CM implementation is high, similar to the implementation of electronic health records (EHRs), likely consuming substantial resources. While ICD-10, utilized worldwide, includes 14,400 different codes, ICD-10-CM, specific for the United States, has expanded to 144,000 codes, which also includes procedural coding system. It is imperative for physicians to prepare for the mandatory implementation. Conversion from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM coding in interventional pain management is not a conversion of one to one that can be easily obtained from software packages. It is a both a difficult and time-consuming task with each physician, early on, expected to spend on estimation at least 10 minutes per visit on extra coding for established and new patients. For interventional pain physicians, there have been a multitude of changes, including creation of new codes and confusing conversion of existing codes. This manuscript describes a variety of codes that are relevant to interventional pain physicians and often utilized in daily practices. It is our objective that this manuscript will provide coding assistance to interventional pain physicians.

### The IASP classification of chronic pain for ICD-11: chronic neuropathic pain [^677b6f30]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

The upcoming 11th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) of the World Health Organization (WHO) offers a unique opportunity to improve the representation of painful disorders. For this purpose, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) has convened an interdisciplinary task force of pain specialists. Here, we present the case for a reclassification of nervous system lesions or diseases associated with persistent or recurrent pain for ≥ 3 months. The new classification lists the most common conditions of peripheral neuropathic pain: trigeminal neuralgia, peripheral nerve injury, painful polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and painful radiculopathy. Conditions of central neuropathic pain include pain caused by spinal cord or brain injury, poststroke pain, and pain associated with multiple sclerosis. Diseases not explicitly mentioned in the classification are captured in residual categories of ICD-11. Conditions of chronic neuropathic pain are either insufficiently defined or missing in the current version of the ICD, despite their prevalence and clinical importance. We provide the short definitions of diagnostic entities for which we submitted more detailed content models to the WHO. Definitions and content models were established in collaboration with the Classification Committee of the IASP's Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG). Up to 10% of the general population experience neuropathic pain. The majority of these patients do not receive satisfactory relief with existing treatments. A precise classification of chronic neuropathic pain in ICD-11 is necessary to document this public health need and the therapeutic challenges related to chronic neuropathic pain.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^d40700dd]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal arterial occlusion ICD-10 CM codes — Central retinal artery occlusion includes H34.11, H34.12, and H34.13; arterial branch occlusion includes H34.231, H34.232, and H34.233; partial retinal artery occlusion includes H34.211, H34.212, and H34.213; and transient retinal artery occlusion includes H34.01, H34.02, and H34.03. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3; ICD = International Classification of Diseases and CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States.

Some individuals experience long-term sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, referred to as "post-COVID conditions" (PCC) or "long COVID". Various and often overlapping persistent symptoms have been attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including loss of smell and/or taste, fatigue, dyspnea, arthralgia, chest pain, myalgia, cough, and mood disturbances; these symptoms may last months to years. To date, formal definitions of PCC are broad and nonspecific to capture the variety of PCC manifestations. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria require any signs, symptoms, or conditions to be present for ≥ 4 weeks post-infection to be considered PCC, while the World Health Organization defines PCC as the continuation or development of otherwise unexplained new symptoms 3 months after an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Such broad definitions limit our understanding of PCC, even as coordinated efforts seek to refine such definitions. Early studies noted that 50%–80% of patients had symptoms 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas subsequent PCC prevalence estimates range from 18.9% in 2022 to 11.1% in 2023. The heterogeneity of these estimates is partly explained by variance in risk factors, such as acute infection severity, vaccination status, infecting variant, age, sex, and underlying health conditions. However, an additional driver of such variable prevalence estimates is the lack of a precise, working definition of PCC.

Our understanding of PCC pathogenesis is also limited by arbitrary definitions such as the presence of any symptom at 6 months, nonspecific International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes developed for PCC (ie, U09.9 or "Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified"), or categorization of symptoms, signs, or other ICD codes into assumed organ systems, even though such clinical features may not be linked by a shared underlying pathology. Such challenges in precisely and functionally defining PCC further limit the design and interpretation of mechanistic studies and clinical trials.

### Sex differences in comorbidity at diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: a population-based study [^95f4e82a]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Study populations.

In each province, we applied an administrative case definition for MS that had been validated and performed similarly in Manitoba and Nova Scotia. Anyone aged ≥ 20 years with ≥ 3 hospital or physician claims for MS (ICD-9/10 codes 340/G35) during the study period was classified as having MS. To identify incident cases of MS, we used a 5-year run-in period; thus if administrative data were available in 1990, the earliest incident cases could be identified in 1995.

We identified a cohort from the general population, matched on sex, year of birth, and region of residence (postal code or first 3 digits of postal code if unable to match on full postal code). Statistical efficiency is optimized at 4 to 6 matched controls; therefore we obtained up to 5 matches for each case after excluding anyone with any diagnostic codes (ICD-9/10) for demyelinating disease: optic neuritis (377.3/H46), acute transverse myelitis (323.82/G37), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (323/G36.9), demyelinating disease of CNS unspecified (341.9/G37.8), other acute disseminated demyelination (G36), MS (340/G35), or neuromyelitis optica (341.0/G36.0). For each person with MS, we assigned the date of the first health claim for demyelinating disease as the date of diagnosis, and the same (index) date was assigned to matched controls.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^c5bd4139]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

ICD-10-CM laterality and 7th-character rules — Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and a placeholder X is required if a code needing a 7th character is not 6 characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the code indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When laterality is specified in the diagnosis code, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

Categorization and updating cadence — evidence-based clinical practice guidelines should be current; except for an original version of a new CPG, this typically requires revision of previous versions based on new evidence or as scheduled subject to time-based expirations, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force aims to review each topic at least every five years for either an update or reaffirmation.

### An update on the classification and treatment of vasculitic neuropathy [^09cb8077]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Vasculitic neuropathy usually presents with painful mononeuropathies or an asymmetric polyneuropathy of acute or subacute onset. The disorder should be classified as being systemic or non-systemic. Systemic vasculitis should be further classified into one of the primary and secondary forms. Although specific treatment regimens vary among neurologists, basic principles can be applied. Corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs have been the mainstay of treatment for most forms of vasculitic neuropathy. Here we discuss dosing, potential side-effects, and management recommendations of conventional treatments. New treatments showing promise include intravenous immunoglobulin and biological agents and trials of the newest treatments are being reviewed. Future trials should compare commonly used treatment regimens and better establish the efficacy of newer, potentially safer, treatments.

### Reliability of diagnostic coding in intensive care patients [^692fd38c]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Coding diagnoses is necessary to categorize patients in epidemiological studies.

- Multiple symptoms or diseases are characteristic of intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

- The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems provides a profusion of medical codes.

- The selection of codes by ICU physicians is unreliable. This weakens the conclusions of cohort studies using diagnosis as an inclusion criterion.

### Automated clinical coding: what, why, and where we are? [^a4ea9569]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The main principle of the current deep learning approach is to find a complex function (non-linear and constructed by multiple layers) to match a clinical note of a patient's visit to a set of codes. As we introduced earlier, this is the multi-label classification setting. This approach, however, has several major limitations when applied to clinical coding:
Handling unseen, infrequent, and imbalanced labels: In the MIMIC-III data set, around 5000 codes appear fewer than 10 times in the training data and over 50% of codes never appear. Vanilla deep learning models rely on large amounts of data for training and fail completely for new or unseen labels. Multi-label classification is also very challenging, especially when there are many labels or when the labels are imbalanced.
Lack of symbolic reasoning capabilities: Manual coding involves reasoning beyond just locating concepts in the notes. The coders sometimes need to connect different pieces of information together. The information from different sources may even be contradictory to each other for the same patient. Their decisions are based on a standard coding process, aided by coding guidelines. Deep learning, on the other hand, tries to simply learn from the labelled data the association between texts and codes in different (pre-trained) embedding spaces, without explicitly modelling the reasoning process. Human-like reasoning may be supported by knowledge-based techniques, which can potentially boost the performance and explainability of coding of deep learning methods. The reasoning may include formalising coding guidelines into logical expressionsand creating regular expressions to capture various diagnosis descriptions of a code, and leveraging various semantics in knowledge graphs constructed from several linked ontologies including the target ICD hierarchy.
Handling long documents: Looking for the relevant information of a code from a long document poses a "needle-in-the-haystack" problem. The recent Transformer-based pre-trained language models (e.g. BERT, Bi-directional Encoding Representations from Transformers) usually require a limited length of up to 512 sub-word tokens (where a word can be tokenised into several sub-words) as input due to the memory-demanding self-attention mechanism, while discharge summaries alone in MIMIC-III have on average around 1500 tokens or wordsand up to over 10,000 tokens, not counting other types of clinical notes. More recent studies applied Longformer, TransformerXL, BigBirdto clinical coding to process documents of up to 4,096 tokens, but this is still insufficient for the clinical notes. On the other hand, text redundancy (or "Note Bloat" problem) is prevalent in clinical note creation, as measured in recent studies. This may impede the performance of deep learning models for code prediction, which may be alleviated through text de-duplication based on text similarity measures.

### ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM mapping of the AAST emergency general surgery disease severity grading systems: conceptual approach, limitations, and recommendations for the future [^57d673b3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's "Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics.

Regarding medical management for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, more specifically with respect to management of pain, EAN/PNS 2021 guidelines recommend to assess the causes of the pain, whether neuropathic or nociceptive, particularly musculoskeletal pain. Consider alternative diagnoses mimicking CIDP, such as POEMS syndrome, vasculitis, diabetes, amyloidosis, or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1B, where neuropathic pain may be more prevalent.
