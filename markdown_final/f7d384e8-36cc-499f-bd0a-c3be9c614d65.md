## Question

medication to treat orthostatic hypo

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medications to treat orthostatic hypotension, including how to choose, dose, and monitor pharmacologic agents. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing neurogenic from non-neurogenic causes. Then, I should verify reversible contributors and initiate first-line non-drug measures. Next, I will select an initial medication such as fludrocortisone or midodrine with clear dosing and monitoring, and escalate to second-line therapies like droxidopa, octreotide for postprandial OH, or pyridostigmine if needed. After that, I must address supine hypertension safety. Finally, I will consider special populations, define a monitoring cadence, and outline when and how to use combination therapy, making sure each step is supported by guidelines and evidence summaries [^114nQSqq] [^113sJq7p] [^111a8mjN].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and subtype before I jump to treatment, because management depends on whether OH is neurogenic; classic OH is a sustained fall in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt of at least 60 degrees, and separating neurogenic OH from non-neurogenic causes and recognizing coexisting supine hypertension are pivotal to therapy selection [^114nQSqq] [^113sJq7p]; I should double-check orthostatic measurements after at least 5 minutes supine and at 1 and 3 minutes standing and extend if delayed OH is suspected, and in those with hypertension planning intensification, guidelines advise checking for OH at baseline and after changes, which I need to ensure happens consistently [^111JYUVe] [^114nx8CL]; I also need to review for reversible contributors such as dehydration, anemia, endocrine disorders, and culprit medications including diuretics, antihypertensives, and dopaminergic agents that can worsen OH, especially in Parkinson's disease, so deprescribing or switching contributors is an early, essential step [^117KaY6h] [^112rSTnM].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic measures because they are first-line for all patients and often reduce symptom burden; I need to confirm the patient is using adequate fluids and salt if not contraindicated, rapid water bolus of about 500 mL before orthostatic stress, physical counterpressure maneuvers such as leg crossing and squatting, abdominal binders, head-up sleeping by 6 to 9 inches, smaller frequent meals for postprandial OH, and avoidance of alcohol, heat, and prolonged standing, as these are guideline-supported and pragmatic [^115KVuKd] [^117BWmPw] [^112a8vzq]; wait, let me verify the efficacy signals here — bolus water drinking demonstrates about a 56% response with an average 12 mmHg increase in standing systolic blood pressure in older adults, while compression stockings are less efficacious and often poorly tolerated, which I should counsel about up front [^113Tyrrg] [^111dapjh]; I should confirm that systematic reviews support these measures as reasonable first steps even though the evidence quality is heterogeneous, which aligns with my practice of trialing the most acceptable, effective single measures first rather than complex combinations [^114GXsgh].

> For initial pharmacologic therapy when symptoms persist after a trial of non-drug measures, I will now examine the comparative roles of fludrocortisone and midodrine and choose based on patient phenotype; fludrocortisone 0.1 to 0.2 mg once daily expands intravascular volume via sodium retention and is guideline-endorsed as a first-line option, but I should ensure high dietary salt intake for full benefit and monitor for hypokalemia, edema, and supine hypertension, with periodic electrolytes and renal function checks [^115UjaoT] [^11261E6M] [^111dQi2u]; midodrine, an alpha-1 agonist, is also first-line, typically starting at 2.5 mg three times daily and titrating up to 10 mg three times daily, with the last dose at least 4 hours before bedtime to mitigate supine hypertension and with counseling on piloerection, pruritus, and urinary retention, noting it is the only licensed OH medication in the UK as of 2017 and often has a rapid onset, which can be advantageous in daytime use [^113sJq7p] [^1135g37L] [^113XPiuX]; hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence — systematic review data for midodrine show improved standing systolic blood pressure and symptom scales but inconsistent effects on the orthostatic drop with low overall quality, so shared decision-making about benefits and adverse effects is key, and pharmaco-epidemiologic data suggest fludrocortisone may be associated with higher all-cause hospitalizations compared with midodrine, which I must weigh in frailer patients [^113C3k33] [^115yS3zY].

> If first-line therapy is inadequate after 2 to 4 weeks, I should consider second-line options tailored to the clinical pattern and safety profile; droxidopa, a norepinephrine prodrug indicated for neurogenic OH, improves dizziness and standing systolic blood pressure in trials and, importantly, did not show a statistically significant increase in supine hypertension versus control in pooled analyses, though I should still screen vigilantly, given confidence intervals that include potential risk [^116crto9]; for postprandial OH specifically, I need to check whether pre-prandial octreotide 25 to 50 mcg subcutaneously 30 minutes before meals is appropriate since it reduces splanchnic pooling but can worsen supine hypertension and is injectable, so selection should be careful and symptom-targeted [^111iAPaY] [^111a8mjN]; pyridostigmine can be considered in refractory neurogenic OH, often 60 mg three times daily, with the advantage of minimal effect on supine blood pressure, although in Parkinson's disease it appears less effective than fludrocortisone for orthostatic blood pressure drops, so I should reserve it for specific scenarios or intolerance to other agents [^115KfJp8] [^114EeZjL].

> But wait, management is unsafe without addressing supine hypertension, which affects a large proportion of neurogenic OH patients; I should elevate the head of the bed by 6 to 9 inches, avoid late-day doses of pressor agents such as ensuring midodrine is not taken within 4 hours of bedtime, and, if supine blood pressure is severely elevated or symptomatic at night, consider a short-acting antihypertensive at bedtime, documenting the shared trade-offs to avoid morning worsening of OH while remembering that guidelines advise not to merely de-intensify OH therapy in those with concomitant supine hypertension but to switch contributory antihypertensives when feasible [^112a8vzq] [^1135g37L] [^116iWimA].

> I should now think about special populations and tailor choices accordingly; in older adults, I need to prioritize non-drug strategies, start at the lowest doses, and watch for falls, with multidisciplinary falls prevention as indicated, whereas in Parkinson's disease I must anticipate dopaminergic agents aggravating OH and consider fludrocortisone or midodrine first, reserving pyridostigmine or droxidopa if refractory or if supine hypertension limits options, and in multiple system atrophy combination therapy is often required with intensive monitoring due to more severe autonomic failure [^116i4f1V] [^112rSTnM] [^114SsPGF]; in diabetes with autonomic neuropathy or in patients with concomitant hypertension, I should control glycemia, avoid volume overload, and align antihypertensive choices with orthostatic tolerance, using careful titration and reassessment after changes to avoid precipitating syncope or falls [^114nx8CL] [^114nQSqq].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic monitoring plan to ensure safety and efficacy; let me verify that baseline and follow-up orthostatic vitals include supine after at least 5 minutes and standing at 1 and 3 minutes, with early reassessment of symptoms and standing time within 1 to 2 weeks of initiating or changing therapy, periodic electrolytes and renal function for fludrocortisone, and regular checks for supine hypertension at each visit with specific nocturnal history, adjusting therapy stepwise based on a 2-week assessment window of benefit versus adverse effects [^111JYUVe] [^111a8mjN] [^112vR4vZ].

> I need to ensure I am cautious with escalation to combination therapy because evidence is limited and risks rise; if severe neurogenic OH persists with syncope despite optimized single agents and nonpharmacologic measures, a carefully supervised combination such as fludrocortisone plus daytime midodrine can be used, but I should institute weekly home or clinic blood pressure checks during initiation and uptitration and pause if supine hypertension or urinary retention emerges, recognizing that midodrine increases the risk of supine hypertension and other dose-related adverse effects [^112vR4vZ] [^113C3k33].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm and make sure nothing is missing; all patients should begin with nonpharmacologic measures and correction of reversible causes, followed by a first-line agent such as fludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily or midodrine starting at 2.5 mg three times daily and titrated, selected to match volume depletion versus vasoconstrictor needs and the patient's comorbidities, then escalate to droxidopa for neurogenic OH when needed or to octreotide for postprandial hypotension, with pyridostigmine as an adjunct in refractory cases and vigilant mitigation of supine hypertension throughout, acknowledging that evidence quality for medications is generally moderate to low and that individualized, reference-guided care is essential to balance symptom relief with safety [^111dQi2u] [^113sJq7p] [^114nQSqq] [^116crto9].

---

Midodrine and droxidopa are the **primary medications** for orthostatic hypotension [^114nQSqq], with midodrine preferred first-line [^113sJq7p] and droxidopa as an alternative, particularly in neurogenic cases [^116crto9]. Fludrocortisone is a second-line option [^111dQi2u], and pyridostigmine or octreotide may be added for refractory cases [^115KfJp8] [^111a8mjN]. Non-pharmacologic measures (increased salt/fluid intake, compression garments, head-up sleeping) should be implemented first [^112rSTnM] [^114nQSqq], and **supine hypertension** must be monitored throughout treatment [^113sfH2Y].

---

## First-line pharmacologic treatments

### Midodrine

- **Mechanism of action**: Alpha-1 adrenergic agonist causing peripheral vasoconstriction and increased vascular resistance [^113sJq7p].

- **Clinical evidence**: Recommended as first-line therapy; improves standing BP and symptoms [^113sJq7p] [^113C3k33].

- **Dosage**: 2.5 mg orally three times daily, titrated to 10 mg three times daily [^113sJq7p].

- **Adverse effects**: Supine hypertension, piloerection, pruritus, urinary retention; last dose ≥ 4 hours before bedtime [^1135g37L] [^113C3k33].

---

### Droxidopa

- **Mechanism of action**: Norepinephrine prodrug increasing vascular tone and BP [^116crto9].

- **Clinical evidence**: Effective for neurogenic OH; reduces dizziness and improves standing BP [^116crto9].

- **Dosage**: 100 mg orally three times daily, titrated to 600 mg three times daily [^116crto9].

- **Adverse effects**: Headache, dizziness, nausea, supine hypertension [^116crto9].

---

## Second-line pharmacologic treatments

### Fludrocortisone

Fludrocortisone is a **mineralocorticoid** that promotes sodium retention and expands plasma volume [^111dQi2u]. It can be used as first- or second-line therapy to raise BP [^115UjaoT]. Typical dosing is 0.1 mg orally daily, titrated to 0.3 mg daily; adverse effects include supine hypertension, hypokalemia, edema, and heart failure exacerbation [^114nQSqq] [^117KaY6h].

---

### Pyridostigmine

Pyridostigmine is an **acetylcholinesterase inhibitor** that enhances ganglionic transmission and is useful for refractory neurogenic OH with minimal risk of supine hypertension [^114nQSqq]. The usual dose is 30 mg orally three times daily, titrated to 60 mg three times daily; adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps [^117KaY6h] [^114EeZjL].

---

### Octreotide

Octreotide is a **somatostatin analog** that reduces splanchnic blood pooling and is effective for refractory neurogenic or postprandial OH [^111a8mjN]. Dosage is 25–50 mcg subcutaneously 30 minutes before meals; adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, gallstones, and injection site reactions [^111iAPaY].

---

## Non-pharmacologic interventions

Non-pharmacologic measures are **first-line** [^114nQSqq] and serve as adjuncts to medications:

- **Increased salt and fluid intake**: Effective for symptomatic OH [^112rSTnM] [^115KVuKd].

- **Compression garments**: Recommended for OH management [^1177nyaR] [^117BWmPw].

- **Head-up tilt sleeping**: Reduces nocturnal diuresis and morning BP drop [^113sfH2Y] [^112a8vzq].

- **Physical counter-maneuvers**: Leg crossing, squatting, and exercise improve symptoms [^117BWmPw].

---

## Special considerations

### Supine hypertension

Monitoring should include regular **supine BP checks** [^113sfH2Y], and management may involve **short-acting antihypertensives at bedtime** for severe cases [^1151Afwy] [^113sfH2Y] [^114nQSqq].

---

### Patient-specific factors

Age and comorbidities warrant **individualized therapy**, considering cardiovascular disease and renal function [^113sfH2Y] [^114nQSqq]. Medication interactions should be reviewed and adjusted if they may **exacerbate OH** [^113sfH2Y] [^116iWimA].

---

Midodrine and droxidopa are **primary treatments** for orthostatic hypotension; fludrocortisone, pyridostigmine, and octreotide are alternatives. Non-pharmacologic measures should be used **first**, and **supine hypertension** requires careful monitoring [^114nQSqq].

### Fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension [^111dQi2u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is an excessive fall in blood pressure (BP) while standing, resulting from a decrease in cardiac output or defective or inadequate vasoconstrictor mechanisms. Fludrocortisone, a mineralocorticoid, increases blood volume and blood pressure. It is considered as first- or second-line pharmacological therapy for orthostatic hypotension, along with mechanical and positional measures such as increasing fluid and salt intake and venous compression methods. However, there has not been a Cochrane Review of the benefits and harms of this drug for this condition.

- **Objectives**: To identify and evaluate the benefits and harms of fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases on 11 November 2019: Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. We also searched trial registries.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all studies evaluating the benefits and harms of fludrocortisone compared to a placebo, another drug for orthostatic hypotension, or studies without comparators. This includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and observational studies. The studies included people with orthostatic hypotension due to chronic peripheral neuropathy, central autonomic neuropathy, or autonomic failure from other causes, but excluded medication-induced orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic hypotension from acute volume depletion or blood loss.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used Cochrane methodological procedures for most of the review.

### Droxidopa for orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116crto9]. Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

The systematic review and meta-analysis aim to determine the efficacy and safety of droxidopa in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension, following its recent approvals in the United States. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Web of Science, ProQuest, and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry were searched. Studies were included if they randomized adults with orthostatic hypotension to droxidopa or to control, and outcomes related to symptoms, daily activity, blood pressure, or adverse events. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Risk of bias was judged against the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the quality of evidence was measured using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. A fixed-effects model was used for pooled analysis.

Of 224 identified records, four studies met eligibility, with a pooled sample size of 494. Study duration was between 1 and 8 weeks. Droxidopa was effective at reducing dizziness [mean difference -0.97 (95% confidence interval -1.51, -0.42)], overall symptoms [-0.52 (-0.98, -0.06)], and difficulty with activity [-0.86 (-1.34, -0.38)]. Droxidopa was also effective at improving standing SBP [3.9 (0.1, 7.69)]. Rates of adverse events were similar between droxidopa and control groups, including supine hypertension [odds ratio 1.93 (0.87, 4.25)].

Droxidopa is well tolerated and effective at reducing the symptoms associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension without increasing the risk of supine hypertension.

### Canadian guideline for Parkinson disease [^112rSTnM]. CMAJ (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Parkinson's disease, particularly in the context of managing autonomic dysfunction, the CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend the following general measures for orthostatic hypotension:

- **Avoid aggravating factors**: Large meals, alcohol, exposure to a warm environment, and drugs known to cause orthostatic hypotension (such as diuretics or antihypertensive drugs). Additionally, recognize that levodopa and dopamine agonists may also worsen orthostatic hypotension.

- **Increase salt intake**: This is recommended for symptomatic orthostatic hypotension.

- **Ensure head-up tilt of the bed at night**.

- **Wear elastic stockings**.

- **Recognize postprandial hypotension**: In some patients, hypotension occurs only after meals; therefore, warn patients about this effect and advise taking frequent small meals.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113sfH2Y]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

It is critical for clinicians to understand the physiology underlying both neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) and supine hypertension, and the associated risks of each when managing patients with nOH. Neurogenic OH is associated with the loss of baroreflex function that normally buffers changes in blood pressure in both directions. Therefore, patients with autonomic nervous system dysfunction typically have nOH and supine hypertension. In addition to supine hypertension being common in patients with nOH, many of the medications used to treat nOH can cause or exacerbate supine hypertension.

Because OH/nOH and supine hypertension are hemodynamic opposites, improving one can worsen the other. Thus, all patients with nOH should be evaluated for supine hypertension. There are differences in clinical practice among clinicians who treat nOH. Some clinicians may not treat nOH for fear of exacerbating supine hypertension, while others may aggressively treat nOH while accepting the resulting supine hypertension. Unlike the potential long-term consequences of hypertension in non-Parkinson's disease patients, the risks of nOH are immediate and represent potential major health threats. By extrapolation, similar recommendations can be made in multiple system atrophy. In contrast, the data is less clear in individuals with pure autonomic failure.

### The efficacy of nonpharmacologic intervention for orthostatic hypotension associated with aging [^113oq6n9]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a disabling condition resulting from a sustained reduction in blood pressure (BP; ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic) within 3 minutes of standing. Aging is one of the most common causes of neurogenic OH, affecting 7% to 30% of community-dwelling older people. Clinical guidelines recommend nonpharmacologic therapy as the first-line treatment in OH, but older people are typically excluded from research, creating a great deal of clinical uncertainty. As the older population is expanding rapidly, we can expect a growing demand for evidence in this area.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^11261E6M]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for orthostatic hypotension, specifically with respect to fludrocortisone, the EFNS 2006 guidelines recommend advising patients to maintain a high dietary salt and adequate fluid intake to obtain full benefits from fludrocortisone treatment.

### New horizons in orthostatic hypotension [^113XPiuX]. Age and Ageing (2017). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common disabling condition associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Much of the evidence available is derived from younger populations with chronic neurological disease, leading to uncertainty for the diagnosis and management of older people.

- **Objective**: To provide an overview of recent and emerging evidence for the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of OH in older persons.

- **Methods**: A narrative review of recent studies, emerging therapies, and relevant regulatory updates was conducted.

- **Findings**: Revisions to the diagnostic criteria for OH include the duration of the blood pressure drop, specific criteria for initial and delayed OH, and OH with hypertension. Non-drug therapies remain the first-line treatment option, and comprehensive geriatric assessment appears to result in lower rates of OH. Recent evidence concerning withdrawal of causative medication is inconsistent. Midodrine has recently become the only licensed medication for OH in the UK. Other emerging treatments include atomoxetine and droxidopa, but these require further evaluation. Many other agents may be used, but are not supported by high-quality evidence. The increase in mortality associated with OH is less apparent in older people.

- **Summary**: OH remains common in older people. The new diagnostic criteria address some of the previous uncertainty, but evidence concerning the withdrawal of antihypertensives is conflicting. Midodrine is now the only licensed medication for OH in the UK, but non-drug therapies remain first line, and fludrocortisone may be considered before midodrine.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^111iAPaY]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). High credibility.

In the medical management of orthostatic hypotension, specifically concerning the use of octreotide, the EFNS 2006 guidelines recommend considering pre-prandial octreotide (25–50 mcg subcutaneous, administered 30 minutes before meals) to reduce post-prandial orthostatic hypotension.

---

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^112ctFpp]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with OH/nOH, normal sympathetic activity cannot compensate for blood pooling within the splanchnic circulation after eating. With nOH, sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve activity is deficient, and many patients become severely hypotensive within 2 hours of eating. It is important to recognize this problem because treatment of OH/nOH can diminish symptoms post-meal. Patients can be asked to measure their blood pressure before and 30 minutes following a high carbohydrate meal. In individuals with postprandial hypotension, smaller, more frequent meals are recommended. There is also some evidence that a low glycemic diet may have a beneficial effect on the symptoms of OH/nOH. Finally, postprandial hypotension can be reduced with caffeine or acarbose.

- **Anemia and vitamin/mineral deficiencies in the diet**: Anemia leads to decreased blood viscosity and oxygen-carrying capacity and may worsen symptoms of OH/nOH. Vitamin B12 deficiency (< 250 pg/mL with elevated methylmalonic acid levels) may also be associated with postural instability and can cause OH. B12 deficiency and anemia should be corrected, and ongoing observation is necessary to prevent recurrence. Thus, changes in diet as well as vitamin and iron supplementation, may be helpful for some patients with nOH.

- **Treating nOH — step 3: Initial pharmacologic treatment**: If the implementation of non-pharmacologic measures does not adequately improve the symptoms of nOH, then it becomes necessary to initiate pharmacotherapy. For patients who are experiencing syncope, near-syncope, or falls, the potential consequences are so grave.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^116i4f1V]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

- **Cardiovascular interventions**: Strong recommendation. Management of orthostatic hypotension should be included as a component of a multidomain intervention (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online). GRADE: 1A. Strong recommendation. Interventions for cardiovascular disorders identified during assessment for risk of falls should be the same as that for similar conditions when associated with syncope, in addition to other interventions based on the multifactorial falls risk assessment. GRADE: 1B.

- **Recommendation details and justification**: Whereas many multidomain fall prevention programmes have included strategies to treat orthostatic hypotension, including modification of possible culprit medications, rehydration, compression garments, and medications (e.g. fludrocortisone and midodrine), there are no single intervention studies for orthostatic hypotension in falls prevention. In older adults with hypertension, symptoms may be ameliorated by the judicious use of antihypertensive medications titrated very slowly and with careful monitoring after changing the dose. For the management of syncope, we advise following local syncope guidelines (e.g. European Cardiac Society Task Force on Syncope). Many multifactorial fall prevention programmes that have shown benefit for fall prevention have included strategies to modify orthostatic blood pressure. The presence of more than one cardiovascular risk factor for falls is not uncommon. Clear causality for a single risk factor may be difficult to establish; therefore, all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors should be treated.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^114SsPGF]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

A structured approach is important in the management of patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH). Wherever possible, underlying causes should be identified through thorough work-up, and the treatment strategy should be adapted accordingly. In addition, the magnitude of symptoms and the presence of asymptomatic OH should be considered. Available treatment options range from non-pharmacological options to aggressive drug therapy. While therapy for non-neurogenic OH is mostly straightforward, NOH is often difficult to treat, requiring a combination of non-pharmacological measures and drugs. Pharmacological agents can lead to different responses in patients with central neurodegeneration compared to those with peripheral neurodegeneration; this distinction must be taken into account during treatment.

NOH can significantly affect patients' quality of life due to the disabling symptoms of autonomic failure. However, most of these symptoms could be alleviated by non-pharmacological and pharmacological measures. Therapeutic interventions should be implemented stepwise depending on the severity of symptoms. If non-pharmacological measures do not sufficiently attenuate NOH symptoms, pharmacological interventions may become necessary. Nevertheless, supine hypertension must be considered in pharmacological treatment.

- **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Non-pharmacological measures should be considered first in NOH. These include a stepwise raising from supine to standing position, physical exercise to prevent deconditioning, and ensuring proper defecation and compression.

### The efficacy of nonpharmacologic intervention for orthostatic hypotension associated with aging [^113Tyrrg]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy and safety of nonpharmacologic interventions for orthostatic hypotension (OH) secondary to aging, a study was conducted involving a total of 150 orthostatic challenges performed on 25 older people (age 60–92 years). These challenges aimed to measure cardiovascular responses to bolus water drinking, compression stockings, abdominal compression, and physical countermaneuvers. The primary outcome was the response rate, as assessed by the proportion of participants whose systolic blood pressure (SBP) drop improved by ≥ 10 mm Hg.

- **Results**: The response rate to bolus water drinking was 56% (95% confidence interval [CI] 36.7–74.2), with an increase in standing SBP by 12 mm Hg (95% CI 4–20). Physical countermaneuvers showed efficacy in 44% (95% CI 25.8–63.3) but had little effect on standing SBP (+7.5 mm Hg [95% CI -1 to 16]). Abdominal compression was effective in 52% (95% CI 32.9–70.7), improving standing SBP by 10 mm Hg (95% CI 2–18). Compression stockings were the least effective, with a response rate of 32% (95% CI 16.1–51.4) and a minimal effect on standing SBP (+6 mm Hg [95% CI -1, 13]). No intervention improved symptoms during standing, and there were no adverse events reported.

- **Conclusions**: Bolus water drinking should become the standard first-line nonpharmacologic intervention for OH, whereas compression stockings should be disregarded in this population.

- **Classification of evidence**: This study provides Class III evidence that for older people with OH, bolus water drinking is superior to other nonpharmacologic interventions in reducing SBP drop.

### Nonpharmacologic management of orthostatic hypotension: A systematic review [^114GXsgh]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

To systematically review the literature on nonpharmacologic treatment of orthostatic hypotension, this study gathered data from various sources including MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SPORTDiscus. The search focused on human studies written in English from January 1980 to April 2013, with relevant article reference lists also reviewed to expand the data set.

Prospective experimental studies assessing nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of orthostatic drop in blood pressure in various patient populations were included. All studies identified through the literature search were reviewed independently in duplicate. Of the 642 studies, 23 met the selection criteria.

Two reviewers independently extracted data, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and orthostatic symptoms in response to postural challenge before and after the intervention. All 23 studies were assessed in duplicate for risk of bias using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale for randomized controlled trials and the Downs and Black tool for nonrandomized trials.

There were eight identified nonpharmacologic interventions for managing orthostatic hypotension, categorized under two general types:

- **Physical modalities**: Exercise, functional electrical stimulation, compression, physical countermaneuvers, compression with physical countermaneuvers, sleeping with head up.
- **Dietary measures**: Water intake and meals.

Due to the clinically diverse nature of the interventions, the analysis incorporated a wide range of approaches.

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^113X16Sj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition and an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It manifests when autonomic reflexes are impaired or intravascular volume is depleted, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder often goes unrecognized until later in its clinical course. Symptoms like orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients with orthostatic hypotension. Patients are often asymptomatic, which complicates the diagnosis further. We summarize seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension.

### Orthostatic hypotension in pancreatic cancer [^115f3Xtt]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2025). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a relatively common medical diagnosis and can be debilitating for the patients it affects. There is a range of treatment options, though only one medication is licensed in the UK for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension. We review the case of a man in his 70s with pancreatic cancer who developed orthostatic hypotension towards the latter stage of his disease, causing severe dizziness and significantly impacting his quality of life.

Multiple factors contributed to his orthostatic hypotension, and various treatments, both non-pharmacological and pharmacological, were trialed with varying degrees of success to alleviate his symptoms and improve his quality of life. On reviewing his case, we identified that the medication options have different optimal scenarios in which they are effective.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: Does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115uQM56]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

Management of antihypertensive therapy is challenging in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, a population often excluded from randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to determine whether the association of antihypertensive therapy and adverse events (e.g. falls, syncope) differed among trials that included or excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing blood pressure lowering medications to placebo, or differing blood pressure targets on falls, syncope outcomes, and cardiovascular events. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate a pooled treatment effect overall in subgroups of trials that excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension and trials that did not exclude these patients, testing for interaction. The primary outcome was fall events.

- **Results**: A total of 46 trials were included, of which 18 excluded orthostatic hypotension and 28 did not. The incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in trials excluding participants with orthostatic hypotension (1.3% versus 6.2%, P < 0.001) but not for incidences of falls (4.8% versus 8.8%; P = 0.40) or syncope (1.5% versus 1.8%; P = 0.67). Antihypertensive therapy was not associated with an increased risk of falls in trials that excluded (OR 1.00, 95% CI; 0.89–1.13) or included (OR 1.02, 95% CI; 0.88–1.18) participants with orthostatic hypotension (P for interaction).

Avoid increased core body temperature

Elevation in body temperature causes peripheral vasodilation. Patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) should avoid situations that could increase core body temperature, such as excessive high-intensity exercise, exercise when ambient temperature and humidity are high, and the use of hot tubs, spas, or saunas, as well as prolonged hot showers. Simple safety adjustments, such as using a shower chair, will help prevent complications. Additionally, individuals with autonomic failure may have impaired thermoregulatory capacity and may be at increased risk for hyperthermia. An example of impaired thermoregulation in autonomic failure is shown by the lack of the expected nocturnal decrease in body core temperature that has been described in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA).

- **Head-up position while sleeping**: Elevating the head of the bed (through use of a wedge under the mattress, or placing blocks under the legs of the bed's headboard so that the head is 6–9 inches (15–23 cm) higher than the feet — stacked pillows are not adequate) will reduce supine hypertension. Supine hypertension commonly leads to pressure diuresis that occurs, resulting in nocturia and blood volume depletion overnight. This nocturnal forced diuresis can be decreased by elevating the head of the bed. In addition, the modest effects of gravity in the head-up position will maintain the activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and maintain higher blood pressure in the morning. The net result is a diminished magnitude of blood pressure drop in the morning.

Compression garments are another strategy to consider…

### Combination non-pharmacologic intervention for orthostatic hypotension in older people: A phase 2 study [^113b9Vxj]. Age and Ageing (2020). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is highly prevalent in older populations and is associated with reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Although non-pharmacologic therapies are recommended as first-line treatment, evidence for their use is lacking. The objective of this phase 2 study was to determine the efficacy of combination non-pharmacologic therapy for OH in older people.

A total of 111 orthostatic blood pressure (BP) responses were evaluated in this prospective study involving 37 older adults (≥ 60 years) with OH. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants whose systolic BP drop improved by ≥ 10 mmHg. Secondary outcomes included standing BP and symptoms. The response rate was compared to the most efficacious single therapy, bolus water drinking (56%). Therapeutic combinations were composed of interventions with known efficacy and tolerability:

- **Therapy A**: Bolus water drinking + physical counter-manoeuvres (PCM).
- **Therapy B**: Bolus water drinking + PCM + abdominal compression.

The response rate to therapy A was 38% (95% confidence interval (CI): 24, 63), with standing systolic BP increasing by 13 mmHg (95% CI: 4, 22). Therapy B was efficacious in 46% (95% CI: 31, 62), increasing standing systolic BP by 20 mmHg (95% CI: 12, 29). Neither therapy had a significant effect on symptoms, and there were no adverse events.

In conclusion, compared to single therapy, there is little additional benefit from combination non-pharmacologic therapy. Focusing on single, efficacious therapies, such as bolus water drinking or PCM, should become the standard first-line therapy.

### Orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic disorders in the hypertension clinic [^1151Afwy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Hypertension specialists are often consulted regarding orthostatic hypotension (OH) or the combination of OH with supine hypertension. These clinical presentations are typically associated with a variety of underlying autonomic disorders. A comprehensive medical history and clinical examination, with attention to autonomic signs and the neurological system, may suggest possible etiology or a differential diagnosis. At times, drug therapy for hypertension or other diseases such as Parkinson's disease is temporarily associated with the onset of OH. In other instances, no definitive association can be made. Most hypertension specialists can initiate basic evaluation and treatment.

Treatment approaches to OH must primarily target the alleviation of symptoms related to cerebral hypoperfusion while also considering supine hypertension. Several lifestyle modifications and drug therapies can ameliorate symptoms of OH. Additionally, short-acting antihypertensive therapy may be useful in controlling nocturnal supine hypertension.

### Orthostatic hypotension in the elderly: Diagnosis and treatment [^117F3Csr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a common problem among elderly patients, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While acute orthostatic hypotension is usually secondary to medication, fluid or blood loss, or adrenal insufficiency, chronic orthostatic hypotension is frequently due to altered blood pressure regulatory mechanisms and autonomic dysfunction. The diagnostic evaluation requires a comprehensive history, including symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction; careful blood pressure measurement at various times of the day and after meals or medications; and laboratory studies. Laboratory investigation and imaging studies should be based upon the initial findings, with emphasis on excluding diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases, amyloidosis, diabetes, anemia, and vitamin deficiency as the cause.

Whereas asymptomatic patients usually need no treatment, those with symptoms often benefit from a stepped approach with initial nonpharmacological interventions, including avoidance of potentially hypotensive medications and use of physical counter maneuvers. If these measures prove inadequate and the patient remains persistently symptomatic, various pharmacotherapeutic agents can be added, including fludrocortisone, midodrine, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The goals of treatment are to improve symptoms and to make the patient as ambulatory as possible rather than trying to achieve arbitrary blood pressure goals. With proper evaluation and management, the occurrence of adverse events, including falls, fractures, functional decline, and myocardial ischemia, can be reduced.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^116iWimA]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, particularly concerning the choice of antihypertensives and initial therapy, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend switching BP-lowering medications that worsen orthostatic hypotension to an alternative BP-lowering therapy. They advise against merely de-intensifying therapy for managing orthostatic hypotension in patients with supine hypertension.

### Combination non-pharmacologic intervention for orthostatic hypotension in older people: A phase 2 study [^112ffUa9]. Age and Ageing (2020). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is highly prevalent in older populations and is associated with reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Although non-pharmacologic therapies are recommended as first-line interventions, evidence for their use is lacking. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of combination non-pharmacologic therapy for OH in older people.

A total of 111 orthostatic blood pressure (BP) responses were evaluated in this prospective phase 2 efficacy study involving 37 older individuals (≥ 60 years) with OH. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants whose systolic BP drop improved by ≥ 10 mmHg. Secondary outcomes included standing BP and symptoms. Comparison was made to the response rate of the most efficacious single therapy, bolus water drinking, which has a 56% response rate. Therapeutic combinations were composed of interventions with known efficacy and tolerability:

- **Therapy a**: Bolus water drinking + physical counter-manoeuvres (PCM).
- **Therapy b**: Bolus water drinking + PCM + abdominal compression.

The response rate to Therapy A was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 24, 63), with standing systolic BP increasing by 13 mmHg (95% CI 4, 22). Therapy B was efficacious in 46% (95% CI 31, 62), increasing standing systolic BP by 20 mmHg (95% CI 12, 29). Neither therapy had a significant effect on symptoms, and there were no adverse events.

In conclusion, compared to single therapy, there is little additional benefit from combination non-pharmacologic therapy. Focusing on single, efficacious therapies, such as bolus water drinking or PCM, should become standard first-line therapy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension [^114nQSqq]. The Lancet Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is an unusually large decrease in blood pressure upon standing that increases the risk of adverse outcomes, even when asymptomatic. Improvements in hemodynamic profiling with continuous blood pressure measurements have uncovered four major subtypes: initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and delayed orthostatic hypotension. Clinical presentations are varied and range from cognitive slowing with hypotensive unawareness or unexplained falls to classic presyncope and syncope. Establishing whether symptoms are due to orthostatic hypotension requires careful history taking, a thorough physical examination, and supine and upright blood pressure measurements. Management and prognosis vary according to the underlying cause, with the main distinction being whether orthostatic hypotension is neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension might be the earliest clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies and often coincides with supine hypertension.

The emerging variety of clinical presentations advocates a stepwise, individualized, and primarily non-pharmacological approach to the management of orthostatic hypotension. Such an approach could include the cessation of blood pressure-lowering drugs, adoption of lifestyle measures (e.g. counterpressure maneuvers), and treatment with pharmacological agents in selected cases.

### Efficacy of treatments for orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review [^1128JS1i]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) affects up to 30% of adults over 65 and frequently contributes to falls and syncopal episodes. Guidelines suggest a wide range of treatments, but systematic reviews of the evidence base for such recommendations are lacking.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review to assess the evidence for all non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for OH. Our search included the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. We searched grey literature and references from included studies and other reviews. We included randomized, placebo-controlled trials that measured postural drop as an outcome. Study quality was assessed using pre-specified measures of bias.

- **Results**: Overall, 36 trials (21 interventions) were included. We identified a heterogeneous population and a wide variety of study methods, precluding meta-analysis. Most trials were of poor quality with a high risk of bias. Changes in postural drop and symptoms were frequently inconsistent. Compression bandages, indomethacin, oxilofrine, potassium chloride, and yohimbine improved the postural drop. Several vasoactive drugs, including midodrine and pyridostigmine, improved the standing blood pressure but overall worsened the postural drop.

- **Conclusions**: Many commonly recommended interventions for OH have a limited evidence base supporting their use. High-quality, randomized, controlled trials are needed to underpin clinical practice for this condition.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^111jn2Ym]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) in individuals who screen positive for orthostatic hypotension (OH) requires an accurate assessment of the underlying cause(s) to determine appropriate treatment recommendations. A stepwise approach is recommended for diagnosis of nOH, starting with measurement of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate, followed by more detailed autonomic testing in select cases.

- **Stepwise approach to the diagnosis of nOH**: The hallmark test for OH involves measuring the change in blood pressure from supine, after at least 5 minutes of rest, to standing (or head-up tilt [HUT]). Guidelines define OH as a sustained fall of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing (or HUT). However, in patients with supine hypertension (a supine systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg), a 30 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure or a 15-point fall in diastolic blood pressure may be a more appropriate criterion for patients with nOH, as the magnitude of blood pressure fall is dependent on the baseline blood pressure.

- **A practical stepwise approach to orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate testing**: The recommended gold standard measurement of OH includes having patients rest in the supine position for at least 5 minutes and then stand for 3 minutes, with blood pressure measurements taken just prior to standing and at both 1 and 3 minutes following standing.

### Orthostatic hypotension, hypertension treatment, and cardiovascular disease: An individual participant meta-analysis [^117TEE2q]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

There are ongoing concerns about the benefits of intensive vs. standard blood pressure (BP) treatment among adults with orthostatic hypotension or standing hypotension.

To determine the effect of a lower BP treatment goal or active therapy vs. a standard BP treatment goal or placebo on cardiovascular disease (CVD) or all-cause mortality in strata of baseline orthostatic hypotension or baseline standing hypotension, an individual participant data meta-analysis based on a systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases through May 13, 2022, was performed.

- **Study selection**: Randomized trials of BP pharmacologic treatment (more intensive BP goal or active agent) with orthostatic hypotension assessments were included.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Data were extracted following PRISMA guidelines. Effects were determined using Cox proportional hazard models with a single-stage approach.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Main outcomes were CVD or all-cause mortality. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a decrease in systolic BP of at least 20 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP of at least 10 mm Hg after changing position from sitting to standing. Standing hypotension was defined as a standing systolic BP of 110 mm Hg or less or standing diastolic BP of 60 mm Hg or less.

The 9 trials included 29,235 participants followed up for a median of 4 years (mean age, 69.0 [SD, 10.9] years; 48% women). At baseline, 9% had orthostatic hypotension, and 5% had standing hypotension. More intensive BP treatment or active therapy showed potential for reduction in these conditions.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113VYy4o]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The American Autonomic Society and the National Parkinson Foundation jointly held an initial consensus panel meeting to formulate essential recommendations into a working guideline for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) and associated supine hypertension. The results of the discussions held during the meeting, along with continued deliberations among the panel participants, are presented here along with recommendations in each of the topic areas. Whereas most patients with disorders typically associated with nOH are seen by cardiologists or neurologists, particularly movement disorder specialists, the first point of contact and potential for identification of nOH is with primary care clinicians. Hence, the following consensus commentary is meant to provide guidance for all clinicians who might encounter and/or ultimately manage nOH.

### Orthostatic hypotension, cardiovascular outcomes, and adverse events: Results from SPRINT [^115WqAa5]. Hypertension (2020). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is frequently observed with hypertension treatment, but its contribution to adverse outcomes is unknown. The SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) was a randomized trial of adults aged ≥ 50 years at high risk for cardiovascular disease with a seated systolic blood pressure (BP) of 130 to 180 mm Hg and a standing systolic BP ≥ 110 mm Hg. Participants were randomized to a systolic BP treatment goal of either < 120 or < 140 mm Hg. OH was defined as a drop in systolic BP ≥ 20 or diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg 1 minute after standing from a seated position.

We used Cox models to examine the association of OH with cardiovascular disease or adverse study events by randomized BP goal. During the follow-up period (median 3 years), there were 1,170 (5.7%) instances of OH among those assigned a standard BP goal and 1,057 (5.0%) among those assigned the intensive BP goal. OH was not associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease events (primary outcome: hazard ratio 1.06 [95% CI, 0.78–1.44]). Moreover, OH was not associated with syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, injurious falls, or acute renal failure.

- **Hypotension-related outcomes**: OH was associated with hypotension-related hospitalizations or emergency department visits (hazard ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.11–2.82]) and bradycardia (hazard ratio, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.19–3.15]), but these associations did not differ by BP treatment goal.

OH was not associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease events, and BP treatment goal had no effect on OH's association with hypotension and bradycardia. Symptomless OH during hypertension treatment was observed, indicating it did not contribute to increased cardiovascular risks.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^1173kqJG]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

Unexplained falls are most likely associated with a cardiovascular cause. The most common cardiovascular causes of falls, in rank order, are orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syndrome, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, bradyarrhythmias, and atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The investigation, management, and specialist referral criteria for syncope, and therefore unexplained falls, can be conducted according to locally applicable guidelines like the 2018 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope.

If orthostatic hypotension is suspected but not detected using traditional methods (oscillometer or sphygmomanometer), referral for beat-to-beat orthostatic measurement is recommended, as the association of falls with orthostatic hypotension measured using beat-to-beat methods is more consistent. If vasovagal syncope or delayed orthostatic hypotension is suspected and diagnostic uncertainty remains, older adults should be referred for head-up tilt tests.

If arrhythmias are suspected after clinical assessment, individuals should be referred for external or internal cardiac monitoring based on locally applicable guidelines. For the assessment of orthostatic hypotension, individuals should be supine for at least 5 minutes before baseline blood pressure is recorded. Upon standing, blood pressure should be taken as soon as possible (40–60 seconds), followed by measurements at 1-minute intervals up to 3 minutes, or up to 5 minutes if symptoms suggest delayed orthostatic reaction.

### Rexulti [^116TDEG4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics, such as Rexulti, can cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The risk is greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. In short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti plus ADT in adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions was comparable between Rexulti plus ADT-treated patients and placebo plus ADT-treated patients, with dizziness occurring in 2% versus 2%, and orthostatic hypotension in 0.1% versus 0%.

Similarly, in short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti in adult patients with schizophrenia, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in Rexulti-treated patients compared to placebo patients was as follows: dizziness (2% versus 2%), orthostatic hypotension (0.4% versus 0.2%), and syncope (0.1% versus 0%).

In 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in patients treated with Rexulti compared to those treated with placebo included: dizziness (3% versus 3%), orthostatic hypotension (1% versus 1%), and syncope (0.2% versus 0.8%).

Orthostatic vital signs should be carefully monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension, such as elderly patients and those with dehydration, hypovolemia, or concomitant antihypertensive medication. Special attention should be given to patients with known cardiovascular disease, including a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities.

### Fludrocortisone is associated with a higher risk of all-cause hospitalizations compared with midodrine in patients with orthostatic hypotension [^115yS3zY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

There are no clinical trial data that address the relative safety of fludrocortisone compared with midodrine, and there are no prospects for conducting such assessments in the future because of the high cost associated with conducting these studies in a relatively rare condition. In the absence of these data, pharmaco‐epidemiological studies can provide valuable information in this regard. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that fludrocortisone use increases the risk of all‐cause and CHF‐related hospitalizations in patients with OH, compared with midodrine use.

### Acceptability of non-drug therapies in older people with orthostatic hypotension: a qualitative study [^111dapjh]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Based on evidence provided in this study, compression stockings should not be used as first-line therapy as they are largely unacceptable. Bolus water drinking and physical counter-manoeuvres are both acceptable, but physical counter-manoeuvres may have the advantage because they do not depend on equipment, toileting, or advance preparation. As abdominal compression has mixed tolerability, its use could be reserved for those who do not respond to water drinking and counter-manoeuvres.

### Caplyta [^112mHdRc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension and syncope**: Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, with the risk being greatest during initial dose administration. Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension, such as elderly patients, those with dehydration, hypovolemia, or concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications, and patients with known cardiovascular disease, including a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities, and cerebrovascular disease. Caplyta has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiovascular disease, as such patients were excluded from pre-marketing clinical trials.

- **Schizophrenia**: In pooled data from short-term (4- to 6-week), placebo-controlled schizophrenia trials, the frequencies of orthostatic hypotension for Caplyta and placebo were 0.7% and 0%, respectively. The rates of syncope for Caplyta and placebo were 0.2% and 0.2%.

- **Bipolar depression**: In data from short-term (6-week), placebo-controlled monotherapy and adjunctive therapy bipolar depression trials, the frequencies of orthostatic hypotension for Caplyta and placebo were both 0%. The rates of syncope for Caplyta and placebo were 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively, in the monotherapy trials, and there were no reports for Caplyta or placebo in the adjunctive therapy trial.

- **Falls**: Antipsychotics, including Caplyta, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls.

### Midodrine for orthostatic hypotension: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^113C3k33]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of midodrine in orthostatic hypotension (OH), major databases and related conference proceedings were searched through June 30, 2012. Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the outcome measures across studies.

Seven trials were included in the efficacy analysis, enrolling 325 patients with a mean age of 53 years. Two additional trials were included in the safety analysis. Compared to placebo, the mean change in systolic blood pressure was 4.9 mmHg (p = 0.65), and the mean change in mean arterial pressure from supine to standing was -1.7 mmHg (p = 0.45). The change in standing systolic blood pressure before and after administering midodrine was 21.5 mmHg (p < 0.001). A significant improvement was observed in patients' and investigators' global assessment symptoms scale, with a mean difference of 0.70 [95% CI 0.30–1.09; p < 0.001] and 0.80 [95% CI 0.76–0.85; p < 0.001], respectively. There was a significant increase in the risk of piloerection, scalp pruritis, urinary hesitancy/retention, supine hypertension, and scalp paresthesia after administering midodrine. The quality of evidence was limited by imprecision, heterogeneity, and an increased risk of bias.

In conclusion, there is insufficient and low-quality evidence to support the use of midodrine for OH.

### Treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome with medication: A systematic review [^115ji8H7]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) has been recognized for decades; however, it is largely based on anecdotal experience and expert opinion. Pharmacologic treatment remains inconsistent and unstandardized. This systematic review aims to identify controlled studies from which informed treatment decisions can be made.

Through a standard systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we identified all English-language studies of medication treatment for POTS that included a comparison or control group and followed outcomes for at least 1 week of treatment.

A total of 626 studies were identified by the search criteria, and 8, involving a total of 499 patients, met the criteria. No studies were adequately similar to allow for meta-analysis. Of the identified 8 studies, 2 were randomized controlled trials and 4 had been subjected to peer review. In individual studies, there was some favorable effect with fludrocortisone, beta blockers, midodrine, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

There is a paucity of high-quality data regarding the effectiveness of medication in treating POTS. Nonetheless, 2 randomized trials and 6 other reports show some favorable effects of medication.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1166KqmB]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

Exclusion of patients with orthostatic hypotension from antihypertensive trials did not alter the relative effects of treatment concerning falls or syncope. However, clinicians should be cognizant when counseling individuals with orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension about the potential side effects of antihypertensive therapy. Trials that excluded those with orthostatic hypotension may underestimate the absolute risk of adverse effects, such as symptomatic hypotension and possibly falls/syncope, as event rates were lower in trials that excluded this population.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^113D1zKx]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of syncope, collapse, and fluctuating blood pressure (BP). His medications included midodrine (10 mg, three times per day) and fludrocortisone (0.1 mg, two times per day), but neither treatment afforded symptomatic relief. Autonomic testing was performed. Head-up tilt table testing revealed a supine BP of 112/68 mm Hg (heart rate, 74 beats per minute (bpm)) after 6 minutes, which dropped to 76/60 mm Hg (83 bpm) within 2 minutes of 80° head-up tilt. Findings from a heart rate with deep breathing test and a Valsalva test were consistent with autonomic dysfunction. The patient was diagnosed with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and treated with droxidopa (100 mg, two times per day; titrated to 100 mg, one time per day). After initiating treatment with droxidopa, the patient no longer reported losing consciousness on standing and experienced improvement in activities of daily living. These improvements were maintained through 1 year of follow-up.

### Fludrocortisone is associated with a higher risk of all-cause hospitalizations compared with midodrine in patients with orthostatic hypotension [^114Uh3nc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The study exposures were the use of midodrine or fludrocortisone. A previous study reported similar but relatively short persistence on study medications after treatment initiation among older adults. Therefore, for this study, each person‐day of follow‐up was classified into prespecified medication exposure categories using pharmacy information.

- **Use**: Represented person‐time with medications available (i.e. period covered by the prescription's days of supply).
- **Indeterminate use**: Defined as up to 180 days without medication available, following any use. This category was used to reduce exposure misclassification, as adherence could be imperfect and medication effects could extend beyond the last day of medication use.
- **Nonuse**: Represented any person‐time not classified in the previously described categories.

The main study outcome was all‐cause hospitalization. A secondary outcome was CHF‐related hospitalizations. These CHF‐related hospitalizations were identified with a primary discharge diagnosis for CHF (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification code 428.*), which previously showed an estimated positive predictive value of 97.4% using medical chart reviews as the criterion standard.

### Lybalvi [^112vW2ym]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics, such as Lybalvi, can cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The risk is typically greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled study analyzing vital signs data, rates of orthostatic hypotension were less than 2% in patients treated with Lybalvi, placebo, and olanzapine. However, in a 24-week, olanzapine-controlled study, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension was 3.7% in Lybalvi-treated patients compared to 0.4% in those receiving olanzapine.

Monitor orthostatic vital signs in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension (e.g. elderly patients, those with dehydration, hypovolemia, or on concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications or CNS depressants [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]). Additionally, caution is advised for patients with known cardiovascular disease, such as a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities, and those with cerebrovascular disease. Lybalvi has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiovascular disease as these patients were excluded from the premarketing clinical trials.

Antipsychotics, including Lybalvi, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which can lead to falls and consequent fractures or other injuries. It is crucial to conduct thorough fall risk assessments for patients with underlying diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects when initiating antipsychotic treatment and during recurrent evaluations.

### Orthostatic hypotension: Epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment [^115EHL5J]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common cardiovascular disorder, manifesting either with or without signs of underlying neurodegenerative disease. OH is diagnosed based on an orthostatic challenge, characterized by a persistent systolic/diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20/10 mm Hg upon standing. The prevalence of OH is age-dependent, ranging from 5% in patients 70 years of age. OH can complicate the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary heart disease; it may cause disabling symptoms, faints, and traumatic injuries, and it can substantially reduce the quality of life.

Despite being largely asymptomatic or presenting minimal symptoms, OH independently increases mortality and the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. This review outlines the etiology and prevalence of OH in the general population, summarizes its relationship with morbidity and mortality, proposes a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm, and delineates challenges and future perspectives.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^112vR4vZ]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Treating neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) involves a focus on reducing the burden of symptoms such as falls, prolonging standing time, and improving the patient's physical capabilities to restore independence in daily activities. The treatment should not aim to normalize standing blood pressure. A 4-step hierarchical treatment algorithm is suggested:

1. **Assess and adjust medications**: After diagnosing symptomatic nOH, it is crucial to simplify pharmacologic interventions by reducing or discontinuing medications that exacerbate nOH. A comprehensive medication review should be conducted to make necessary adjustments, as many medications, including those used for Parkinson's disease (PD), hypertension, or bladder symptoms, can lower blood pressure and worsen nOH symptoms.

2. **Utilize non-pharmacologic approaches**: These methods should be considered to mitigate symptoms while avoiding additional medications.

3. **Implement single-agent pharmacologic treatment**: Introducing a singular pharmacologic agent may help manage symptoms effectively with minimal side effects.

4. **Combine pharmacologic treatments with caution**: This step should be approached with great caution, considering the potential for adverse interactions.

At each stage, a 2-week assessment is recommended to determine if symptomatic benefits are sufficient before proceeding to the next step. Each aspect of this algorithm is elaborated in detail in subsequent sections.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^114nx8CL]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, more specifically with respect to office BP measurement, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend testing for orthostatic hypotension by first having the patient sit or lie down for 5 minutes and then measuring blood pressure 1 and/or 3 minutes after standing, before starting or intensifying BP-lowering medication.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: Does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1133rvMG]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

Hypertension is a key modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Guidelines, such as those from the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension, recommend blood pressure management with a target systolic blood pressure range of 130–139 mm Hg in older adults (≥ 65 years). The decision to initiate antihypertensive therapy in older adults and the choice of blood pressure target in this cohort requires a trade-off between efficacy and safety, considering adverse events such as falls. Managing hypertensive patients with concomitant orthostatic hypotension is particularly challenging. Orthostatic hypotension affects approximately 20% of adults, with prevalence increasing with age, and is an independent risk factor for injurious falls as well as cardiovascular disease and mortality. Given the prevalence of both conditions and the aging population, the overlap of hypertension and orthostatic hypotension is likely to become an increasingly common dilemma for clinicians.

In some randomised controlled trials, individuals with orthostatic hypotension were excluded, either based on clinical history or objective measurement of orthostatic blood pressure measurements. Generalising findings from clinical trials to patients in routine clinical practice requires an understanding of whether such exclusion criteria alter treatment estimates of safety, especially among potentially vulnerable patients.

We sought to determine whether the association of antihypertensive therapy with adverse events, such as falls, fractures, or syncope, differs when orthostatic hypotension is excluded from consideration.

### Evaluation and management of orthostatic hypotension [^117KaY6h]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing when compared with blood pressure from the sitting or supine position. It results from an inadequate physiological response to postural changes in blood pressure. Orthostatic hypotension may be acute or chronic, as well as symptomatic or asymptomatic. Common symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, nausea, palpitations, and headache. Less common symptoms include syncope, dyspnea, chest pain, and neck and shoulder pain. Causes include dehydration or blood loss; disorders of the neurologic, cardiovascular, or endocrine systems; and several classes of medications.

Evaluation of suspected orthostatic hypotension begins by identifying reversible causes and underlying associated medical conditions. Head-up tilt-table testing can aid in confirming a diagnosis of suspected orthostatic hypotension when standard orthostatic vital signs are nondiagnostic; it also can aid in assessing treatment response in patients with an autonomic disorder. Goals of treatment involve improving hypotension without excessive supine hypertension, relieving orthostatic symptoms, and improving standing time. Treatment includes correcting reversible causes and discontinuing responsible medications, when possible. Nonpharmacologic treatment should be offered to all patients. For patients who do not respond adequately to nonpharmacologic treatment, fludrocortisone, midodrine, and pyridostigmine are potential pharmacologic options.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1172GGnN]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

When the first treatment for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) does not relieve symptom burden, it is important to continue seeking a symptom-alleviating treatment. The goal of treatment is to restore physical capabilities and reduce potentially dangerous symptoms, not to normalize blood pressure. The patient in this case study experienced improved quality of life once his symptoms were successfully treated with droxidopa.

- **Patient's perspective**: My father's case had a slow process. I'm not sure how long he had this because his symptoms began around the same time he was diagnosed with cancer in 2011. It continued to happen even after chemo. His blood pressure would get really low. He lost his brother in a motorcycle accident. We thought maybe the trauma or stress was causing his blood pressure to go crazy. Medications to control his blood pressure were not helping. He was taking three medications, and they were not even bridging the gap. Another physician thought it could be postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which is why my father was referred to the Heartbeat Clinic. They wanted to do tests to ensure the diagnosis before any medication was prescribed. We couldn't even walk from the car to the office without my dad going down and passing out. He couldn't even use the restroom without passing out. He had broken ribs and busted his head open from passing out and falling. He passed out six to seven times per day. My mom would try to get him to a chair real quick. We needed to lift his legs to get his blood circulating, but my mother is small and couldn't get him off the floor. By the time he turned 60…

### Acceptability of non-drug therapies in older people with orthostatic hypotension: a qualitative study [^116K3vmh]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

- **Perceived barriers**: Many participants felt that it would simply be too difficult to attempt applying or removing them without additional help.

	"An absolute pain. You were both struggling to get them on me, if I'd got to put those on myself I dread to think how long it would take" (014).

	"I thought they were impossible to use. You just can't get them on" (016).

	"Putting them on was torture" (26).

	- Another significant barrier to wearing the stockings was their appearance. The stockings used were tan in color and thus, to some, were not aesthetically pleasing.

	"They look awful — from a looks point of view. Yours were really, really thick and very sort of, like an old grannies weren't they?" (06).

	- Side effects of the compression were also identified as a barrier, with one participant experiencing itch whilst wearing them.

	"Couldn't bare them" (015).

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: Does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1173wmgx]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

**Key points**: Co-existing hypertension and orthostatic hypotension is a common management dilemma. The exclusion of this cohort from randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy did not alter the relative safety effects of treatment. However, the exclusion may under-estimate the absolute risk of adverse events such as falls.

### Vraylar [^112Vtr17]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension and syncope**: Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The risk is generally greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension was infrequent in trials of Vraylar and was not more frequent on Vraylar than placebo. Syncope was not observed. Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension, such as elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, or on concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications. It is also important in patients with known cardiovascular disease, including those with a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities, as well as in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Vraylar has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiovascular disease because such patients were excluded from pre-marketing clinical trials.

- **Falls**: Antipsychotics, including Vraylar, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which can lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. It is recommended to complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment, and to do so recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy, especially in those with conditions or medications that could exacerbate these effects.

- **Seizures**: Like other antipsychotic drugs, Vraylar may cause seizures. This risk is greatest in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: Does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116kKmFD]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

The systematic search of articles published between 14 April 2020 and 26 May 2022 identified 2,042 records. Following title and abstract screening, 14 were considered potentially relevant. After applying eligibility criteria to the full-text review of studies included in the prior meta-analysis by Albrasi et al. and potentially relevant studies identified in the updated search, 46 trials (n = 233,357) were included (eFigure S2). The 46 trials had a mean follow-up duration of 34.9 months and included 18 trials (n = 97,976) that excluded those with orthostatic hypotension and 28 trials (n = 135,381) that did not exclude those with orthostatic hypotension. Characteristics of trials and participants by orthostatic hypotension exclusion categories are outlined in Table 1. There was no difference in the mean age of participants by orthostatic hypotension exclusion categories. The baseline systolic BP and diastolic BP were similar in both groups.

- **Individual trial characteristics**: Characteristics of individual trials are outlined in Table 2.

- **Antihypertensive treatment and falls events**: Thirteen trials (n = 94,222) reported falls, and there were 3,002 falls events during the follow-up. The baseline incidence of falls in the control group was 4.8% in trials that excluded orthostatic hypotension compared with 8.8% in trials that did not exclude participants with orthostatic hypotension (P-value = 0.40) (Figure 1). The association of antihypertensive treatment and falls was similar for trials that excluded those with orthostatic hypotension (OR 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89–1.13) and trials that did not exclude those with orthostatic hypotension.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^117K1NdP]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients in each of these groups have a higher risk of orthostatic hypotension (OH)/neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) when compared to the normal population.

For these five categories of patients, clinicians should ask about cardinal symptoms of OH, their frequency and severity, how long they can stand, and the effect of symptoms on their activities of daily living. Questions about symptoms should also note the time of day when they occur, as symptoms of OH/nOH are most likely to occur in the morning and after meals. If a patient gives a positive response to one or more of the questions listed in Table 1, they should be considered as being at risk for OH/nOH, and a more complete evaluation, including orthostatic vital signs, needs to be conducted to confirm a diagnosis of OH/nOH.

From a practical standpoint, at a minimum, the patient should be asked a variation of question 10: "Do you have symptoms when you stand up or within 3–5 minutes of standing and do they get better when you sit or lie down?" Because falls are of such consequence to aging patients, a specific question about circumstances of falls is appropriate. Clinicians must recognize that some patients are reluctant to admit symptoms of OH or falls, fearing that they may lose their autonomy due to family member insistence on enhancing their safety.

- **Table 1: Screening questions for suspected OH/nOH**: Any positive response should prompt further investigation with orthostatic blood pressure measurements.

### Zelapar [^111V54Z1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Hypotension/Orthostatic hypotension**: Assessments of orthostatic (supine and standing) blood pressures at different times throughout the 12-week study period in two controlled trials showed that the frequency of orthostatic hypotension (> 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and/or > 10 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure) was greater with Zelapar treatment than with placebo treatment. Patients taking Zelapar were most likely to experience a decline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks (2 weeks after initiating 2.5 mg Zelapar). At that time, the incidence of systolic orthostatic hypotension was about 21% in Zelapar-treated patients and 9% in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of diastolic orthostatic hypotension was about 12% in Zelapar-treated patients and about 4% in placebo-treated patients. Thus, it appears that there may be an increased risk for orthostatic hypotension in the period after increasing the daily dose of Zelapar from 1.25 to 2.5 mg.

The incidence of orthostatic hypotension was higher in geriatric patients (≥ 65 years) than in non-geriatric patients. In the geriatric patients, orthostatic hypotension occurred in about 3% of Zelapar-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.

- **Dyskinesia**: Zelapar may potentiate dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause dyskinesia or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. In controlled trials, the incidence of dyskinesia was 6% in Zelapar-treated patients and 3% in placebo-treated patients. Decreasing the dose of levodopa may lessen dyskinesia.

### Combination non-pharmacologic intervention for orthostatic hypotension in older people: A phase 2 study [^117Jse6d]. Age and Ageing (2020). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates that there is little additional benefit of combination therapy over single non-drug therapy on the primary outcome. Indeed, rather surprisingly, the combination of bolus water drinking with PCM appears to reduce the efficacy of water therapy. It is theoretically possible that the skeletal muscle vasodilation during PCM attenuates the vasopressor response to water. However, the addition of abdominal compression to the aforementioned combination did improve secondary outcomes, but arguably not to the extent that it becomes clinically valuable. Analogous to the law of diminishing returns, the clinical benefits gained for the patient are less than the effort invested into using combination therapy.

These results are at odds with usual clinical practice, which typically involves recommending several non-pharmacologic interventions to patients with OH. This is particularly relevant for older and frailer populations who typically experience both polypharmacy and polytherapy for multiple conditions. These populations are also most likely to be non-adherent to their treatments. Simplifying advice regarding non-pharmacologic therapy may offer an opportunity to improve uptake and adherence to treatment. The multifactorial pathogenesis of OH in older people may partly explain why there is a mixed response to the different therapies. For example, individuals with sarcopenia may have reduced efficacy of their skeletal muscle pump, whilst those with venous insufficiency may respond more readily to compression therapy. These considerations, alongside other factors, highlight the need for personalized treatment approaches.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113pcNNH]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is a prevalent disorder. Clinicians from a variety of specialties need to be well informed about the diagnosis and management of nOH as it carries a significant burden of morbidity and has also been associated with increased mortality. Clinicians should, therefore, familiarize themselves with this condition and evolving management options, which offer substantial symptomatic improvement. This communication will focus primarily on nOH, while recognizing that orthostatic symptoms are often multifactorial. Patients with nOH may have their symptoms worsened by medications, hypovolemia, intrinsic cardiovascular disease, and other factors.

The literature on nOH is fraught with inconsistencies in the definition and methods of diagnosis, and suffers from a lack of evidence-based guidelines to direct clinicians towards 'best practice'. As nOH is a subset of orthostatic hypotension (OH), it should be noted that patients with nOH and OH may experience the same symptoms but for different reasons. The following consensus definition of OH was devised by the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology, and endorsed by the European Federation of Autonomic Societies and the World Federation of Neurology: OH is "… a sustained reduction of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg, or both, within 3 min of standing or head-up tilt to at least 60° on a tilt table". In addition to meeting the definition for OH, patients with nOH have impairment of the autonomic nervous system.

The EFNS 2006 guidelines recommend the following as part of the initial evaluation of patients with suspected orthostatic hypotension:

- **Structured history taking**: A comprehensive history to assess symptoms and medical background.
- **Detailed physical examination**: Conducting a thorough physical assessment to identify any abnormalities.
- **Supine and upright BP measurements**: Measuring blood pressure while the patient is supine and upright to assess for changes.
- **12-lead ECG recording**: Performing an ECG to evaluate heart function and rule out cardiac causes.
- **Active standing or head-up tilt**: Ideally, this should include continuous assessment of blood pressure and heart rate for 3 minutes.

### Pyridostigmine bromide versus fludrocortisone in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension in Parkinson's disease - a randomized controlled trial [^114EeZjL]. European Journal of Neurology (2017). High credibility.

Evidence for effective treatment options for orthostatic hypotension (OH) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is scarce. Elevation of cholinergic tone with pyridostigmine bromide has been reported as a way to improve blood pressure regulation in neurogenic hypotension without causing supine hypertension.

- **Methods**: This was a double-centre, double-blind, randomized, active-control, crossover, phase II non-inferiority trial of pyridostigmine bromide for OH in PD (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01993680). Patients with confirmed OH were randomized to 14 days of 3 × 60 mg/day pyridostigmine bromide or 1 × 0.2 mg/day fludrocortisone before crossover. Outcome was measured by peripheral and central blood pressure monitoring during the Schellong manoeuvre and questionnaires.

- **Results**: Thirteen participants were enrolled between April 2013 and April 2015, with nine participants completing each trial arm. Repeated measures comparison showed a significant 37% improvement with fludrocortisone for the primary outcome diastolic blood pressure drop on orthostatic challenge (baseline 22.9 ± 13.6 vs. pyridostigmine bromide 22.1 ± 17.0 vs. fludrocortisone 14.0 ± 12.6 mmHg; P = 0.04), while pyridostigmine bromide had no effect. Fludrocortisone caused an 11% peripheral systolic supine blood pressure rise (baseline 128.4 ± 12.8 vs. pyridostigmine bromide 130.4 ± 18.3 vs. fludrocortisone 143.2 ± 10.1 mmHg; P = 0.01) but no central mean arterial supine blood pressure rise (baseline 107.2 ± 7.8 vs. pyridostigmine bromide 97.0 ± 12.0 vs. fludrocortisone 107.3 ± 6.3 mmHg; P = 0.047). Subjective OH severity, motor score, and quality of life measurements were assessed.

### Igalmi [^114TkoQ5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Igalmi causes dose-dependent hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and bradycardia. In clinical studies, 18%, 16%, and 9% of patients treated with 180 mcg of Igalmi, 120 mcg of Igalmi, and placebo, respectively, experienced orthostatic hypotension (defined as SBP decrease ≥ 20 mmHg or DBP decrease ≥ 10 mmHg after 1, 3, or 5 minutes of standing) at 2 hours post-dose. In those studies, 7%, 6%, and 1% of patients treated with 180 mcg of Igalmi, 120 mcg of Igalmi, and placebo, respectively, experienced HR ≤ 50 beats per minute within 2 hours of dosing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In clinical studies with Igalmi, patients were excluded if they had treatment with alpha-1 noradrenergic blockers, benzodiazepines, other hypnotics or antipsychotic drugs four hours prior to study drug administration; had a history of syncope or syncopal attacks; SBP < 110 mmHg; DBP < 70 mmHg; HR < 55 beats per minute; or had evidence of hypovolemia or orthostatic hypotension.

Reports of hypotension and bradycardia, including some resulting in fatalities, have been associated with the use of another dexmedetomidine product given intravenously (Igalmi is for sublingual or buccal use and is not approved for intravenous use). Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported after administration of this other dexmedetomidine product to young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone and when this product was given by rapid intravenous or bolus administration.
