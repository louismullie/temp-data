## Question

What is the significance of an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) with elevated liver enzymes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) together with elevated liver enzymes and how to interpret the overlap. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clear definitions and the patterns of abnormality. Then, I should verify the common etiologies that link macrocytosis and abnormal liver chemistries. Next, I will examine smear morphology and reticulocyte responses to narrow the differential. After that, I need to assess prognostic and triage implications. Finally, I will outline a practical, evidence-informed diagnostic workup and synthesize the most likely scenarios based on clinical context [^111bDP7o] [^117MpALN] [^113z2Ems].

> Let me first confirm the definitions and why the combination matters. Macrocytosis is generally defined as MCV greater than 100 fL, and it is a common CBC abnormality with major causes including alcohol use, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, liver disease, hypothyroidism, and certain medications [^111bDP7o]. Elevated liver enzymes should be parsed into hepatocellular patterns (disproportionate ALT/AST) versus cholestatic patterns (disproportionate alkaline phosphatase), because this directs the differential and testing strategy [^117MpALN]. Hold on, I should verify a key principle before we overweigh absolute numbers: the magnitude of enzyme elevation is not, by itself, a reliable guide to clinical significance outside the clinical context and specific analyte involved, so trend review and context are essential [^113z2Ems].

> Next, I need to consider overlapping etiologies. Alcohol use is a major unifying cause: it raises MCV in a dose-dependent fashion and frequently elevates GGT and transaminases; mechanisms include acetaldehyde-mediated erythrocyte toxicity and associated folate deficiency, though MCV remains a nonspecific marker influenced by multiple factors and genetics has limited explanatory power here [^113VhQCo] [^113BSm1h]. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic dysfunction are the most common causes of mild transaminase elevation in primary care and can coexist with macrocytosis via nutritional factors, insulin resistance, or concurrent hypothyroidism or medication effects, so I should not jump to conclusions without assessing metabolic risk and medications [^112yo3Df] [^117MpALN] [^11799txx]. Nutritional deficiencies remain central: folate and vitamin B12 deficiency cause macrocytosis and may coincide with liver enzyme abnormalities, especially in alcohol misuse; vitamin B12 deficiency can cause both macrocytosis and elevated liver enzymes. To be precise, B12 deficiency causes megaloblastic macrocytosis and can coexist with elevated transaminases from concurrent liver disease or medications, so I should confirm levels and, if borderline, check methylmalonic acid and homocysteine [^111bDP7o] [^112yo3Df].

> I will now examine morphology and marrow response because this often distinguishes pathways. If the peripheral smear shows macro-ovalocytes with hypersegmented neutrophils, megaloblastic anemia from B12 or folate deficiency is likely, which fits common alcohol- and malnutrition-associated mechanisms in liver disease; if the smear is non-megaloblastic, a high reticulocyte count suggests hemolysis or blood loss, whereas a normal or low reticulocyte count points toward alcohol toxicity, liver disease, hypothyroidism, or drugs [^111bDP7o]. But wait, what if we are in pregnancy or a hypertensive disorder context? Then I should double-check for HELLP physiology when macrocytosis is not explanatory but hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia suggest a distinct syndrome requiring urgent obstetric evaluation, and I should remember mimics such as malaria in endemic travel histories that present with hemolysis and enzyme elevations [^113fVnow] [^116cWZrd] [^11499cio].

> Let me think about medications, because they can simultaneously injure the liver and alter red cell indices. Methyldopa can cause hemolytic anemia and liver test abnormalities, so Coombs testing and drug cessation are important if suspected, especially when macrocytosis is paired with reticulocytosis from hemolysis and transaminase rises [^116N8KRd]. Albendazole, lomitapide, and antiretrovirals are examples where transaminase elevations are expected risks, and broader antiretroviral regimens in HIV can yield intricate mechanisms of liver injury that overlap with metabolic and viral causes, so a meticulous medication history and HIV/HBV/HCV assessment are mandatory [^1126SyZM] [^114z5zPT] [^113jESt1] [^117MpALN]. Hold on, I should verify I am not missing commonly used agents; statins rarely cause clinically significant injury and should not be automatically stopped without cause, but they still belong in the medication reconciliation and timeline review when liver tests change [^117MpALN].

> Next, I should review contextual and longitudinal clues, because persistence and prior patterns guide urgency. Most abnormal liver panels remain abnormal on retesting, and interpretation should follow review of past results, history, and targeted exam rather than reflexive repetition; immediate referral is triggered by jaundice or suspected biliary or hepatic malignancy, while otherwise a structured algorithm based on injury pattern is advised [^113XoUqa] [^113z2Ems]. I need to ensure I ask specifically about alcohol quantity and chronicity, because harmful intake thresholds guide fibrosis assessment, and I should verify that GGT disproportion or ALT thresholds are integrated with alcohol risk to triage elastography or specialist referral early rather than late [^114hRj1D] [^117J7mYC].

> I should confirm prognostic implications when both signals coexist. In alcohol-related contexts, I initially thought that MCV greater than 100 fL together with GGT greater than 100 U/L alone mandated fibrosis assessment; wait, let me verify the source and correct myself: guidelines recommend fibrosis assessment for harmful drinkers and for those flagged by AUDIT-C who have abnormal liver tests such as ALT greater than 50 U/L or GGT greater than 100 U/L, regardless of MCV, so MCV helps with suspicion of alcohol exposure but is not itself a fibrosis criterion in these pathways [^117J7mYC] [^114hRj1D]. Beyond alcohol, severe or persistent liver test derangements portend worse outcomes in systemic illness such as COVID-19, where AST predominance and hyperbilirubinemia have correlated with mortality; this underscores why the injury pattern and trajectory matter when macrocytosis coexists as a potential nutritional or alcohol signal rather than a direct driver of risk [^113pbPRG] [^116mgxHL] [^111ydZco].

> Let me outline a pragmatic diagnostic workup while I double-check it against guidelines. Initial tests should include a full blood count with platelets, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear to sort megaloblastic from non-megaloblastic patterns, along with a complete liver panel including ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, albumin, and PT/INR to define the injury pattern and synthetic function, and serum vitamin B12, folate, ferritin, iron, transferrin saturation, and TIBC to assess nutritional and iron status, with hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody screening as standard [^111bDP7o] [^117MpALN] [^112yo3Df] [^11799txx] [^113z2Ems]. I should confirm next steps anatomically and immunologically when indicated: abdominal ultrasound and, if cholestatic, PBC/PSC serologies, and a broader aetiology screen including autoimmune markers per guideline pathways, especially if abnormalities persist beyond intercurrent illness windows [^117MpALN] [^113z2Ems] [^113XoUqa].

> Hold on, I should verify the iron axis and genetics given the macrocytosis clue. If ferritin is elevated, I need to distinguish inflammation from iron overload with transferrin saturation; a high TSAT prompts HFE testing and, if needed, quantitative iron assessment, noting that HFE C282Y homozygosity is associated with higher MCV partly through iron loading and may contribute independently in women, while hyperferritinemia with normal TSAT usually reflects inflammatory or fatty liver states rather than primary hemochromatosis [^115VY5sm] [^114SLmej] [^112yo3Df]. Let me reconsider lifestyle contributors I might miss: active smoking is an often-overlooked cause of macrocytosis and should be queried alongside alcohol, medications, thyroid disease, and nutritional intake to avoid anchoring bias on the liver alone [^11185Ssu] [^111bDP7o].

> If alcohol-related disease is suspected, I should confirm risk quantification and fibrosis staging. Use AUDIT-C with a quantified weekly unit count, counsel cessation, and proceed to noninvasive fibrosis assessment such as elastography when harmful intake is present or when abnormal ALT or GGT thresholds in drinkers are met, with referral considered at higher kPa thresholds; I must also remember that GGT greater than 100 U/L in this context is a trigger even if transaminases are modest [^114hRj1D] [^117J7mYC]. I need to ensure brief interventions and referrals to alcohol services are offered for dependency, as cessation modifies both the macrocytosis and the liver trajectory over time, given the RBC lifespan lag and guideline emphasis on behavior change [^114hRj1D].

> Now, I should set red flags and urgency thresholds. Synthetic failure evidenced by elevated INR or low albumin, the presence of clinical jaundice or features of portal hypertension, and marked biochemical injury patterns warrant urgent referral; while drug labels often use stopping rules like persistent ALT/AST greater than three times the upper limit of normal accompanied by bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of normal, in general hepatology practice these combinations also raise concern for severe drug-induced or intrinsic liver injury and justify expedited evaluation alongside the pattern-based ACG approach [^113XoUqa] [^117MpALN] [^115WRUmV]. Hold on, I should verify I am not missing obstetric emergencies again: in pregnant patients, evolving HELLP physiology with hemolysis and thrombocytopenia plus transaminase elevations requires immediate obstetric management rather than routine liver workup, even if MCV itself is not the driver [^113fVnow] [^116cWZrd].

> Synthesis and bottom line: The pairing of elevated MCV with elevated liver enzymes is nonspecific but clinically meaningful, most often pointing to alcohol use, malnutrition with folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, MASLD/NAFLD with metabolic risk, or medication effects; the smear pattern, reticulocyte response, iron indices, and injury pattern of liver tests quickly stratify the differential and the next tests. Most likely scenarios include alcohol-related liver disease when GGT is disproportionately high and MCV exceeds 100 fL, MASLD in the setting of metabolic syndrome with calculation of fibrosis scores to triage further testing, folate or B12 deficiency in chronic liver disease with dietary risk, and drug-induced liver injury with marrow or hemolytic effects, all of which require targeted history, labs, and, when indicated, noninvasive fibrosis assessment and timely referral for high-risk features [^113VhQCo] [^112yo3Df] [^11799txx] [^113z2Ems] [^117J7mYC]. I should double-check that previous results and comorbidities are reviewed before deciding on repetition or escalation, because clinical context drives significance far more than single absolute values, and persistent or severe abnormalities should not be watched passively without aetiologic investigation and risk stratification [^113z2Ems] [^113XoUqa] [^117MpALN].

Elevated MCV with elevated liver enzymes most often reflects **alcohol use** [^113VhQCo] or **liver disease** (ALD, NAFLD/NASH) [^112yo3Df] but may also indicate vitamin B12/folate deficiency, hypothyroidism, or medication effects [^111bDP7o]. Alcohol-related macrocytosis is **dose-dependent** [^113VhQCo] and commonly coexists with GGT/AST elevations, while NAFLD/NASH is linked to metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance [^112yo3Df] [^116vL4kT]. Evaluate with a CBC, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, B12/folate, TSH, liver panel, hepatitis serologies, and iron studies [^111bDP7o] [^112yo3Df] [^117MpALN]; consider imaging and, if needed, liver biopsy [^113XoUqa]. For **management**, address the cause — alcohol cessation [^114hRj1D], nutritional repletion [^111bDP7o], metabolic risk control [^112yo3Df], and stopping hepatotoxic drugs [^1126SyZM] [^114z5zPT] — and refer to a specialist for persistent or severe abnormalities [^113z2Ems].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several mechanisms underlie concurrent **elevations in MCV and liver enzymes**:

- **Alcohol consumption**: Alcohol has direct hematotoxic effects, causing macrocytosis through interference with erythrocyte stability and structure [^113BSm1h]. Acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of alcohol, accumulates in erythrocytes, leading to cell damage and immune-mediated responses. Alcohol also induces liver injury, reflected by elevated liver enzymes.

- **Liver disease**: Chronic liver diseases, such as alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cirrhosis, are associated with macrocytosis due to altered lipid metabolism, impaired erythropoiesis, and nutritional deficiencies (e.g. vitamin B12, folate) [^111bDP7o] [^112yo3Df].

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies cause megaloblastic anemia, characterized by macrocytosis and elevated liver enzymes due to impaired DNA synthesis and hepatocellular injury.

- **Medications and toxins**: Certain medications (e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine, antiretrovirals) and toxins can cause macrocytosis and hepatotoxicity, leading to elevated liver enzymes.

## Clinical conditions associated with elevated MCV and liver enzymes

The table below summarizes common **clinical conditions associated with elevated MCV and liver enzymes**:

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|

## Diagnostic approach

A systematic **diagnostic approach** is essential to determine the underlying cause:

- **Clinical history and examination**: Assess alcohol intake, medication use, dietary habits, and symptoms of liver disease or anemia [^113XoUqa] [^112hkzh2].

- **Laboratory tests**: Perform complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, vitamin B12 and folate levels, liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, bilirubin), hepatitis serologies, and iron studies [^117MpALN] [^112yo3Df].

- **Imaging studies**: Abdominal ultrasound or MRI to evaluate liver structure, steatosis, or cirrhosis [^113z2Ems].

- **Liver biopsy**: Consider in cases of unexplained persistent elevations or suspected advanced liver disease [^117MpALN].

---

## Clinical implications and prognosis

Concurrent elevation of MCV and liver enzymes **indicates significant underlying pathology**, often due to chronic liver disease, alcohol misuse, or nutritional deficiencies [^117MpALN]. Prognosis depends on the cause, severity of liver injury, and response to treatment [^117MpALN]. Persistent elevations increase the risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality, necessitating prompt evaluation and management.

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on addressing the **underlying cause**:

- **Alcohol cessation**: Essential in alcohol-related liver disease [^114hRj1D].

- **Nutritional supplementation**: Vitamin B12 and folate replacement in deficiencies [^111bDP7o].

- **Medication adjustment**: Discontinuation or dose adjustment of hepatotoxic drugs [^1126SyZM] [^114z5zPT].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, dietary changes, and exercise in NAFLD [^112yo3Df].

- **Monitoring and follow-up**: Regular monitoring of liver enzymes and hematological parameters [^113z2Ems].

---

Elevated MCV with elevated liver enzymes signals **underlying pathology** — such as alcohol misuse, liver disease, nutritional deficiencies, or medication effects — and warrants a systematic diagnostic approach with targeted management to improve outcomes [^112yo3Df] [^117MpALN].

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113z2Ems]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations list**: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months (level 2b, grade B).

- **Research recommendation 1**: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended (level 5, grade D).

- **Recommendation 2**: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history, and medical condition (level 5, grade D).

- **Recommendation 3**: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte that is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context (level 5, grade D).

- **Recommendation 4**: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte that is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B).

- **Recommendation 5**: In adults, a standard liver aetiology screen should include an abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and serum immunoglobulins.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^111bDP7o]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: Causes and evaluation [^112yo3Df]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Mild, asymptomatic elevations (less than five times the upper limit of normal) of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels are common in primary care. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the U.S. population has elevated transaminase levels. An approach based on the prevalence of diseases that cause asymptomatic transaminase elevations can help clinicians efficiently identify common and serious liver disease.

- **Common and uncommon causes**: The most common causes of elevated transaminase levels are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes include alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease.

- **Extrahepatic sources**: Extrahepatic sources, such as thyroid disorders, celiac sprue, hemolysis, and muscle disorders, are also associated with mildly elevated transaminase levels.

- **Initial evaluation**: The initial evaluation should include an assessment for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (i.e. waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting lipid level, and fasting glucose or A1C level); a complete blood count with platelets; measurement of serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin; and hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen testing.

- **Helpful indices**: The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score and the alcoholic liver disease/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease index can be helpful in the evaluation of mildly elevated transaminase levels. If testing for common causes is consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and is otherwise unremarkable, a tr

### Assessing the impact of alcohol consumption on the genetic contribution to mean corpuscular volume [^113VhQCo]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

The molecular basis for the increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) that occurs with alcohol misuse is incompletely understood. A study of 105 alcohol-dependent individuals, 62 moderate drinkers, and 24 abstainers was able to show that the increase in MCV was dose-dependent. Alcohol may have direct haematotoxic effects by interfering with cell structure and erythrocyte stability. Interestingly, the levels of acetaldehyde, a metabolite of alcohol, show a significant increase inside erythrocytes of alcohol-dependent individuals. Since acetaldehyde is a toxic metabolite and can bind to proteins, this may lead to erythrocyte damage directly or through an immune-mediated mechanism via the development of anti-acetaldehyde adduct antibodies. Folate deficiency also occurs with alcohol misuse, particularly in those patients with liver disease, and therefore may be implicated in increasing the MCV.

It is important to note, however, that MCV is a non-specific biomarker in that other factors such as age, smoking, malnutrition, and underlying diseases, including hypothyroidism, liver disease, and pernicious anaemia, are also known to affect MCV. There is also a genetic contribution to the MCV, in addition to the genetic factors that have been identified for other haematological indices. Genetic factors have also been implicated in high alcohol consumption — our recent study showed genome-wide significant effects across six loci following meta-analysis in two large independent cohorts. The relationship between the genetic loci that determine the MCV and those associated with excess alcohol drinking is, however, unconvincing.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117J7mYC]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

- **Recommendation 9**: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease, such as features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests, and/or a Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available).

Patients flagged up with the AUDIT-C but drinking < 15 U/week, and who have abnormal liver tests (ALT > 50 U/L or GGT > 100 U/L), should be considered for an assessment of liver fibrosis, similar to the higher-risk group.

- **Research recommendation 2**: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.

### High mean corpuscular volume predicts poor outcome for patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma [^112ZYD3F]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

High mean corpuscular volume (MCV) plasma levels were significantly correlated with diminished overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), establishing the preoperative MCV plasma level as an independent prognostic factor for patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. In addition to MCV, the prognostic roles of mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), and hemoglobin (Hb) levels were evaluated. However, only MCH, MCHC, and RDW proved to be independent prognostic factors for OS and DFS.

Anemia is prevalent among cancer patients, and the prognostic significance of hematologic parameters has been documented for various malignancies, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, at the time of writing, no data exist on the correlation between MCV and the survival of patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. Since MCV serves as an indicator for the red blood cell volume, it is commonly employed in the detection of megaloblastic or iron-deficiency anemia. Macrocytosis is frequently associated with liver and blood diseases, alcohol consumption, smoking, and vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.

In contrast to ESCC, no correlation exists between alcohol consumption and the development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG). Therefore, alternate reasons for elevated MCV must be considered for patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. A plausible explanation could be the tumor's location at the gastroesophageal junction. Malignant tumors near the cardia of the stomach, developing from chronic atrophic gastritis, could impair the function of parietal cells and consequently lead to vitamin B12 deficiency and macrocytic anemia.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests, such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions.

Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations. The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause.

In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### Determinants and characteristics of mean corpuscular volume and hemoglobin concentration in white HFE C282Y homozygotes in the hemochromatosis and iron overload screening study [^115VY5sm]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

Elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is common in persons with hemochromatosis associated with HFE C282Y homozygosity. We evaluated data from the subset of non-Hispanic white participants in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study to determine if elevated MCV in C282Y homozygotes is related to this genotype or to serum iron measures. Regression analysis was used to model MCV and hemoglobin (Hb) from transferrin saturation (TfSat), serum ferritin (SF), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, age, HFE genotype, field center, and presence of liver-related abnormalities in C282Y homozygotes and control subjects without HFE mutations (wt/wt genotype).

Mean MCV was higher in C282Y homozygotes than in HFE wt/wt controls (94.4 vs. 89.7 fL in women; 95.3 vs. 91.2 fL in men; P < 0.0001 for both). These differences were largely associated with increased mean TfSat and SF in C282Y homozygotes. Adjusted mean MCV was 92.0 fL (95% confidence interval, 91.1–92.9) in female C282Y homozygotes and 90.9 fL (90.3–91.5) in controls. Among women with SF in the reference range 20–200 microg/L, adjusted mean MCV was 92.9 fL (91.7–94.2) in C282Y homozygotes, 1.8 fL higher than in controls (P = 0.013). The adjusted mean MCV of male C282Y homozygotes and controls was similar (P = 0.30). Adjusted mean Hb was 0.2 g/dL higher in women with C282Y/C282Y than in controls. Greater mean MCV in C282Y homozygosity reflects increased mean TfSat and mean SF in men and women; an additional effect of genotype on MCV and Hb was detected in women.

### Hellp syndrome: a rare, early presentation at 17 weeks of gestation [^116cWZrd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

The occurrence of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome before 20 weeks of gestation is extremely rare. This condition has been reported in only a few cases, always in conjunction with other comorbidities such as fetal triploidy and the antiphospholipid syndrome.

- **Case**: A 24-year-old woman was admitted at 15 weeks and 3 days of gestation with uncontrollable hypertension and proteinuria. An extensive workup did not reveal any underlying medical or obstetric conditions. Within 11 days of admission, her condition deteriorated, and the diagnosis of severe HELLP syndrome was supported by the findings of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and severe thrombocytopenia, all of which resolved after the termination of the pregnancy.

- **Conclusion**: Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome in women presenting with clinical manifestations or laboratory abnormalities consistent with this diagnosis, even before 20 weeks of gestation.

### Budd-Chiari syndrome: A rare and life-threatening complication of Crohn's disease [^112HjKWm]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Laboratory studies determined that he had iron deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin 5.7 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume 57 fL, undetectable serum iron, and ferritin of 9 mg/dL) from chronic gastrointestinal blood loss, normal bilirubin (total: 0.8 mg/dL and unconjugated: 0.4 mg/dL) and creatinine (0.6 mg/dL) levels, increased prothrombin time (16.6 s), hypoalbuminaemia (2.2 g/dL), and elevated liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase: 138 U/L; alanine transaminase: 83 U/L; aspartate transaminase: 81 U/L). Stool examination revealed positive faecal leucocytes but was otherwise negative for faecal culture for enteric pathogens, including Clostridium difficile toxin, Giardia antigen, Cryptosporidium antigen, and other ova and parasites. The elevation of his liver enzymes remained unexplained, as he had no history of alcohol abuse, and serological studies for hepatotropic viruses were negative. Laboratory studies performed to evaluate for Wilson's disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and primary biliary cholangitis were also negative.

Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly with moderate ascites. Ascitic fluid was sampled, which showed 1.1 consistent with portal hypertension. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy to further evaluate his bleeding and history of IBD were performed. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed erythema in the antrum of the stomach and multiple superficial duodenal ulcers (figure 1). Biopsies from the upper and lower GI tract showed gastroduode.

### Iron overload may be critical for liver dysfunction in anorexia nervosa, and the role of haematocrit-adjusted albumin in assessing nutritional status: a case report [^113vBvGM]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is frequently associated with liver dysfunction, but the precise mechanism remains undefined. Since the nutritional marker albumin has a low correlation with changes in body weight in AN, and patients with AN often have dehydration as a complication, we also examined whether haematocrit (HCT)-adjusted serum albumin could be a better nutritional marker in AN.

- **Case presentation**: We describe a 15-year-old girl with severe weight loss and liver damage whose liver enzymes normalized after 1.5 months of hospitalization and weight gain. We found a significant correlation between body weight (BW) and HCT-adjusted serum albumin (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rs) = 0.66, P = 5.28 × 10⁻³) and between BW and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (rs = -0.825, P = 8.45 × 10⁻⁵). After division by HCT, correlations between serum albumin and ALT (rs = -0.835, P = 5.24 × 10⁻⁵) and between the iron-storage protein ferritin and the liver enzyme gamma-glutamyl transferase (rs = 1.0, P = 0.017) were also statistically significant.

- **Conclusion**: These results suggest that improvement of the nutritional status in AN could relieve liver dysfunction and facilitate iron transport. Since a decrease in the iron-transport protein transferrin presumably increases labile non-transferrin-bound iron, resulting in excess reactive oxygen species production, a defect in iron transport due to malnutrition could be one of the causes of liver injury in AN. In addition, HCT-adjusted albumin could be a better marker than its raw data to assess changes in nutritional status in AN.

### Assessing the impact of alcohol consumption on the genetic contribution to mean corpuscular volume [^114dJ4k1]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

Analysis of the heterogenous effects between individuals with different alcohol intakes found that no variants reached the threshold for statistical significance (P < 2.4 × 10−4). SNP rs218264 was the closest to this threshold at P = 5.2 × 10−4, although both the low and heavy drinking groups showed significant associations with this variant (Table 3). No variants reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) when exploring the heterogeneity of allelic effects between the different drinking groups. Specific assessment of the alcohol metabolizing pathway found no evidence of an alcohol-related association between MCV and either the ADH or ALDH SNPs (Supplementary Material, Table S2).

The genetic score used as a proxy for acetaldehyde accumulation rate/speed of clearance in drinkers only was independent of confounding factors (i.e. covariates included in multivariate model). The frequencies of the effect alleles contributing to the allele score were as follows: rs1229984_T = 0.021; rs698_T = 0.588, and rs2228093_T = 0.121. We found no evidence for an association between MCV and the allele score (P = 0.53). However, there was evidence that the allele score was associated with alcohol intake (P < 2 × 10−16). Categorization of the allele score demonstrated that this relationship with alcohol consumption was dose-dependent (negative direction), and thus, the score can be considered valid given Knowledge of alcohol metabolism and its relationship with intake.

### Does this patient with liver disease have cirrhosis [^112hkzh2]. JAMA (2012). Low credibility.

Among adult patients with liver disease, identifying those most likely to have cirrhosis noninvasively is challenging. The objective of the study was to identify simple clinical indicators that can exclude or detect cirrhosis in adults with known or suspected liver disease.

Data sources included searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1966 to December 2011), as well as reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks. For study selection, 86 studies of adequate quality were retained that evaluated the accuracy of clinical findings for identifying histologically proven cirrhosis.

Data extraction involved two authors independently abstracting data (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LRs]) and assessing methodological quality. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate summary LRs across studies. Results from the 86 studies included 19,533 patients, among whom 4725 had biopsy-proven cirrhosis, resulting in a prevalence rate of 24% (95% CI, 20%-28%).

Many physical examinations and simple laboratory tests increase the likelihood of diagnosing cirrhosis. The most frequently studied, reliable, and informative results include the presence of ascites (LR, 7.2; 95% CI, 2.9–12) and a low platelet count (LR, 9.4; 95% CI, 2.6–37). For lowering the likelihood of cirrhosis, the most useful findings are a Lok index < 0.2 (a score created from the platelet count and serum aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase ratio).

### Malaria in pregnant woman masquerading as HELLP syndrome [^11499cio]. American Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Malaria may be complicated by the development of thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and/or hemolysis, which may be difficult to distinguish from HELLP (hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome in a pregnant patient. A 33-year-old woman developed a HELLP-like syndrome and persistent fever postpartum without symptoms of preeclampsia. A malaria blood smear was performed, returning positive for Plasmodium falciparum. The patient was immediately treated with quinine. Follow-up was uneventful, with the total disappearance of fever and prompt resolution of biochemical signs of the HELLP-like syndrome three days later.

Malaria in a pregnant woman can masquerade as HELLP syndrome. The wide overlap in symptoms (headache, malaise, digestive symptoms) does not suggest that symptoms would be effective in differentiating malaria and preeclampsia. A recent travel to an endemic area, associated with a malaria blood smear and clinical examination, should be key to the differential diagnosis.

### Liver volume in thalassaemia major: Relationship with body weight, serum ferritin, and liver function [^114d2k8r]. Pediatric Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

It is not known whether body weight alone can adjust for the volume of the liver in the calculation of the chelating dose in beta-thalassemia major patients, who frequently have iron overload and hepatitis.

- **Objective**: The hypothesis is that liver volume in children and adolescents suffering from beta-thalassemia major is affected by ferritin level and liver function.

- **Materials and methods**: Thirty-five beta-thalassemia major patients aged 7–18 years, and 35 age- and sex-matched controls had liver volume measured by MRI. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and ferritin levels were obtained in the thalassemia major patients.

- **Results**: Body weight explained 65% and 86% of the change in liver volume in beta-thalassemia major patients and age-matched control subjects, respectively. Liver volume per kilogram of body weight was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in thalassemia major patients than in control subjects. There was a significant correlation between ALT level and liver volume per kilogram body weight (r = 0.55, P = 0.001). Patients with elevated ALT had significantly higher liver volume per kilogram body weight (mean 42.9 ± 12 cm³/kg) than control subjects (mean 23.4 ± 3.6 cm³/kg) and patients with normal ALT levels (mean 27.4 ± 3.6 cm³/kg).

- **Conclusions**: Body weight is the most important single factor for liver volume changes in thalassemia major patients, but elevated ALT also has a significant role. Direct liver volume measurement for chelation dose adjustment may be advantageous in patients with elevated ALT.

### Hemgenix [^113cHHhU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Five subjects experienced AST elevations greater than 2–3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), with values ranging from 71 IU/L to 118 IU/L. Three subjects had AST elevations greater than 3–5 times the ULN, with values ranging from 127 IU/L to 163 IU/L. One subject had AST elevation greater than 5 times the ULN, recorded at 327 IU/L, which occurred 11 months post-Hemgenix administration.

Seventeen subjects had elevations in ALT levels within the first four months after Hemgenix infusion, ranging from 41 IU/L to 275 IU/L. Of these, eleven subjects' ALT levels resolved within four months post-infusion, with values ranging from 41 IU/L to 275 IU/L. Five subjects' ALT levels did not normalize as of the last follow-up, with values at the two-year follow-up ranging from 48 IU/L to 110 IU/L. Seven additional subjects experienced ALT elevations with onset between months 6 to 24, with values ranging from 42 IU/L to 193 IU/L. Five of these subjects had additional risk factors for elevated transaminase levels, including Hepatitis C and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). In three subjects, ALT levels remained elevated as of the last follow-up, with values ranging from 59 IU/L to 193 IU/L.

### Acute hepatic porphyrias: Recommendations for evaluation and long-term management [^116XvCtm]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The acute hepatic porphyrias are a group of four inherited disorders, each resulting from a deficiency in the activity of a specific enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. These disorders present clinically with acute neurovisceral symptoms, which may be sporadic and, when severe, can be life-threatening. The diagnosis is often missed or delayed as the clinical features resemble other more common medical conditions. There are four major subgroups:

- **Symptomatic patients with sporadic attacks**: Less than four attacks per year or acute attacks, which are four or more attacks per year.
- **Asymptomatic high porphyrin precursor excretors**.
- **Asymptomatic latent patients**: Without symptoms or porphyrin precursor elevations.

Given their clinical heterogeneity and potential for significant morbidity with suboptimal management, comprehensive clinical guidelines for initial evaluation, follow-up, and long-term management are needed. Particularly, no guidelines exist for monitoring disease progression or response to treatment. The Porphyrias Consortium of the National Institutes of Health's Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network, which consists of expert centers in the clinical management of these disorders, has formulated these recommendations. These recommendations are based on the literature, ongoing natural history studies, and extensive clinical experience.

Initial assessments should include diagnostic confirmation by biochemical testing, subsequent genetic testing to determine the specific acute hepatic porphyria, and a complete medical history and physical examination.

### Pulmonary hypertension with warm hands [^112cfRYX]. Thorax (2017). Low credibility.

Routine blood chemistry showed a haemoglobin level of 16.0 g/dL, haematocrit 57%, a mean corpuscular volume of 72, and a reticulocyte index of 18%, together with a serum iron of 6.1 μmol/L and ferritin of 7 μg/L, suggestive of anaemia secondary to severe iron deficiency, most likely due to hypermenorrhoea. The N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level was elevated to 196 pg/mL. Thrombocytes, white blood cells, kidney function, liver enzymes, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were all within reference values.

No abnormalities were noted on the chest radiograph; however, a transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild right ventricular (RV) dilatation and dysfunction, a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion of 23 mm, an estimated RV systolic pressure of 57 mm Hg, and right atrial pressure of 5 mm Hg. Furthermore, there was no evidence of paradoxical septal motion. Cardiac magnetic imaging (CMR) was performed, which confirmed mild RV dysfunction with an RV ejection fraction of 47%. The RV appeared mildly dilated and hypertrophic, whereas no signs of valvular abnormalities or intracardiac shunts were noted. This pointed to a pulmonary cause of her RV dysfunction.

Spirometry showed a total lung capacity of 3.97 L (4.84 L; 82%), residual volume of 1.08 L (1.31 L; 82%), FVC of 2.65 L (3.59 L; 74%), and an FEV1 of 1.75 L (3.13 L; 56%). Carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) was 97.64 μmol/s/kPa (60%), and the 6-minute walking distance was 370 m with no drop in SpO2. Because of the suspicion of pulmonary hypertension (PH)…

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^114hRj1D]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

- **Alcohol-related liver disease algorithm**: In patients where alcohol is suspected to be the main injurious factor, the extent of consumption influences early decision-making. For those drinking at harmful levels, defined as ≥ 35 units/week for women and ≥ 50 units/week for men, an assessment of liver fibrosis is the critical next step. For other patients, the administration of the AUDIT C questionnaire alongside a brief intervention is recommended initially. For patients who continue to drink at hazardous levels, consideration should be given to assessment as for the higher-risk category according to liver fibrosis evaluation. This is particularly important for those with a GGT of > 100 U/L.

Cut-off points for ARFI vary according to the manufacturer and should be tailored to the device used. ARFI stands for acoustic radiation force impulse, ELF for enhanced liver fibrosis, GGT for γ-glutamyltransferase, and HCC for hepatocellular carcinoma.

- **Aim of treatment in ARLD**: The aim is for the patient to stop drinking harmfully, which usually means complete abstinence. Referral to alcohol services should be undertaken for those patients with alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19, and kept in mind for those patients with an AUDIT score of ≥ 8. Importantly, a liver diagnosis itself can be a highly effective intervention to change behavior and may be all that is required in many cases. However, the provision of such brief interventions in primary care is inconsistent and should be given greater priority.

- **Recommendation 8**: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with ARLD with evidence of alcohol dependency.

### VAFSEO [^115WRUmV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Evaluation of anemia and iron stores involves correcting and excluding other causes of anemia, such as vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, and bleeding, before initiating VAFSEO. Iron status should be assessed in all patients before and during treatment. Supplemental iron therapy is recommended when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or serum transferrin saturation is below 20%. Most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will require supplemental iron during therapy. Hemoglobin (Hb) levels should be measured at baseline and as recommended in section 2.4.

For liver testing, measure serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin prior to starting VAFSEO and then monthly for the first six months. Thereafter, monitor as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Discontinue VAFSEO if there are persistent ALT or AST elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or if ALT or AST elevations greater than three times ULN are accompanied by a bilirubin increase greater than two times ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Important dosing information**: Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not aim for a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g/dL. VAFSEO can be taken with or without food and should be swallowed whole. Tablets must not be cut, crushed, or chewed.

### The liver in COVID-19: Prevalence, patterns, predictors, and impact on outcomes of liver test abnormalities [^116mgxHL]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic unprecedented in over a century, with approximately 35 million cases and more than 1 million deaths globally. Though predominantly a lower respiratory illness, other organ injuries are well-recognized. Among these, liver injury is of major interest. The objective of the study was to define the prevalence, patterns, predictors, and impact of liver injury among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected retrospectively among patients admitted to St. Luke's University Hospital with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 18, 2020. The association of liver tests (LTs) with mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and biochemical predictors, was examined.

Data were available on 551 patients. The prevalence of any or ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal transaminase elevation was 61.2% and 9.4% on admission, and 72.1% and 22.4% at peak. Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase elevations were less common on admission (11.4% and 12.6%, respectively) and at peak (17.7% and 22%, respectively). All liver test (LT) elevations were consistently predicted by inflammatory markers. Hyperbilirubinemia predicted mortality both on admission and at peak. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had opposite impacts on mortality, with AST positively and ALT negatively associated with mortality. Hence, besides hyperbilirubinemia, the AST:ALT ratio emerged as the best marker for mortality among the LTs.

### Albenza [^1126SyZM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

In clinical trials, treatment with Albenza has been associated with mild to moderate elevations of hepatic enzymes in approximately 16% of patients. These elevations have generally returned to normal upon discontinuation of therapy. There have also been case reports of acute liver failure of uncertain causality and hepatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

- **Monitoring hepatic effects**: Monitor liver enzymes (transaminases) before the start of each treatment cycle and at least every 2 weeks during treatment. If hepatic enzymes exceed twice the upper limit of normal, consideration should be given to discontinuing Albenza therapy based on individual patient circumstances. Restarting Albenza treatment in patients whose hepatic enzymes have normalized off treatment is an individual decision that should take into account the risk/benefit of further Albenza usage. Perform laboratory tests frequently if Albenza treatment is restarted.

Patients with elevated liver enzyme test results are at increased risk for hepatotoxicity and bone marrow suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Discontinue therapy if liver enzymes are significantly increased or if clinically significant decreases in blood cell counts occur.

- **Unmasking of neurocysticercosis in hydatid patients**: Undiagnosed neurocysticercosis may be uncovered in patients treated with Albenza for other conditions. Patients with epidemiologic factors who are at risk for neurocysticercosis should be evaluated prior to initiation of therapy.

### Elevated concentrations of liver enzymes and ferritin identify a new phenotype of insulin resistance: effect of weight loss after gastric banding [^1149i42e]. Obesity Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Several studies have associated elevated liver enzymes (LFTs), obesity, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and a link has been established between insulin resistance (IR) and elevated ferritin concentrations. We examined the relationship between LFTs, ferritin, and IR in morbidly obese subjects and the effect of weight loss after bariatric surgery.

- **Methods**: We measured liver enzymes, ferritin, insulin resistance, and glucose tolerance (by OGTT) in 159 morbidly obese subjects (BMI = 44.4 ± 0.4 kg/m²) at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year after laparoscopic-adjustable-gastric banding (LAGB). Subjects were divided into two groups: increased LFTs (ALT > 30; AST/ALT < 1) vs. normal LFTs.

- **Results**: A large proportion of morbidly obese subjects had increased LFTs (44%) which were associated with increased IR and ferritin, suggesting potential liver disease. A majority of the morbidly obese with increased LFTs, IGT, and T2DM were male and had almost double ferritin concentrations, strongly correlated with ALT (r = 0.43, p < 0.0001). Both ferritin and ALT correlated with waist circumference and IR. One year after LAGB, glucose tolerance improved, LFTs and IR were reduced; ferritin did not change significantly but was still correlated with IR.

- **Conclusions**: Ferritin may be an additional useful marker for more severe hepatic IR.

### Assessing the impact of alcohol consumption on the genetic contribution to mean corpuscular volume [^111gmyw9]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

Stratification of participants by drinking status did not identify any loci that determined the effect of alcohol intake on mean corpuscular volume (MCV). This suggests that the pathways through which alcohol influences MCV are not mediated by genetic variation. This was supported by the causal inference for alcohol on MCV levels when using rs1229984 as a proxy for alcohol consumption in the Mendelian randomization analysis. However, the discriminatory power of MCV in identifying heavy alcohol use is modest, given that alcohol accounts for only ~65% of MCV values above 100 fL. Additionally, the turnover of erythrocytes is around 120 days, meaning that recently abstinent individuals will present with evidence of alcohol consumption for several months.

Using a genetic score to define alcohol metabolism, we did not find evidence to support that acetaldehyde accumulation is important in determining MCV levels. This is contrary to the findings in Asians for MCV and other alcohol-related liver function in Europeans. The lack of association with MCV is likely due to the fact that rs1229984 (ADH1B) is rare in Europeans and the ubiquitous presence of active ALDH2, the enzyme primarily involved in the rapid metabolism of acetaldehyde to acetate. Similar results to our own for ALDH gene polymorphisms were reported in a study of 510 white alcohol-dependent patients.

The PheWAS analysis showed SNP level pleiotropy for variants involved in MCV, suggesting a shared genetic risk with a number of conditions. Many of these combinations have strong physiological connections with one another, such as mineral metabolism.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113XoUqa]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

In response to abnormal liver blood tests, the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral, as indicated in Figure 1. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes, it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause.

Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness. However, when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after one month, and even at two years, 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests, it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding.

In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

- **Response to abnormal liver blood tests**: The initial response to abnormal liver blood tests is detailed in Figure 1. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure, and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine the choice of pathway.

### Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): Where are we now and where are we going [^111DyHhS]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Although non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was considered relatively uncommon prior to the middle of the last decade, over the past three years, there has been an explosion of studies on various aspects of NASH, with one study reporting that after hepatitis C, NASH was the most common diagnosis in patients presenting largely with persistent abnormalities of liver function tests. The field of NASH has come a long way in a relatively short space of time. This article considers advances in knowledge that have arisen as a result of these studies and highlights areas for further work.

### Methyldopa [^116N8KRd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Methyldopa can cause Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia. If this occurs, the medication should be discontinued as the anemia typically resolves quickly. Should it persist, corticosteroids may be administered, and other causes of anemia should be evaluated. The drug should not be reinstituted if methyldopa is the cause.

When methyldopa leads to Coombs positivity, either alone or with hemolytic anemia, the red cells are generally coated with gamma globulin of the IgG (gamma G) class only. The Coombs test may take weeks to months to return to normal after stopping methyldopa.

- **Transfusion considerations**: If a patient on methyldopa requires a transfusion, both direct and indirect Coombs tests should be performed. In the absence of hemolytic anemia, only the direct Coombs test is usually positive, which does not interfere with typing or cross-matching. However, if the indirect Coombs test is positive, issues may arise with major cross-matching, necessitating the assistance of a hematologist or transfusion expert.

- **Adverse events**: Occasionally, patients experience fever within the first three weeks of methyldopa therapy, sometimes with eosinophilia or liver function test abnormalities, such as changes in serum alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT), bilirubin, and prothrombin time. Jaundice, possibly without fever, may develop, typically within the first two to three months of therapy. Some patients show signs consistent with cholestasis, while others may exhibit hepatitis and hepatocellular damage.

Rarely, other reactions may occur.

### A prediction model for hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets syndrome in pre-eclampsia with severe features [^113fVnow]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

Pre-eclampsia (PE) with severe features is defined as one or more of the following conditions: blood pressure (BP) during admission or hospitalization with systolic BP ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 110 mmHg on two occasions, at least 4 hours apart; or elevated systolic BP between 140 and 159 mmHg, or elevated diastolic BP between 90 and 109 mmHg on two occasions, at least 4 hours apart (defined as mild hypertension), with the presence of any of the following:

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Platelet count ≤ 100,000/μL.
- **Elevated liver enzymes**: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ twice the upper normal level.
- **Severe persistent right‐upper‐quadrant/epigastric pain**: Pain unresponsive to medication.
- **Acute kidney injury**: Defined as elevated serum creatinine > 1.1 mg/dL or doubling of serum creatinine in the absence of other renal disease.
- **Pulmonary edema** or **new‐onset cerebral/visual disturbance**.

Proteinuria was defined as protein secretion ≥ 300 mg in a 24-hour urine collection or, when absent, as a protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 0.3.

HELLP syndrome was defined by all of the following:

- **Hemolysis due to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**: > 600 IU/L, and/or serum bilirubin ≥ 1.2 mg/dL, and/or a suggestive peripheral blood smear.
- **Elevated liver enzymes**: ALT and AST ≥ twice the upper normal level.
- **Thrombocytopenia**: Platelet count ≤ 100,000/μL.

All three components were required to diagnose a patient with HELLP syndrome.

New‐onset postpartum PE is defined as PE that occurs within 6 weeks postpartum, excluding cases with antepartum PE with persistent PE. Small for gestational age is defined as birth weight below the 10th percentile.

### Genome-wide and Mendelian randomisation studies of liver MRI yield insights into the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis [^117NtVvg]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

The intronic variant in SLC30A10, a gene which codes for a predominantly manganese metal ion transporter, was also associated with elevated cT1 measures in our study, as well as elevated aminotransferases in the UK Biobank. Manganese is an essential metal required for the adequate functioning of numerous enzymes; however, it is toxic and induces cell death at elevated cellular levels. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC30A10 have previously been associated with cirrhosis, higher manganese levels in liver biopsy samples, and neurotoxicity including parkinsonian-like movement disorders.

The association between cT1 increasing alleles at the two novel loci (SLC39A8 and SLC30A10) and higher ALT and AST adds supportive evidence for their pathogenic role in the liver. The missense variant in SLC39A8 has previously been shown to be associated with multiple traits including alcohol intake, BMI, schizophrenia, Crohn's disease, lower brain grey matter volume, and microbiome diversity. We show for the first time a further novel association with higher diabetes and triglyceride levels, while highlighting variable effects on cholesterol levels. The associations of both variants with cT1 were independent of BMI, alcohol intake, liver fat percentage, and liver iron content in our sensitivity models.

### Evaluation and management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^112BgUFv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents a spectrum of liver diseases that occur in the absence of alcohol consumption in amounts considered injurious to the liver. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes both non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We present an integrated approach that utilizes both clinical and laboratory studies to diagnose and manage a patient with suspected non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

The goals of treatment include:

- **Correction of the underlying risk factors**: Address lifestyle changes and manage comorbid conditions.
- **Avoidance of factors that promote progression of liver disease**: This includes lifestyle adjustments and monitoring of harmful substances.
- **Specific treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis**: Focus on targeted therapies to treat the condition effectively.

### Prevalence of elevated liver enzymes and its association with type 2 diabetes: A cross-sectional study in Bangladeshi adults [^116vL4kT]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

The biological mechanism underlying the associations between hepatic enzymes and the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains unclear; however, some possible pathways can be considered. One possibility is that elevated levels of ALT, AST, and GGT reflect excessive fat deposition in the liver, a condition termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is considered to be involved with metabolic syndrome, which encompasses several cardiovascular risk factors related to insulin resistance, hypertension, central obesity, dyslipidemia, and T2D. Moreover, NAFLD is closely linked to obesity and visceral fat accumulation. It is a common feature of insulin resistance syndrome, where visceral adiposity is considered a significant contributor to T2D.

Another possibility is that serum GGT plays an important role in intracellular antioxidant defense systems, primarily by regulating intracellular glutathione levels. Increased oxidative stress may contribute to the development of diabetes, as chronic oxidative stress results in diminished responsiveness to insulin and ultimately leads to T2D. Although the associated mechanism remains largely unknown, changes in inflammation occurring through oxidative stress are predicted to be a common step in the pathogenesis of T2D. In a previous study, after adjusting for C-reactive protein, a marker of oxidative stress and inflammation, GGT showed a significant association with the risk of diabetes. The significant association between GGT and T2D observed in the present study also supports those previous findings.

### Liver biochemistries in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^113pbPRG]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to elevated liver biochemistries in approximately half of patients on presentation. At the time of writing, data are limited regarding the trend of liver biochemistries over the course of illness. We aimed to evaluate the trend, etiology, and outcomes associated with liver biochemistries in COVID-19.

- **Approach and results**: A total of 60 patients with COVID-19 were admitted between March 21 and March 28, 2020. The mean age was 57 years, 65% were male, and 28% were Hispanic. At the study conclusion, 6 patients were deceased, 28 were discharged, and 26 remained admitted. Patients who remained admitted were followed for a median of 12 days. Of 60 patients, 41 (69%) had at least one abnormal liver biochemistry on admission.

Median aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher than alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at admission (46 vs. 30 U/L) and during the hospital course. Aminotransferases rose above normal in 54 (93%) patients, whereas alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin elevations were rare. Ten (17%) patients developed aminotransferases more than 5 times the upper limit of normal. AST highly correlated with ALT throughout the illness course (r = 0.97; P < 0.0001), whereas correlations with markers of muscle injury and inflammation were weak.

Statin use was common before (40%) and during admission (80%) at our center, with no difference in peak liver biochemistries between users and nonusers. No demographic or comorbid illness was associated with liver injury. Admission AST (69 vs. 49; P < 0.05), peak AST (364 vs. 77; P = 0.003).

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Turner syndrome, more specifically concerning liver damage surveillance, the ESE/PES 2024 guidelines recommend considering reassessment if liver enzymes are elevated to at least 2× the upper normal limit, as fluctuation is common. Further evaluation and referral to a gastroenterologist are advised in cases of persistent liver function abnormalities.

### Liver abnormalities are frequent and persistent in patients with Fanconi anemia [^111MBDws]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of PLI was made based on a previously published definition to allow for comparison of findings. Patients were defined as having PLI if both serum aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) were above the upper limit of normal on at least three different blood draws, over one month apart. Serum bilirubin levels were typically normal until the development of end-stage liver disease, in agreement with previous reports, and those data are not presented here.

Results were interpreted as elevated using established age- and sex-dependent reference intervals at the time of the result. For analysis, to determine changes in serum AST and ALT rounded to multiples of the upper limit of normal values, we used established pediatric reference ranges established by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1996 to 2006. Using a cutoff of 25 U/L, we calculated times above the limit of the normal range for AST and ALT.

We excluded any liver function testing performed from the start of the conditioning regimen to six months after HSCT in recipients because of the known hepatotoxicity associated with transplant-related procedures and medications. Our institution's hepatic function panel includes measurements of AST, ALT, total protein, albumin, and bilirubin, not γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). However, all available GGT levels were recorded if obtained on each patient. All recipients of HSCT received aggressively T-cell depleted stem cell grafts, with a very low to negligible frequency of graft-versus-host disease.

### Active smoking and macrocytosis in the general population: Two population-based cohort studies [^11185Ssu]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of erythrocytes, is a highly prevalent phenomenon in adult individuals. MCV is the measurement of the average volume of red blood cells, and macrocytosis is defined as an MCV exceeding 100 fL. Currently, textbooks and guidelines mention a myriad of causes for macrocytosis, with vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, alcohol use, myeloid dysplastic syndromes, and liver disease as the most prominent. In the 1970s, several papers reported a positive association between smoking and MCV.

However, this has not led to the inclusion of cigarette smoking as an important cause of macrocytosis in textbooks and guidelines. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between smoking, assessed by both questionnaire and 24-hour urinary cotinine excretion as an objective measurement of nicotine exposure, with MCV in two large population-based cohorts.

### Hemgenix [^117Q5LUe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Monitoring post-administration:

- **Conduct regular liver enzyme testing**: Perform tests to monitor for liver enzyme elevations, which may indicate immune-mediated hepatotoxicity. In clinical studies, the mean duration of corticosteroid use for elevated transaminases was 81.4 days (SD 28.6), ranging from 51 to 130 days [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor ALT and AST (transaminase) levels weekly for 3 months following administration. Continue to monitor transaminases in patients with elevated liver enzymes until levels return to baseline.

- **Implement corticosteroids if needed**: If ALT increases to above normal limits or to twice the patient's baseline within the first 3 months post-dose, consider a course of corticosteroids. For clinically relevant ALT increases requiring corticosteroids, start with 60 mg/day of oral prednisolone or prednisone, tapering as ALT levels normalize (see Table 1).

- **Monitor Factor IX activity**: Conduct weekly monitoring for 3 months, particularly when exogenous Factor IX is administered. Improved hemostatic control may take several weeks post-infusion, necessitating continued hemostatic support with exogenous human Factor IX during this period [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### ACG clinical guideline: Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests.

Hepatocellular injury is defined as a disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared to alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is characterized by a disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase levels compared to AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin, and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that an elevated ALT is associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/L for males and 19 to 25 IU/L for females; levels above this should be assessed.

The degree of elevation of ALT and/or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Additionally, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medications should be sought.

For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be conducted.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1133f5Yq]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood or function tests (LFTs), which are perceived to be inexpensive, are checked frequently in both primary and secondary care to exclude liver disease, monitor potential adverse effects of drugs such as statins, and investigate generally unwell patients. These tests often result in abnormal findings, the clinical significance of which is unclear.

In many cases, these tests are requested in response to non-specific symptoms where there is little potential link between symptoms and the likelihood of liver disease, or for unrelated reasons such as chronic disease monitoring. This often leads to a cycle of additional liver blood testing in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Notably, most patients referred to hospitals with abnormal liver tests do not have any evidence of significant liver disease.

For example, University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust received 130,849 requests for liver blood tests in 2016 from 82 general practices. Of these, 38,636 (30%) contained at least one abnormal result, defined as being outside the stated reference range. The Abnormal Liver Function Investigations Evaluation (ALFIE) study from Tayside in Scotland showed that over a 10-year period, 25% of the community population aged over 16 had liver blood tests, with about a third having at least one abnormal value. Although an abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was predictive of liver disease (HR = 4.2), the rate of detection was remarkable.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^111Cfjqo]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays reveal that a full blood count typically shows moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) range of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) between 100–120. Reticulocytopenia is prevalent, although 30% of cases exhibit a normal MCV. Reports indicate instances of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia; however, these lineages are generally unaffected.

The hallmark of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I (CDA-I) is absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, which signifies ineffective erythropoiesis. Ineffective erythropoiesis was initially demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is assessed two weeks post-intravenous infusion. In effective erythropoiesis, such as in cases of anaemia due to bleeding, iron deficiency, or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59Fe is approximately 75–80%. In contrast, with ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30%.

Recently, a new clinical index known as the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI) has been developed to differentiate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)], and has demonstrated a high sensitivity (90.4%) for achieving a clinical diagnosis of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type II (CDA-II). While this metric is promising for CDA-I, it has yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal, showing anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, and irregular forms.

### Assessing the impact of alcohol consumption on the genetic contribution to mean corpuscular volume [^113BSm1h]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

Results

- **Demographics**: A total of 139,921 individuals were excluded from the UKB cohort: 1,502 declined to provide information on their drinking status, 1,984 were drinking at levels at least 4 SDs above sex-specific means, 7,060 had liver disease, 23,385 had missing MCV data, 104,788 failed GWAS quality control (including ethnic inclusion), and 1,202 had missing covariate information. This study therefore included 362,595 participants, of whom 194,706 (53.7%) were females, with an average age of 56.9 (SD = 7.9) years. There were 82,235 (24.6%) zero, 146,436 (40.1%) light, 114,946 (30.2%) moderate, and 18,978 (5.0%) heavy drinkers. The median units per week were 6.0 [interquartile range (IQR) = 13.0] in females and 15.6 (IQR = 23.9) in males. There was evidence of hypothyroidism and vitamin B12 deficiency in 14,781 and 777 participants, respectively.

- **Alcohol consumption and MCV**: Alcohol consumption was associated with higher MCV (P < 1.0 × 10⁻³²⁰). Increasing alcohol consumption by 5 units (40 g) per week resulted in a 0.3% increase in MCV. Variation by drinking status was evident; compared with light drinkers (reference group), zero drinkers had 0.9% lower mean values, while moderate and heavy drinkers had 1.1% and 2.8% higher mean values, respectively (all P < 1.0 × 10⁻³²⁰). Results from multivariate analysis for MCV were consistent in terms of direction and magnitude when those classified as teetotal were removed.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115LahNR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin, compared to a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy, where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after the review of previous results, past medical history, and medical condition.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: Causes and evaluation [^11799txx]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Approximately 10% to 20% of the general population has elevated liver chemistry levels, including aspartate and alanine transaminases. Elevated transaminase levels may be associated with significant underlying liver disease and an increased risk of liver-related and all-cause mortality. The most common causes of mildly elevated transaminase levels (two to five times the upper limit of normal) are metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, chronic hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes are alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic causes include celiac disease, hyperthyroidism, rhabdomyolysis, and pregnancy-associated liver disease.

Initial laboratory testing assesses the complete blood cell count with platelets, blood glucose, lipid profile, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin. If MASLD is suspected, the FIB-4 Index Score or NAFLD Fibrosis Score can be used to predict which patients are at risk for fibrosis and may benefit from further testing or referral to a hepatologist. All patients with elevated transaminases should be counseled about moderation or cessation of alcohol use, weight loss, and avoidance of hepatotoxic drugs.

### The association of higher levels of within-normal-limits liver enzymes and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome [^1112hUfL]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

The notion that persistently elevated liver enzyme concentrations, even within the so-called "reference" range, is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and future disease has been previously demonstrated. In fact, it has been shown that several liver enzymes, in particular GGT, are associated with the appearance of cardiovascular events. This is also relevant to individuals with the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Thus, the recognition that the prevalence of the MetS increases even in individuals whose liver enzymes are in the lower part of the 'normal' reference range might have clinical significance in terms of early recognition of these dysmetabolic changes.

We recognize several limitations in the analysis:

- **Descriptive nature**: Our conclusions are based essentially only on associations between parameters. Based on its cross-sectional design, the present findings are inherently limited in their ability to eliminate causal relationships.

- **Study population factors**: Some of the study population had several risk factors, and we could not fully eliminate the possible effect of underlying diseases and medications used for these diseases on the present findings. Further prospective population-based studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms in order to answer these questions.

- **Serum GGT as an indicator**: Serum GGT is a sensitive indicator of alcohol consumption and/or liver dysfunction, such as fatty liver. It is also high in patients with liver diseases such as chronic viral hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or drug-induced liver injury. These liver diseases are present in community-dwelling persons.

### Juxtapid [^114z5zPT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Risk of hepatotoxicity**: Juxtapid can cause elevations in transaminases and hepatic steatosis, as described below [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. To what extent Juxtapid-associated hepatic steatosis promotes the elevations in transaminases is unknown. Although cases of hepatic dysfunction (elevated transaminases with increase in bilirubin or INR) or hepatic failure have not been reported, there is concern that Juxtapid could induce steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis over several years. The clinical studies supporting the safety and efficacy of Juxtapid in HoFH would have been unlikely to detect this adverse outcome given their size and duration [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Elevation of transaminases**: Elevations in transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) are associated with Juxtapid. In the clinical trial, 10 (34%) of the 29 patients with HoFH had at least one elevation in ALT or AST ≥ 3× ULN, and 4 (14%) of the patients had at least one elevation in ALT or AST ≥ 5× ULN. There were no concomitant or subsequent clinically meaningful elevations in bilirubin, INR, or alkaline phosphatase [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

During the 78-week HoFH clinical trial, no patients discontinued prematurely because of elevated transaminases. Among the 19 patients who subsequently enrolled in the HoFH extension study, one discontinued because of increased transaminases that persisted despite several dose reductions, and one temporarily discontinued because of markedly elevated transaminases (ALT 24× ULN, AST 13× ULN).

### Green neutrophilic inclusions in liver disease [^1167Qupv]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute hepatic failure is traditionally diagnosed based on clinical presentation, historical information, and a collection of abnormal laboratory findings, including elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, prothrombin time, serum bilirubin, and alpha-fetoprotein. Non-specific hematological findings such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and changes in erythrocyte morphology are well documented in patients with liver failure.

However, it is believed that there are no specific morphological findings on peripheral blood smears directly linked to liver failure. This report describes two patients diagnosed with acute hepatic failure, both having coarse, bright-green cytoplasmic inclusions identified within their neutrophils. One previous case of a patient with similar neutrophil findings and concurrent liver disease has been reported in the literature; however, a direct relationship to liver failure was not proposed. It is suggested that these findings may be directly related to liver failure and may also serve as a prognostic indicator of impending death.

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^114SLmej]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting serum ferritin elevation in relation to other clinical parameters, including patient history, transferrin saturation, serum concentrations of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration. Observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload, documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices, were used as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### Copper deficiency caused by excessive alcohol consumption [^111scnKz]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 5190/μL without abnormal fractionation. His haemoglobin (Hb) was 7.8 g/dL (normal range 13.5–17.6 g/dL) and the mean corpuscular volume was 107.4 fl (normal range 83–93 fl), reflecting macrocytic anaemia. The platelet count was 11.7×10⁴/μL (normal range 13.1×10⁴–36.2×10⁴/μL), indicating mild thrombocytopenia. Aspartate aminotransferase was 477 IU/L (normal range 7–97 IU/L) and alanine aminotransferase was 155 IU/L (normal range 6–43 IU/L), suggesting liver dysfunction. Blood urea nitrogen was 26.7 mg/dL (normal range 10–20 mg/dL) and creatinine 2.41 mg/dL (normal range 0.6–1.0 mg/dL), indicating kidney dysfunction as well. Blood glucose level was normal at 137 mg/dL.

Ammonia level increased to 166 μg/dL (normal range 30–80 μg/dL) and serum ferritin significantly increased to 9506 ng/mL (normal range 39.4–340 ng/mL). C-reactive protein was 5.89 mg/dL (normal range 0.0–0.3 mg/dL). Urinary white blood cells and bacterial urine tests were negative, thus excluding pyelonephritis. Moreover, ascites had no bacteria and the white blood cell count in ascites was 32/μL, excluding spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

- **Reference values**: These tests were conducted after vitamin ingestion at the emergency department. Serum vitamin B1 was 91 ng/mL (normal range 24–66 ng/mL) and serum vitamin B12 was > 1500 pg/mL (normal range 180–914 pg/mL). Prothrombin time (PT) was 16.5 s (normal range 11–14 s) and PT% was 51.9% (normal range 80–120%).

Head CT revealed no abnormalities; however, abdominal CT showed signs consistent with the patient's condition.

### HIV infection and hepatic enzyme abnormalities: Intricacies of the pathogenic mechanisms [^113jESt1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Liver enzyme elevations are common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, and their diagnosis or management may be difficult because of the intricacies of the pathogenic mechanisms involved. These include hepatotoxicity related to the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen, idiosyncratic or immunoallergic mechanisms, and direct cytotoxicity enhanced by an underlying liver disease. Liver enzyme abnormalities may also reflect hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) infection, which each have their own risks for chronic immune-mediated liver disease (including hepatitis flare after immune reconstitution) and direct cytotoxicity.

Finally, other factors may affect liver deterioration, including alcohol-related liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis associated with metabolic syndromes (e.g. hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or being overweight) that are potentially HAART related, and the use of medication or illicit drugs (e.g. methamphetamine). A better understanding of these complex interactions, including adjustments of dosages of antiretroviral drugs, will probably help in the management of HIV-infected patients with liver enzyme abnormalities.

### Iron overload may be critical for liver dysfunction in anorexia nervosa, and the role of haematocrit-adjusted albumin in assessing nutritional status: a case report [^1134oFeX]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is often associated with liver dysfunction. Elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are found in 30% of the restricting type and 7.3% of the binge-eating type. Elevations can occur during malnutrition and also reportedly occur in one-third of patients with AN during refeeding. Some reports attribute the elevations to hepatocyte autophagy and fat deposition; however, the detailed mechanism remains unclear.

We present a patient with AN who exhibited elevated liver enzymes, ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT). Her ALT and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels decreased with nutritional improvement, which was associated with a reduction in TSAT and ferritin levels. Studies suggest that repeated blood transfusions may cause iron overload (IOL), increasing labile non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), followed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in heart and liver damage. We hypothesized that malnutrition-induced low transferrin levels in AN might cause IOL and hepatic injury. This study investigated the relationship between liver enzymes and nutritional indices or iron metabolism markers in a patient with restricting-type AN.

Blood albumin (Alb) and pre-albumin are known as nutritional markers; however, a recent systematic review has suggested that they may not reflect nutritional status in malnourished patients without inflammatory diseases. Nevertheless, since restricting-type AN is often complicated by dehydration, we hypothesized that we could use these markers if we could eliminate the effects of dehydration.

### Severity of liver test abnormalities in coronavirus disease 2019 depends on comorbidities and predicts early in-hospital mortality [^111ydZco]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Liver chemistry abnormalities (LCA) are common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but their causes and clinical impact have not been adequately studied. We assessed the associations between LCA and clinical characteristics, inflammatory serum markers, and in-hospital mortality.

- **Methods**: Ten thousand eight hundred fifty-six adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in 13 hospitals in New York (1 March to 27 April 2020) were analyzed retrospectively. Abnormalities of liver chemistries [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin] were defined as absent, mild-moderate (at least one value up to four times elevated), or severe.

- **Results**: LCA were mild-moderate in 63.9% and severe in 7.6% at admission. Risk factors for severe LCA were male sex and chronic liver disease. Conversely, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were less likely associated with severe LCA. AST elevation correlated weakly to modestly with inflammatory markers. On adjusted analysis, in-hospital mortality was 1.56 times and 1.87 times increased in patients with mild-to-moderate and severe LCA, respectively. Diabetes, hypertension, male sex, and age greater than 60 years were associated with an incremental risk of mortality with increased severity of LCA, especially in the first week of hospitalization. Hypertension was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality unless LCA were present.

- **Conclusion**: Increasing severity of LCA on hospital admission predicts early in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients.

### Liver iron loading in alcohol-associated liver disease [^115BdoMt]. The American Journal of Pathology (2023). Low credibility.

Ferritin, the iron storage protein present intracellularly and in the circulation, is elevated in response to elevation in iron and/or inflammation. It is composed of two types of chains: heavy (H) and light (L). Rats fed with alcohol for 7 weeks showed significantly increased levels of H-ferritin expression in the liver. Similarly, HepG2 cells treated with alcohol had increased expressions of both H and L ferritin, and alcohol increased L-ferritin synthesis in rat hepatocytes. Alcohol exposure to the human hepatoma HepaRG cell line also increased the expression of L-ferritin. Such an alcohol-induced increase in liver ferritin could be either a rescue mechanism to combat the alcohol-induced elevation in iron levels and store excess iron, or it could be a response to alcohol-induced inflammation, or both.

However, a study in mice fed with alcohol for 12 weeks showed decreased hepatic L-ferritin expression, and there were no significant effects at the earlier time points. Similarly, in VL-17A cells, alcohol did not alter the expression of H-ferritin. These differential ferritin responses to alcohol require further investigation.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^112nLmed]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

- **Findings**: Below we describe the findings for tests assessed in four or more studies, including:

	- **Blood cell counts**: White blood cell count increase and decrease, neutrophil count increase and decrease, monocyte count increase, lymphocyte count decrease, platelet decrease

	- **Liver function tests**: Alanine aminotransferase increase, aspartate aminotransferase increase, albumin decrease, total bilirubin

	- **Inflammatory markers**: CRP increase, procalcitonin increase, IL-6 increase

	- **Muscle and renal function indicators**: Creatine kinase increase, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase increase

An overview of tests and cut-off values per study can be found in Table 4. Table 1 presents the summary of findings for the individual tests, including sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios (DORs). All HSROC curves were close to the non-informative diagonal, with DORs varying between 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.78) and 4.53 (95% CI 1.89 to 10.88). As an indication, a test with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 70% has a DOR of 5.0.
