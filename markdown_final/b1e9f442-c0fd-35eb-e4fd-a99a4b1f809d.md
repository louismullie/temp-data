## Question

treatment for diverticulitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for diverticulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying disease severity and patient risk. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, especially when imaging is needed. Next, I will examine outpatient versus inpatient management for uncomplicated cases, followed by the antibiotic decision and supportive care. After that, I need to check the management of complicated disease, including abscess, perforation, and fistula. Finally, I will consider special populations, prevention of recurrence, and follow-up, and I will close with a concise decision algorithm and key takeaways, ensuring each step aligns with current high-quality guidelines and pivotal studies.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework because everything downstream depends on it. Uncomplicated diverticulitis typically lacks abscess, perforation, obstruction, or fistula, whereas complicated disease includes these features, and patient risk stratification must account for immunocompromise, significant comorbidities, sepsis, and reliability of follow-up, as these factors shift thresholds for antibiotics, admission, and intervention [^117c9a3a] [^97a53719] [^2518a380].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic strategy before committing to treatment. In patients with classic left lower quadrant pain and no red flags, clinical diagnosis may suffice, but if there is diagnostic uncertainty, atypical features, or concern for complications, contrast-enhanced CT is the imaging of choice due to high sensitivity and specificity and its ability to stage severity and guide management, while ultrasound can be considered where expertise and availability permit [^ba701e17] [^5629a942] [^85494fb0].

> I will now examine the setting of care for uncomplicated disease. Most immunocompetent patients with mild symptoms, no sepsis, and reliable follow-up can be managed as outpatients, whereas hospitalization is indicated for severe pain, inability to tolerate oral intake, immunocompromise, significant comorbidity, or unreliable follow-up; I should double-check that this aligns with contemporary guidelines, which consistently endorse outpatient care for carefully selected patients [^2518a380] [^97a53719] [^95be4a62].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I initially thought antibiotics were mandatory for all uncomplicated cases, but wait, multiple high-quality RCTs and meta-analyses show no clear benefit of routine antibiotics in immunocompetent patients with mild uncomplicated diverticulitis, so selective use is reasonable; I should confirm the exceptions where antibiotics are still indicated, such as immunocompromise, systemic inflammation, frailty, or high inflammatory markers, and note that ongoing symptoms or vomiting also shift the balance toward antibiotics [^337c5213] [^ffb71495] [^09aa4638] [^9810e181] [^1c5eecb0].

> Let me think about supportive care because it matters even when antibiotics are omitted. Clear liquids during the acute phase with advancement as symptoms improve, adequate hydration, and analgesia are foundational; I should confirm that guidelines align with this approach, which they do, and emphasize close follow-up within 48–72 hours to ensure clinical improvement [^b9d03454] [^622dd2f9] [^ba701e17].

> Next, I should review complicated disease, starting with abscess. For small abscesses under about 4–5 cm, antibiotics alone can be tried with close monitoring, whereas larger or nonresolving abscesses warrant percutaneous drainage plus antibiotics; I need to ensure I cite the right guidance, which supports drainage for larger collections and acknowledges that some smaller abscesses resolve with antibiotics alone, albeit with a nontrivial failure rate [^1e42fae6] [^7064a95f] [^131f63c1].

> But wait, what if there is free perforation or generalized peritonitis. In that scenario, urgent surgical consultation is mandatory, and operative management is typically indicated; historically, a two-stage approach with diversion was common, yet contemporary practice increasingly favors source control with resection and primary anastomosis when feasible, and laparoscopic lavage and drainage may be considered in selected patients with purulent peritonitis, though this remains controversial and patient selection is critical [^117c9a3a] [^6a28a5f7] [^85494fb0].

> I should confirm the approach to fistula and stricture. Fistulas to bladder, vagina, or skin generally require elective segmental resection with fistula tract excision after inflammation has settled, and strictures causing obstruction likewise warrant elective resection; timing should balance disease control and patient optimization, and minimally invasive techniques are preferred when feasible [^notfound].

> Let me consider special populations, especially older adults. Older patients more often present atypically, have higher complication rates, and may require a lower threshold for imaging, admission, and antibiotics; I need to ensure I emphasize shared decision-making around goals of care, functional status, and surgical risk, as many older adults prioritize quality of life and independence over aggressive interventions [^56075f2f] [^861a6553] [^d66821be].

> I should double-check the stance on elective surgery after recovery. The outdated "two-strike" rule has been retired; elective sigmoid resection should be individualized based on severity, chronic symptoms, patient preference, and operative risk, not merely the number of episodes, and laparoscopic approaches are preferred when anatomy and expertise allow [^68bcd0cb] [^0f0577c8].

> Next, I should review prevention of recurrence and follow-up. High-quality diet with adequate fiber, normal BMI, physical activity, smoking cessation, and avoidance of NSAIDs are reasonable strategies with modest evidence; colonoscopy is generally recommended 6–8 weeks after an episode of complicated diverticulitis or if no recent high-quality colon evaluation exists to exclude malignancy, and persistent symptoms after treatment should prompt imaging and lower endoscopy to exclude ongoing inflammation or alternative diagnoses [^0f0577c8] [^79363ba2] [^d68aa8ff].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. Classify severity and patient risk; if uncomplicated and low risk, manage outpatient with selective antibiotics and supportive care with close follow-up; if uncomplicated but higher risk, consider admission and antibiotics; if complicated by abscess, drain if large and give antibiotics; if perforation or generalized peritonitis, obtain urgent surgical consultation; if fistula or stricture, plan elective resection after optimization; throughout, tailor decisions to patient values, comorbidities, and follow-up reliability [^2518a380] [^97a53719] [^1e42fae6].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit. Modern care emphasizes outpatient management for selected uncomplicated cases, selective rather than routine antibiotics, image-guided interventions for abscess, and individualized decisions for elective surgery, with special attention to older adults and those with comorbidities; this represents a paradigm shift from older, more aggressive approaches and is supported by RCTs, meta-analyses, and contemporary guidelines [^24aff90d] [^337c5213] [^09aa4638] [^2518a380].

---

Treatment of diverticulitis is **severity-based**: uncomplicated cases are managed outpatient with selective antibiotics [^09aa4638] and clear liquids [^b9d03454], while complicated cases require hospitalization, IV antibiotics, and CT-guided drainage or surgery for abscesses or perforation [^117c9a3a] [^1e42fae6]. Most patients improve with conservative care [^00302677]; **recurrence is common** but elective surgery is reserved for persistent symptoms or complications, not a fixed number of episodes [^68bcd0cb] [^0f0577c8]. Dietary fiber, weight control, and activity reduce recurrence risk [^0f0577c8] [^5629a942].

---

## Classification and severity assessment

Accurate classification guides therapy: **uncomplicated diverticulitis** features inflammation without abscess, perforation, fistula, or obstruction, whereas **complicated diverticulitis** includes abscess, free perforation, fistula, or obstruction. CT is the **diagnostic gold standard** for staging and detecting complications [^85494fb0] [^5629a942].

---

## Uncomplicated diverticulitis

### Outpatient management

- **Setting**: Most immunocompetent patients with mild symptoms can be managed outpatient if they can tolerate oral intake, have no significant comorbidities, and have reliable follow-up [^2518a380] [^97a53719].

- **Diet**: Start clear liquids [^b9d03454]; advance to low fiber as symptoms improve, then normalize fiber over 2–4 weeks [^notfound].

- **Analgesia**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs if no contraindications; opioids sparingly.

- **Follow-up**: Re-evaluate within 7 days; earlier if deterioration [^95be4a62].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

- **Selective use**: Antibiotics are not routinely required [^d41ed902]; consider omission in immunocompetent patients with mild disease and close follow-up [^09aa4638] [^ffb71495].

- **When indicated**: Use antibiotics for immunocompromised patients, those with systemic symptoms (fever, leukocytosis), or when close follow-up is uncertain [^e60a88e7] [^0f0577c8].

- **Regimens**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus metronidazole, or fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole for 5–7 days [^notfound].

---

## Complicated diverticulitis

### Hospitalization and initial management

Indications include severe pain, inability to tolerate oral intake, immunocompromise, significant comorbidities, or suspected complications [^notfound]. Initial management entails **NPO status**, IV fluids, and **broad-spectrum IV antibiotics** covering gram-negative and anaerobic organisms [^53d65fb8].

---

### Abscess management

Small abscesses (< 4–5 cm) may be managed with antibiotics alone, with close monitoring [^1e42fae6]. Larger abscesses (≥ 4–5 cm) or those not responding to antibiotics should undergo **CT-guided percutaneous drainage** plus antibiotics [^131f63c1] [^ed0b4330].

---

### Surgical intervention

- **Emergency surgery**: Indicated for free perforation, generalized peritonitis, or failed nonoperative management [^117c9a3a].

- **Elective surgery**: Consider after recovery from complicated diverticulitis, especially with recurrent episodes or chronic symptoms [^bda72152] [^68bcd0cb].

- **Approach**: Laparoscopic surgery is preferred when feasible, with primary anastomosis when appropriate [^68bcd0cb] [^85494fb0].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

- **Diet**: High-fiber diet, limited red meat, and avoidance of nuts, seeds, and popcorn are recommended [^0f0577c8] [^5629a942].

- **Lifestyle**: Maintain normal BMI, regular physical activity, smoking cessation, and avoid NSAIDs [^0f0577c8] [^5629a942].

- **Medications**: Rifaximin plus fiber may reduce recurrence in selected patients, though evidence is limited [^ea416738].

---

## Special considerations

In older adults, management should be **individualized** given higher risks of complications and atypical presentations [^56075f2f] [^861a6553]. In immunocompromised patients, a **lower threshold** for hospitalization and antibiotics is appropriate [^0f0577c8] [^9070f7c7].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Severity** | **Management** | **Antibiotics** | **Intervention** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated | Outpatient | Selective | None |
| Complicated (abscess) | Hospitalization | Yes | Drainage if ≥ 4–5 cm |
| Complicated (perforation) | Emergency surgery | Yes | Immediate surgery |

---

Treatment of diverticulitis is **individualized** by severity and patient factors: uncomplicated cases are managed outpatient with selective antibiotics and diet, while complicated cases need hospitalization, IV antibiotics, and procedures for abscess or perforation. Recurrence is common, but elective surgery is reserved for selected patients, and lifestyle measures reduce risk [^24aff90d].

### Trends in the surgical management of diverticulitis [^3e17707b]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Sigmoid diverticulitis is an increasingly common Western disease associated with a high morbidity and cost of treatment. Improvement in the understanding of the disease process, along with advances in the diagnosis and medical management has led to recent changes in treatment recommendations. The natural history of diverticulitis is more benign than previously thought, and current trends favor more conservative, less invasive management. Despite current recommendations of more restrictive indications for surgery, practice trends indicate an increase in elective operations being performed for the treatment of diverticulitis. Due to diversity in disease presentation, in many cases, optimal surgical treatment of acute diverticulitis remains unclear with regard to patient selection, timing, and technical approach in both elective and urgent settings. As a result, data is limited to mostly retrospective and non-randomized studies. This review addresses the current treatment recommendations for surgical management of diverticulitis, highlighting technical aspects and patterns of care.

### Acute diverticulitis: diagnosis and treatment recommendations from… [^ba701e17]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In patients with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis, abdominal contrast CT has high sensitivity and specificity and is recommended if there is diagnostic uncertainty.
- Uncomplicated diverticulitis in patients with no risk factors for complicated diverticulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with medical supervision if they can drink fluids, have social support, and wish to avoid admission.
- In patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis and no risk factors for complicated diverticulitis, antibiotic treatment does not affect quality of life or reduce related complications or need for surgery, although it may slightly decrease the likelihood of ongoing diverticulitis. From the AFP Editors. There are approximately 200, 000 hospitalizations per year for acute diverticulitis in the United States.

The American College of Physicians performed a systematic review to determine the most effective diagnosis and management options for acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis. Need for Hospitalization For patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis who can drink fluids, want to avoid admission, and have social support, there is no evidence that hospitalization improves the outcomes of future elective surgery or risk of recurrence. The impact of hospitalization on treatment failure, quality of life, and mortality is unknown. Most patients with uncomplicated disease may be managed in an outpatient setting. Outpatient management has not been evaluated for patients with complicated diverticulitis or who have risk factors for complicated diverticulitis. Antibiotics For patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis, the ACP recommends a trial of supportive care that includes bowel rest and hydration.

In these patients, complication rates, quality of life, need for surgery, length of hospital stay, and long-term recurrence are similar whether antibiotics are given or not. Antibiotics may slightly decrease the likelihood of ongoing diverticulitis or short-term recurrence. Patients with complicated diverticulitis or risk factors for complicated diverticulitis should receive antibiotics. The best antibiotic regimen for diverticulitis is unknown. Clostridioides difficile infection, and antibiotic resistance, were not reported in the available studies. In complicated diverticulitis, the benefit of percutaneous drainage is uncertain. The few observational studies had uncertain outcomes and did not report procedural adverse events. Editor's Note: Although the evidence is somewhat limited, it is important to know that uncomplicated diverticulitis without risk factors is simple to treat. Imaging is not required if the clinical diagnosis is certain.

Outpatient treatment without antibiotics has similar outcomes as admission or prescribing antibiotics. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Contributing Editor.

### Diverticulitis: when and how to operate? [^b66c83ab]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease, and particularly diverticulitis, has increasing incidence in industrialised countries. Diverticular disease can be classified as symptomatic uncomplicated disease, recurrent symptomatic disease, and complicated disease. Conservative or medical management is usually indicated for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Indications for surgery include recurrent attacks and complications of the disease. Surgical treatment options have changed considerably over the years along with the inventions of new diagnostic tools and new surgical therapeutic approaches. Indications and timing for surgery of diverticular disease are determined mainly by the stage of the disease. In addition to this major factor, the individual risk factors of the patient along with the course of the disease after conservative or operative therapy do play a big role in decision-making and treatment of this disease. In this context, the purpose of this article is to review the surgical treatment of diverticulitis with regard to indications, timeliness of operative intervention, operative options and techniques, and special circumstances.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^b9deef1f]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Diverticulitis accounts for over 300,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States and its incidence increases with age. Among older adults, diverticulitis is the fourth leading cause for emergency surgery. Older adults with multimorbidity and geriatric syndromes are often excluded from clinical studies, leaving a gap in the evidence needed to guide management. Here, we provide a clinically oriented review of the diagnosis and management of older adults with diverticulitis through the lens of age‐friendly care.

Methods and Results

We reviewed the literature describing the epidemiology, diagnosis, management, and prevention of diverticulitis in older adults. Due to age‐related physiologic changes, the presence of geriatric syndromes, and multimorbidity, older adults with diverticulitis often present with atypical symptoms, variable laboratory findings, and are at higher risk for complications than younger patients. Guidelines support a more aggressive approach to diagnosis in this population, with lower threshold for obtaining diagnostic imaging. Antibiotics remain a mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated disease, and surgical management should be focused on severity of disease and the balance between the likelihood of improving quality of life and risks and burden of treatment.

Conclusions

Diverticulitis is a common disease that has a unique presentation among older individuals with limited evidence to guide management. Diagnosis and treatment should focus on what matters most to the patient, providing the most meaningful outcome possible within the context of multimorbidity, patient goals, symptom burden, and anticipated treatment outcomes.

### Systematic review of evidence and consensus on diverticulitis: an analysis of national and international guidelines [^31f95b4c]. Colorectal Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

The study aimed to analyse the currently available national and international guidelines for areas of consensus and contrasting recommendations in the treatment of diverticulitis and thereby to design questions for future research.

Method

MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed were systematically searched for guidelines on diverticular disease and diverticulitis. Inclusion was confined to papers in English and those < 10 years old. The included topics were classified as consensus or controversy between guidelines, and the highest level of evidence was scored as sufficient (Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine Level of Evidence of 3a or higher) or insufficient.

Results

Six guidelines were included and all topics with recommendations were compared. Overall, in 13 topics consensus was reached and 10 topics were regarded as controversial. In five topics, consensus was reached without sufficient evidence and in three topics there was no evidence and no consensus. Clinical staging, the need for intraluminal imaging, dietary restriction, duration of antibiotic treatment, the protocol for abscess treatment, the need for elective surgery in subgroups of patients, the need for surgery after abscess treatment and the level of the proximal resection margin all lack consensus or evidence.

Conclusion

Evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of diverticular disease and diverticulitis ranged from nonexistent to strong, regardless of consensus. The most relevant research questions were identified and proposed as topics for future research.

### Italian guidelines for the diagnosis and management of colonic diverticulosis and diverticular disease [^4e1ffcbc]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Colonic diverticulosis and diverticular disease are among the most common gastrointestinal disorders encountered in clinical practice. These Italian guidelines focus on the diagnosis and management of diverticulosis and diverticular disease in the adult population, providing practical and evidence-based recommendations for clinicians. Experts from five Italian scientific societies, constituting a multidisciplinary panel, conducted a comprehensive review of meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, and observational studies to formulate 14 PICO questions. The assessment of the quality of the evidence and the formulation of the recommendations were carried out using an adaptation of the GRADE methodology. The guidelines covered the following topics: i) Management of diverticulosis; ii) Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease: diagnosis and treatment; iii) Acute diverticulitis: diagnosis and treatment; iv) Management of diverticular disease complications; v) Prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis; vi) Interventional management of diverticular disease.

### Management of diverticulitis: a review [^24aff90d]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Care of patients with diverticulitis is undergoing a paradigm shift. This narrative review summarizes the current evidence for left-sided uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis. The latest pathophysiology, advances in diagnosis, and prevention strategies are also reviewed.

Observations

Treatment is moving to the outpatient setting, physicians are forgoing antibiotics for uncomplicated disease, and the decision for elective surgery for diverticulitis has become preference sensitive. Furthermore, the most current data guiding surgical management of diverticulitis include the adoption of new minimally invasive and robot-assisted techniques.

Conclusions and Relevance

This review provides an updated summary of the best practices in the management of diverticulitis to guide colorectal and general surgeons in their treatment of patients with this common disease.

### Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis [^337c5213]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis is a complication of the common condition, diverticulosis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally been treated with antibiotics, as diverticulitis has been regarded as an infectious disease. Risk factors for diverticulitis, however, may suggest that the condition is inflammatory rather than infectious which makes the use of antibiotics questionable.

Objectives

The objectives of this systematic review were to determine if antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis affects the risk of complications (immediate or late) or the need for emergency surgery.

Search Methods

For this update, a comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform on February 2021.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including all types of patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of left-sided uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Comparator and interventions included antibiotics compared to no antibiotics, placebo, or to any other antibiotic treatment (different regimens, routes of administration, dosage or duration of treatment). Primary outcome measures were complications and emergency surgery. Secondary outcomes were recurrence, late complications, elective colonic resections, length of hospital stay, length to recovery of symptoms, adverse events and mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors performed the searches, identification and assessment of RCTs and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or involvement of the third author. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain additional data if needed or for preliminary results of ongoing trials. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was used to assess the methodological quality of the identified trials. The overall quality of evidence for outcomes was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Effect estimates were extracted as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed with the Mantel-Haenzel method.

Main Results

The authors included five studies. Three studies compared no antibiotics to antibiotics; all three were original RCTs of which two also published long-term follow-up information. For the outcome of short-term complications there may be little or no difference between antibiotics and no antibiotics (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.30 to 2.62; 3 studies, 1329 participants; low-certainty evidence). The rate of emergency surgery within 30 days may be lower with no antibiotics compared to antibiotics (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.13, 1.71; 1329 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). However, there is considerable imprecision due to wide confidence intervals for this effect estimate causing uncertainty which means that there may also be a benefit with antibiotics. One of the two remaining trials compared single to double compound antibiotic therapy and, due to wide confidence intervals, the estimate was imprecise and indicated an uncertain clinical effect between these two antibiotic regimens (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.11 to 4.58; 51 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). The last trial compared short to long intravenous administration of antibiotics and did not report any events for our primary outcomes. Both trials included few participants and one had overall high risk of bias. Since the first publication of this systematic review, an increasing amount of evidence supporting the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics has been published, but the total body of evidence is still limited.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence on antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated acute diverticulitis suggests that the effect of antibiotics is uncertain for complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, elective colonic resections, and long-term complications. The quality of the evidence is low. Only three RCTs on the need for antibiotics are currently available. More trials are needed to obtain more precise effect estimates.

### Diagnosis and management of acute diverticulitis [^09074bf3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Although the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis is somewhat standardized, the scientific evidence and basis for treatment has been questioned. For years, medical and surgical management of acute diverticulitis has been based on the theory that more than 2 significant attacks of diverticulitis would lead to the recommendations of surgical resection. This should be questioned and further investigated with prospective randomized trials. Only a small number of well-published articles support the surgical management with good scientific data. Although our ability to take a history and skill of physical examination has not changed, the use of improved technology such as high-speed computerized axial tomography has afforded us the ability to make earlier and more accurate diagnoses. This may further allow us to standardize treatment and study outcomes. The time has come to further investigate and justify this management. It is possible that only the most critical situations may necessitate an operation. Clearly, the age group less than 40 years, as well as the immunocompromised, steroid-dependent, diabetic, and transplant patients, seem to be at greater risk with increased morbidity if not treated early and aggressively. And those individuals who present with perforation or compromised obstruction most likely will continue to need emergent intervention. We should try to set the rules by evidence-based medicine, while remaining within the confines of excellent and cost-effective care.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^81bf06c8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diverticulitis is a common gastrointestinal disease that still garners significant attention and study because of its heterogeneity in presentation and outcome. We provide a review of the newest and most controversial topics in diverticulitis. Recent discoveries on the influence of diet and other environmental risk factors are discussed, showing how the epidemiology of the disease process is shifting away from what was previously felt to be a disorder primarily limited to older western populations. Interestingly, as has long been suspected, genetic mutations and variations associated with the development of diverticulitis are being discovered and are summarized here. The data for non-operative and outpatient management of diverticulitis are reviewed, as are pharmacologic agents studied for use in the secondary prevention of diverticulitis. Lastly, we present controversies in the surgical treatment of diverticulitis. This review will provide a synopsis of the last 5 years of literature relating to diverticulitis.

Conclusion

This joint EAES and SAGES collaborative consensus conference updates surgeons on current and best evidence and provides a set of recommendations that can guide clinical practice on the management of acute diverticulitis. Strong membership engagement helped to highlight the clinical relevance of consensus recommendations and shed light on ongoing controversies related to diagnosis and management of acute diverticulitis.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: expert review [^a3fa9f82]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis — conclusions state that colonic diverticulitis is a painful disease that occurs unpredictably; although most patients never experience a perforation or abscess, uncomplicated recurrences are a burden to patients and many worry about recurrence, perforation, and need for surgery. Gastroenterologists can alleviate many of these concerns by making an accurate diagnosis, addressing chronic sequelae, and educating patients on risk factors, prognosis, and indications for surgery. Although the advice in this document is based on low- to moderate-quality evidence, research is ongoing and has the potential to eventually identify better options for diverticulitis treatment and prevention.

### When should we operate for recurrent diverticulitis? [^d4f8239d]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines on elective surgery for recurrent diverticulitis have removed generalized recommendations for elective preventive surgery and advice individualized decision per patient. We discuss the clinical evidence and potential use of risk factors to help with decision-making for patient selection for elective surgery in the presence of a history of diverticulitis.

### International, expert-based, consensus statement regarding the management of acute diverticulitis [^b5e6ad93]. JAMA Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

This Delphi study provides consensus related to many aspects of acute diverticulitis and identifies other areas in need of research.

Objective

To generate an international, expert-based, consensus statement to address controversies in the management of acute diverticulitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study was conducted using the Delphi technique from April 3 through October 21, 2014. A survey website was used and a panel of acute diverticulitis experts was formed via the snowball method. The top 5 acute diverticulitis experts in 5 international geographic regions were identified based on their number of publications related to acute diverticulitis.

Interventions

The Delphi study used 3 rounds of questions, after which the consensus statement was collated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

A consensus statement related to the management of acute diverticulitis.

Results

Twenty items were selected for inclusion in the consensus statement following 3 rounds of questioning. A clear definition of uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis is provided. In uncomplicated diverticulitis, consensus was reached regarding appropriate laboratory and radiological evaluation of patients as well as nonsurgical, surgical, and follow-up strategies. A number of important topics, including antibiotic treatment, failed to reach consensus. In addition, consensus was reached regarding many nonsurgical and surgical treatment strategies in complicated diverticulitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Controversy continues internationally regarding the management of acute diverticulitis. This study demonstrates that there is more nonconsensus among experts than consensus regarding most issues, even in the same region. It also provides insight into the status quo regarding the treatment of acute diverticulitis and provides important direction for future research.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: expert review [^0f0577c8]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Colonic diverticulitis is a painful gastrointestinal disease that recurs unpredictably and can lead to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastroenterologists commonly care for patients with this disease. The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide practical and evidence-based advice for management of diverticulitis. We reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies to develop 14 best practices. In brief, computed tomography is often necessary to make a diagnosis. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis. Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course. In patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively rather than routinely in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. At the same time, patients should understand that genetic factors also contribute to diverticulitis risk. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first presentation. An elective segmental resection should not be advised based on the number of episodes. Instead, a discussion of elective segmental resection should be personalized to consider severity of disease, patient preferences and values, as well as risks and benefits.

### Surgery for diverticulitis in the 21st century: a systematic review [^68bcd0cb]. JAMA Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon is an increasingly common disease. Patterns of care and management guidelines have significantly evolved in recent years.

Objectives

To review and classify the primary data published since 2000 that are guiding decision making, technical considerations, and the outcomes of surgery for sigmoid diverticulitis.

Evidence Review

We searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse, PubMed, and Cochrane databases for studies pertaining to the diagnosis and management of chronic and recurrent diverticulitis from January 1, 2000, to March 31, 2013. We supplemented this automated search with references drawn from included studies and PubMed. We rated the level of evidence according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.

Findings

We identified 68 studies meeting inclusion criteria for final review. The studies were almost exclusively observational and had limited certainty of treatment effect. We found that complicated recurrence after recovery from an uncomplicated episode of diverticulitis is rare (< 5%) and that age at onset younger than 50 years and 2 or more recurrences do not increase the risk of complications. Chronic symptoms may persist even after resection in 5% to 22% of patients. Prophylactic surgery is generally not recommended for average-risk patients with diverticulitis, irrespective of the number of episodes of acute, noncomplicated disease. Decisions to proceed with colon resection should be based instead on the patient-reported frequency and severity of diverticulitis symptoms.

Conclusions and Relevance

The prior standard for proceeding with elective colectomy following 2 episodes of diverticulitis is no longer accepted. Decisions to proceed with colectomy should be made based on consideration of the risks of recurrent diverticulitis, the morbidity of surgery, ongoing symptoms, the complexity of disease, and operative risk. Laparoscopic surgery is preferred to open approaches. Recent evidence suggests that existing guidelines should be updated.

### Current management of diverticulitis [^f979c3b2]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Diverticulosis and diverticulitis remain common diagnoses in western countries, and the incidence continues to rise. Diverticulitis accounts for roughly one-third of admissions to acute care hospitals annually, with even more patients being treated as outpatients due to improved understanding of risk stratification and the natural history of disease progression. Thus, having a thorough understanding of the etiology of the disease in conjunction with computed tomography findings and patient presentation can help dictate the appropriate treatment.

What is the best treatment for patients with a small diverticular abscess (< 4–5 cm)? What is the best treatment for patients with large diverticular abscess?

For patients with a small (< 4–5 cm) diverticular abscess, we suggest an initial trial of non-operative treatment with antibiotics alone (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

We suggest to treat patients with large abscesses with percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment; whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, we suggest to initially treat patients with large abscesses with antibiotic therapy alone, clinical conditions permitting. Alternatively, an operative intervention is required (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. The treatment of abscess always requires antibiotic therapy. If the abscess is limited in size, systemic antibiotic therapy alone is considered safe and effective in removing the abscess and solving acute inflammation with a pooled failure rate of 20% and a mortality rate of 0.6%.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^8a572a50]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the longtime prevalence of diverticulitis as one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, its etiology, prevention, and treatment remain hotly contested. Once viewed as a disorder of primarily older people in western populations, diverticulitis has rapidly increased its presence in all age groups worldwide, prompting researchers to reexamine the pathophysiology of the disease process. Clinicians continue to push the envelope with novel approaches to management, from avoiding antibiotics for uncomplicated cases to identifying subsets of patients with complicated diverticulitis who may not require an operation. Here, we review the most recent literature on a wide array of topics in diverticulitis, with an emphasis on publications within the last 5 years.

### Current status of the treatment of acute colonic diverticulitis: a systematic review [^85494fb0]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Aim

This paper addresses the current status of the treatment of acute colonic diverticulitis by an evidence-based review.

Method

A systematic search in PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google scholar on colonic diverticulitis was performed. Diagnostic tools, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized comparative studies, observational epidemiological studies, national and international guidelines, reviews of observational studies on elective and emergency surgical treatment of diverticulitis, and studies of prognostic significance were reviewed. Criteria for eligibility of the studies were diagnosis and classification, medical treatment, inpatients and outpatients, diverticulitis in young patients, immunosuppression, recurrence, elective resection, emergency surgery, and predictive factors.

Results

Some 92 publications were selected for comprehensive review. The review highlighted that computed tomography is the most effective test in the diagnosis and staging of acute diverticulitis; outpatient treatment can be performed for uncomplicated diverticulitis in patients without associated comorbidities; conservative treatment is aimed at those patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis; elective surgery must be done on an individual basis; laparoscopic approach for elective treatment of diverticulitis is appropriate but may be technically complex; in perforated diverticulitis, resection with primary anastomosis is a safe procedure that requires experience and should take into account strict exclusion criteria.

Conclusion

The heterogeneity of patients with colonic diverticular disease means that both elective and urgent treatment should be tailored on an individual basis.

### United States guidelines for diverticulitis treatment [^925cd4db]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines for diverticular disease management were last supported and published by the American Gastroenterology Association and the American College of Gastroenterology 2 decades ago. Guidelines have been published in other countries and by some societies. These guidelines are suggested as United States of America guidelines. In reality, they are what is practiced in Connecticut at Yale New Haven hospitals. The epidemiology and pathophysiology is described. This is still considered a dietary fiber-deficiency disease that results in high intracolonic pressure with resultant outpocketing of diverticula in the weakest point of the colon at the sites of vascular penetration with developing elastin deposition in the colon wall. The age and gender distribution is described. They are most common in the sigmoid. The guidelines of management are described according to accepted classification of the disease at all stages from onset, to early formation, to mild disease, to complicated disease, to rare specific states. The outcomes and mortality are discussed.

Our approach to the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis has evolved over the past 20 y. Routine use of antibiotics has decreased with recent studies suggesting simple cases of diverticulitis can be selectively managed without antibiotics. The criteria necessitating surgical intervention have also been amended as our understanding of the natural history of diverticulitis has grown. We favor selective use of antibiotics, percutaneous drainage, and surgery depending on the severity of the disease, patient factors, and clinical context.

The John A. Hartford Foundation and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement comprehensive guide for Age‐Friendly Health Systems encourages emphasis on four elements of care for older adults: What Matters, Medication, Mentation, and Mobility. This framework can be applied to diverticulitis care in this population. Here, we place emphasis on "what matters" when considering the best approach to diagnosing and managing diverticulitis in older patients. Understanding what is important to the patient and how diverticulitis and its treatment may impact the patient's life goals can be a powerful guide for management. In some cases, deviating from the management strategies advocated for younger healthier patients may be best for an older adult with diverticulitis.

Ultimately, the decision to move forward with surgery should take into consideration multiple factors, including risk and severity of possible recurrence, impact of diverticulitis episodes on a patient's daily life and function, and risks associated with an elective procedure (Figure 4). Although a severe diverticulitis recurrence may be life threatening, understanding what matters to each patient and whether the anticipated outcomes of surgery align with their goals should primarily drive the decision.

### Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis [^d56ecf39]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis is an inflammatory complication to the very common condition diverticulosis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally been treated with antibiotics with reference to the microbiology, extrapolation from trials on complicated intra-abdominal infections and clinical experience.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotic interventions for uncomplicated diverticulitis on relevant outcome.

Search Methods

Studies were identified by computerised searches of the The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Ongoing trials were identified and reference lists of identified trials and relevant review articles were screened for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs including all types of patients with a radiological confirmed diagnosis of left-sided uncomplicated diverticulitis. Interventions of antibiotics compared to any other antibiotic treatment (different regime, route of administration, dosage or duration of treatment), placebo or no antibiotics. Outcome measures were complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, late complications and duration of hospital stay and recovery of signs of infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors performed the searches, identification of RCTs, trial assessment and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or involvement of a third part. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain additional data if needed or were contacted for preliminary results of ongoing trials. Effect estimates were extracted as relative risks (RR).

Main Results

Three RCTs were identified. A qualitative approach with no meta analysis was performed because of variety in interventions between included studies. Interventions compared were antibiotics to no antibiotics, single to double compound antibiotic therapy and short to long IV administration. None of the studies found significant difference between the tested interventions. Risk of bias varied from low to high. The newest RCT overall had the best quality and statistical power.

Authors' Conclusions

The newest evidence from one RCT says there is no significant difference between antibiotics versus no antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Previous RCTs have only suggested a non-inferiority between different antibiotic regimes and treatment lengths. This new evidence needs confirmation from more RCTs before it can be implicated safely in clinical guidelines. Ongoing RCTs will be published in the years to come and more are needed. The role of antibiotics in the treatment of complicated diverticulitis has not been investigated yet.

### Treatment of diverticular disease of the colon and prevention of acute diverticulitis: a systematic review [^ea416738]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Diverticular disease of the colon is a common disorder, characterized by recurrent symptoms and complications such as diverticulitis, requiring hospital admissions and surgery.

Objective

This study aimed to systematically review the evidence for medical therapy of diverticular disease in reducing symptoms and preventing acute diverticulitis.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and Embase databases (1966 to February 2010).

Study Selection

The studies selected were prospective clinical trials on uncomplicated diverticular disease of the colon.

Interventions

Four investigators independently reviewed articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality according to standardized criteria.

Main Outcome Measures

The main outcomes measured were improvement in symptoms, complete remission of symptoms, and prevention of acute diverticulitis.

Results

We identified 31 studies, including 6 placebo-controlled trials. The methodological quality of these studies was suboptimal. Only 10 trials provided a detailed description of the patient history, 8 assessed symptoms by the use of a validated questionnaire, and 14 appropriately defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Only one long-term double-blind placebo-controlled study was identified. This reported a significant improvement in symptoms and greater prevalence of symptom-free patients at 1 year with fiber plus rifaximin in comparison with fiber alone. The efficacy of treatment in preventing acute diverticulitis was evaluated in 11 randomized trials. Four trials compared rifaximin plus fiber vs fiber alone and failed to show a significant difference between treatments. However, cumulative data from these trials revealed a significant benefit following rifaximin and fiber (1-year rate of acute diverticulitis: 11/970 (1.1%) vs 20/690 (2.9%); P = 0.012), but with a number needed to treat of 57, to prevent an attack of acute diverticulitis.

Limitations

Heterogeneity of the study design, patients' characteristics, regimens and combination of studied treatment, and outcome reporting precluded the pooling of results and limited interpretation.

Conclusions

The treatment for diverticular disease relies mainly on data from uncontrolled studies. Treatment showed some evidence of improvement in symptoms, but its role in the prevention of acute diverticulitis remains to be defined.

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^27879bf2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease of the colon (DDC) includes a spectrum of conditions from asymptomatic diverticulosis to symptomatic uncomplicated diverticulosis, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis, and acute diverticulitis without or with complications that may have serious consequences. Clinical and scientific interest in DDC is increasing because of the rising incidence of all conditions within the DDC spectrum, a better, although still limited understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved; the increasing socioeconomic burden; and the new therapeutic options being tested. The goals of treatment in DDC are symptom and inflammation relief and preventing disease progression or recurrence. The basis for preventing disease progression remains a high-fiber diet and physical exercise, although evidence is poor. Other current strategies do not meet expectations or lack a solid mechanistic foundation; these strategies include modulation of gut microbiota or dysbiosis with rifaximin or probiotics, or using mesalazine for low-grade inflammation in uncomplicated symptomatic diverticulosis. Most acute diverticulitis is uncomplicated, and the trend is to avoid hospitalization and unnecessary antibiotic therapy, but patients with comorbidities, sepsis, or immunodeficiency should receive broad spectrum and appropriate antibiotics. Complicated acute diverticulitis may require interventional radiology or surgery, although the best surgical approach (open versus laparoscopic) remains a matter of discussion. Prevention of acute diverticulitis recurrence remains undefined, as do therapeutic strategies. Mesalazine with or without probiotics has failed to prevent diverticulitis recurrence, whereas new studies are needed to validate preliminary positive results with rifaximin. Surgery is another option, but the number of acute events cannot guide this indication. We need to identify risk factors and disease progression or recurrence mechanisms to implement appropriate preventive strategies.

### Is the decline in the surgical treatment for diverticulitis associated with an increase in complicated diverticulitis? [^95636367]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Indications for operative intervention in the treatment of diverticulitis have become unclear. We hypothesized that surgical treatment for diverticulitis has decreased resulting in proportionately more complicated diverticulitis cases (free perforation and/or abscess).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with diverticular disease in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1991 through 2005. We used diagnostic codes to identify all patient discharges with diverticular disease and then determined the proportion of discharges with diverticulitis, perforated disease, diverticular abscess, and surgical treatment.

Results

During the study period, 685,390 diverticulitis discharges were recorded. The ratio of diverticulitis discharges increased from 5.1 cases per 1,000 inpatients in 1991 to 7.6 cases per 1,000 inpatients in 2005 (P < 0.0001). The proportion of patients who underwent colectomy for uncomplicated diverticulitis declined from 17.9% in 1991 to 13.7% in 2005 (P < 0.0.0001). During the same period, the proportion of free diverticular perforations as a fraction of all diverticulitis cases remained unchanged (1.5%). The proportion of diverticular abscess discharges as a fraction of all diverticulitis cases increased from 5.9% in 1991 to 9.6% in 2005 (P < 0.0001). Last, we noted a decrease in diverticular perforations and/or abscess treated with colectomy, 71.0% in 1991 to 55.5% in 2005 (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Despite a significant decline in surgical treatment for diverticulitis, there has been no change in the proportion of patients discharged for free diverticular perforation. There was an increase in diverticular abscess discharges, but this finding was not associated with an increase in same stay surgical treatment.

### Current diagnosis and management of acute colonic diverticulitis: what you need to know [^117c9a3a]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a common disease treated by acute care surgeons. Acute uncomplicated colonic diverticulitis involves thickening of the colon wall with inflammatory changes and less commonly requires the expertise of a surgeon; many cases may be treated as an outpatient with or without antibiotics. Complicated diverticulitis involves phlegmon, abscess, peritonitis, obstruction, stricture, and/or fistula and usually requires inpatient hospital admission, treatment with antibiotics, and consideration for intervention including operative management. This review will discuss what the acute care surgeon needs to know about diagnosis and management of acute colonic diverticulitis.

### Recent advances in the treatment of colonic diverticular disease and prevention of acute diverticulitis [^8bfba48c]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of diverticulosis and diverticular disease of the colon is increasing worldwide. Although the majority of patients remains asymptomatic long-life, the prevalence of diverticular disease of the colon, including acute diverticulitis, is substantial and is becoming a significant burden on National Health Systems in terms of direct and indirect costs. Focus is now being drawn on identifying the correct therapeutic approach by testing various treatments. Fiber, non-absorbable antibiotics and probiotics seem to be effective in treating symptomatic and uncomplicated patients, and 5-aminosalicylic acid might help prevent acute diverticulitis. Unfortunately, robust evidence on the effectiveness of a medical strategy to prevent acute diverticulitis recurrence is still lacking. We herein provide a concise review on the effectiveness and future perspectives of these treatments.

### Sigmoid diverticulitis: a systematic review [^00302677]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Diverticulitis is a common disease. Recent changes in understanding its natural history have substantially modified treatment paradigms.

Objective

To review the etiology and natural history of diverticulitis and recent changes in treatment guidelines.

Evidence Review

We searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases for English-language articles pertaining to diagnosis and management of diverticulitis published between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2013. Search terms applied to 4 thematic topics: pathophysiology, natural history, medical management, and indications for surgery. We excluded small case series and articles based on data accrued prior to 2000. We hand searched the bibliographies of included studies, yielding a total of 186 articles for full review. We graded the level of evidence and classified recommendations by size of treatment effect, according to the guidelines from the American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.

Findings

Eighty articles met criteria for analysis. The pathophysiology of diverticulitis is associated with altered gut motility, increased luminal pressure, and a disordered colonic microenvironment. Several studies examined histologic commonalities with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome but were focused on associative rather than causal pathways. The natural history of uncomplicated diverticulitis is often benign. For example, in a cohort study of 2366 of 3165 patients hospitalized for acute diverticulitis and followed up for 8.9 years, only 13.3% of patients had a recurrence and 3.9%, a second recurrence. In contrast to what was previously thought, the risk of septic peritonitis is reduced and not increased with each recurrence. Patient-reported outcomes studies show 20% to 35% of patients managed nonoperatively progress to chronic abdominal pain compared with 5% to 25% of patients treated operatively. Randomized trials and cohort studies have shown that antibiotics and fiber were not as beneficial as previously thought and that mesalamine might be useful. Surgical therapy for chronic disease is not always warranted.

Conclusions and Relevance

Recent studies demonstrate a lesser role for aggressive antibiotic or surgical intervention for chronic or recurrent diverticulitis than was previously thought necessary.

Concluding remarks

From honing in on specific dietary and genetic associations to refining surgical techniques, the complex landscape of diverticulitis is ever-changing. At a glance, there are more publications on quality of life and cost-effectiveness outcomes. These matters are particularly important as we attempt to become less aggressive in our care, so that we do not inadvertently promote chronic symptoms and recurrent disease in the name of "doing less". Patterns of treatment and societal guidelines remain significantly heterogeneous worldwide. We look forward to the longer-term results of trials from the last decade and ongoing innovation in the field.

### Treatment… [^5629a942]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

A diverticulum is a protrusion through the intestinal wall, and diverticulosis is the presence of multiple diverticula. Acute diverticulitis is inflammation of diverticula. Possible causes include abnormal colonic motility, colonic wall resistance, intraluminal pressures, and colonic wall defects. Screening and Prevention Screening for diverticular disease is not recommended. It is often found incidentally on screening colonoscopy or imaging studies performed for other reasons. Measures for preventing recurrence of diverticulitis include consuming a vegetarian diet or high-quality diet, limiting red meats and sweets, achieving or maintaining a body mass index of 18 to 25 kg per m. 2, being physically active, and avoiding tobacco and long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

8–11 A high-fiber diet is associated with a lower incidence of diverticular disease, but evidence regarding whether it prevents the recurrence of diverticulitis is lacking.
12. DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION Initial tests include complete blood count, basic metabolic panel to evaluate electrolyte and renal status, urinalysis to rule out urinary tract infection, and C-reactive protein. If imaging is performed, computed tomography with contrast is the diagnostic test of choice because of its availability and high sensitivity and specificity. 8, 9, 15, 16 Magnetic resonance imaging has good diagnostic accuracy and avoids radiation exposure but may not be as readily available as computed tomography. 8, 17 Ultrasonography can be effective in the diagnosis of diverticulitis, but operator experience affects accuracy.

Its ability to assess for free air or the extent of large abscesses is limited. 8, 17. CLINICAL PREDICTION RULES The combination of a C-reactive protein level greater than 5 mg per dL, isolated left lower quadrant tenderness, and absence of vomiting has a positive LR of
5. 3 to 18 for diverticulitis. 13, 18 A clinical prediction rule that includes abdominal guarding, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein level can be used to predict the likelihood of complicated diverticulitis. 19.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: routine use of antibiotics for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [^5b5edf6b]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (UD) with antibiotics remains common despite substantial evidence supporting the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic outpatient management. In the past 15 years, there have been two landmark randomized-controlled clinical trials, follow-up studies, and numerous retrospective studies that have supported the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic management of UD. Multiple medical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Physicians recommend using antibiotics selectively rather than routinely in UD. We aim to raise physician awareness of the latest guideline recommendations through our article, potentially improving antibiotic stewardship and reducing related healthcare costs.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^a95d911b]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis has been treated routinely with antibiotics for decades, although evidence in favour of antibiotic treatment has always been lacking. Recently two RCTs 1, 2 demonstrated the safety of omitting antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis up to 1 year of follow‐up. First, the AVOD Antibiotics in Acute Uncomplicated Diverticulitis trial 1 showed comparable rates of complicated diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis and sigmoid resection between observational and antibiotic treatment. Second, the DIABOLO (Diverticulitis: Antibiotics or Close Observation) trial 2 found no significant differences regarding time to recovery, complicated diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis and sigmoid resection. However, both RCTs reported somewhat – by and large non‐significant – higher rates of complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resections in the non‐antibiotic group. As neither of the studies was powered to analyse these secondary outcomes, uncertainty remained whether these small differences could potentially be true causal associations, the consequence of patient selection or findings by chance in accordance with statistical non‐significance. A regular meta‐analysis of the two RCTs would not be able to account for different follow‐up times and different outcome definitions that were provided in the results papers of these studies. In contrast, a meta‐analysis of individual‐patient data can not only account for these differences but additionally provide an opportunity to use the increased sample size of both trials combined. The aim was to identify patients at risk of complications who may benefit from antibiotic treatment.

### Recurrent diverticulitis [^b5a21dc8]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The term "diverticulitis" indicates the inflammation of a diverticulum or diverticula, which is accompanied by detectable or microscopical perforation. Diverticulitis is a common condition with an estimated incidence of 25%. At present, elective sigmoid resection is recommended after 2 episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis to prevent the serious complications of recurrent colonic diverticulitis. This guideline has been based on the assumption that recurrent episodes (2 or more) of diverticulitis will lead to complicated diverticulitis and higher mortality. The data to support this assumption are based on only a few small studies. Advances in diagnostic modalities, medical therapy, and surgical techniques over the past 2 decades have changed both the management and outcomes of diverticulitis. Many authors have shown that patients treated nonoperatively have a low risk of recurrent disease and would be expected to do well without elective colectomy.

### Modern concepts in diverticular disease [^cbcd5b8b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Over the last decade there has been a striking shift in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathology, and management of diverticular disease. Indeed, many of the guidelines published in the late nineties and early 2000s are now redundant. High-fiber diets, avoidance of nuts and seeds, antibiotic treatment for mild diverticulitis, elective resection after 2 attacks of diverticulitis, Hartmann's procedure (HP), and aggressive management of young patients are all open to question. The more we challenge our understanding of diverticulitis it becomes apparent how little we know about this disease entity. This review aims update the reader on current hypotheses and evidencebased modern management strategies in diverticular disease.

### EAES and SAGES 2018 consensus conference on acute diverticulitis management: evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice [^08989e2b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The objective of this international DCC was to generate an updated review and evidence-based recommendations that could provide valuable guidance to our members, particularly acute care surgeons, on this common surgical problem for which the management has radically changed in the last 10 years. In this first collaborative project, we successfully engaged the wider membership of EAES and SAGES in order to ensure that the final output would reflect participants' opinions, be relevant across both Societies' diverse membership, and help bridge existing gaps in clinical practice upon evidence-based principles. Although a number of AD guidelines have been reported by national and specialty societies, significant discrepancies have resulted in differing levels of uptake and subsequent widespread variations in practice. Involving the members of both societies, the DCC achieved broader consensus beyond that of an expert panel, ensuring relevance and applicability to clinical practice, with the hope of increasing adoption and unifying clinical practice for the benefit of our patients.

Through this effort, six systematic reviews of the contemporary evidence related to the epidemiology, diagnosis and classification of acute diverticulitis, elective and emergency treatment of uncomplicated and complicated acute diverticulitis were generated. These comprehensive reviews (presented in the supplementary materials) underpinned 51 consensus statements and 41 recommendations generated by the international steering group. The level of membership participation from both societies exceeded our expectations with over 1000 online survey responses and 300 audience members from both congresses actively engaged to reshape the final statements and recommendations.

Consensus was achieved on most of the recommendations which were also reported as likely to impact or change the clinical practice for participants not already applying them. This is perhaps not surprising as high-level evidence is now available for many acute diverticulitis topics and underpinned the basis of each statement and linked recommendation developed by this conference.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^861a6553]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Sigmoid or left‐sided diverticulosis (hereafter termed "diverticulosis") refers the presence of false diverticula of the colon. Diverticulosis affects 60% of the U.S. population by age 60. Most individuals with diverticulosis are asymptomatic, however, 10%–25% develop symptoms ranging from minor abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits to severe pain, sepsis, or diverticular bleeding. This review will focus specifically on diverticulitis, defined as inflammation centered on the diverticular orifices. The majority (85%) of individuals with diverticulitis develop uncomplicated disease while the remaining 15% experience disease complicated by abscess, fistula, obstruction, or perforation.

Among gastrointestinal diagnoses, diverticulitis is the sixth most common cause of hospital admissions and 11th most common cause of non‐malignant deaths in the United States. The overall incidence of diverticulitis is increasing, driven in part by the aging population in the United States. Diverticulitis increases with age, as does the number of diverticulitis related Emergency Department visits. Diverticulitis is the fourth most common cause for emergency surgery in older adults. Older adults with diverticulitis are at higher risk of in‐hospital mortality and complications of diverticulitis and resulting surgical treatments than younger patients.

Treatment strategies for diverticulitis include observation, medical management, elective surgery, and emergency surgery. Treatment decisions for older adults require weighing symptom severity, impact on quality of life, and risks associated with intervention and non‐intervention. The data supporting optimal management of older adults is sparse and the variable presentation and differing outcomes among older adults support a nuanced approach to diagnosis and management. Recent European multi‐society guidelines for the care of older adults with diverticulitis establish a foundation for unique considerations in this population. Relevant literature was identified via pub med and embase. Articles were selected based on review of their abstracts, which indicated that they were original articles or practice guidelines relevant to diagnosis or management of diverticulitis in older adults or age‐related outcomes related to diverticulitis. This review aims to provide clinically relevant context and recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis in older adults.

### Diagnosis and management of acute diverticulitis… [^68efad91]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment Although most patients can be treated on an outpatient basis, a retrospective analysis of 693 patients found that women and those with free fluid on CT are at higher risk of outpatient treatment failure. 20 Outpatient management has traditionally consisted of a clear liquid diet, oral broad-spectrum antibiotics, and follow-up in two to three days. 2 Outpatient management with rest and fluids is effective for patients with mild diverticulitis.
2. 2 Hospitalization should be considered if patients have signs of peritonitis or there is suspicion of complicated diverticulitis. Inpatient management includes no food or drink by mouth, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and intravenous antibiotics. 2 Clinical improvement is expected within two to four days and includes decreasing fever, leukocytosis, and pain.

2 A randomized controlled trial including 50 patients found that starting oral antibiotics after clinical improvement with intravenous antibiotics resulted in shorter hospitalizations, greater cost savings, and no increased risk of recurrence compared with longer treatment with intravenous antibiotics.
21. ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY The usual practice in the United States for the treatment of diverticulitis includes broad-spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative rods and anaerobic bacteria. 24 A small randomized controlled trial with 79 patients found that oral antibiotics are as effective as intravenous antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis. 25 Patients who do not improve with medical management may have complicated diverticulitis, and additional imaging should be performed.

Complicated Diverticulitis Patients with a localized abscess may be candidates for CT-guided percutaneous drainage, a procedure that does not increase the risk of recurrent diverticulitis. SURGICAL THERAPY Fifteen to 30 percent of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis require surgical intervention during that admission. 40 A small prospective study found that mesalamine and Lactobacillus casei are effective in preventing recurrence. 41 A meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials with 1, 660 patients who had experienced at least one episode of diverticulitis found that rifaximin plus fiber provided one year of complete symptom relief and fewer complications compared with fiber alone. 42.

### EAES and SAGES 2018 consensus conference on acute diverticulitis management: evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice [^b9bec716]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic left-sided colonic diverticular disease is a common clinical entity with rising prevalence, healthcare costs and societal impact in industrialized countries. Acute diverticulitis (AD), which ranges in severity from minor subclinical episodes to major complications, presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. While the overarching goal in treatment is to minimize morbidity, a number of factors influence the management of AD besides clinical severity and co-morbidities. Variations in institutional protocols and resources, specialty training, surgical expertise, as well as societal and patient expectations regarding cost of care and quality of life, may impact clinical management and subsequent outcomes. Several surgical and medical professional societies have recognized the need to standardize the management of AD based on metrics previously identified as clinically relevant in several guidelines and consensus statements published over the past two decades. Evidence-based recommendations regarding the management of AD are often conflicting primarily due to the lack of good quality data, and regional variations in AD practices.

Since the 1999 European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) AD consensus conference, more recent data regarding the epidemiology, diagnosis, non-operative management and surgical techniques including the use of minimally invasive strategies have been published, warranting an update of AD management guidelines. The aim of this joint EAES and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) collaborative consensus conferences was to generate an updated and comprehensive set of evidence-based AD management recommendations. This consensus conference was also designed to canvass the wider opinion of both memberships regarding the statements and recommendations to maximize potential uptake and impact on practice.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^74395565]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The decision to treat patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis with antibiotics or not does not depend on a single outcome measure. All reasons in favour of using antibiotics and all reasons in favour of omitting them should be taken into account. Omitting antibiotics did not increase the risk of ongoing diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis or sigmoid resection, and is therefore a safe treatment strategy. Insufficient statistical power to detect small differences in complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resection may leave some room for discussion if these small differences are considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics should be limited as much as possible to minimize the global threat of rising microbial resistance and to prevent antibiotic‐related morbidity (8·3 per cent of all patients in DIABOLO 2), including potentially life‐threatening allergic reactions. In the end, individual‐patient characteristics or preferences may be deciding factors in the decision‐making process. However, in subgroups of patients with independent risk factors for adverse outcome (high pain scores, high WBC and a history of acute diverticulitis at presentation) no beneficial role for antibiotics in the prevention of such adverse outcomes was found.

### Acute colonic diverticulitis [^0526931f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a gastrointestinal condition that is frequently encountered by primary care and emergency department practitioners, hospitalists, surgeons, and gastroenterologists. Clinical presentation ranges from mild abdominal pain to peritonitis with sepsis. It is often diagnosed on the basis of clinical features alone, but imaging is necessary in more severe presentations to rule out such complications as abscess and perforation. Treatment depends on the severity of the presentation, the presence of complications, and underlying comorbid conditions. Medical and surgical treatment algorithms are evolving. This article provides an evidence-based, clinically relevant overview of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute diverticulitis.

### What do we know about diverticular disease? A brief overview [^6051a232]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Diverticulosis and its complications, particularly diverticulitis, are extremely common in western countries. The major factor in the development of diverticulosis is a lack of adequate fiber intake. Diverticulitis may be complicated by abscess formation, fistula formation, peritonitis, or obstruction. Computed tomography scans are highly useful tools to plan appropriate care. Most cases of simple, uncomplicated diverticulitis respond to conservative therapy with bowel rest and antibiotics. Many controversies remain in the care of diverticulitis patients, including the optimal timing of surgery. One particularly interesting area of recent research examines the overlap of diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease, including the use of probiotics and mesalamine in diverticular disease.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^913d93b4]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis has been treated routinely with antibiotics for decades, although several guidelines have adapted their recommendations meanwhile. These now state that antibiotics should not be used routinely or can be avoided 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Some guidelines, however, state that antibiotics 'should be used selectively' (American Gastroenterological Association Institute guideline 11), antibiotics 'should be given to patients with risk indications of a complicated course' (German guideline 9), or antibiotics 'on a case‐by‐case basis should possibly be considered' (Italian guideline 8).

Little is known, however, about risk factors for a complicated course of initially uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Therefore, guidelines cannot recommend antibiotics for specific patient subgroups, besides subgroups that were excluded from studies on this topic such as immunocompromised patients and women. The present meta‐analysis identified several risk factors for one or more adverse outcomes that can guide the selection of patients who may benefit from antibiotics. However, the results showed that omitting antibiotics does not increase the risk of adverse outcomes in these high‐risk patients. Therefore, prevention of these adverse outcomes with antibiotic treatment may not be warranted.

Concluding remarks

Overall, the surgical management of diverticular disease has evolved with current goals of maintaining intestinal continuity, using a laparoscopic approach, and controlling infection acutely to bridge patients to later one-stage procedures. Patient selection remains paramount to the surgical decision-making process and treatment plans should be individualized according to the needs of the patient.

### Antibiotics versus No antibiotics for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ffb71495]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are routinely used for diverticulitis irrespective of severity. Current practice guidelines favor against the use of antibiotics for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Objective

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the role of antibiotic use in an episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Data Sources

PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane were used.

Study Selection

Eligible studies included those with patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis receiving any antibiotics compared with patients not receiving any antibiotics (or observed alone).

Main Outcome Measures

Pooled odds rate of total complications, treatment failure, recurrent diverticulitis, readmission rate, sigmoid resection, mortality rate, and length of stay were measured.

Results

Of 1050 citations reviewed, 7 studies were eligible for the analysis. There were total of 2241 patients: 895 received antibiotics (mean age = 59.1 y; 38% men) and 1346 did not receive antibiotics (mean age = 59.4 y; 37% men). Antibiotics were later added in 2.7% patients who initially were observed off antibiotics. Length of hospital stay was not significantly different among either group (no antibiotics = 3.1 d vs antibiotics = 4.5 d; p = 0.20). Pooled rate of recurrent diverticulitis was not significantly different among both groups (pooled OR = 1.27 (95%, CI 0.90–1.79); p = 0.18). Rate of total complications (pooled OR = 1.99 (95% CI, 0.66–6.01); p = 0.22), treatment failure (pooled OR = 0.68 (95% CI, 0.42–1.09); p = 0.11), readmissions (pooled OR = 0.75 (95% CI, 0.44–1.30); p = 0.31). and patients who required sigmoid resection (pooled OR = 3.37 (95% CI, 0.65–17.34); p = 0.15) were not significantly different among patients who received antibiotics and those who did not. Mortality rates were 4 of 1310 (no-antibiotic group) versus 4 of 863 (antibiotic group).

Limitations

Only 2 randomized controlled studies were available and there was high heterogeneity in existing data.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis of current literature shows that patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis can be monitored off antibiotics.

### Diverticular disease: diagnosis and treatment [^c33fdfba]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease refers to symptomatic and asymptomatic disease with an underlying pathology of colonic diverticula. Predisposing factors for the formation of diverticula include a low-fiber diet and physical inactivity. Approximately 85 percent of patients with diverticula are believed to remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic disease without inflammation is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring colonoscopy because imaging studies cannot discern the significance of diverticula. Fiber supplementation may prevent progression to symptomatic disease or improve symptoms in patients without inflammation. Computed tomography is recommended for diagnosis when inflammation is present. Antibiotic therapy aimed at anaerobes and gram-negative rods is first-line treatment for diverticulitis. Whether treatment is administered on an inpatient or outpatient basis is determined by the clinical status of the patient and his or her ability to tolerate oral intake. Surgical consultation is indicated for disease that does not respond to medical management or for repeated attacks that may be less likely to respond to medical therapy and have a higher mortality rate. Prompt surgical consultation also should be obtained when there is evidence of abscess formation, fistula formation, obstruction, or free perforation.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^d66821be]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Uncomplicated Diverticulitis

Little data exists to support optimal medical management of diverticulitis in older or frail adults. Historically, management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis involved inpatient admission with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Following several large randomized controlled trials of younger patients (mean age ~57) with few, if any comorbidities, outpatient management with omission of antibiotics has become the recommendation for young patients with mild uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, this treatment strategy has not been evaluated in older or frail adults. As such, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guidelines recommend selected use of antibiotics in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis in patients who are frail or have significant comorbidities. Close clinical follow‐up is essential in older adults, and antibiotics and/or inpatient observation should be considered in older, frail patients with systemic symptoms, fever, leukocytosis, multiple comorbidities, or unreliable follow‐up.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^ce5c5876]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

This individual‐patient data meta‐analysis included 1109 patients, 545 in the observational group and 564 in the antibiotics group. Duration of follow‐up was comparable between the groups: 12·3 (i.q.r. 12·1–13·0) months in the observational group and 12·4 (12·1–13·0) months in the antibiotics group. Baseline characteristics were mostly comparable; however, primary diverticulitis was slightly but significantly more common in the antibiotics group (Table 2).

Observational versus antibiotic treatment

The duration of stay for the initial hospital admission was slightly but non‐significantly shorter in the observational group compared with the antibiotics group (median 2 versus 3 days respectively; P = 0·037) (Table 3). Some 33 of 1109 patients (3·0 per cent) were treated as outpatients from the start of treatment. The rate of ongoing diverticulitis differed somewhat, but this difference failed to reach statistical significance: 7·2 per cent (39 of 545) in observational group versus 5·0 per cent (28 of 564) in the antibiotics group (P = 0·062). The rates of recurrent diverticulitis were comparable: 8·6 per cent (47 of 545) versus 9·6 per cent (54 of 564) respectively (P = 0·610). Complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resection rates were recorded during the acute disease stage (within 1 month) and at 1‐year follow‐up. Rates of complicated diverticulitis within 1 month were comparable between groups: 1·8 per cent (10 of 545) in the observational group versus 1·1 per cent (6 of 564) in antibiotics group (P = 0·204); at 1‐year follow‐up they differed somewhat (by 10 patients), but non‐significantly: 4·0 per cent (22 of 545) versus 2·1 per cent (12 of 564) respectively (P = 0·079). Rates of sigmoid resection were no different between the groups at 1 month (0·6 per cent (3 of 545) versus 0·7 per cent (4 of 564); P = 0·818) or 1 year (5·0 per cent (27 of 545) versus 2·5 per cent (14 of 564); P = 0·214).

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the management of acute diverticulitis [^2a68db49]. Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute diverticulitis — antibiotic use and generalizability of evidence are described: Two recent randomized trials and 2 systematic reviews have reported no clear benefit and questioned the routine use of antibiotics, as does this guideline, suggesting selective and individualized use. Further, the patients studied were inpatients with uncomplicated disease confirmed by computed tomography (CT); therefore, the results should not be generalized to complicated patients (those with abscesses or fistulas), those with severe infection or sepsis, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with significant comorbidities. Outpatient management without antibiotics has not been studied, although we would expect these patients to have generally milder disease and logically equal or better outcomes.

### EAES and SAGES 2018 consensus conference on acute diverticulitis management: evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice [^53d65fb8]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

Acute diverticulitis — antibiotic regimen and coverage guidance notes no preferred regimen or route/duration, indicates antibiotics for all complicated cases, and advises spectrum based on stewardship principles. There is no evidence to support a particular antibiotic regime, route, or duration for complicated acute diverticulitis. Antibiotics are indicated in all complicated acute diverticulitis cases. If a drainage procedure is indicated, there is no evidence to support a prolonged course of antibiotics after source control is achieved. Our expert panel recommended that antibiotic use covers gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria based on institutional protocols and antibiotic stewardship principles. (LoE: very low. Strength of recommendation: strong).

Acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — evidence gaps: Evidence is very uncertain (insufficient) to assess the benefits and harms on comparative effectiveness of antibiotic regimens and percutaneous drainage of abscess versus conservative management, and evidence was inconclusive or unavailable to assess the management of acute complicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis with antibiotics or in outpatient settings.

### Treatment of perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis: past, present, and future [^6a28a5f7]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The supposed optimal treatment of perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis has changed several times during the last century, but at present is still unclear.

Methods/Results

The first cases of complicated perforated diverticulitis of the colon were reported in the beginning of the twentieth century. At that time the first therapeutic guidelines were postulated in which an initial nonresectional procedure was provided to be the safest plan of management. After many years in which resection had become standard practice, today, one century later, again (laparoscopic) nonresectional surgery is presented as a safe and promising alternative in treatment of complicated perforated diverticulitis. The question rises what had happened to close the circle?

Conclusions

This paper includes a historic summary of changing patterns in surgical strategies in perforated diverticulitis complicated by generalized peritonitis.
