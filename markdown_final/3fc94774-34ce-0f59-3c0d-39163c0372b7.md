## Question

What is hepatopulmonary syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what hepatopulmonary syndrome is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition and diagnostic triad. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, especially the role of intrapulmonary vascular dilations and shunting. Next, I will review epidemiology and clinical features, including orthodeoxia and platypnea. After that, I need to check the diagnostic criteria and recommended testing sequence. Then, I will examine severity classification and prognosis. Finally, I will consider management, including oxygen therapy, liver transplantation, and special scenarios like pediatrics and post-transplant hypoxemia, and I will close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't gloss over anything important. Hepatopulmonary syndrome is defined by a triad of liver disease or portal hypertension, intrapulmonary vascular dilations causing right-to-left shunting, and abnormal gas exchange with hypoxemia, typically quantified by an elevated alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient and/or reduced PaO2 on room air, and this framework is consistently endorsed by major guidelines and reviews [^810db291] [^56104cc2] [^fa3bfa31] [^ef23b2a6].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before moving on. The core abnormality is diffuse dilation of precapillary and capillary pulmonary vessels, with occasional discrete arteriovenous communications, leading to ventilation–perfusion mismatch and intrapulmonary shunting that worsens in the upright position, producing orthodeoxia and platypnea; mechanistically, increased nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and angiogenic signaling contribute to vasodilation and angiogenesis, and experimental models reinforce these human observations [^fa3bfa31] [^ba03a2c9] [^97ee4716] [^ef23b2a6].

> I should double-check the epidemiology because prevalence estimates vary with diagnostic thresholds. In adults with cirrhosis, HPS is reported in roughly 5–32%, with most contemporary series clustering around 10–20%, and in children the prevalence appears lower but nontrivial, with pediatric cohorts showing up to about 20% in those with cirrhosis or severe portal hypertension; importantly, HPS can occur even with relatively preserved liver function, so severity of liver disease does not strictly track with HPS risk [^fa3bfa31] [^f5c36928] [^c17aa979] [^412438ef] [^ef23b2a6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical features without anchoring them to the pathophysiology. Patients often present with insidious dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and cyanosis, and the classic positional worsening of oxygenation with standing is a hallmark; digital clubbing and spider nevi may be seen, but I need to ensure I emphasize that these findings are variable and that HPS can be underrecognized in the absence of targeted screening [^ef23b2a6] [^2fa31a37] [^c6fcf552].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic criteria and testing sequence, and I need to be precise here. Diagnosis requires liver disease or portal hypertension, demonstration of intrapulmonary vascular dilations, and impaired oxygenation; screening with pulse oximetry using SpO2 less than 96% is reasonable, followed by arterial blood gas to document an A–a gradient greater than 15 mmHg (greater than 20 mmHg if age 65 or older) and/or PaO2 less than 80 mmHg on room air, and confirmation of IPVD with contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography showing delayed left-heart opacification after right-heart bubbles; macroaggregated albumin scanning can quantify shunt fraction and help distinguish HPS from cardiac shunts, and contrast TEE can exclude intracardiac shunts when needed [^385dbbb7] [^3cdbceb7] [^c4cd475d] [^66dbe938] [^f985f385] [^9a0dffa4] [^23d7a98e].

> Let me consider severity classification because it guides prognosis and transplant prioritization. Severity is typically graded by the degree of hypoxemia: mild with PaO2 80–100 mmHg or A–a gradient greater than 15 mmHg, moderate with PaO2 60–79 mmHg, and severe with PaO2 less than 60 mmHg; very severe disease with PaO2 less than 50 mmHg carries the highest waitlist mortality and is the threshold at which MELD exception points are generally granted in adults, reflecting the independent adverse prognostic impact of HPS [^27803877] [^c215cfec] [^f960580a] [^6e9e69e7].

> I will now examine prognosis, and I should confirm that HPS independently worsens survival. Multiple cohorts show that HPS approximately doubles mortality compared with cirrhotic patients without HPS, with median survival in severe cases approaching 10–12 months without transplantation; importantly, HPS-related mortality persists after adjusting for liver disease severity, underscoring the need for early transplant evaluation in appropriate candidates [^6e9e69e7] [^541b1068] [^f5c36928].

> But wait, what about management — let me verify the hierarchy of evidence. There are no FDA-approved medical therapies that durably improve oxygenation or survival in HPS; supportive oxygen is standard, and liver transplantation is the only established curative therapy, with resolution of hypoxemia in most survivors beyond 6 months; in adults with severe HPS, MELD exception points are recommended to mitigate waitlist mortality, whereas TIPS is not recommended for HPS management due to insufficient benefit and potential harm [^cea75dbd] [^03c349e7] [^a34c7e6a] [^c215cfec] [^f960580a] [^865a50c7] [^e0e73e57].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and contexts. In children, HPS is less common but still clinically meaningful, and adult-derived MELD/PELD exception criteria may not fully capture pediatric risk; nonetheless, pediatric recipients with HPS generally have excellent post-transplant outcomes, and congenital portosystemic shunts should be considered for correction when feasible; in patients with very severe HPS, post-transplant hypoxemia is common and carries high mortality, prompting preemptive planning and, in some centers, staged use of inhaled vasodilators, methylene blue, selective embolization, or extracorporeal support as bridges to recovery [^a6f74d08] [^628c5868] [^7dee4a69] [^9252aac3].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic pitfalls so I don't overstate certainty. Contrast echocardiography detects IPVD but cannot distinguish diffuse microvascular dilation from discrete AVMs or intracardiac shunts, and macroaggregated albumin scanning complements this by quantifying extrapulmonary tracer uptake; moreover, ICD-coded HPS is frequently misapplied, with only a minority of labeled patients meeting formal criteria, so adherence to the triad and guideline-recommended testing is essential to avoid misclassification [^9a0dffa4] [^74ad6de0].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is tight: hepatopulmonary syndrome is a pulmonary vascular complication of liver disease or portal hypertension characterized by intrapulmonary vascular dilations with right-to-left shunting and impaired oxygenation, presenting with dyspnea and positional hypoxemia; it is common in cirrhosis, independently worsens prognosis, and is diagnosed by a triad of liver disease, documented IPVD, and abnormal ABG thresholds; severity stratification by PaO2 guides urgency, and liver transplantation is the only definitive therapy, with supportive oxygen and transplant prioritization strategies improving outcomes in appropriately selected patients [^fa3bfa31] [^810db291] [^f5c36928] [^a34c7e6a].

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a **triad of liver disease, intrapulmonary vascular dilations, and hypoxemia** [^e31e59a9] due to right-to-left shunting and ventilation–perfusion mismatch [^fa3bfa31]. It is common in cirrhosis and portal hypertension, with a prevalence of 10–30% [^f5c36928] and a **two-fold increase in mortality** [^541b1068] compared to cirrhotic patients without HPS. Diagnosis relies on pulse oximetry screening (SpO2 < 96%) [^385dbbb7], arterial blood gas (PaO2 < 80 mmHg or A–a gradient ≥ 15 mmHg) [^3cdbceb7], and contrast echocardiography to confirm intrapulmonary shunting [^66dbe938]. There is **no effective medical therapy** [^cea75dbd]; liver transplantation is the only curative option [^a34c7e6a], with MELD exception points for severe hypoxemia (PaO2 < 60 mmHg) [^c215cfec]. Supportive oxygen is used while awaiting transplant [^fa375ff7], and severe post-transplant hypoxemia occurs in 6–21% [^5b956d2a], requiring specialized ICU management [^7dee4a69].

---

## Pathophysiology

HPS arises from **intrapulmonary vascular dilations** (IPVDs) that create right-to-left shunts and ventilation–perfusion mismatch, causing hypoxemia [^fa3bfa31]. Key mediators include nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and angiogenic factors (e.g. VEGF) [^ba03a2c9], which drive vasodilation and neovascularization [^97ee4716]. IPVDs can be diffuse or focal and are best detected by contrast echocardiography [^66dbe938].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with:

- **Dyspnea**: Especially exertional, often progressive [^ef23b2a6].
- **Orthodeoxia**: Desaturation in upright posture, improving supine [^0bf81726].
- **Platypnea**: Shortness of breath upright, relieved supine [^ef23b2a6].
- **Cyanosis and clubbing**: In advanced cases [^ef23b2a6].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

Diagnosis requires the **following triad**:

| **Component** | **Diagnostic method** | **Criteria** |
|-|-|-|
| Liver disease or portal hypertension | Clinical history, imaging | Documented cirrhosis or portal hypertension |
| Intrapulmonary vascular dilations | Contrast echocardiography [^66dbe938] | Delayed (> 3 cardiac cycles) left-heart opacification after right-heart bubbles |
| Hypoxemia | Arterial blood gas [^3cdbceb7] | PaO2 < 80 mmHg or A–a gradient ≥ 15 mmHg (≥ 20 mmHg if age > 64) |

---

Screening with **pulse oximetry** (SpO2 < 96%) is recommended in cirrhotic patients [^385dbbb7], followed by ABG and contrast echocardiography if positive [^b3fead5a]. Macroaggregated albumin scanning can quantify shunting and help distinguish HPS from cardiac shunts [^9a0dffa4].

---

## Prevalence and risk factors

HPS occurs in **10–30% of cirrhotic patients** [^f5c36928] and is strongly associated with portal hypertension [^ef23b2a6]. Risk increases with advancing liver disease severity, but HPS can occur even in compensated cirrhosis [^70cb2aac]. Pediatric HPS is less common but well described [^c17aa979].

---

## Prognosis

HPS significantly worsens prognosis, with a **median survival of 10.6 months** in untreated patients [^6e9e69e7] and a two-fold increase in mortality versus cirrhotic patients without HPS [^541b1068]. Severity correlates with mortality, especially when PaO2 < 60 mmHg [^notfound].

---

## Management

- **Supportive care**: Long-term supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia [^345c74ca] [^fa375ff7].
- **Liver transplantation**: Only curative therapy [^a34c7e6a]; MELD exception points are granted for severe hypoxemia (PaO2 < 60 mmHg) [^c215cfec].
- **Post-transplant care**: Severe post-transplant hypoxemia occurs in 6–21% [^5b956d2a] and requires ICU strategies (e.g. inhaled vasodilators, ECMO) [^7dee4a69].

---

## Conclusion

HPS is a **severe pulmonary vascular complication of cirrhosis** characterized by IPVDs and hypoxemia, with no effective medical therapy beyond supportive oxygen [^cea75dbd]. Early recognition and liver transplantation are critical to improving outcomes [^f5c36928].

### Portopulmonary hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome [^e31e59a9]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

The clinically and pathophysiologically distinct entities of portopulmonary hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome occur in a substantial proportion of patients who have advanced liver disease of different causes. These disorders are notoriously underdiagnosed, but they have a substantial impact on survival and require focused treatment. Abnormal intrapulmonary vascular dilatation, the hallmark of hepatopulmonary syndrome, can cause profound hypoxaemia that can be very difficult to treat. By contrast, portopulmonary hypertension results from excessive pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodelling that eventually leads to right-heart failure. Insights into the pathogeneses of these syndromes have led to novel therapeutic approaches. However, in severely affected patients, effective treatment remains a difficult task. In selected patients, liver transplantation represents the only treatment option, but the decision to do isolated liver transplantation is particularly challenging in patients who have severe pulmonary disease involvement. Data from several centres have contributed to provide criteria that allow improved prediction of which patients may, or may not, benefit from liver transplantation alone.

### Supine exercise in hepatopulmonary syndrome patients with… [^0bf81726]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome is a rare condition that presents in about a quarter of patients with liver cirrhosis. In addition, a small subset of these HPS patients also have orthodeoxia, defined as a drop in oxygen levels when they are sitting up, as opposed to lying flat. At present, there is little known about this condition. Patients diagnosed with HPS and orthodeoxia experience reduced ability to exercise, especially when upright. While standard cardiopulmonary exercise is routinely performed in the sitting position, there are machines that enable candidates to exercise in the supine position. This is especially relevant in patients with severe HPS, with clinically significant orthodeoxia, where conventional upright exercise is difficult. The main stopping criterion will be the point at which, after standardized encouragement, the subject is unable to continue because of symptoms. This is defined as the "tolerable limit". Additional safety-related stopping criteria will include: the appearance of life-threatening arrhythmias, a drop in systolic blood pressure by ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline, or a desaturation below a set point for ≥ 30 s. The set saturation point will be chosen individually for each patient, as the lower of: 80% or the lowest saturation seen on room air 6MWT.

### New updates on hepatopulmonary syndrome: a comprehensive review [^541b1068]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a serious pulmonary vascular complication that causes arterial hypoxemia in the setting of liver disease. HPS has a progressive course and is associated with a two-fold increased risk of mortality relative to cirrhotic patients without HPS. It primarily affects patients with portal hypertension. The key pathological features of HPS include intrapulmonary angiogenesis and vascular dilations (IPVDs). The prevalence of HPS varies widely due to inconsistent diagnostic criteria and a lack of standardized protocols. Despite advances in understanding its pathophysiology, no effective curative treatments for HPS exist. Liver transplantation remains the only definitive treatment, improving survival and altering the disease natural course. This review explores the pathophysiology, clinical features, and therapeutic strategies for HPS, highlighting recent advances in the literature.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss the advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of experimental and human hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) and in the management of HPS, particularly regarding liver transplantation.

Recent Findings

Advances have been made in defining the pathophysiology of HPS in experimental models as well as in human disease, including the role of endothelin-1, pulmonary monocytes, and angiogenesis. Additionally, the implications of the presence of HPS as it relates to prioritizing patients for liver transplantation and posttransplant outcomes will also be reviewed.

Summary

Mechanisms of disease continue to be defined in HPS, providing potential targets for pharmacologic intervention. Outcomes after liver transplantation are also becoming clearer, including the management of HPS with severe hypoxemia.

### Pulmonary vascular complications of liver disease [^28770030]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension are two pulmonary vascular complications of liver disease. The pathophysiology underlying each disorder is distinct, but patients with either condition may be limited by dyspnea. A careful evaluation of concomitant symptoms, the physical examination, pulmonary function testing and arterial blood gas analysis, and echocardiographic, imaging, and hemodynamic studies is crucial to establishing (and distinguishing) these diagnoses. Our understanding of the pathobiology, natural history, and treatment of these disorders has advanced considerably over the past decade; however, the presence of either still increases the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with underlying liver disease. There is no effective medical treatment for hepatopulmonary syndrome. Although liver transplantation can resolve hepatopulmonary syndrome, there appears to be worse survival even with transplantation. Liver transplantation poses a very high risk of death in those with significant portopulmonary hypertension, where targeted medical therapies may improve functional status and allow successful transplantation in a small number of select patients.

### Hepatopulmonary syndrome: update on pathogenesis and clinical features [^fa3bfa31]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a serious vascular complication of liver disease that occurs in 5–32% of patients with cirrhosis. The presence of HPS markedly increases mortality. No effective medical therapies are currently available and liver transplantation is the only established treatment option for HPS. The definition and diagnosis of HPS are established by the presence of a triad of liver disease with intrapulmonary vascular dilation that causes abnormal arterial gas exchange. Experimental biliary cirrhosis induced by common bile duct ligation in the rat reproduces the pulmonary vascular and gas exchange abnormalities of human HPS and serves as a pertinent animal model. Pulmonary microvascular dilation and angiogenesis are two central pathogenic features that drive abnormal pulmonary gas exchange in experimental HPS, and thus might underlie HPS in humans. Defining the mechanisms involved in the microvascular alterations of HPS has the potential to lead to effective medical therapies. This Review focuses on the current understanding of the pathogenesis, clinical features and management of HPS.

### Proposed management algorithm for severe hypoxemia after liver transplantation in the hepatopulmonary syndrome [^7dee4a69]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is defined as the triad of liver disease, intrapulmonary vascular dilatation, and abnormal gas exchange, and is found in 10–32% of patients with liver disease. Liver transplantation is the only known cure for HPS, but patients can develop severe posttransplant hypoxemia, defined as a need for 100% inspired oxygen to maintain a saturation of ≥ 85%. This complication is seen in 6–21% of patients and carries a 45% mortality. Its management requires the application of specific strategies targeting the underlying physiologic abnormalities in HPS, but awareness of these strategies and knowledge on their optimal use is limited. We reviewed existing literature to identify strategies that can be used for this complication, and developed a clinical management algorithm based on best evidence and expert opinion. Evidence was limited to case reports and case series, and we determined which treatments to include in the algorithm and their recommended sequence based on their relative likelihood of success, invasiveness, and risk. Recommended therapies include: Trendelenburg positioning, inhaled epoprostenol or nitric oxide, methylene blue, embolization of abnormal pulmonary vessels, and extracorporeal life support. Availability and use of this pragmatic algorithm may improve management of this complication, and will benefit from prospective validation.

### Potential clinical targets in hepatopulmonary syndrome: lessons from experimental models [^97ee4716]. Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a relatively common and potentially severe pulmonary complication of cirrhosis with increased risk of mortality. In experimental models, a complex interaction between pulmonary endothelial cells, monocytes, and the respiratory epithelium, which produces chemokines, cytokines, and angiogenic growth factors, causes alterations in the alveolar microvasculature, resulting in impaired oxygenation. Model systems are critical for evaluating mechanisms and for preclinical testing in HPS, due to the challenges of evaluating the lung in the setting of advanced liver disease in humans. This review provides an overview of current knowledge and recent findings in the rodent common bile duct ligation model of HPS, which recapitulates many features of human disease. We focus on the concepts of endothelial derangement, monocyte infiltration, angiogenesis, and alveolar type II cell dysfunction as main contributors and potential targets for therapy.

### Proposed management algorithm for severe hypoxemia after liver transplantation in the hepatopulmonary syndrome [^9252aac3]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is defined as a triad of liver disease, intrapulmonary vascular dilatation, and abnormal gas exchange, and is found in 10–32% of patients with cirrhosis 1, 2, 3, 4. This disease is associated with progressive hypoxemia and a high mortality 3, 5. Although liver transplantation (LT) is curative in HPS, these patients have an elevated postoperative complication rate 6, 7, 8, 9. In particular, "severe posttransplant hypoxemia", defined as a need for 100% inspired oxygen (FiO 2) to maintain a saturation of ≥ 85% (out of proportion to any other concurrent lung process) 10, has been identified as a major complication leading to prolonged ICU stay and death in this population 6, 9, 10, 11, 12. Although survivors have a complete normalization of gas exchange over time, severe posttransplant hypoxemia occurs in 6–21% of HPS patients, carries a mortality of 45%, and accounts for the majority of peri‐operative deaths in this population 10. A variety of strategies to attempt to manage this complication have been described in the literature, but these have never been reviewed and summarized and are used inconsistently, which has led to calls for a systematic approach 6, 9, 10, 13. We sought to review available evidence in order to develop a practical clinical management algorithm for severe posttransplant hypoxemia in HPS.

### Pregnancy exacerbating hepatopulmonary syndrome [^938f92ff]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatopulmonary syndrome is an uncommon complication of liver cirrhosis. The natural history of this condition and its optimal management during pregnancy are not yet known.

Case

We present the case of a 35-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis who developed severe dyspnea in the 25th week of gestation and was diagnosed as suffering from hepatopulmonary syndrome. She was managed conservatively until 35 weeks of gestation, when she was delivered by cesarean.

Conclusion

The natural history, in this case, indicates that pregnancy may induce hepatopulmonary syndrome in an otherwise asymptomatic cirrhotic patient. Oxygen supplementation was the cornerstone of treatment and resulted in a favorable outcome.

### Hepatopulmonary syndrome: role of nitric oxide and clinical aspects [^70cb2aac]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome is defined by oxygenation impairment due to abnormal intrapulmonary vascular dilatations in patients with liver disease. The implication of enhanced pulmonary production of nitric oxide in the pathogenesis of intrapulmonary vascular dilatations has been demonstrated both in murine models and in human hepatopulmonary syndrome. The diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome in chronic liver disease is of paramount importance, considering the fact that severe hypoxemia related to hepatopulmonary syndrome may occur in patients with well compensated liver disease and that survival is reduced in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome relative to non hepatopulmonary syndrome patients. Priority for liver transplantation, which is presently the only cure, has been recently increased in patients with advanced hepatopulmonary syndrome.

Methods and Materials

Literature search

We searched MEDLINE (from inception to October 20, 2014) for English language studies involving human subjects with "hepatopulmonary syndrome" as a medical subject heading or keyword. We supplemented this with a manual search of reference lists from all retrieved articles and by consulting experts in the field. We included studies which described outcomes of strategies expected to rapidly (< 72 h) reverse hypoxemia either posttransplant, or in a nontransplant context which could be applied posttransplant (in patients with HPS). Two reviewers (DN, SG) screened all abstracts and categorized them as definitely, possibly, or definitely not meeting inclusion criteria. We retrieved and reviewed full manuscripts for abstracts categorized as definitely or possibly meeting inclusion criteria by one or both reviewers, review articles, and reports of LT outcomes in HPS (adults and children).

Algorithm development

The treatment algorithm was developed iteratively by a multidisciplinary team from two quaternary care LT centers (the University Health Network, University of Toronto and Hôpital St‐Luc, Université de Montréal). Evidence suggests that protocol‐driven care can improve ICU care‐related outcomes 14, and that early involvement of multidisciplinary teams in the protocol development can foster a sense of ownership, autonomy, and increased adherence 15. Accordingly, we involved all relevant multidisciplinary stakeholders in the iterative development and approval of the algorithm. The team included five ICU physicians, one respirologist with an interest in HPS, two transplant hepatologists, and one ICU respiratory therapist. The algorithm was further reviewed and modified based on suggestions from ICU, transplant hepatology, liver transplant surgery, respiratory therapy, nursing, and extracorporeal life support (ECLS) team members.

We determined which treatments to include in the algorithm and their recommended sequence of use based on their relative likelihood of success, invasiveness, and risk, based on available evidence from our literature search. Where evidence was not available, we relied on common sense and our practical experience in using these strategies at our specialized HPS center, where reported mortality from this complication was 28.6%, versus 75% in other reports 10.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome is an uncommon complication of nonacute liver failure, and in rare cases, hypoxia may be the presenting sign of liver dysfunction. The condition, once thought to be a contraindication, is improved in most cases by transplantation. There is a significant risk of postoperative, hypoxia-related morbidity and mortality in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome. We present a case of life-threatening hypoxia following liver transplantation for liver failure and associated hepatopulmonary syndrome, with successful management using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

### Physiologic changes in the hepatopulmonary syndrome before and after liver transplant: a longitudinal and predictor analysis [^1d1178f4]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims:

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a common complication of liver disease defined by abnormal oxygenation and intrapulmonary vascular dilatation, treated with liver transplantation. Little is known about changes in HPS physiological parameters over time. We sought to describe baseline clinical and physiological characteristics in HPS and their relationships, temporal changes in physiological parameters before and after transplant, and predictors of changes in oxygenation.

Approach and Results:

This was a retrospective cohort study in the Canadian HPS Program (n = 132). Rates of change after diagnosis were: −3.7 (−6.4, −0.96) mm Hg/year for partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2); −26 (−96, 44) m/year for 6-minute walk distance, and 3.3% (−6.6, −0.011) predicted/year for diffusion capacity. Noninvasive shunt of ≥ 20% predicted a slower PaO 2 decline by 0.88 (0.36, 1.4) mm Hg/month. We identified 2 PaO 2 deterioration classes — "very severe disease, slow decliners" (PaO 2 45.0 mm Hg; −1.0 mm Hg/year); and "moderate disease, steady decliners" (PaO 2 65.5 mm Hg; −2.5 mm Hg/year). PaO 2 increased by 6.5 (5.3, 7.7) mm Hg/month in the first year after transplant. The median time to normalization was 149 (116, 184) days. Posttransplant improvement in PaO 2 was 2.5 (0.1, 4.9) mm Hg/month faster for every 10 mm Hg greater pretransplant orthodeoxia.

Conclusions:

We present a large and long longitudinal data analysis in HPS. In addition to rates of physiological decline and improvement before and after liver transplantation, we present novel predictors of PaO 2 decline and improvement rates. Our findings enhance our understanding of the natural history of HPS and provide pathophysiologic clues. Importantly, they may assist providers in prognostication and prioritization before and after transplant.

### Model for end-stage liver disease / pediatric end-stage liver disease exception policy and outcomes in pediatric patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome requiring liver transplantation [^17a32b6e]. Liver Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a pulmonary vascular disease that develops in a subset of patients with chronic liver failure and portal hypertension and is characterized by intrapulmonary vascular dilations with resultant arterial hypoxemia.–Although there is significant variation in the reported prevalence of HPS secondary to differences in diagnostic criteria and heterogeneity of underlying liver disease, its prevalence among candidates for liver transplantation (LT) has been reported at up to 32% for adults, and up to 20% in the pediatric population.–Simultaneously, HPS is associated with a decreased quality of life and an increase in the risk of death among both adult and pediatric LT candidates. Although there are currently no effective medical treatments for HPS as measured by sustained improvement in oxygenation or reduction in mortality, LT has been demonstrated to reverse the syndrome and improve survival rates.–

The Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scoring system, first adopted in 2002 as the standard method of determining LT waitlist priority, is based on objective data and has been validated as an accurate predictor of 3‐month mortality. The Pediatric End‐Stage Liver Disease (PELD) scoring system was developed around the same time and with the same set of principles in mind but with the intent of addressing characteristics unique to children with chronic liver disease.–By aiming to reflect the severity of a patient's disease based on an estimated 3‐month mortality without transplant, implementation of the MELD/PELD system has resulted in a decrease in the proportion of children dying while on the waiting list. Importantly, however, the PELD system has been shown to underestimate pretransplantation mortality for children, which may be placing them at a systemic disadvantage in organ allocation relative to adults.

### Coexisting hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension: implications for liver transplantation [^3786cb25]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) and portopulmonary hypertension (POPH) represent pulmonary complications of liver disease and portal hypertension. The underlying pathophysiology behind these entities is complex and involves different effects of vasoactive substances on the pulmonary vasculature, among them endothelin-1 and nitric oxide (NO). Hepatopulmonary syndrome results from vasodilation, intrapulmonary shunting, and hypoxia. In contrast, portopulmonary hypertension is predominantly owing to generalized vasoconstriction that leads to remodeling and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, but is rarely associated with hypoxia. We present a case report in which these 2 processes with opposing pathologic mechanisms coexist in the same patient. We also conducted a literature search to identify other documented cases of coexisting hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension, common clinical features of these patients, and outcomes with or without treatment. Our case highlights the importance of recognizing the coexistence of these 2 disease processes, as they may occur simultaneously and affect the approach to treatment, including liver transplantation.

### Evaluation for liver transplantation in adults: 2013 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^23d7a98e]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) in liver transplantation (LT) candidates — screening, evaluation, and MELD exception policy are detailed as follows: Current Organ Procurement Transplant Network/UNOS policy assigns a MELD exception score of 22 for patients with portal hypertension, intrapulmonary shunting, and a room air PaO2 < 60 mmHg, with a 10% mortality equivalent increase in points every 3 months if the PaO2 remains < 60 mmHg. Screening of LT candidates by pulse oximetry is indicated to detect HPS patients with a PaO2 < 70 mmHg, using a threshold value of SpO2 < 96% at sea level to trigger complete evaluation, and preoperative evaluation should include room air arterial blood gas, transthoracic contrast echocardiography, and exclusion of alternate causes by chest x-ray, pulmonary function tests, and chest computed tomography. Arterial response to administration of 100% oxygen may be used to gauge perioperative oxygenation ability but does not appear to influence outcome, and the guideline states that the presence of severe HPS is associated with increased mortality and affected individuals should undergo expedited LT evaluation (1-B).

### Defining and characterizing severe hypoxemia after liver transplantation in hepatopulmonary syndrome [^5b956d2a]. Liver Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome is defined as a triad of liver disease, intrapulmonary vascular dilatations, and abnormal gas exchange, and it carries a poor prognosis. Liver transplantation is the only known cure for this syndrome. Severe hypoxemia in the early postoperative period has been reported to be a major complication and often leads to death in this population, but it has been poorly characterized. We sought to propose an objective definition for this complication and to describe its risk factors, incidence, and outcomes. We performed a systematic literature search and reviewed our single-center experience to characterize this complication. On the basis of the most commonly applied definition in 27 identified studies, we objectively defined severe postoperative hypoxemia as hypoxemia requiring a 100% fraction of inhaled oxygen to maintain a saturation ≥ 85% and out of proportion to any concurrent lung process. Nineteen of the 27 reports (70%) fulfilled this definition, as did 4 of the 21 patients (19%) at our center. We determined the prevalence and mortality of this complication from reports including 10 or more consecutive patients and providing sufficient postoperative details to determine whether this complication had occurred. In these reports, the prevalence of this complication was 12% (25/209). For the 11 cases with reported outcomes, the posttransplant mortality rate was 45% (5/11). There was a trend toward an increased risk of developing this complication in patients with very severe preoperative hypoxemia, defined as a partial pressure of arterial oxygen ≤ 50 mm Hg (8/41 with very severe hypoxemia versus 3/49 without severe hypoxemia, P = 0.053), and there was a significantly increased risk for patients with anatomic shunting ≥ 20% (7/25 with anatomic shunting ≥ 20% versus 1/25 without anatomic shunting ≥ 20%, P = 0.049). In conclusion, increased preoperative vigilance for this common complication is required among high-risk patients, and further research is required to identify the best management strategies.

Conclusions

Severe posttransplant hypoxemia is associated with an unacceptably high mortality in HPS. We used best evidence and expert opinion to develop a practical management algorithm for this complication. Future research should prospectively measure the impact of this algorithm on posttransplant outcomes in this population.

### Mechanisms of pulmonary vascular complications of liver disease: hepatopulmonary syndrome [^ba03a2c9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Pulmonary vascular abnormalities occurring in the setting of liver disease have been increasingly recognized as important clinical entities that influence survival and liver transplant candidacy in affected patients. The most common such abnormality, the hepatopulmonary syndrome, is found in 15% to 20% of patients with cirrhosis. These disorders have no effective medical therapies. Experimental models of hepatopulmonary syndrome have identified a sequence of hepatic and pulmonary endothelial alterations that lead to nitric oxide and carbon monoxide-mediated intrapulmonary vasodilatation. A key role for shear stress-mediated pulmonary endothelial endothelin B receptor overexpression and cholangiocyte ET-1 production and release has emerged as a mechanism for local nitric oxide production in the lung. How these alterations are influenced by bacterial translocation and the systemic hyperdynamic circulatory state and whether similar changes occur in human disease are areas of ongoing investigation.

### Hepatopulmonary syndrome: the anaesthetic considerations [^8757c6c5]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a pulmonary complication observed in patients with chronic liver disease and/or portal hypertension, attributable to an intrapulmonary vascular dilatation that induces severe hypoxaemia. Considering the favourable long-term survival of HPS patients as well as the reversal of the syndrome with a functional liver graft, HPS is now an indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Consequently, blood gas analysis and imaging techniques should be performed when cirrhotic patients present with shortness of breath as well as when OLT candidates are placed on the transplant waiting list. If the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is more than 10.7kPa when breathing room air, HPS can be excluded and no other investigation is needed. When the PaO2 when breathing room air is 10.7kPa or less, contrast-enhanced echocardiography should be performed to exclude pulmonary vascular dilatation. Lung function tests may also help detect additional pulmonary diseases that can contribute to impaired oxygenation. When contrast-enhanced echocardiography is negative, HPS is excluded and no follow-up is needed. When contrast-enhanced echocardiography is positive and PaO2 less than 8kPa, patients should obtain a severity score that provides them with a reasonable probability of being transplanted within 3 months. In mild-to-moderate HPS (PaO2 8 to 10.6kPa), periodic follow-up is recommended every 3 months to detect any further deterioration in PaO2. Although no intraoperative deaths have been directly attributed to HPS, oxygenation may worsen immediately following OLT due to volume overload and postoperative infections. Mechanical ventilation is often prolonged with an extended stay in the ICU. A high postoperative mortality (mostly within 6 months) is observed in this group of patients in comparison to non-HPS patients. However, the recovery of an adequate PaO2 within 12 months after OLT explains the similar outcome of HPS and non-HPS patients following OLT over a longer time period.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) in liver transplantation (LT) candidates — HPS is found in 5–32% of adult liver transplant candidates. LT offers a survival benefit in HPS, with 76% of LT recipients at the Mayo Clinic surviving 5 years compared to 26% of matched patients with equivalent severity of hypoxemia and liver disease who were not transplanted, and HPS reverses in almost all patients who survive more than 6 months; perioperative mortality appears high in those with severe HPS, with preoperative PaO2 < 50 mmHg alone or in combination with an MAA shunt scan of greater than 20% predictors of increased mortality after LT.

### Inhaled iloprost for hepatopulmonary syndrome: improvement of hypoxemia [^48988bfe]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome is characterized by advanced liver disease, hypoxemia, and intrapulmonary shunting. The only reported curative option is orthotopic liver transplantation. We describe here a beneficial effect of inhaled prostacyclin including a decrease in respiratory symptoms and improved oxygenation in this clinical situation, with no approved pharmacological long-term therapy. The prostanoid iloprost, approved for pulmonary and portopulmonary hypertension, caused an increase in oxygenation, relief of dyspnea, and increased exercise tolerance in a patient suffering from liver-cirrhosis-associated hepatopulmonary syndrome. After liver transplantation, restitution of hepatopulmonary syndrome did not occur immediately. Inhaling iloprost resulted in improved physical condition and better clinical rehabilitation potential until hypoxemia finally resolved 3 months after transplantation. Therefore, iloprost could improve quality of life in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome waiting for liver transplantation and post surgery until the resolution of the hypoxemia.

### Diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome in a large integrated health system [^74ad6de0]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Data on the accuracy of the diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) in cirrhosis is limited. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients with International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) in a large integrated health system.

Methods

A retrospective review of encounters was performed of all patients with ICD-9-CM and/or ICD-10-CM diagnosis of cirrhosis and HPS from 2014–2019 in a multi-state health system. Demographics and cardiopulmonary testing closest to the time of HPS diagnosis were recorded. HPS was defined using standard criteria.

Results

A total of 42,749 unique individuals with cirrhosis were identified. An ICD diagnosis of HPS was found in 194 patients (0.45%), of which 182 had clinically confirmed cirrhosis. 143 (78.5%) underwent contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography, and 98 (54%) had delayed shunting. Among them, 61 patients had a documented arterial blood gas, with 53 showing abnormal oxygenation (A-a gradient of > 15 mm Hg). 12 were excluded due to significant pulmonary function test abnormalities and abnormal oxygenation from other cardiopulmonary diseases. Ultimately, 41 (22.5%) fulfilled the criteria for HPS. When stratifying those with an ICD code diagnosis of HPS into HPS, no HPS and indeterminate HPS groups, based on standard diagnostic criteria for HPS, we found that the confirmed HPS patients had similar complications except for less portopulmonary hypertension, worse gas exchange, less cardiopulmonary disease and were more often diagnosed in transplant centers.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of HPS by ICD code is made in an extremely small subset of a sizeable cirrhotic cohort. When made, only a minority of these patients meet diagnostic criteria. Our findings highlight the need for improved education and more effective screening algorithms.

### Physiologic changes in the hepatopulmonary syndrome before and after liver transplant: a longitudinal and predictor analysis [^732b12e1]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a pulmonary vascular complication of cirrhosis defined by a combination of abnormal arterial oxygenation and intrapulmonary vascular dilatation (IPVD), occurring in up to 30% of patients with liver disease.

Although experts have noted that HPS is a progressive condition, little is known about how oxygenation changes in patients with HPS over time. Similarly, although diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) – and exercise capacity as measured by 6-minute walk distance (6MWD)are reduced in patients with HPS, it is unclear whether and how these important physiologic and functional measures change over time and correlate with one another and with physical exam findings.

Several studies have described significantly increased mortality in HPS when compared to patients without HPS with a similar severity of liver disease. Accordingly, given that liver transplantation is the only proven treatment for HPS, the Organ Procurement Transplant Network and United Network for Organ Sharing recommend assigning MELD exception points to patients with severe HPS (PaO 2 < 60 mm Hg). Given significant transplant wait times in most centers, predicting the rate of PaO 2 decline could enable both better prognostication and transplant prioritization in this population.

Similarly, although liver transplantation results in near or complete normalization in oxygenation in nearly all patients, –, the time course of recovery is highly variable, and little is known about the rate of improvement in PaO 2 and other physiologic parameters after transplantation. It is also unknown whether the rate of improvement can be predicted by baseline characteristics, which would be indispensable for posttransplant planning and prognostication.

To date, descriptions of physiological parameters in patients with HPS have been limited almost exclusively to static data. Herein, we sought to describe the following: (1) baseline clinical and physiological characteristics and their relationships; (2) changes in physiological parameters over time in HPS and their predictors; and (3) changes in physiological parameters over time after liver transplant in HPS, and their predictors, in a well-characterized cohort of patients followed in the Canadian HPS Program over a period of ~20 years.

### Proposed management algorithm for severe hypoxemia after liver transplantation in the hepatopulmonary syndrome [^9f683db2]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Literature search

We retrieved 416 citations using the medical subject heading "hepatopulmonary syndrome", and an additional 156 citations using the keyword "hepatopulmonary syndrome", for a total of 572 citations. Of these, 18 definitely met, 149 possibly met, and 405 definitely did not meet inclusion criteria. Upon full manuscript review, of the 149 citations possibly meeting inclusion criteria, 15 met inclusion criteria. We identified an additional 23 citations of interest from the manual search of reference lists and from experts, nine of which met inclusion criteria upon full manuscript review, for a total of 42 manuscripts (7%) meeting inclusion criteria. Of these, 27 studies reported therapies that were included in the algorithm (Table 1). Given that this is an infrequent complication in a rare disease, evidence was limited to case reports and case series and could not be formally meta‐analyzed. A small number of patients have been reported for any one therapy, with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) being the best studied (19 patients), followed by methylene blue (MB) (10 patients), inhaled epoprostenol (four patients), embolization of abnormal pulmonary vessels (four patients), combined iNO and MB (two patients), ECLS (three patients), and Trendelenburg positioning (one patient). Mechanisms and time‐courses of action for these agents are summarized in Table 2. Therapies that were not included in our algorithm, along with their mechanisms of action and reasons for exclusion are summarized in Supplemental Table S1.

### Proposed management algorithm for severe hypoxemia after liver transplantation in the hepatopulmonary syndrome [^5ed8727c]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Pretransplant Testing

Our review suggests that there is variability in responsiveness to various therapies (Table 1). This is likely due to variations in the timing, dose and duration of their administration, and unique patient factors related to HPS pathophysiology and any co‐existing lung disease. A previous report noted increased risk of severe posttransplant hypoxemia in patients with a baseline PaO 2 ≤ 50 mmHg and/or ≥ 20% anatomic shunting 10. In these "high‐risk" patients, preoperative testing for responsiveness to these approaches may be beneficial in predicting their relative effectiveness. These data could be used to tailor and adapt the algorithm to each patient, and positive results may be used to justify listing of candidates otherwise considered at too high a risk for this complication 6.

Discussion

Severe hypoxemia accounts for a majority of postoperative deaths in patients with HPS undergoing LT. We reviewed existing literature to develop a systematic management algorithm for this complication, informed by best evidence and expert opinion.

This complication tends to occur early in the postoperative period (usually within 24 h of LT). It is thought to be related to postoperative pulmonary vasoconstriction resulting from an abrupt change in the vascular mediators entering the lung from the hepatic effluent 10, 22. Due to possible remodeling and impaired vasoconstriction in dilated HPS vessels, normal (nondilated) pulmonary vessels may vasoconstrict disproportionately, resulting in further increases in flow through dilated HPS vessels, and consequently, a transient worsening in the underlying diffusion‐perfusion defect and ventilation‐perfusion (VQ) mismatch of HPS 10. Accordingly, selected therapies work through a variety of mechanisms to reduce flow through these dilated vessels (Table 2). The overall goal of therapy is to: (1) mitigate early mortality; and (2) maintain oxygenation for long enough such that the expected posttransplant reversal of HPS pathology (and hypoxemia) can begin to take place. The rationale for inclusion of each treatment in the algorithm and other considerations are summarized below.

### Hepatopulmonary syndrome, another face of dysregulated BMP9 signaling [^644603cc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Although clinical and translational data in this study shed important new light on the role of BMP9 signaling in pulmonary vascular syndromes associated with liver disease, questions remain. As a biomarker of HPS or PoPH, BMP9 appears more useful among patients with milder cirrhosis, raising the question of why many individuals with severe cirrhosis remain free of either syndrome despite having almost universally diminished BMP9 concentrations. A previous report suggested that BMP10 might be more useful for discriminating HPS than PoPH, an observation that would be interesting to test in this well-phenotyped cohort. However, the process of how some patients with cirrhosis develop HPS, PoPH, or both is not likely explained by BMP9 or BMP10 alone but might be attributable to myriad changes in the vasoactive secretome of advanced liver disease. A parallel might be drawn to genetic syndromes of this pathway: loss-of-function mutations in GDF2, and its receptors ACVRL1 and ENG, may give rise to distinct vascular syndromes of PAH or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and the determinants may lie in microanatomic and functional diversity of endothelial lineages responsible for distinct forms of vascular remodeling and differential susceptibility of phenotypes to signaling, hemodynamic, inflammatory, genetic, or epigenetic perturbations.

### Pulmonary complications in liver disease [^ef23b2a6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Two discrete entities affecting the pulmonary vascular bed — hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension

In addition to these acute organ–organ interactions, prolonged stimulation by liver-derived vasoactive and proliferative mediators promotes remodeling processes in the pulmonary vascular bed in chronic liver disease through diffuse or localized telangiectasia (in HPS) or hyperplastic lesions in terminal pulmonary arterioles (in PoPH).

Respiratory function needs to be assessed in all candidates listed or considered for liver transplantation (LT), as primary disorders affecting the pulmonary circulation are associated with functional status, quality of life, and survival on the waiting list and outcome after LT. HPS and PoPH, a form of secondary pulmonary hypertension (PAH), might also prompt unplanned admission of the patient with end-stage liver disease with dyspnea or right heart dysfunction and require immediate and appropriate care on an ICU to prevent further deterioration of an already limited liver function.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome is characterized by hypoxemia with an abnormal alveolar–arterial O 2 -gradient and evidence of intrapulmonary shunting in the presence of liver disease. Abnormal oxygenation is defined by elevated alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient (> 15 mmHg or > 20 mmHg in patients > 64 years, respectively) while breathing room air in a sitting position, and severity of HPS is classified according to the degree of hypoxemia. The underlying intrapulmonary vascular dilatations can best be diagnosed by contrast-enhanced echocardiography, and characteristic findings on CT imaging may also be seen. In severe cases, clinical characteristics of hypoxemia such as cyanosis and digital clubbing might be present. The severity of HPS might be aggravated by upright posture (platypnea–orthodeoxia) and is not related to the severity of liver disease. In general, the pulmonary circulation is diffusely affected by telangiectatic lesions, but anatomically defined shunts might less commonly exist that are potentially amenable to interventional therapy (Fig. 1).

### OPTN policy regarding prioritization of patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome: does it provide equitable organ allocation? [^20b739e2]. American Journal of Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

United Network for Organ Transplantation (UNOS) policy 3.6.4.5.1 provides exception points to patients diagnosed with hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) to compensate for their reported increased mortality risk. We compared pre- and posttransplant and overall outcomes in 255 patients receiving exception points under this policy (HPS policy patients) with 32 358 nonexception control patients listed in the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) era to determine whether the intent of the policy is being met. Overall, 92.5% of HPS policy patients versus 45.5% of controls had been transplanted, 5.1% versus 31.2% remained on waiting list and 1.5% versus 14.1% had died while awaiting transplant (p < 0.0001 for each comparison). Relative risk (RR) of death for HPS policy patients compared to controls was 0.158 (confidence interval [CI]: 0.059–0.420, p = 0.0002) pretransplant, and 0.827 (CI: 0.587–1.170, p = 0.28) posttransplant. Overall (combined waitlist and posttransplant) RR of death was 0.514 (CI: 0.374–0.707, p = 0.00004) compared with controls. After adjustment for laboratory MELD, overall RR was 0.807 (CI: 0.587–1.110, p = 0.19), indicating that HPS policy patients' mortality risk would be similar to that of controls had they been listed with their laboratory MELD score. HPS policy patients have a significant pretransplant survival advantage over standard liver transplant candidates because of the exception points awarded, and have similar posttransplant survival. Better criteria for diagnosing and grading of HPS are required.

### Hepatopulmonary syndrome in patients with cystic fibrosis and liver disease [^ab7dfe00]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a liver-induced lung disorder defined as a triad of liver disease, pulmonary vascular dilatation, and a defect in oxygenation. It can complicate chronic liver disease of any etiology, but is most commonly associated with portal hypertension. Severe liver disease with portal hypertension is present in 2% to 8% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), but to date, to our knowledge, only one patient with CF has been reported to suffer from HPS. Here, we describe two patients with CF diagnosed with HPS, one subsequent to unresolved hypoxemia and the other following screening for HPS performed in our center. We speculate that HPS is underdiagnosed in patients with CF because of their coexisting respiratory morbidity, and we advocate routine screening for every patient with CF who has liver disease and portal hypertension.

### Prevalence of hepatopulmonary syndrome in children… [^412438ef]. publications.aap.org (2008). Low credibility.

The hepatopulmonary syndrome is defined as a triad of liver disease, hypoxemia, and intrapulmonary vascular dilation. The reported prevalence of hepatopulmonary syndrome in adults with cirrhosis ranges from 4% to 29%; however, the prevalence of hepatopulmonary syndrome and its outcome in children is unknown. The objective of this study was to describe prospectively the prevalence of intrapulmonary vascular dilation and hepatopulmonary syndrome in children with liver disease. METHODS. Pulse oximetry was undertaken in children with liver disease, and those with oxygen saturation ≤ 97%, those with cirrhosis, and those with clinically severe portal hypertension from other causes underwent contrast-enhanced echocardiography for detection of intrapulmonary vascular dilations. Patients with intrapulmonary vascular dilation underwent arterial blood gas analysis and technetium-99m–labeled macroaggregated albumin scan. RESULTS.

Oxygen saturation was measured in 301 children and was ≤ 97% in 8. These 8 and an additional 18 patients with cirrhosis or portal hypertension underwent contrast-enhanced echocardiography. Seven patients had intrapulmonary vascular dilation detected by contrast-enhanced echocardiography; 2 of these patients had abnormal arterial blood gas analysis and thus met diagnostic criteria for hepatopulmonary syndrome. Both patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome had abnormal pulse oximetry. Technetium-99m–labeled macroaggregated albumin scans for 6 patients showed a median 6. 5% tracer uptake outside the lungs. CONCLUSIONS. Hepatopulmonary syndrome occurs in an important minority of children with cirrhosis or severe portal hypertension.

Additional studies should be undertaken to determine the importance of intrapulmonary vascular dilation without hepatopulmonary syndrome and the impact of hepatopulmonary syndrome on the outcomes of affected children. Comments.

### Pulmonary manifestations of chronic liver disease: a comprehensive review [^c16ee344]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) and porto-pulmonary hypertension (PoPH) represent relatively common pulmonary vascular complications of advanced liver disease. Despite distinct differences in their pathogenetic background, both clinical states are characterized by impaired arterial oxygenation and limited functional status, and are associated with increased pre-transplantation mortality. Accumulation of ascitic fluid in the pleural cavity, known as hepatic hydrothorax (HH), is another frequent manifestation of decompensated cirrhosis, which may cause severe respiratory dysfunction, depending on the volume of the effusion, the rapidity of its development and its resistance to therapeutic measures. Orthotopic liver transplantation constitutes the only effective treatment able to resolve the pulmonary complications of liver disease. A prioritization policy for liver transplantation has evolved over the past years regarding advanced stages of HPS, yielding favorable outcomes regarding post-transplantation survival and HPS resolution. In contrast, severe PoPH is associated with poor post-transplantation survival. Hence, liver transplantation is recommended only for patients with PoPH and an acceptable reduction in pulmonary pressure values, after receiving PoPH-targeted vasodilating therapy. This review focuses on basic pathogenetic and diagnostic principles and discusses the current therapeutic approaches regarding HPS, PoPH, and HH.

### Hepatopulmonary syndrome, another face of dysregulated BMP9 signaling [^bfa90e75]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a serious complication of cirrhosis characterized by intrapulmonary vascular dilatation (IPVD), severe hypoxemia, and elevated alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient (A-aO 2). Portopulmonary hypertension (PoPH) is another pulmonary vascular complication of liver disease defined by pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) caused by the presence of portal hypertension. Although both HPS and PoPH stem from abnormal hepatic production or clearance of vasoactive or angiogenic molecules, it remains unclear what factors drive or predict the development of either syndrome. One potential factor, BMP9, a circulating ligand of TGF-β superfamily produced by the liver, is believed to function as an endothelial homeostatic factor. BMP9 is known to be reduced in patients with PoPH as well as in those with HPS, and it predicts survival in World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension group 1 PAH. In this context, the mechanistic role of BMP9 in the development of HPS and PoPH warrants further investigation.

In a study reported in this issue of the Journal, Robert and colleagues (pp.) evaluated the concept that BMP9 deficiency contributes to the development of HPS. They examined BMP9 as a potential biomarker of pulmonary vascular disease in a cohort of patients with cirrhosis, including those with HPS, PoPH, or both. Similar to previous findings, the authors found decreased circulating serum BMP9 concentrations in proportion to the severity of cirrhosis (Child–Pugh stage, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score). In patients with compensated or mild cirrhosis, BMP9 concentrations were lower among those with HPS than those without any pulmonary vascular disease. BMP9 concentrations were equally low in patients with HPS or combined HPS and PoPH, which in turn were lower than those with isolated PoPH, whose BMP9 concentrations were not different from those of patients with cirrhosis without pulmonary vascular disease. In contrast to previous cohorts in which BMP9 concentrations discriminated the presence of PoPH equally or better than HPS, BMP9 concentrations appeared to be more sensitive for detecting HPS than isolated PoPH.

### The complex interrelationships between chronic lung and liver disease: a review [^ce3bdb47]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Lung complications may occur as a result of hepatic disease from any cause and represent a highly heterogeneous group of conditions. Early recognition of such complications may be challenging but is crucial both in forming a meaningful differential diagnosis and in avoiding severe sequelae and irreversible damage. Although a number of different pathogenetic mechanisms are likely to be involved, chronic liver dysfunction may cause pulmonary manifestations because of alterations in the production or clearance of circulating cytokines and other mediators. This is likely to be the case in hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension and primary biliary cirrhosis, although their pathogenesis remains largely speculative. Moreover, the severity of lung manifestations may or may not correspond to that of liver impairment, making disease outcome often unpredictable. Congenital and inflammatory disorders, however, may primarily affect both the liver and lung. Apart from specific diseases, a number of medications can also result in pulmonary and hepatic toxic effects. This is particularly important with cytokine therapy - used to treat viral hepatitis, among other diseases - because treatment consists of drug discontinuation, which, in turn, may cause reactivation or progression of the underlying disease that the drug was used for. This review summarizes salient diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of these often misdiagnosed conditions and highlights, based on the most recent literature, the need for early referral of such patients to centres with specific expertise in the field. In fact, a multidisciplinary approach involving pulmonologists, hepatologists and, in particularly severe cases, transplant surgeons has been already proven successful.

### Portopulmonary hypertension: a tale of two circulations [^f8724945]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Pulmonary involvement is common in patients with portal hypertension and can manifest in diverse manners. Changes in pulmonary arterial resistance, manifesting either as the hepatopulmonary syndrome or portopulmonary hypertension (PPHTN), have been increasingly recognized in these patients in recent years. This review summarizes the clinicopathologic features, diagnostic criteria, as well as the latest concepts in the pathogenesis and management of PPHTN, which is defined as an elevated pulmonary artery pressure in the setting of an increased pulmonary vascular resistance and a normal wedge pressure in a patient with portal hypertension.

### Respiratory dysfunction and pulmonary disease in cirrhosis and other hepatic disorders [^2ef109c5]. Respiratory Care (2007). Low credibility.

End-stage liver disease and its complications are a leading cause of death among adults in the United States, and thousands of patients await liver transplantation. The liver plays a central role in health and homeostasis and thus the diseased liver leads to many deleterious effects on multiple organ systems, including the pulmonary system. We review the general effects of cirrhosis on the respiratory system, including mild hypoxemia, atelectasis, and hepatic hydrothorax. Cirrhosis is associated with 2 unique entities that affect the pulmonary vasculature: hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension. Hepatopulmonary syndrome, which is found in approximately 20% of patients awaiting liver transplantation, refers to the triad of hepatic dysfunction, hypoxemia, and intrapulmonary vascular dilations, and responds well to liver transplantation. In portopulmonary hypertension, cirrhosis and portal hypertension lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension, and portopulmonary hypertension has been considered a contraindication for transplantation. Currently, patients must have mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension to be considered for transplantation, and may still require long-term therapy with vasodilators to prevent right-ventricular failure and, consequently, failure of the newly transplanted liver allograft.

### Prognostic significance of the hepatopulmonary syndrome in patients with cirrhosis [^6e9e69e7]. Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

The hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) has been defined by chronic liver disease, arterial deoxygenation, and widespread intrapulmonary vasodilation. Mortality of patients with HPS is considered to be high, but the effect of HPS on survival in patients with cirrhosis remains unclear.

Methods

A total of 111 patients with cirrhosis were studied prospectively by using transthoracic contrast echocardiography for detection of pulmonary vasodilation, blood gas analysis, and pulmonary function test. Twenty different clinical characteristics and survival times were noted.

Results

Twenty-seven patients (24%) had HPS. Their mortality was significantly higher (median survival, 10.6 months) compared with patients without HPS (40.8 mo, P < 0.05), even after adjusting for liver disease severity (2.9 vs. 14.7 months in Child-Pugh class C with [n = 15] and without HPS [n = 35, P < 0.05]; 35.3 vs. 44.5 months in Child-Pugh class B with [n = 7] and without HPS [n = 23, P = NS]), and exclusion of patients who underwent liver transplantation during follow-up (median survival 4.8 vs. 35.2 months, P = 0.005). Causes of death were mainly nonpulmonary and liver-related in the 19 patients with and the 35 patients without HPS who died. In multivariate analysis, HPS was an independent predictor of survival besides age, Child-Pugh class, and blood urea nitrogen. Mortality correlates with severity of HPS.

Conclusions

The presence of HPS independently worsens prognosis of patients with cirrhosis. This should influence patient management and scoring systems and accelerate the evaluation process for liver transplantation.

### Hepatopulmonary syndrome: favorable outcomes in the MELD exception era [^b6173399]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a pulmonary vascular disorder occurring as a consequence of advanced liver disease, characterized by hypoxemia due to intrapulmonary vascular dilatations. HPS independently increases mortality, regardless of the cause or severity of liver disease. Liver transplantation (LT) improves survival in HPS. We present the largest consecutive series of HPS patients specifically addressing long-term survival relative to the degree of hypoxemia and the era in which LT was conducted. We evaluated 106 HPS patients at the Mayo Clinic from 1986 through 2010. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier methodology. LT was accomplished in 49 HPS patients. Post-LT survival (1, 3, 5, and 10 years) did not differ between groups based on baseline partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) obtained at the time of HPS diagnosis. Improvements in overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years post-LT in those HPS patients transplanted after January 1 2002 (n = 28) (92%, 88%, and 88%, respectively) as compared with those transplanted prior to that time (n = 21) (71%, 67%, and 67%, respectively) did not reach statistical significance (5-year P = 0.09). Model for Endstage Liver Disease (MELD) exception to facilitate LT was granted to 21 patients since January 1 2002 with post-LT survival of 19/21 patients and one wait-list death.

Conclusion

Long-term outcome after LT in HPS is favorable, with a trend towards improved survival in the MELD exception era since 2002 as compared to earlier HPS transplants. Survival after LT was not associated with PaO2 levels at the time of HPS diagnosis. (HEPATOLOGY 2012).

### Model for end-stage liver disease / pediatric end-stage liver disease exception policy and outcomes in pediatric patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome requiring liver transplantation [^a6f74d08]. Liver Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is associated with increased waitlist mortality in liver transplantation (LT) candidates. Children with HPS are granted Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)/Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) exception points for waitlist prioritization in the United States based on criterion developed for adults. In this study, the impact of this MELD/PELD exception policy on post-LT survival in children was examined. A retrospective cohort of patients aged younger than 18 years with a MELD/PELD exception request who underwent LT between 2007 and 2018 were identified in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Patients were stratified by waitlist partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2) to assess risk factors for waitlist mortality and post-LT survival. Among 3082 pediatric LT recipients included in the study, 124 patients (4%) received MELD/PELD exception points for HPS. Patients with HPS were a median age of 9 years (interquartile range: 6, 12 years), 54.8% were girls, and 54% were White. Most patients (87.9%) were listed with laboratory MELD/PELD scores < 15. Waitlist mortality for patients with HPS exception points was rare and not different from patients without HPS. When stratified by pre-LT PaO 2, hypoxemia severity was not associated with differences in 1-, 3-, or 5-year survival rates after LT (p = 0.13). However, patients with HPS showed a slightly lower survival rate at 5 years compared with patients without HPS (88.7% vs. 93.4%; p = 0.04). MELD/PELD exceptions for children with HPS mitigated waitlist mortality, and recipients with HPS experienced excellent 5-year survival after LT, although slightly lower than in patients without HPS. Unlike adults with HPS, the severity of pre-LT hypoxemia in children does not impact post-LT survival. These data suggest that adult criteria for granting MELD/PELD exception points may not appropriately capture HPS severity in pediatric patients. Further prospective multicenter studies to examine the risk factors predicting negative survival outcomes in children with HPS are warranted.

### Efficacy and safety of pentoxifylline in improving… [^e4692b87]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Efficacy and Safety of Pentoxifylline in Improving Oxygenation in Hepatopulmonary SyndromeClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The triad of liver disease, arterial hypoxia, and extensive pulmonary vascular dilatation is known as the hepatopulmonary syndrome. The prevalence of this syndrome ranges from 10% to 30% in people with chronic liver disease. The exact cause of HPS is unknown. Previous research has shown that eicosanoids function as vasoconstrictors and cause an increase in the number of intravascular macrophage-like cells. Cirrhosis has been linked to increased NO generation in the lungs, which has been linked to intrapulmonary venous dilation. Increased pulmonary NO production is attributed to increased expression of pulmonary vascular endothelial NO synthase and inducible NO synthase. Increased hepatic synthesis and release of low levels of endothelin 1 has been established in recent investigations to function as a trigger for increasing eNO levels.

TNF and ET-1 have both been linked to the onset of experimental HPS. Increased CO generation and heme oxygenase expression have been linked to the progression of HPS in recent investigations. HPS increases mortality in cirrhotic patients and may affect the frequency and severity of portal hypertension consequences. To the best of our knowledge there have been only three pilot studies in humans which checked the effect of pentoxifylline in hepatopulmonary syndrome and they showed highly contrasting results. The outcome was also measured in a short interval. Investigator hypothesize that pentoxifylline would improve the oxygenation in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome.

DEFINITION
- Hepatopulmonary syndrome will be defined by
- Presence of liver disease and / or portal hypertension AND
- Partial pressure of oxygen < 80mm Hg or Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient [P O2 gradient ≥ 15mmHg
- Active bacterial infections, active hepatic encephalopathy
- Known malignancy including HCC.

### Transient hepatopulmonary syndrome in a patient with acute hepatitis a… [^787c7352]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2001). Low credibility.

The hepatopulmonary syndrome is defined as the triad of liver disease, hypoxaemia and intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. This syndrome has been described in patients with liver cirrhosis, noncirrhotic portal hypertension, and fulminant hepatic failure, however, there are no previous descriptions of hepatopulmonary syndrome in patients with acute nonfulminant viral hepatitis. We report a 47-year-old, previously healthy man that presented with acute hepatitis A, and developed progressive dyspnoea, platypnoea and orthodeoxia with no evidence of parenchymal or thromboembolic lung disease. PaO2 on room air was 58 mmHg, O2 saturation was 88% and alveolar-arterial O2 gradient was 62%. During his hospitalization serum albumin level decreased to 3.1 g/dl and prothrombin time was prolonged to 16.8 s, however, he remained alert with no signs of hepatic encephalopathy. Contrast echocardiography revealed left heart chamber opacification 3–4 cardiac cycles after the opacification of the right heart chamber, consistent with hepatopulmonary syndrome. During the following days there was a gradual improvement in the patient's condition, with resolution of his dyspnoea and gradual increase of PaO2. Repeat contrast echocardiography and PaO2 determinations, 3 weeks later, were normal. On long-term follow-up the patient remained asymptomatic with normal liver function tests and normal O2 saturation. This report indicates that hepatopulmonary syndrome may be a transient manifestation of acute hepatitis A in the absence of fulminant liver failure.

### Prevalence of hepatopulmonary syndrome in children [^c17aa979]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The hepatopulmonary syndrome is defined as a triad of liver disease, hypoxemia, and intrapulmonary vascular dilation. The reported prevalence of hepatopulmonary syndrome in adults with cirrhosis ranges from 4% to 29%; however, the prevalence of hepatopulmonary syndrome and its outcome in children is unknown. The objective of this study was to describe prospectively the prevalence of intrapulmonary vascular dilation and hepatopulmonary syndrome in children with liver disease.

Methods

Pulse oximetry was undertaken in children with liver disease, and those with oxygen saturation ≤ 97%, those with cirrhosis, and those with clinically severe portal hypertension from other causes underwent contrast-enhanced echocardiography for detection of intrapulmonary vascular dilations. Patients with intrapulmonary vascular dilation underwent arterial blood gas analysis and technetium-99m-labeled macroaggregated albumin scan.

Results

Oxygen saturation was measured in 301 children and was ≤ 97% in 8. These 8 and an additional 18 patients with cirrhosis or portal hypertension underwent contrast-enhanced echocardiography. Seven (27%) patients had intrapulmonary vascular dilation detected by contrast-enhanced echocardiography; 2 of these patients had abnormal arterial blood gas analysis and thus met diagnostic criteria for hepatopulmonary syndrome (representing 8% of patients with cirrhosis or severe portal hypertension). Both patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome had abnormal pulse oximetry. Technetium-99m-labeled macroaggregated albumin scans for 6 patients showed a median 6.5% (range: 4%-12%) tracer uptake outside the lungs.

Conclusions

Hepatopulmonary syndrome occurs in an important minority of children with cirrhosis or severe portal hypertension. Additional studies should be undertaken to determine the importance of intrapulmonary vascular dilation without hepatopulmonary syndrome and the impact of hepatopulmonary syndrome on the outcomes of affected children.

### Hepatopulmonary syndrome: prevalence and predictive value of various cut offs for arterial oxygenation and their clinical consequences [^b4521e96]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is defined as the triad of liver disease, arterial deoxygenation, and pulmonary vascular dilatation. The reported prevalence of HPS in cirrhotic patients varies between 4% and 19%, and various threshold values defining arterial deoxygenation have been used and recommended previously. However, it is not known how the prevalence of HPS differs using different cut off values for arterial deoxygenation.

Methods

We studied 127 patients for the presence of HPS using transthoracic contrast echocardiography for detection of pulmonary vasodilation, pulmonary function tests, and blood gas analysis.

Results

Ninety eight patients were included in the study, of whom 33 (34%) had a positive contrast echocardiography. Using an increased alveolar-arterial difference for the partial pressure of oxygen (AaDO(2)) as an indication of hypoxaemia, the prevalence of HPS was considerably higher (> 15 mm Hg, 32%; > 20 mm Hg, 31%; and > age related threshold, 28%) than using reduced partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO(2)) as a threshold (< 80 mm Hg, 19%; < 70 mm Hg, 15%; and < age related threshold, 15%). For AaDO(2) as the cut off, the positive predictive value for a diagnosis of HPS was low (34%, 37%, and 53%, respectively). In contrast, PaO(2) as a cut off had considerably higher positive predictive values (44%, 93%, and 94%, respectively). Introducing PaO(2) < 65 mm Hg as the cut off, the positive predictive value increased to 100%. Dyspnoea was more often present in patients with "clinically significant" HPS (57%) compared with "subclinical HPS" (8%), and patients without HPS (6%). The Child-Pugh score correlated significantly with the severity of HPS. Two of five liver transplanted patients with "subclinical HPS" had embolic brain infarcts, possibly induced by venous emboli passing through dilated intrapulmonary vessels.

Conclusions

Defining arterial hypoxaemia in HPS by different, previously used, cut off values for arterial oxygenation leads to a wide variation in the prevalence of HPS in the same sample of cirrhotic patients.

### Evidence for an association between intrahepatic vascular changes and the development of hepatopulmonary syndrome [^dea34eee]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is characterized by an arterial oxygenation defect, defined by an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, induced by pulmonary vascular dilatations in the context of liver disease. The pathogenesis of HPS is poorly understood. Morphologic changes associated with HPS are unknown. This study aimed at describing imaging and pathology changes associated with HPS.

Methods

We performed a case-control study in candidates for transplant with suspicion of cirrhosis. Each patient with HPS (Pao 2 ≤ 70 mm Hg) was matched to three control subjects for age, cause, and liver disease severity. Pretransplant thoracic and abdominal imaging and explanted livers were reviewed.

Results

CT scans and Doppler ultrasounds from 21 patients with HPS were compared with those from 63 control subjects. HPS was associated with a two- to threefold higher prevalence of obstructed intrahepatic portal branches, of slowed or hepatofugal portal blood flow, and of large abdominal portosystemic shunts. Hepatic artery diameter was also larger in patients with HPS. Explanted livers from 19 patients with HPS were compared with those from 57 control subjects. HPS was associated with a fourfold higher prevalence of portal venule thrombosis and a ninefold higher prevalence of extensive vascular proliferation within fibrous septa. Obstruction of centrilobular venules, sinusoidal dilatation, and liver parenchymal extinction were also more common in patients with HPS.

Conclusions

HPS is associated with intrahepatic vascular changes and with features suggesting severe portal hypertension. These results raise the hypothesis that intrahepatic vascular changes precipitate the development of HPS, opening new therapeutic perspectives for HPS.

### Coil embolization of pulmonary arteries as a palliative treatment of diffuse type I hepatopulmonary syndrome [^98c97457]. Respiratory Care (2015). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome is a serious complication of liver disease. Type I hepatopulmonary syndrome is associated with diffuse dilatation of the pulmonary vasculature, leading to severe hypoxemia. Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for this condition. There are limited options for those who are not candidates for liver transplantation. We present the case of a patient who presented with severe hypoxemia requiring FIO2 of 0.95 with PaO2 of 59 mm Hg. Workup revealed 33% intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt. A pulmonary angiogram showed diffuse dilatation of the pulmonary arteries, especially in the lower lobes. The patient was diagnosed with type I hepatopulmonary syndrome. He was not a candidate for liver transplantation. The patient underwent sequential coil embolizations of the lower lobe pulmonary arteries. He was discharged home on 2 L of supplemental oxygen. This case demonstrates that coil embolization of dilated pulmonary arteries is a potential palliative treatment for patients with diffuse type I hepatopulmonary syndrome.

Regarding surgical interventions for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to liver transplantation, ILTS 2016 guidelines recommend to use standard MELD exception scores if PaO2 is < 60 mmHg due to hepatopulmonary syndrome. Consider using increased MELD exception scores (higher MELD points) if PaO2 is < 50 mmHg.

### Pulmonary complications in liver disease [^41b041ed]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic liver disease and impaired hepatic function are important risk factors for increased incidence of, and mortality from, acute pulmonary complications including manifest acute respiratory distress syndrome in approximately 8% of cirrhotics admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). While micro-aspiration associated with encephalopathy and hydropic decompensation are well-known triggers for pulmonary complications, the more specific consequences of end-stage liver disease on the pulmonary microcirculation, such as hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) and portopulmonary hypertension (PoPH), result from either production of or failure to clear a broad range of inflammatory, vasoactive or proliferative/angiogenic mediators. The impact of an altered bile acid pattern induces a shift in the gut microbiome that sheds new light on the molecular basis of the long acknowledged 'gut–liver–lung axis' as the "motor of multiple organ failure".

### Improved survival after liver transplantation in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome [^2450ba6f]. American Journal of Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is present in 10–32% of chronic liver disease patients, carries a poor prognosis and is treatable by liver transplantation (LT). Previous reports have shown high LT mortality in HPS and severe HPS (arterial oxygen (PaO(2)) ≤ 50 mmHg). We reviewed outcomes in HPS patients who received LT between 2002 and 2008 at two transplant centers supported by a dedicated HPS clinic. We assessed mortality, complications and gas exchange in 21 HPS patients (mean age 51 years, MELD score 14), including 11/21 (52%) with severe HPS and 5/21 (24%) with living donor LT (median follow-up 20.2 months after LT). Overall mortality was 1/21 (5%); mortality in severe HPS was 1/11 (9%). Peritransplant hypoxemic respiratory failure occurred in 5/21 (24%), biliary complications in 8/21 (38%) and bleeding or vascular complications in 6/21 (29%). Oxygenation improved in all 19 patients in whom PaO(2) or SaO(2) were recorded. PaO(2) increased from 52.2 ± 13.2 to 90.3 ± 11.5 mmHg (room air) (p < 0.0001) (12 patients); a higher baseline macroaggregated albumin shunt fraction predicted a lower rate of postoperative improvement (p = 0.045) (7 patients). Liver transplant survival in HPS and severe HPS was higher than previously demonstrated. Severity of HPS should not be the basis for transplant refusal.

Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) — definition, prevalence, diagnostic confirmation, and severity: Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a condition in which intrapulmonary vascular dilations (IPVD) develop in the setting of portal systemic shunting and is present in 4 to 29% chronic liver disease patients of all ages. The diagnosis of HPS in children is confirmed by the presence of hypoxia and one of the following demonstrating the presence of IPVD: contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography; technetium-labeled macro-aggregated albumin lung perfusion scan demonstrating a shunt fraction of > 6%; or cardiac catheterization demonstrating IPVD. Severe shunting of > 20%, as determined by macro-aggregated albumin scan, is associated with increased posttransplantation morbidity and mortality in adults, and in adults with severe HPS (paO2 < 50 mmHg) the median survival in the absence of LT is less than 12 months. Patients with HPS may benefit from supplemental oxygen during periods of increased physical activity, LT is appropriate for the treatment of HPS in children with cirrhotic liver disease and may be appropriate in some noncirrhotic patients with HPS, and alternative nontransplant approaches can include ligation of the shunt or endovascular occlusion by an interventional radiologist.

### Hepatopulmonary syndrome increases the postoperative mortality rate following liver transplantation: a prospective study in 90 patients [^d51a85d7]. American Journal of Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a frequent pulmonary complication of patients with end-stage liver diseases. HPS is diagnosed by hypoxemia and pulmonary vascular dilatation and is an independent risk factor of mortality. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the only factor that modifies the natural course of HPS. Once patients with HPS have been transplanted, their long-term survival rate is similar to transplanted patients without HPS. Consequently, HPS is an indication of OLT whatever the severity of hypoxemia. However, besides the favorable long-term survival of HPS patients with OLT, a high postoperative mortality (mostly within 6 months) has been suggested. The aim of our study was to analyze the incidence of HPS and postoperative outcome after OLT in 90 consecutive patients. All patients were prospectively included and had blood gas analysis to detect HPS. Patients with hypoxemia had contrast echocardiography to confirm HPS. Nine patients had HPS with a 50 ≤ PaO(2) ≤ 70 mmHg. Among them 3 (33%) died while the mortality rate was 9.2% in the group without HPS (7 over 76 patients). In the HPS patients who survived, the syndrome completely recovered within 6 months. In conclusion, our study shows a high postoperative mortality rate following OLT even though the preoperative PaO(2) was > 50 mmHg in all HPS patients transplanted.

### Hepatic BMAL1 and HIF1 α regulate a time-dependent hypoxic response and prevent hepatopulmonary-like syndrome [^72b622cb]. Cell Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The transcriptional response to hypoxia is temporally regulated, yet the molecular underpinnings and physiological implications are unknown. We examined the roles of hepatic Bmal1 and Hif1α in the circadian response to hypoxia in mice. We found that the majority of the transcriptional response to hypoxia is dependent on either Bmal1 or Hif1α, through shared and distinct roles that are daytime determined. We further show that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1α accumulation upon hypoxia is temporally regulated and Bmal1 dependent. Unexpectedly, mice lacking both hepatic Bmal1 and Hif1α are hypoxemic and exhibit increased mortality upon hypoxic exposure in a daytime-dependent manner. These mice display mild liver dysfunction with pulmonary vasodilation likely due to extracellular signaling regulated kinase (ERK) activation, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and nitric oxide accumulation in lungs, suggestive of hepatopulmonary syndrome. Our findings indicate that hepatic BMAL1 and HIF1α are key time-dependent regulators of the hypoxic response and can provide molecular insights into the pathophysiology of hepatopulmonary syndrome.

### Hepatopulmonary syndrome in HIV-hepatitis C virus coinfection: a case report and review of the literature [^19e551c2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

A wide array of diagnoses must be considered when a patient with advanced liver disease and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection presents with hypoxemia. It is important to entertain the possibility of hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) in such patients, a diagnosis that must be confirmed with a contrast-enhanced echocardiogram (bubble study). We describe a case of HPS diagnosed in a patient with HIV infection and chronic liver disease and review the literature on HPS.
