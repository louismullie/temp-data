## Question

how do is say at this time there is nothing for us to do only monitor

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to communicate that no immediate intervention is indicated and that the plan is to monitor, while preserving clarity, empathy, and appropriate uncertainty framing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why observation is the right choice. Then, I should verify the rationale and evidence supporting watchful waiting. Next, I will translate that into patient-centered language that acknowledges uncertainty. After that, I need to define the monitoring plan, triggers for action, and logistics. Finally, I should confirm shared understanding and document the plan, aligning with communication best practices and guideline-based principles for uncertainty and follow-up [^1167ZTcw] [^116P9x9t].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the reason for monitoring rather than intervening now, because I need to ensure the decision is justified by the current data and trajectory of the condition. In many scenarios, such as early disease stages, stable chronic conditions, or post-procedural observation, watchful waiting is appropriate when the risk of immediate intervention outweighs potential benefit, and when reliable monitoring can detect change early enough to act, as reflected in disease-specific guidance emphasizing trend-based assessment and timely surveillance rather than premature treatment [^114XTECb] [^111XL8Yu] [^113qkZg9].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence-based rationale I will present, because I should anchor the explanation in standards of care and avoid overpromising certainty. For example, in CKD-MBD, decisions are explicitly recommended to be based on trends rather than single values, reinforcing the principle that serial monitoring guides safer, more effective action than isolated data points, and in diabetes care, HbA1c monitoring intervals and CGM use are tailored to stability and risk, illustrating how structured surveillance supports timely intervention when indicated [^114XTECb] [^116HpCEq] [^112xCL1z].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about how to phrase this; I need to translate the clinical reasoning into clear, patient-centered language that acknowledges uncertainty without sounding evasive. A careful way to say this is: "Based on your current results and how you are doing today, there is no immediate treatment we need to start right now. The best next step is to monitor closely so we can catch any change early and act promptly if needed", which aligns with guidance to communicate uncertainty transparently while maintaining confidence in the plan and the rationale for observation [^1167ZTcw] [^117TY3Cs].

> I should double-check that I am not implying inaction; instead, I will specify what "monitoring" means in practical terms, because patients often equate "wait and see" with "do nothing". I will outline the exact parameters we will follow, the cadence of check-ins, and the thresholds that would prompt a change in plan, mirroring structured approaches such as time-limited trials that are individualized, iterative, and oriented to patient goals, and device-based monitoring frameworks that define responsibilities, alert response, and documentation [^116P9x9t] [^115uEtZo] [^111odERD].

> Let me consider concrete examples to make this actionable, and I will verify that the monitoring cadence matches guideline-based intervals where applicable. For instance, if following glycemic control in diabetes, I might say we will recheck HbA1c in 3–6 months and review CGM data more frequently if used, consistent with ADA guidance on periodic assessment and continuous glucose monitoring, and if following blood pressure, I would recommend home BP monitoring over at least 7 days before the next visit to better characterize control, per USPSTF implementation guidance [^116HpCEq] [^113w3D7j].

> Next, I should review how to communicate uncertainty and the possibility of change over time, because patients deserve a realistic preview of decision points. I will explain that our plan is dynamic and that if new symptoms arise, if test results change, or if the risk-benefit balance shifts, we will revisit and adjust, using language that frames uncertainty constructively and supports shared decision-making rather than false reassurance [^1167ZTcw] [^112AUhAc].

> I need to ensure the patient understands and agrees with the plan, so I will ask for a teach-back and document the shared understanding, including who is responsible for what and how to reach us if concerns arise. This mirrors consensus statements emphasizing clear documentation, defined roles, and reliable communication pathways in remote and device-based monitoring, and it operationalizes the collaborative spirit of time-limited frameworks even when no immediate endpoint is fixed [^111odERD] [^115ZiY5u] [^116P9x9t].

> But wait, what if the patient interprets "monitoring" as neglect or lack of concern; I should anticipate that emotional response and address it explicitly. I can reassure that observation is an active, evidence-based strategy with predefined triggers for action, and I can reference how structured monitoring improves safety and timeliness of care in other contexts, such as inpatient CGM for high hypoglycemia risk and arrhythmia monitoring after stroke, underscoring that surveillance is a form of intervention when used thoughtfully [^116fYx7i] [^113qkZg9] [^1174tvXG].

> Finally, I will document the rationale, the monitoring plan, and the decision to defer intervention in the medical record, noting the evidence base and the agreed-upon follow-up cadence, because clear documentation supports continuity, quality, and defensibility of care decisions, consistent with device monitoring guidance and general principles of clinical communication and follow-up [^111odERD] [^115ZiY5u].

---

At this time, there is **no active intervention** indicated; we will continue to monitor closely and reassess if the patient's condition changes or new information becomes available [^1167ZTcw]. This approach aligns with best practice for **watchful waiting** and ensures patient safety through vigilant observation and timely follow-up [^1167ZTcw].

---

## Clinical rationale for monitoring

Monitoring is appropriate when the patient's condition is **stable**, the risk of intervention outweighs the benefits, or the diagnosis remains uncertain. This strategy allows clinicians to detect changes early and intervene promptly if needed [^114Nm2xN].

---

## Evidence supporting monitoring

Multiple guidelines endorse monitoring in specific clinical scenarios, including:

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Regular monitoring of glycemic status and renal function is recommended, with individualized frequency based on clinical stability and risk factors [^116HpCEq] [^111XL8Yu].

- **Hypertension**: Home blood pressure monitoring is recommended to assess control and guide therapy adjustments [^112xCL1z].

- **Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs)**: Remote monitoring is recommended to detect arrhythmias and device malfunctions early, enabling timely intervention [^115ZiY5u].

---

## Risks and benefits of monitoring

### Benefits

- **Early detection**: Allows prompt intervention if the patient's condition deteriorates [^113qkZg9].

- **Avoids unnecessary interventions**: Prevents overtreatment and potential harm from unwarranted procedures or medications [^117FGpzF].

- **Patient-centered care**: Engages patients in shared decision-making and self-management [^114ng1Mu].

---

### Risks

- **Delayed intervention**: Potential for missed opportunities if the patient's condition worsens unexpectedly [^113c5xaL].

- **Patient anxiety**: Uncertainty may cause stress or anxiety, requiring clear communication and support [^1167ZTcw].

- **Resource utilization**: Requires follow-up appointments and monitoring resources [^111odERD].

---

## Communication with patients and families

Clear communication is essential when adopting a monitoring approach. Clinicians should explain:

- **Rationale**: Why monitoring is the best course of action at this time [^113nER6M].

- **Plan**: Specific monitoring parameters, frequency, and follow-up schedule [^111odERD].

- **Red flags**: Symptoms or changes that should prompt immediate contact or escalation of care [^113c5xaL].

---

## Documentation and follow-up

Thorough documentation of the rationale, monitoring plan, and patient education is essential. Regular follow-up ensures timely reassessment and adjustment of the care plan as needed [^111odERD].

---

## Conclusion

At this time, there is **no active intervention** indicated; we will continue to monitor closely and reassess if the patient's condition changes or new information becomes available. This approach aligns with best practice for **watchful waiting** and ensures patient safety through vigilant observation and timely follow-up [^1167ZTcw].

Monitoring represents a seminal part of modern anesthesia but it is imperative that clinicians and health care staff understand the fundamentals of measurements to correctly understand, apply, and at times discard various monitoring options. The world of measurements is a very precise science that needs to be fully acknowledged. This communication aims at highlighting certain issues relevant to everyday clinical monitoring.

Real-time monitoring of outcomes is becoming increasingly feasible in health care, and with it the hope of early detection of problems and the ability to tell whether interventions are having their desired effect. The next step should be to try to demonstrate that the reports of such monitoring systems lead to reasonable responses and valid inferences about causality, and that we are not chasing red herrings.

### Diabetes therapy podcast: real-world data for glucose sensing technologies in type 1 diabetes [^111YQxWP]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

The Evidence Base From Randomized Controlled Trials

N.O.: Yes, absolutely. As you say, making the choice about which technology is most appropriate in a clinical scenario is really important, and that choice should be an informed choice between the clinician and the person who is going to be using the device. So if we think about those three categories, I will park blinded GCM because it is really not frequently used as I said in clinical practice, so there is not a great evidence base for that recently. But if we think about real-time continuous glucose monitoring, there is a fantastic evidence base, particularly over the last 10 years or so, which tells us that RT-CGM can significantly reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in young people, older adults, and adults living with T1D, and importantly RT-CGM can do that irrespective of whether you use an insulin pump or a multiple dose injection regimen. Along with the reduced HbA1C, real-time monitoring reduces exposure to hypoglycemia at all thresholds. The International Hypoglycemia Study Group suggested that everyone should use a threshold of less than 3.0 mmol/L or 54 mg/dL as the threshold for important hypoglycemia, and CGM certainly reduces exposure to all thresholds including that one. And really importantly, for people at highest risk of severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of a third party for active treatment, RT-CGM can reduce the incidence of those severe episodes, and that is really important because they can be incredibly disabling and they are associated with morbidity and mortality. CGM also reduces glucose variability, and these changes to glucose, these improvements to overall glucose and glucose below target happen during the day and during the night. The concept study showed that RT-CGM used by pregnant women living with T1D can reduce adverse maternal–fetal outcomes, and that included neonatal intensive care admissions for the newborn, neonatal hypoglycemia, and the length of stay for the baby. In terms of how people live with T1D and the psychosocial outcomes or the patient-reported outcomes, RT-CGM can reduce hypoglycemia fear, and in particular the worry aspect of the hypoglycemia fear score and can increase treatment satisfaction. Flash glucose monitoring has a slightly smaller evidence base, but can reduce exposure to hypoglycemia below 3.9 mmol/L or 70 mg/dL, again can increase treatment satisfaction, and until recently, flash glucose monitoring did not have an evidence base for a reduction in HbA1c compared with self-monitoring blood glucose. The IMPACT Study, which was the main RCT in T1D, did not show a change in HbA1c, but the FLASH-UK study, which has just been published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that the FreeStyle Libre 2 device, which is an intermittently scanned CGM device with qualitative alarms, can reduce HbA1c compared with self-monitored blood glucose. As I said at the start, it is really important to be able to make an informed choice about which monitoring technology is most appropriate, and there are three studies that have pitched both flash glucose monitoring and RT-GCM in a head-to-head study. One of these, the I HART CGM study, did that in very high-risk people, so people with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia or previous severe hypoglycemia, and then there was the CORRIDA study and the ALERTT1 study, which were larger and less selective populations and really interestingly, all three showed exactly the same thing, which is that RT-CGM had a significantly greater beneficial impact on glucose outcomes than flash glucose monitoring, so it is really down to informed choice, personal preference, and what you are trying to achieve with your CGM technology.

### Diabetes podcast: Do It yourself / open Source artificial pancreas systems: part 1 [^1155p3Mx]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

DL: I am doing well. Thank you so much for having me on the podcast.

SH: Great! It's really super exciting for us to have you and learn about the DIY/APS movement. Before we do that, please tell us a bit about yourself.

DL: I was actually diagnosed with T1D at the age of 14 and have now lived with it for many years and have seen the evolution of technologies from a finger stick and multiple daily injections to using an insulin pump, using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and now using what we call closed loop therapy. I am an American, I live in the United States and I come from a communications background, but I have spent more and more of my time in the last couple of years researching and working on the side in the diabetes space.

SH: So DIY? How did you start this?

DL: So DIY stands for 'Do it yourself', which is actually what diabetes is. Diabetes is so self-managed by people with diabetes; we do 99% of everything on our own. So when people ask me about DIY, they are usually asking about DIY diabetes technology; and my journey in that space started when I was frustrated with not being able to hear my continuous blood glucose monitor alarm and wanted to find a way to make a louder alarm. I was not satisfied with the response from the companies saying that I was the only one with this problem or it would be out in a couple of years in the next version. I was able to spot a solution that somebody else created.

### Is It time to say goodbye to sputum? [^112viVxj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A further strength of this paper is the inclusion of a subset of patients with longitudinal samples collected while the patients were on treatment. The data presented show that most individuals had a drop in MAC cell-free DNA while on treatment, meaning this assay could represent an easy, quick, noninvasive means of monitoring response to treatment. However, the numbers presented are small, and, as the authors themselves note in their discussion, larger prospective studies with an extended follow-up time are needed to fully explore this correlation.

So, should we be jettisoning our reliance on sputum? I am afraid the answer is not yet. Overall, the number of cases included in the study is quite small, and the results need to be validated in a prospective cohort. Also, although the assay shows the potential to radically improve time to diagnosis, and may lead to similar improvements in monitoring of treatment, there is one major issue that it does not address: drug susceptibility testing. Current guidelines recommend susceptibility-based treatment for macrolides and amikacin, not least because of a clear correlation between outcome and macrolide susceptibility. Initiation of treatment will therefore still need to be preceded by traditional susceptibility testing, which will require results from at least one sputum culture or lavage. This does not detract from the role this assay plays in moving us forward in the field of diagnostics for nontuberculous mycobacteria, but at present it will remain challenging to realize the benefits that rapid diagnosis could offer.

### Asthma education and monitoring: what has been shown to work [^111WPseT]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Cochrane systematic reviews and meta-analyses on education and monitoring of asthmatic children have come to divergent conclusions, mainly because of the heterogeneity of education programmes and patients. There is little doubt that education is useful. However, the useful components of the education programmes remain to be elucidated, not only by randomized controlled trials but also by observational studies performed within distinct asthma phenotypes. Any education and monitoring package needs to contain basic explanation about the disease and its influencing factors, as well as inhalation instructions. There is no good evidence to justify home monitoring of lung function; symptom monitoring suffices. Probably, the crucial part of asthma education programmes is a high level of agreement between patient and doctor regarding the goals of the treatment (patient-doctor partnership). Therefore, further exploration of the patient's needs should be worthwhile.

### The principles of whole-hospital predictive analytics monitoring for clinical medicine originated in the neonatal ICU [^115wwUta]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Dynamics of the model that match the course of the illness

While statistical testing of the performance of the heart rate characteristics index was essential, there should be more to it than threshold-based evaluations like sensitivity and specificity or even areas under curves that evaluate multiple thresholds. (When a patient says s/he feels unwell, do you ask about their predictive performance?) We find that inspecting the time course of the model prediction as a function of the time until the event tells us much about what clinicians would see at the bedside. The phenotypes of the trajectories can say a great deal about the patient's prognosis. For example, we identified trajectories of heart rate characteristics monitoring that differentiated septic patients into higher and lower risk categories, a result presaged as long ago as 2003. Indeed, it is often the trend over time more so than the magnitude of the risk that leads clinicians to act.

While highly problematic statistically, alerts based on threshold-crossings are not without value. The field of predictive analytics monitoring was recently advanced by Escobar and coworkers at Kaiser-Permanente who broadly adopted a very successful systems approach of alerts and informed intermediaries to reduce mortality at 19 hospitals. But the problems of alert fatigue are well-known, and few risk estimates have true thresholds, where the risk steps up but is constant on either side of the breakpoint.

Perspective

Illnesses are dynamic, and the risk estimate should dynamically rise as the signature becomes more clear.

### 'It's what you do that makes a difference' an interpretative phenomenological analysis of health care professionals and home care workers experiences of nutritional care for people living with dementia at home [^1127vkL1]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

'As a carer, I know that sometimes you only have a certain amount of time to go in. A lunch call could be half an hour. In that time with someone with dementia you might have given them so many options and they choose one and then they decide they don't want that. It's just unfortunate that support workers are only given a certain amount of time and the people that dish out the time will be sitting there saying well hold on a minute, she's got dementia, she's got carers three times a day. That's where ours stops. Well it shouldn't. That's not a duty of care. Duty of care is to promote independent living at home'. (CW1)

Dementia was expressed by some participants as a 'social care issue', and one which requires multidisciplinary input. Memory café's (which support people with dementia and their family members in a safe, social setting) were viewed as a valuable resource by the GP, and one which differs to that of formal health provision services, such as memory clinics.

'Memory cafes are very popular because they're not them and us, type of thing. It's very - they're very level playing fields. Whereas, when you go to the memory clinic, the consultant, the specialist, he's them and we're the patient'. (GP)

Many participants described their roles framed within referral policies and procedures. This was deemed necessary to manage a large number of referrals with limited resources, but there were challenges associated with this, particularly in the context of changing strategies to prevent hospital admissions.

'We would put an individualised nutritional care plan in place and then we would monitor that. We aren't able to monitor as closely as we would like because of the level of the dietetic service… I'm a bit biased, but I think we need more dietitians'. (CD)

### Patient-centered activity monitoring in the self-management of chronic health conditions [^114ng1Mu]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Behavior change

There is great variability in the effective use of behavioral science principles in order to effect behavior change. There are three key components that are critical to long-term engagement with wearables: i) habit formation (setting cues, routines, and rewards), ii) social motivation (sharing or competing for goals with others), and iii) goal reinforcement feedback to monitor personal progress. BJ Fogg discusses the importance of computers as 'persuasive technology', with an ability to enhance self-efficacy, provide tailored information, trigger decision-making, and help people reduce barriers that impede target behaviors. A recent review of behavioral techniques in activity monitors found that goal-setting, behavioral goal review, behavior feedback, self-monitoring, and rewards were generally included in popular monitors, but that other important components, such as problem-solving, behavioral instruction, and commitment strategies, were rare. Overall, this review found that these devices included a range of 5 to 10 of 14 total potentially effective research-based techniques.

At present, the mechanisms of action are unclear. Do patients develop greater insight by viewing data about their activity levels? Does self-monitoring encourage a greater generalized sensitivity to one's daily health status? Perhaps the act of tracking can itself lead to behavior change. It has long been known that simple self-monitoring can affect one's self-evaluation and lead to self-administered consequences that affect response frequency. Some wearable manufacturers attempt to leverage social media in the form of data sharing, but many consumers reject this idea. The assumption that user measurement and feedback of data are sufficient in the success of these devices is dubious. The majority of consumer-accessible wearable devices are not part of a formal disease management program with a clearly reported time of use period and specific goals. The inclusion of effective behavior change components in a programmatic manner may drive positive outcomes more than wearable use alone.

### Evaluation of a clinical decision support tool to guide adoption of the American Heart Association telemetry monitoring practice standards [^111h77AV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Gray Areas

Participants mentioned several gray areas where they felt the practice standards did not fit well. For example, it was brought up that patients may have multiple indications during their stay, which complicates selecting a single indication for telemetry monitoring. Also, within the system there are intermediate care units that have cardiac monitoring capabilities. It was mentioned that there was internal professional debate on how the telemetry monitoring initiative should be used for these patients. One interviewee expressed desire for more direction on ordering telemetry monitoring for this population:

If you look at an IMC [intermediate care] patient in intermediate care… I have a lot of providers I encounter who believe all those patients should be on tele and nurses too. Then there's those who don't. That's a huge controversial point. I think we, as a system, need to either educate not to use it there or offer a button on that cardiac monitoring order for IMC, just because I think we get a lot of wildly inappropriate, goofy 'other' indications typed in because of that particular class of patient. — Physician 13

### Recommendations for using real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) data for insulin adjustments in type 1 diabetes [^112ZojtA]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

It is our hope that our recommendations provide a starting point for how to use the trend information. More important than the specific recommendations is the concept that insulin doses must be modified based on this valuable trend information. This concept applies not only to patients using these devices in real time but to the providers who will be guiding patients throughout the "lifespan" of these devices, from initiating use to perfecting it.

We believe that previous recommendations on insulin dosing have been far too rigid for far too long and fail to incorporate useful rtCGM information. As proof of this, our recommendations and previous work highlight that not all glucoses are created equal. Advice on how to respond to a given glucose value varies drastically based on where the glucose level is heading. If this information is not incorporated into insulin management, then we are not using these devices to their fullest potential, and in fact, missing their benefit entirely.

Having access to an accurate glucose value every 5 minutes with high and low alerts and ROC arrows is the most valuable tool people with type 1 diabetes have to help predict the unpredictable. We hope our recommendations to adjust insulin dosing based on the anticipated glucose in 30 minutes for mealtime and corrections will be helpful to people living with T1D and providers who take care of them.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^115txtaq]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Patient preferences for evaluation and monitoring — Focus group participants 'expressed interest in assessing and tracking their progress over time', emphasized that measuring improvement helped them visualize progress and remain engaged, and found monitoring difficult 'without frequent questionnaires and measurement tools'. The text adds that 'considering that patients should be proficient in the administered questionnaires' language is important' and that, although there may be a time burden, 'no documented evidence of associated harm exists'.

### How do non-geneticist physicians deal with genetic tests? A qualitative analysis [^116BqMkY]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

What is interesting in the above excerpt is the emphasis placed on the temporal relationship and the similarity of the activities. The surgery is affected by a change in the course of the disease: what focused selective attention on a highly delicate treatment decision is only temporary. Routine monitoring leads to steering the disease toward a genetic scenario. The testing indication is described as almost routine when the patient is admitted to a hospital for surgery. The account given by this endocrinologist, who focuses on monitoring endocrine cancers, illustrates the connection between the moment of surgery, hospitalization, and the testing scenario for genetic predisposition.

"Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are usually genetically diagnosed as part of a preoperative assessment, so early as well. Patients are hospitalized in preparation for surgery, and that's part of the package, in fact, they come and have a genetic test during their hospital stay. They are usually warned of this ahead of time, but not always, because sometimes in the rush to surgery we are crunched for time". Focus group E.

The combination of hospitalization, an endocrinology assessment and sample-taking all fall under a sort of windfall effect. In other words, the procedure leading from a cancerous pathology to hospitalization to assessment, sends a signal to order genetic tests. Like a cascade, a series of tasks leads to the tests being ordered. This windfall effect is produced when the spatial and temporal environments positively influence the recommended prescription within the framework of a medical reference without it being planned in advance. Thus, in the following excerpt, which concerns a surgical intervention:

" There are patients who are first discovered on the day they come. For example, they have an office visit with an ENT, the ENT discovers the paraganglioma, so they are referred to us for an extension study to see if there is any elsewhere, and we take the opportunity to do some genetic tests. So, we discover them, let's say, the day they arrive during hospitalization. So, they sign the consent form on the day they're informed, there is no time afterwards and the family tree is filled out, or, actually, medical students fill out the family tree, and the form is filled out right then". Focus group A.

### SAGES guidelines for the introduction of new technology and techniques [^117Q5gUj]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

New technology and techniques — information needs, monitoring, and registries emphasize that "The provision of updated and timely information on NT&T is highly desirable, as in its absence surgeon decision making is impaired", and "Our expert consensus was that the development of technology assessments should be done by medical societies with the best interest of the patient in mind". The page notes, "SAGES has created a new committee to address this need, and initial assessments have already been produced [21]", and "It is important to note that the lack of timely information is considered one of the most important barriers to an optimal decision-making process during NT&T adoption by hospital administrators [39] and probably also applies to surgeons". It further states that "Careful monitoring of outcomes with a new device or procedure and meticulous reporting in a database that allows comparisons are also perceived as very important", that "Such monitoring should be performed by the surgeon and the institution but also by societies who can provide guidance to their membership when needed", and that "Databases such as NSQIP can be very useful for surgeons", while cautioning that "while this process may be ideal, its application to daily practice may not be straightforward", illustrated by "the efforts of NOSCAR to create a registry of all NOTES human cases" where "The development of such a registry proved difficult due to incomplete voluntary reporting of cases, lack of financial resources to support the registry, and performance of a significant number of cases outside the US that were not captured by the registry. [3]", which "highlights the importance, in the era of globalization, of ensuring that processes be applicable internationally".

### Patient safety and the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study of perspectives of front-line clinicians [^1164suPX]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Equipment and space

In addition to staffing shortages, clinicians discussed how the pandemic affected resources, including physical space and equipment, and the impact of these deficiencies on care delivery and patient safety. Early in the pandemic, they struggled with inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and critical care beds. One nurse, reflecting on the early stage of the pandemic, shared the impact of an inadequate supply of ICU beds,

We had so many ICU patients that they converted the step-down unit… to ICU rooms, which is very unsafe. It's not like the same monitoring that we use in the ICU… There's not as much suction, like wall suction, which you need suction for these patients, usually ICU, at least two minimum. There's just not enough equipment in the room. You can't properly monitor the patients, because their monitors aren't set up for ICU patients… they were forcing us to go out there and take care of patients in conditions that were not safe. (Nurse)

Later in the pandemic, concerns around space and equipment became more widespread. All parts of the health system saw an influx of patients, many of whom had deferred care. Referring to later waves of the pandemic, a resident physician reflected on how overwhelmed their hospital was with both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, and how they had to practice medicine in ways that were atypical, such as providing critical care in the hallways:

We were coding people in the hallway. We were seeing gunshot wounds in chairs like I was saying. There were so many intensive care unit patients in the emergency department that were crashing all the time… It's like you are working on minimal resources, minimal room, nursing is always short. So it was just, it just felt unsafe at some times. (Resident Physician)

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^116HpCEq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Glycemic monitoring in diabetes and CKD — We recommend hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) for monitoring glycemic control in patients with diabetes and CKD (1C) and, due to its low cost and availability, it is the preferred method for glycemic monitoring in CKD. It is reasonable to measure HbA1c twice a year in stable patients with diabetes and up to 4 times a year if the individualized glycemic target has not been met and/or therapy is adjusted (practice point 2.1.1), but accuracy and precision of HbA1c will decline with worsening kidney function (practice point 2.1.2). Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) provide measures that are not known to be affected by CKD and its treatment; however, a weakness of SMBG is that it may not detect the wide and often unpredictable glucose excursions common in patients with diabetes and CKD, the inconvenience and costs of these approaches are substantially higher than the other glycemic monitoring methods, and currently, there are no RCTs to recommend alternative measures of glycemic control over HbA1c in these patients.

### Final "perspectives on the news": American association of clinical endocrinology and American diabetes association 2011 [^117HJryv]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Is the Food and Drug Administration hindering diabetes treatment?

Two perspectives presented in a symposium at the ADA meeting discussed the complex role of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the regulation of monitoring, drugs, and devices for diabetes. Aaron Kowalski, New York, New York, from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, noted that FDA decisions have broad effects affecting the time line of device and drug development but that FDA requirements for end points for novel therapies are not well-defined. He suggested this to be particularly relevant for devices for type 1 diabetes, stating, "Patients have a unique voice in this… [because they are] self-managing their disease". Patients do want safe treatments, he said, but consider delays in access to novel approaches unacceptable, given the risks of living with diabetes. He used as an example the artificial pancreas, which combines the insulin pump, continuous glucose monitor, and a software algorithm connecting the two, aiming for the avoidance of hypoglycemia and achievement of glucose targets. Part of the effort of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation led to FDA approval of algorithm development simulation rather than requiring animal studies. Such "smart algorithms" do appear to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia, suggesting that "this is a treatment we could use right now… [with] very low risk and very high potential benefit… [that] could eliminate 80% of hypoglycemia overnight". Furthermore, closed-loop controller systems have been shown to reduce variability and hypoglycemia risk overnight. Studies are being carried out with dual insulin and glucagon infusion to further minimize hypoglycemia. The FDA has, Kowalski said, promised a guidance document giving its expectations, but he indicated his frustration at the more rapid approval of such products in Europe along with his concern that companies might "abandon the U.S". A Medtronic product suspending insulin delivery during hyperglycemia has been approved outside the U.S. for nearly 3 years.

### Working for patient safety: a qualitative study of women's help-seeking during acute perinatal events [^1112HQkv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Resources and strategies

A number of women reported that they were in a position to help secure professional response for admission into hospital or escalation of care once already in the hospital setting. Their narratives highlighted the work that they engaged in to build a case for clinical attention, the negotiations that took place with health care professionals and the strategies women and partners drew on (such as objective signs and symptoms, use of verbal insistence and repetition) to secure clinical help.

Petra had been schooled in what to say and what to expect from the hospital staff in response to her going into labour. This authoritative knowledge gave her the confidence to insist on timely transfer to the hospital via the ambulance services.

'The ambulance people were here, 'What's the problem?' I say, 'I'm overdue, I've seen blood, and I have a scar which needs monitoring. So I need to go to the hospital' They said, 'We can't take you to the hospital, call the hospital while we are still here, talk to them, let us hear what they are saying'. I called the hospital and the midwife said, 'don't worry, put some water in the bath tub and make a cup of tea and sit in there'. I said, 'I was told that the moment I go into labour I should come to the hospital, I need to be monitored'. The midwife told me, 'OK, let the ambulance people bring you over to the hospital'

The precision medicine initiative is designed to better understand the causes of disease, to develop target therapies, and to identify patients that would benefit from treatment. Prescribing the right dose, which is not always the same to all patients, is needed for a successful outcome. The purpose of this commentary is to discuss the role of dose individualization based on therapeutic drug monitoring as a clinical patient management tool in the application of precision medicine.

### Diabetes therapy podcast: real-world data for glucose sensing technologies in type 1 diabetes [^114c14jL]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Continuous Glucose Sensors Today

N.O.: Yes, sure. There are broadly three categories of continuous glucose sensors that we have available to us for care of all diabetes, but in particular T1D. These are real-time CGM (RT-CGM), which gives the user a real-time glucose value along with the rate and direction of change of glucose and the preceding few hours of glucose trend, and that is available either on a receiver or a smartphone device and gives the user that real-time information whenever they wish to see it. Real-time devices also give alerts and alarms for either impending or established hypo- and hyperglycemia or if glucose is very rapidly changing. The second implementation of continuous glucose data is flash glucose monitoring or what is sometimes called intermittently scanned CGM, and that does not give real-time values but instead relies on the user swiping their device, so that is either the receiver or the smartphone over the sensor to give them the information, and the alerts and alarms are either not present at all with intermittently scanned CGM, or they are qualitative alarms, and what that means is rather than giving you the immediate alarm and the information around the alarm, it tells you that something has happened that requires a swipe to look at what the alarm status is. And then finally, there is blinded CGM, where the user cannot see any of the values and at the end of the sensor session, the data is downloaded for review. That is used far less frequently in clinical practice but can be a very useful research tool. So continuous glucose monitors do not measure blood, they measure interstitial fluid glucose so the glucose in the fluid underneath the skin and they report frequently sampled glucose values between every 1 min to every 15 min or so. Most of them are around the 5 min mark so that gives you 288 glucose values per day, and they enable you to make clinically meaningful changes to your self-management on a reasonably regular basis.

L. A.: Well that is fantastic. It seems there really are so many options available to us. It must be quite difficult to work out which one might be best. As we know these have developed so much in the past 20 years because of technological advancements, but also because of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which have been crucial in building up the robust evidence base. So, could you actually talk us through some of the key evidence that has come out of these clinical trials?

### Computers in patient education and monitoring [^1175jnbK]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Computing technologies offer much promise in the field of medicine. Every discipline in medicine has been affected by the proliferation of computerized technology. Clinicians face challenges in balancing constraints of time and personnel resources when caring for and educating patients. The potential value of computer technology is tremendous and expectations run high among providers and patients. Computers can help patients to synthesize knowledge from information and to retain information about diseases. Computer and communication technologies can extend the caregiver's reach with remote patient monitoring. Health care providers' roles are changing because of the availability of health information on the Internet. Computer-based patient education can help improve the patient's awareness and understanding of his or her disease(s), which can help make the patient more of a partner in the patient-physician relationship. Currently, there are some limitations to and issues about using computers for patient education and monitoring, but I expect those limitations and issues to be substantially mitigated in the future.

### Impact of remote patient monitoring on clinical outcomes: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113nFJqg]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The literature on RPM reveals enthusiasm over its promises to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare utilization, decrease costs, provide abundant data for research, and increase physician satisfaction. Non-invasive biosensors that allow for RPM offer patients and clinicians real-time data that has the potential to improve the timeliness of care, boost treatment adherence, and drive improved health outcomes. The passive gathering of data may also permit clinicians to focus their efforts on diagnosing, educating, and treating patients, theoretically improving productivity and efficiency of the care provided. However, despite anecdotal reports of RPM efficacy and growing interest in these new health technologies by researchers, providers, and patients alike, little empirical evidence exists to substantiate claims of its ability to improve clinical outcomes, and our research indicates many patients are not yet interested in or willing to share RPM data with their physicians. A recently published systematic review by Vegesna et al. summarized the state of RPM but provided only a qualitative overview of the literature. In this review, we provide a quantitative analysis of RPM studies to provide clinicians, patients, and health system leaders with a clear view of the effectiveness of RPM on clinical outcomes. Specifically, our study questions were as follows: How effective are RPM devices and associated interventions in changing important clinical outcomes of interest to patients and their clinicians? Which elements of RPM interventions lead to a higher likelihood of success in affecting clinically meaningful outcomes?

We sought to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assess the effects of using non-invasive, wearable biosensors for RPM on clinical outcomes. Understanding precisely in which contexts biosensors can improve health outcomes is important in guiding research pathways and increasing the effectiveness and quality of care.

### How can we monitor glycaemic variability in the clinical setting? [^113BCF48]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

No universal consensus exists on how to express glycaemic variability. Among other parameters, standard deviation of blood glucose values, mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions (MAGE), the Low Blood Glucose Index (LBGI) and the High Blood Glucose Index (HBGI), which were subsequently combined into the Average Daily Risk Range (ADRR), mean of daily differences (MODD) and glycaemic variability index (GVI) are highlighted. The continuous glucose monitoring in research and clinical settings has been a great help for a comprehensive approach to circadian blood glucose evaluation and identification of individual patterns, mainly in type 1 diabetes, but recently also in type 2 diabetes. In everyday clinical practice the judicious use of self-monitoring of blood glucose in an educational setting involving the patient and the care team is an unreplaceable tool to effectively and safely guide behavioural and drug therapy.

### Alzheimer's association workgroup suggests language for clinicians to talk to their patients about new treatments [^117FrDWS]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

The availability of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved therapies for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) challenges clinicians and health‐care providers with effectively communicating the risks, benefits, burdens, costs and available support associated with these treatments to patients, families, and other health‐care providers. The task is essential but complex.

The Alzheimer's Association Clinical Meaningfulness Workgroup has developed recommendations and suggested language to help health‐care providers explain newly approved AD treatments to patients and caregivers. "Benefits and Risks of FDA‐Approved Amyloid‐Targeting Antibodies for Treatment of Early Alzheimer's Disease: Navigating Clinician‐Patient Engagement" was published online October 15.

The paper focuses on FDA‐approved amyloid‐targeting antibody therapies for early AD, which offer hope by slowing disease progression. However, these treatments are not cures, and thoughtful management — including ongoing, clear, factual communication — is required.

"The language and guidance in the article emphasizes the need for clear and empathetic communication between clinicians, patients, and caregivers regarding treatment eligibility, risks, benefits, and costs", said Maria C. Carrillo, PhD, Alzheimer's Association chief science officer and medical affairs lead, and senior author on the article. "It also stresses the importance of genetic testing in advance, ongoing monitoring for side effects, and managing the logistical and financial issues associated with treatment".

"This effort was catalyzed by Alzheimer's patients and families sharing their enthusiasm, but also their concerns — telling us what they want and need to know about these drugs, and the confusion and discord they have experienced because of the contentious public discussion about the FDA‐approved treatments for early Alzheimer's", Carrillo explained. "The issues are complex, but can be discussed in a way that everyone can understand. We do this for cancer treatment. We can do this for Alzheimer's".

### Uncertainty of risk estimates from clinical prediction models: rationale, challenges, and approaches [^112AUhAc]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

I believe in the old adage, knowledge is power. To make patients aware of the inherent uncertainty in any predictive model is, to my mind, ethically mandatory. To give them the opportunity to get some idea of how uncertain the prediction is, is arguably just as important. I think most patients want to be given the best available information, and to have explained to them how that information may, or may not, be completely useful in their particular case.

However, I do acknowledge that there are instances when patients/parents may not wish to be given this additional information. Some may choose not to access it. Some may reason that the knowledge would not change their decisions. If there is only one treatment path available, does it matter if you have absolute or only partial confidence of the outcome? That is ultimately a decision for the patient".

However, this transcript also highlights that communicating uncertainty of risks is a complex issue and will not always be appropriate because the clinical context alongside each individual's needs and level of understanding is variable. We return to this issue later in the article (see "challenges in communicating and interpreting uncertainty of risk estimates").

### A qualitative evaluation and conceptual framework on the use of the birth weight and age-at-death boxes for intervention and evaluation system (BABIES) matrix for perinatal health in Uganda [^115bPmjq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Theme 3. Changes in behavior or facility SOPs

A team-based approach was required and reinforced by the BABIES matrix; respondents explained that the tool required the effort of many individuals to complete and provide an appropriate response. Respondents reported that this collaborative strategy changed the way staff interacted and communicated with each other. It allowed open discussion, accountability for, and resolution of issues evidenced by the data. Respondents described that when problems were addressed, particularly newborn and maternal deaths, the discussions were supportive and focused on problem solving versus blaming, shaming, and punitive actions.

"[The Ministry of Health] congratulate[s] us, then they say we have improved from what we were doing to a certain level. But if it is not that, they also tell us that the other time [before BABIES matrix] we discussed this and this, we said you can improve by doing this and this, but it was not done [previously]". - Respondent

One facility was intentional about engaging with their community because of what was learned at monthly meetings. Respondents from this facility described that the BABIES matrix provided tangible evidence of the outcomes that could be reported back to the community. As specific issues were identified by the team through use of the tool, community-based interventions were developed with community partners.

"In antenatal we have educated the mothers to do antenatal early, to start as early as they know they are pregnant and informed the VHTs [Village Health Teams] to refer us mothers who are pregnant in the community as early as possible, so they start antenatal early and we do what, we do the tests like syphilis test, HCT [HIV counseling and testing]. If they are syphilis [positive], we treat early, as early as possible, so we avoid those macerated stillbirths". - Respondent

Sometimes the BABIES matrix did not entirely replace the existing procedures and processes but was integrated into existing practices.

"In our meetings we always have a performance monitoring tool, whereby we make sure we give people some duties which we have to monitor at the end of the month… and we sometimes use quality improvement tools. We make like a journal, so this time we are going to improve on this, so at the end of the month, we come back to see have we achieved anything, or we have relapsed". - Respondent

Patient responsibilities in remote monitoring include that patient enrollment establishes a clear strategy for communicating benefits and limitations of RM; a frequently misunderstood limitation is its inability to act as an emergency response system; patients and caregivers should be made aware that there is a delay between an episode or alert and the transmission of that alert to the CIED clinic; the organizational model should not be constructed to immediately interpret and act on alerts but rather within an acceptable time frame such as the next business day; expected reaction times should be explained and patients and caregivers instructed on how to react in an emergency situation; and demonstrations of how to set up the monitor and how transmissions work should be performed at enrollment.

### Is It time for a patient-centered quality measure of asthma control? [^114c6G2Q]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Quality measures play a prominent role in the US health care system. They are used to monitor and report performance across health plans, providers, and health systems and are a foundational element of value-based payment. Measuring the quality of asthma care has been challenging because of a lack of reliable data to assess clinical processes and track patient-specific outcomes. Existing asthma Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measures rely on administrative claims-derived data on dispensed medications. These are proxy measures of appropriate prescribing but are not reflective of comprehensive asthma care. The increase in the volume and specificity of longitudinal clinical data in electronic health records, movement toward electronic quality measures, and advances in electronic clinical data systems enable the development of more meaningful measures. A patient-reported measure of asthma control would incorporate key clinical indicators such as a validated age- and culturally appropriate test, and would reflect the combined outcome of medical management, self-management education, reduction of environmental exposures, and appropriate support services. Although there is a current quality measure that includes a test of asthma control (the Optimal Asthma Control Measure), work is needed to address questions about usability, patient literacy, and the influence of setting on self-reported scores. Comprehensive reliability and validity testing of both clinical data and stratification across risk groups will be needed to determine whether a measure based on standardized assessments of asthma control indeed promote improved clinical outcomes.

CKD-MBD decision-making and assay considerations — In patients with CKD stages 3–5D, we recommend that therapeutic decisions be based on trends, rather than a single laboratory value, taking into account all available CKD-MBD assessments (1C). This statement recommends assessing all parameters of CKD-MBD together and each parameter over time, and the practitioner should account for assay and timing factors: PTH and phosphorus levels are subject to diurnal variation and vitamin D levels are subject to seasonal variation; testing for PTH and phosphorus should be performed at similar times during the day and week, and to eliminate between-assay variability, the same assay should be used for monitoring changes over time. This recommendation is applicable to the United States.

### A systematic review on patient and public attitudes toward health monitoring technologies across countries [^115eYqhz]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Several properties of health monitoring technologies identified as bringing benefits to their users have also been flagged as potential sources of risk. Respondents reported behavior changes but also feared over-reliance on technology and over-treatment. While some experienced more interaction with healthcare professionals, others worried about reduced communication with family and clinicians. Some praised these technologies for personalized care, but there were also concerned about the misuse of personal data –. In the cases, where the same characteristics of technologies could bring benefits to some users but result in negative unintended consequences for others, the potential benefits and risks should be carefully considered before these technologies are widely adopted.

Health monitoring devices, like other digital technologies that collect personal information, raise privacy concerns. Perceived privacy risks underscore a divide between users and the companies handling their data. This review found that users feared data misuse by companies, necessitating robust policies and guidelines for inclusivity and trustworthiness. While research indicates the need for comprehensive policies to build trust and ensure inclusive practices, regulatory approaches vary significantly across nations. For example, the US classifies monitoring technologies as either medical or non-medical devices, with medical devices regulated by the 21st Century Cures Act. In contrast, Japan classifies devices by risk level, requiring approval for higher risk devices. Studying contrasting regulatory models could inform the development of more effective global standards for responsible health data monitoring.

### Unlocking the potential of continuous glucose monitoring: a new guideline supports the development of continuous glucose monitoring devices [^113qQUM3]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a new technology that allows patients to measure glucose levels continuously over several days. It has several advantages over traditional glucose meters in that it does not involve repeated finger sticks and can measure trends and track changes in glucose levels over time. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, working with the Diabetes Technology Society, published Performance Metrics for Continuous Interstitial Glucose Monitoring; Approved Guideline, which provides recommendations for methods for determining analytical and clinical metrics of CGMs. The document provides guidance on how CGM data should be presented, compared between devices, and compared between measurement technologies. The document serves as a roadmap for the testing of CGM devices and will ultimately advance the potential of this exciting technology. Performance Metrics for Continuous Interstitial Glucose Monitoring; Approved Guideline represents the consensus view on preparing and presenting CGM data.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^117FGpzF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Anti-PLA2R antibody monitoring in MN is outlined with timing, interpretation, and thresholds: Practice Point 3.3.4 states that "Longitudinal monitoring of anti-PLA2R antibody levels at 6 months after start of therapy may be useful for evaluating treatment responses in patients with MN, and can be used to guide adjustments to therapy (Figure 33)". The commentary cautions that "antibody levels should not be interpreted at a single time point; thus, a single value above 50 RU/mL in the presence of the nephrotic syndrome does not necessarily indicate a need for immunosuppressive treatment". Seroconversion is defined as "either a negative immunofluorescent test or an ELISA titer < 2 RU/mL (some laboratories report < 4 RU/mL, which is also reasonable)". Furthermore, "decline and disappearance of anti-PLA2R antibodies by 6 months should be an indication to limit further immunosuppression", whereas "their persistence should lead the treating physician to continue therapy or ultimately change to another agent".

### A waiting crisis? [^116U9Zfu]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Much philosophical and social science research tells us that the tolerability of waiting is determined not so much by the quantity of time one is asked to endure, but its quality. Subjectively, pain can slow time; waiting also becomes unbearable when what you are waiting for seems unlikely to be delivered in a timely way. Yet modes of waiting with others that involve paying careful attention to making relationships can manage, ameliorate, and make therapeutic use of time. These relational practices of making time are there in the everyday work of returning and checking to understand what is needed at any given moment; they are there, too, in the personal letter from a clinic that reminds someone on a list that they are indeed someone's patient and being kept in mind. Time may not flow smoothly and may even feel stuck in such moments. But for the young person who is not sure that life is worth living but turns, time and again, to their psychotherapist or mental health team; for the adult telling their doctor about a series of chronic conditions who comes to learn that their experience will be heard and attended to; or for the person in a hospice sharing their life story with an attentive carer: in these moments of relating, time is created rather than wasted. The practices of waiting that nurture such relationships are the ground on which care grows.

So how do we navigate the idea that waiting lists and times are crises that demand urgent forms of action, while also taking care of the waiting intrinsic to care? The crisis account feels both accurate and timely as we look towards a post-pandemic future, but its call for immediate action also has risks. These include opening the door to further privatisation of the NHS to restructure the system, the hardening of criteria around who is eligible for care, and more unsustainable sacrifices being demanded of its understaffed and undervalued workforce. At such a moment, in addition to the need for long-term investment in the NHS and social care, preventive approaches, and improved public health, we suggest that it is vital to develop more nuanced narratives about crisis, waiting, and care. Only then will we be able to preserve the crucial difference between waiting that can and should be ameliorated by improving resourcing and systems, and waiting that is central to individual and collective care.

### Building a monitoring matrix for the management of multiple sclerosis [^112eJ87x]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a longitudinal and heterogeneous course, with an increasing number of therapy options and associated risk profiles, leading to a constant increase in the number of parameters to be monitored. Even though important clinical and subclinical data are being generated, treating neurologists may not always be able to use them adequately for MS management. In contrast to the monitoring of other diseases in different medical fields, no target-based approach for a standardized monitoring in MS has been established yet. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a standardized and structured monitoring as part of MS management that is adaptive, individualized, agile, and multimodal-integrative. We discuss the development of an MS monitoring matrix which can help facilitate data collection over time from different dimensions and perspectives to optimize the treatment of people with MS (pwMS). In doing so, we show how different measurement tools can combined to enhance MS treatment. We propose to apply the concept of patient pathways to disease and intervention monitoring, not losing track of their interrelation. We also discuss the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the quality of processes, outcomes, and patient safety, as well as personalized and patient-centered care. Patient pathways allow us to track the patient's journey over time and can always change (e.g., when there is a switch in therapy). They therefore may assist us in the continuous improvement of monitoring in an iterative process. Improving the monitoring process means improving the care of pwMS.

Healthcare Provider's perspectives on the use of the mHealth app for diabetes self-management among T2DM patients (refer: Fig. 3)

Fig. 3
Perspectives of the HCPs

Need for continuous patient monitoring

The professionals expressed their need for continuous monitoring of the patients; this was possible with regular efforts put forth by the healthcare team and the patients themselves (Refer: Table 5). The monitoring of blood glucose and proper insulin dosage was a crucial part of diabetes management, hence the doctors were dependent solely on the patients reporting their blood glucose levels accurately and in determining their next doses.

[D – Indicates Doctor responses, N – Indicates Nurses responses]

D1- Most patients, like 60% come from far away like 2–3 h distance, for such people, we tell them to monitor GRBS at home. We give them duty mobile number if they have doubts, they can call us in OPD hours. From our side, we make sure that they have access to information, but I am not sure because of their illiteracy people cannot.

D3- One thing I have noticed is even though we explain everything on disease management the patients do not follow what we have said, and they are not taking anything that we have prescribed, and they will start with Ayurveda and homeopathy treatment.

For a few months or years, they will start taking some alternative medicines and come back with high sugars or getting complications then they return to our treatment.

Educating patients on diabetes self-management (DSM)

Patients tend to get confused about managing their diabetes through proper diet and exercise, some concerns stated by the professionals were.

D1- They ask us - why my sugars are high. I do not eat rice, yet they are high! so dietary concerns are more.

The foremost aspect of identifying the condition early and avoiding future complications of diabetes is to educate on the disease condition. Educating through means of mHealth apps poses a lesser burden on the HCPs. Hence, educating and reminding the patients on what to do and what not regularly helps them to understand and adapt to good behavioural habits in managing their condition effectively.

### Clinical targets for continuous glucose monitoring data interpretation: recommendations from the international consensus on time in range [^114T5oa3]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Improvements in sensor accuracy, greater convenience and ease of use, and expanding reimbursement have led to growing adoption of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). However, successful utilization of CGM technology in routine clinical practice remains relatively low. This may be due in part to the lack of clear and agreed-upon glycemic targets that both diabetes teams and people with diabetes can work toward. Although unified recommendations for use of key CGM metrics have been established in three separate peer-reviewed articles, formal adoption by diabetes professional organizations and guidance in the practical application of these metrics in clinical practice have been lacking. In February 2019, the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) Congress convened an international panel of physicians, researchers, and individuals with diabetes who are expert in CGM technologies to address this issue. This article summarizes the ATTD consensus recommendations for relevant aspects of CGM data utilization and reporting among the various diabetes populations.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: practical use of continuous glucose monitoring [^116jd54D]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Currently available continuous glucose monitoring systems

The child had a hypo (BG < 4 mmol/L) on the ward which was confirmed by fingerpick BG test. It was treated appropriately by the ward staff but they noticed that there is a discrepancy between the finger prick BG readings and CGM. Her BG came up to 5.5 mmol/L 15 min after the treatment was given but the CGM value was displaying 4.5 mmol/L. You notice that on the CGM display screen, the glucose level is displayed along with an arrow pointed upwards. You are not sure how to interpret this.

There are some important concepts you need to remember while looking after CYP using CGM devices and making treatment decisions

Lag time: It is important to remember that CGM measures interstitial glucose rather than BG. Interstitial glucose levels are dependent on the flow of glucose according to the concentration gradient between the vascular and interstitial space. The difference in glucose levels in the two compartments leads to the concept of 'lag-time'. The lag time is most pronounced when BG levels are changing rapidly. This concept is important to remember when considering hypoglycaemia management; the sensor reading might not pick up hypoglycaemia and lead to delayed treatment. Similarly, sensor glucose levels might not rise as rapidly as BG leading the user to repeat treatment unnecessarily (figure 2).
Trend arrows: CGM also detects interstitial glucose changes over time. As a result, the CGM display screen reports the glucose reading and a trend arrow. This arrow determines the rate of rise or fall of glucose. Each system has its own arrow system to display specific rates of change of sensor glucose levels. The rate of change depicted by the trend arrows helps us to predict glucose levels in the next 20–30 min. This aids in making treatment decisions and helps avoid hypo/hyperglycaemia. Figure 3 outlines trend arrows showing the rate of change in glucose levels for different CGM systems. The insulin dosing for mealtime and corrections should be adjusted according to trend arrows. The Association of Children's Diabetes Clinicians has designed a stepwise guide that gives advice on how to alter insulin dosage based on trend arrows(figure 3).
Accuracy: Mean absolute relative difference (MARD) is the metric used to assess the accuracy of CGM systems. The mean difference between interstitial glucose and reference BG readings is presented as the MARD. A MARD of less than 10% is considered accurate enough to make treatment decisions so that an insulin bolus can be calculated from a CGM sensor reading, rather than a capillary finger prick. Dexcom G6 and FreeStyle Libre sensors have MARD of 9% and are licenced to make treatment decisions. For a sensor with MARD higher than 10%, the recommendation is to check BG before treatment decisions about treating hypoglycaemia or giving insulin are made. The accuracy of the sensor is also dependent on the BG range with reduced accuracy typically in hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic range. It is therefore advisable to check BG with finger prick testing when levels are falling or low.
Other considerations when using CGM devices: Most CGM systems make use of the enzymatic reaction between glucose and glucose oxide to measure interstitial glucose levels (table 2). Paracetamol (both oral and intravenous) caused falsely elevated readings in the previous Dexcom G4 and G5 sensors and Medtronic sensors. Newer Dexcom G6, guardian 3 sensors and FreeStyle Libre have an acetaminophen blocker that prevents this interference at therapeutic doses of paracetamol. Clinicians should be mindful that if sensors' readings are unusually high, levels should be confirmed with finger-prick BG testing. The direct pressure on the CGM site can also cause falsely low sensor readings due to reduced tissue perfusion CYP who wear a CGM device do not routinely need to check their BG readings with finger prick tests. However, they still need to make sure they calibrate their sensor as per manufacturer's instructions (table 1). It is also advisable to check BG if CGM readings do not match with clinical symptoms, for example, if a child is feeling symptoms and showing signs of hypoglycaemia but sensor readings are above the hypoglycaemic range. Not all devices are licenced to make treatment decisions. Users of those devices must check their BG before making any decisions about insulin administration. If in doubt, users must confirm with a BG test. Advantages and barriers of using CGM devices have been summarised in Table 2

### International consensus on use of continuous glucose monitoring [^111mMJV5]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) has been the traditional method for assessing glycemic control. However, it does not reflect intra- and interday glycemic excursions that may lead to acute events (such as hypoglycemia) or postprandial hyperglycemia, which have been linked to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), either from real-time use (rtCGM) or intermittently viewed (iCGM), addresses many of the limitations inherent in HbA 1c testing and self-monitoring of blood glucose. Although both provide the means to move beyond the HbA 1c measurement as the sole marker of glycemic control, standardized metrics for analyzing CGM data are lacking. Moreover, clear criteria for matching people with diabetes to the most appropriate glucose monitoring methodologies, as well as standardized advice about how best to use the new information they provide, have yet to be established. In February 2017, the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) Congress convened an international panel of physicians, researchers, and individuals with diabetes who are expert in CGM technologies to address these issues. This article summarizes the ATTD consensus recommendations and represents the current understanding of how CGM results can affect outcomes.

### Empowered citizen' health hackers' who are not waiting [^116DuzMD]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

When enough is enough

The lack of accessible and actionable data is a common frustration in the type 1 diabetes community. Given the easier communication between diabetics with online communities in recent times, the community have been engaging in conversation, with a key event in the community being the first DiabetesMine D-Data ExChange event, which highlighted the frustration of patients waiting for their needs to be addressed and where the community declared "We Are Not Waiting". And rightly so, why should patients wait to address their current needs?

Patients currently have access to global online communities that allow unrestricted sharing of ideas, projects and collaboration efforts to overcome challenges, as well as access to cheap technology from the Hobby Electronics movement and a passionate well-educated pool of individuals with a common goal. This critical mass, which rallied under the hashtag #WeAreNotWaiting, saw rapid progress in DIY medical devices in the type 1 diabetes community.

Patient-driven projects

Through community-driven innovation there has been a surge in edge cases being developed, which may be of little interest to the medical industry either due to costs or risks. By gaining access to their own data under their terms, several patient-driven creative solutions have been developed:
To monitor continuous glucose monitor data from a smartwatch
To remotely monitor a child's blood sugar levels
To provide louder alarms and treatment suggestions according to the data
To analyse patient data and automate medication delivery

These projects are empowering the patient through the better use of real-time data to help manage a real-time condition. Watching one's blood sugars rise on a smartwatch after eating a pizza is a lot more powerful than the screen on the manufactures device showing the same data in one's bag.

### Importance of FDA-integrated continuous glucose monitors to ensure accuracy of continuous glucose monitoring [^114EPfBh]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a public health care problem that is now epidemic in scale worldwide. Glucose monitoring is an important part of self-management of diabetes. Of note, although self-monitoring of blood glucose is associated with an improvement in control of HbA1c, the information it provides is limited, and people living with diabetes may be unaware of their glucose levels or trends, leading to an increased risk of hypoglycemic events. - In contrast, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been shown to improve glycemic control, as well as to reduce the risk of both severe and nonsevere hypoglycemia. - In fact, CGM supports people with DM to optimize their therapy, diet, and activity, facilitating improved HbA1c, increased time in target range of 70 to 180 mg/dL, reduced time below range (< 70 mg/dL), and improved Glycemia Risk Index scores. - A CGM measures interstitial glucose, which correlates well with plasma glucose; trend arrows provide useful information about whether glucose levels are rising or falling. CGM devices can be divided into two groups, "adjunctive" devices, which require measurement of glucose levels through concomitant use of blood glucose meters for adjusting DM therapy (i.e. insulin dose or treatment of hypoglycemia), and "non-adjunctive" devices, which are not subject to these requirements. -

### How much are patients willing to pay to avoid intraoperative awareness? [^117GBUwd]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine how much patients are willing to pay to avoid intraoperative awareness?

Design

Observational study

Setting

University-affiliated metropolitan hospital.

Patients

60 patients who completed a questionnaire (39 F, 21 M). The mean age was 43 years and the median household income range of 45,000–60,000 US dollars.

Interventions

Patients completed an interactive computer-generated questionnaire on the value of preventing intraoperative awareness and their willingness to pay for a "depth of anesthesia" monitor. Their willingness to pay for the prevention of postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, postoperative grogginess, and sleepiness was also determined as a means of comparison.

Measurements and Main Results

Patients were willing to pay (WTP) 34 US dollars, 10 US dollars to 42 US dollars (median, interquartile range) for a monitor that would assist an anesthesia care provider assess the depth of anesthesia in an effort to avoid awareness. This increased to 43 US dollars, 20 US dollars to 77 US dollars (p < 0.0,001) (median, interquartile range), if the insurance company was making the payment and the WTP value only decreased minimally to 33 US dollars if the incidence of awareness was reduced 10-fold.

Conclusion

The incidence of intraoperative awareness and WTP value for monitoring awareness have a nonlinear relationship (a risk averse utility function), which suggests that patients assign an intrinsic base value for a rare or very rare possibility of an event. Other healthcare economic analyses (such as cost effectiveness) do not take this factor into account and assume a linear value relationship (i.e., if something occurs ten times less frequently, it has ten times less value).

Implication

The median value for patients' WTP for a monitor that might prevent awareness under anesthesia was 34 US dollars given an incidence of 5/1,000 cases. The incidence of awareness and WTP value have a nonlinear relationship suggesting that patients assign an intrinsic base value for the possibility of awareness.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the use of integrative therapies as supportive care in patients treated for breast cancer [^113vwFQw]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute: Monographs (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical guidelines overview — the recommendations "are based on the strength of evidence using accepted standards" and "are focused on the period during active treatment and the period following when treatment side effects may persist", supporting clinician–patient dialogue because "These graded recommendations are intended to help clinicians and patients engage in informed and meaningful dialogue with each other regardless of their final course of action". Decision-making guidance states "Clinicians and patients should adopt shared decision-making approaches when assessing the risk–benefit ratio for each therapy" and "It is important to personalize the recommendations based on patients' values and clinical characteristics". Integrative therapies are "used alongside/in combination with conventional medical care and should be fully communicated", and "All modalities should be administered by qualified and experienced providers, if applicable, who have the appropriate training, licensure, and credentialing", with coordination emphasized as "Ongoing communication and exchange of treatment summaries among all health-care providers should take place". Monitoring and safety guidance include "Patients should be monitored for efficacy and toxicity, including early and delayed adverse effects", and "Treatment should be stopped for unfavorable or neutral risk/benefit effects". The document cautions that "we cannot make claims about comparative efficacy (ie, whether one intervention is better than another)" and that "patient preference, as well as cost, degree of improvement, and effort involved should be taken into account", noting "there were a large number of therapies that were deemed to have insufficient evidence to form recommendations".

Third, any acceptable "degree of less certainty" 13 about a specific product can only be temporary, even in the face of high unmet need. A fundamental tenet of AL is progressive reduction of uncertainty by way of preagreed evidence generation plans and time frames. In addition, the AL approach emphasizes tight management of utilization, monitoring in the market place, and an ability and political willingness to restrict use or withdraw a product if the benefit–risk or the value for money is less than expected. Together, these precautions are expected to lead to lower realized risks for patients compared to the current approach (see below).

Fourth, a starting point for the AL concept is the growing realization that almost every disease or clinical indication consists of multiple subpopulations. (For an example of substratification of even a classic blockbuster indication like dyslipidemia, please refer to Baird et al 19; the argument will be further developed below.) Hence, the ethical question about the trade‐off between the interests of future vs. current patients will likely have a different answer for each individual subpopulation. What is acceptable uncertainty for one subgroup may not be acceptable for another, and will be dependent on the patient subgroups' disease burden, potential for benefit, and, to the extent practical, on patients' declared preferences to accept a given level of uncertainty in exchange for access to new therapies.

Uncertainties regarding personal benefits

Although in a lot of cases expectations were very high, many patients indicated their uncertainty about their actual chance to personally benefit by participating in the program. Some patients were not certain whether they would (merely) contribute to research or if and to what extent they could expect a personal benefit.

Well, I have a basic skepticism to the extent that I say, medically it's all definitely meaningful and valuable, but whether something really ensues in the… for my specific case. let's see. (IP10)

Yes, I'm missing it, uh, I'm actually missing.since I don't know now, if there can still be an advantage for me at my age or maybe in ten years or whatever.in twenty years or something. Somehow.how shall I put it? Some purpose it will have in a way that medicine makes progresses. But whether it's short term or long term, I don't know.… Well, no I wasn't actually told, but I guess it would help research and I doubt it's gonna help ME. (IP17)

Many patients experienced this uncertainty as particularly burdensome while awaiting the results of the program.

So yes, and as I said, chemotherapy.is getting harder and harder to endure. So, at the moment the time factor is very.it is an important.an issue since yesterday, right?… I can stand that [the waiting period] with chemotherapy, but.they [these months] will be exhausting. That is clear. I know that. (IP7)

This waiting time. Waiting, waiting, waiting. That is always the worst. That is ALWAYS the worst. (IP27)

Another patient described her perception while waiting for concrete results of PCM as "hanging in the balance":

My son corresponded back and forth with Dr. A. and he was also always nice and positive, but he probably can't say anything very concrete like that until this biopsy in [city 1]. we're all pending there like everything is still hanging in the balance. (IP19)

### The stage IV shuffle: elusiveness of straight talk about advanced cancer [^111nxeoT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

During the initial consultation with a patient to communicate a diagnosis of late-stage cancer, the oncologist may refrain from giving survival statistics, redirecting the conversation from the bad news (incurability) to the practical aspects of the patient's care (treatments, timetables, appointments, and testing to monitor response to treatment). Whether conscious or unconscious, this diversion helps cushion the impact of the disturbing news. This paper shows that clinicians' gingerly handling of harsh facts when they talk with patients also applies to health educators and researchers when they write about late-stage cancer. As a result, these cancer patients typically lack an understanding of their poor prognosis and the limited effectiveness of most available treatments, possibly compromising their ability to make informed choices. To remedy this problem, I describe an approach to straight talk about late-stage cancer that can give a patient realistic hopes instead of false hopes that are apt to betray later on. I also propose an enhanced method of displaying and interpreting comparative efficacy data that can facilitate understanding and serve as a basis for shared decision making.

### Prevention of postpartum haemorrhage by community-based auxiliary midwives in hard-to-reach areas of Myanmar: a qualitative inquiry into acceptability and feasibility of task shifting [^116QccEZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

"We give the misoprostol together with the CDK [clean delivery kit] to all the AMWs in our areas. For those who are near to us, there is no problem because it is easy to monitor and refer if needed. But for those in the hill hard-to-reach, there is no-one apart from them. We tell them again and again when to give the drug [misoprostol], only after the birth of the baby and not to use it any other time"

(MW assigned in the hard-to-reach area during FGD with MWs)

However, some of the key informant interviewees mentioned that they worried about the misuse of misoprostol to induce abortion, but MWs and AMWs in the FGDs did not mention anything in relation to abortion, potentially because induced abortions are illegal in Myanmar and are therefore a highly sensitive topic.

"I always tell the AMWs to give the drug [misoprostol] only after the baby is born as it is very dangerous if is given before the delivery of the baby and because they are away from me during the time of the actual birth. I worry that they would use it early"

(MW from hard-to-reach area during FGD with MWs)

One of the reasons for this concern was that the drug's commonly used name in Myanmar language, "tha ein pwint say" (the ein: uterus; pwint: open; say: medicine), literally means "a drug that enhances the opening of the uterus", creating misunderstanding among the users. Thus it was now purposely referred to as "tha ein kyunte say" (the ein: uterus; kyunte: contract; say: medicine), literally meaning contraction of the uterus, in most of the trainings.

### How to communicate evidence to patients [^116rWQ8Q]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

Understanding the problem

One problem is what do we mean by 'good understanding' of a risk or benefit? Clearly, we do not just mean someone can recall a number — the percentage chance of something happening. Knowledge of a fact is not the same as understanding. We want a patient to imagine the range of things that might happen to them and to understand how likely each is compared with other things that they are familiar with; to slot these new scenarios into their personal framework of 'what might happen in my life' in an appropriate way, allowing them to weigh up evidence and to make a decision that is right for them. What an 'appropriate' way to imagine them is, will depend very much on their individual experiences and perception. That personalised, internalised concept of risk or chance is, then, very hard to define, let alone measure.

A patient's concept of the numbers involved is also only a part of what feeds into their final decision. Their emotions and personal values will all have a huge influence on their risk perception and decision-making, so we cannot assess their understanding of the facts by what decision they make either. Some of these (such as their feelings about a particular outcome) are entirely appropriate factors to weigh in their decision. Others (such as their feelings towards their doctor) we may wish to minimise. There are so many things that can affect a patient's understanding, especially when we are considering a personal interaction, that minimising these unwanted biases is very hard.

This complexity means that it is not easy to create simple guidance on how to communicate evidence clearly to patients.

However, there are some useful findings from research that are worth every healthcare professional knowing.

### Continuous glucose monitoring and metrics for clinical trials: an international consensus statement [^116hVro8]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Randomised controlled trials and other prospective clinical studies for novel medical interventions in people with diabetes have traditionally reported HbA 1c as the measure of average blood glucose levels for the 3 months preceding the HbA 1c test date. The use of this measure highlights the long-established correlation between HbA 1c and relative risk of diabetes complications; the change in the measure, before and after the therapeutic intervention, is used by regulators for the approval of medications for diabetes. However, with the increasing use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in clinical practice, prospective clinical studies are also increasingly using CGM devices to collect data and evaluate glucose profiles among study participants, complementing HbA 1c findings, and further assess the effects of therapeutic interventions on HbA 1c. Data is collected by CGM devices at 1–5 min intervals, which obtains data on glycaemic excursions and periods of asymptomatic hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia (ie, details of glycaemic control that are not provided by HbA 1c concentrations alone that are measured continuously and can be analysed in daily, weekly, or monthly timeframes). These CGM-derived metrics are the subject of standardised, internationally agreed reporting formats and should, therefore, be considered for use in all clinical studies in diabetes. The purpose of this consensus statement is to recommend the ways CGM data might be used in prospective clinical studies, either as a specified study endpoint or as supportive complementary glucose metrics, to provide clinical information that can be considered by investigators, regulators, companies, clinicians, and individuals with diabetes who are stakeholders in trial outcomes. In this consensus statement, we provide recommendations on how to optimise CGM-derived glucose data collection in clinical studies, including the specific glucose metrics and specific glucose metrics that should be evaluated. These recommendations have been endorsed by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Diabetes Association, the Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists, DiabetesIndia, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes, the Japanese Diabetes Society, and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. A standardised approach to CGM data collection and reporting in clinical trials will encourage the use of these metrics and enhance the interpretability of CGM data, which could provide useful information other than HbA 1c for informing therapeutic and treatment decisions, particularly related to hypoglycaemia, postprandial hyperglycaemia, and glucose variability.

It was also noted that in communities with a strong religious presence, there tended to be resistance to PrEP from faith leaders, who asserted that promoting PrEP was counter to their religious values, promoting and encouraging sexual activity amongst young people.

The community were very negative saying that we are telling the young women to have sex. They were saying "you are telling them that you must wear a condom and that there is this pill that prevents HIV, so you are basically telling our children to go and have sex". (Outreach worker)

According to implementer respondents, in some communities the views of religious leaders had the potential to derail the PrEP programme.

Such people preach and preach… people spend most of their time in their churches, so they have a big effect. When you offer PrEP to a young girl, they go around saying at the church "no, no, no those things are bad… ARVs, you must not take them"… there are all of these myths around HIV, so these people are making it difficult for us to convince our young girls who are really sexually active and not taking care of themselves, to have a little bit of protection… they are making it really hard for us to reach our young girls. (Outreach worker)

However, there were also cases reported where church leaders were supportive of the programme and were allowing implementers to operate out of church facilities.

Most of the people in the community are willing to work with us… sometimes we use the church building… so they are really being hands-on, because they understand what the program is about… we receive positive energy from them… the managers do get assistance from the church leaders. (Monitoring and evaluation staff)

Implementer respondents emphasised that in general, community members are misinformed about PrEP. They cited several myths relating to PrEP, including that it causes infertility, results in termination of pregnancy or in HIV infection. A few cases in which people contracted HIV whilst being on PrEP, had also negatively affected community acceptability of PrEP. Information regarding whether these people were taking PrEP consistently and correctly was often not discussed alongside these unfortunate cases, when community members speak among themselves.

### Digital diabetes congress 2017 [^111xEhyy]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of developing mobile applications for diabetes is generally to: (1) provide enhanced access to timely information for patients, health care professionals, and researchers; (2) facilitate remote monitoring and diagnosis of patients, often based on information delivered by wearable devices; (3) provide decision support to assist patients in selecting treatment; or (4) deliver timely recommendations for treatment to increase adherence to prescribed therapy. There is a perception that mobile applications can provide meaningful clinical benefits, however, there is only sparse convincing evidence to support this belief at the present time. Compounding this problem is the short life span of digital software, such that if a traditional type of randomized controlled trial is conducted on a product, by the time the study has been designed, approved by an IRB, conducted, and analyzed, the product might have significantly changed to a next generation system. Because of great interest in establishing what are the potential benefits, metrics of success, and appropriate components of mobile applications for diabetes, Diabetes Technology Society and William Sansum Diabetes Center launched the Digital Diabetes Congress, March 7–8, 2017, in San Francisco. This report contains summaries of the meeting's 12 sessions. Each summary was written by the session's moderator who helped develop the session prior to the event and keep it on track during the event. This meeting report presents a summary of how 57 panelists, speakers, and moderators, who are leaders in digital health, see the current and future landscape of digital health tools applied to diabetes.

Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

### Patient-centered activity monitoring in the self-management of chronic health conditions [^11218d51]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In addition to usability factors, health literacy is of prime importance to maximize the benefit of consumer-accessible technology that may be utilized outside of clinical settings. According to the National Assessment of Adult Literacy, only 12% of US adults have proficient health literacy and over a third would have difficulty with following directions on a prescription drug label or maintaining a childhood immunization schedule based on a standard chart. In addition, limitations in numeracy, the ability to use numbers in daily living, are common in the US population. These limitations may make it difficult to comprehend and utilize personal data. Will patients understand visualized data, attribute meaning to the 'findings', and make behavioral changes if necessary? Wearable devices capture potentially useful and clinically impactful data, but these devices will gain wider adoption when patients find devices usable and their data comprehensible.

### Patient-centered activity monitoring in the self-management of chronic health conditions [^115JnATx]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

As activity tracking devices become smaller, cheaper, and more consumer-accessible, they will be used more extensively across a wide variety of contexts. The expansion of activity tracking and personal data collection offers the potential for patient engagement in the management of chronic diseases. Consumer wearable devices for activity tracking have shown promise in post-surgery recovery in cardiac patients, pulmonary rehabilitation, and activity counseling in diabetic patients, among others. Unfortunately, the data generated by wearable devices is seldom integrated into programmatic self-management chronic disease regimens. In addition, there is lack of evidence supporting sustained use or effects on health outcomes, as studies have primarily focused on establishing the feasibility of monitoring activity and the association of measured activity with short-term benefits.

Discussion

Monitoring devices can make a direct and real-time impact on self-management, but the validity and reliability of measurements need to be established. In order for patients to become engaged in wearable data gathering, key patient-centered issues relating to usefulness in care, motivation, the safety and privacy of information, and clinical integration need to be addressed. Because the successful usage of wearables requires an ability to comprehend and utilize personal health data, the user experience should account for individual differences in numeracy skills and apply evidence-based behavioral science principles to promote continued engagement.

Summary

Activity monitoring has the potential to engage patients as advocates in their personalized care, as well as offer health care providers real world assessments of their patients' daily activity patterns. This potential will be realized as the voice of the chronic disease patients is accounted for in the design of devices, measurements are validated against existing clinical assessments, devices become part of the treatment 'prescription', behavior change programs are used to engage patients in self-management, and best practices for clinical integration are defined.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune effector cell-related adverse events [^113Djar1]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). High credibility.

CAR T cell therapy — post-infusion monitoring and patient education: During the first week after infusion, patients are monitored two to three times and patients or their caregivers need to have a thermometer available to monitor and report any fever, and both products advise patients to remain within a 2-hour drive of their treatment center for 4 weeks. Product labeling, product-specific risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS), and trial-specific guidelines should inform the duration and frequency of monitoring after infusion. In patients deemed to be at high risk of developing CRS, inpatient treatment and/or more frequent monitoring may be warranted, and as centers gain more experience administering CAR T cell therapies, requirements for monitoring may be modified and outpatient administration may be initiated with the best judgment of the treating physician. Cellular therapy centers should educate patients and a primary caregiver regarding typical manifestations of CRS, and about specific actions to take if signs or symptoms occur.

### Delayed definitive management of localized prostate cancer: what do we know? [^116N7VP1]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

There are few important limitations that must be acknowledged. First, patients included on RCTs may be healthier than men in the general population. If this were true, we might be overestimating the benefits of delayed treatment because of competing risks, thus our estimates may be overly conservative. Another possible limitation is that with newer drugs and better imaging, progression could be detected earlier and patients with stable disease now requiring interventions could actually be spared definitive local treatment longer. In both of these scenarios, we would consider this more acceptable than asserting that an "unsafe" delay as being a "safe" delay. Thus, it appears that modest delays measured in weeks, months, and years for high-, intermediate-, and low-risk prostate cancer, respectively, appears to have relatively little impact on long-term outcomes. Furthermore, while we spoke about NHT or active surveillance as means to delay "definitive treatments", we acknowledge their significance in the management of prostate cancer. NHT, for example, is central in the radiotherapy management paradigm and its use, whether in the clinical trials that justified its inclusion or in daily clinical practice, was not originally designed to "delay" definitive treatments but rather to improve outcomes. Our goal, however, for this narrative review was mainly to give patients a rough estimate of a period in months or years which is deemed acceptable to specifically postpone surgery or radiation even if it entails other interventions such as NHT.

We are hopeful that the summary of the available data presented here will help facilitate transparent communication to patients and their families as well as primary care physicians as they consider making referrals and evidence-based recommendations concerning treatment delays in men with clinically localized prostate cancer. Given the unlikely possibility that clinical trials will be designed to answer this question, we hope this discussion clarifies the reasoning behind the recommendations for acceptable durations of treatment delays in patients with prostate cancer.

### Developing a framework and electronic tool for communicating diagnostic uncertainty in primary care: a qualitative study [^1167ZTcw]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic quality, as defined by the National Academy of Medicine Committee on Diagnostic Error in Healthcare, relies on effective communication. One key aspect of meaningful diagnostic communication and minimizing diagnostic errors is conveying diagnostic uncertainties to patients during clinical visits. However, there has been a paucity of studies and interventions addressing ways to best manage this critical element for conversing with patients regarding uncertainties in diagnosis.

The current state of the art regarding managing diagnostic uncertainty is both underdeveloped and contentious. Some have suggested that the absence of direct utterances of uncertainty or indirect expressions of imperfect knowledge reflects clinician unwillingness to acknowledge uncertainty. Medical training offers little guidance on how best to develop communication skills to convey uncertainty. Many fear that in expressing uncertainty clinicians risk being perceived by patients as less knowledgeable, confident, or competent. Nonetheless, inappropriate management of diagnostic uncertainty could result in either diagnostic delays (if patients are falsely reassured and do not perceive a need to consider alternative diagnoses) or unnecessary anxiety (if nonreassuring communication overly worries them).

Emerging evidence, as well as ethical standards respecting patient autonomy, show that acknowledging diagnostic uncertainty has potential benefits, including strengthening and fostering clinician-patient relationships and trust, promoting better patient engagement, and advancing shared decision-making. Patients who come to clinicians for reassurance (there is nothing serious) or a definitive explanation (your diagnosis is X) will not likely welcome what they might perceive as equivocal, vague, hedged, or evasive answers from physicians appearing to lack confidence, knowledge, and certainty. Yet honesty and transparency demand that clinicians more modestly step away from an arrogant overconfidence and candidly and accurately acknowledge what they do and do not know about the diagnosis. This transparency is a prerequisite to promoting shared decision-making and ensuring safe action plans, monitoring, and follow-up.

### Screening for hypertension in adults: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^114VwHvs]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF hypertension screening — screening intervals and implementation details. The USPSTF suggests annual screening for hypertension in adults 40 years or older and for adults at increased risk for hypertension (such as Black persons, persons with high-normal blood pressure, or persons who are overweight or obese). Screening less frequently (e.g., every 3 to 5 years) is appropriate for adults aged 18 to 39 years not at increased risk for hypertension and with a prior normal blood pressure reading. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring offers the most evidence-based risk information for future cardiovascular events. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring devices are small portable machines that record blood pressure noninvasively at typically 20- to 30-minute intervals over 12 to 24 hours while patients go about their normal activities or are asleep. Home blood pressure monitoring devices are fully automated oscillometric devices that record measurements taken from the patient's brachial artery, are activated by patients or caregivers, and measurements are taken much less frequently than with ABPM (eg, 1 to 2 times a day or week, although the blood pressure measurements can be spread out over more time).

### Reckoning with uncertainty to repair trust [^117TY3Cs]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

An eager MS1 drinks from the fountain of knowledge, filling her brain with medical facts, answering multiple‐choice questions dutifully, choosing the "single best right answer". An industrious MS3 proposes thoughtful courses of action in her oral presentation and gets feedback to "be more confident" and "put your nickel down". As she transitions to residency, the shades of grey multiply before her eyes, and she realizes quickly how patients "do not read the textbook". Lying awake in bed, unable to sleep, after a long day in the hospital as an attending, her brain runs through all aspects of the day where she had to navigate the stormy ship of uncertainty — how do I communicate this evolving picture to the family? How do I even begin to hand this patient off to the next provider? How do I know what I'll be walking into in the morning?

Diagnostic and prognostic uncertainty are ubiquitous throughout patients' care journeys, yet the dominant culture within medical education does little to acknowledge it, and even actively discourages communicating uncertainty. But falsely expressing certainty can have dire consequences, for both patients, clinicians, and the public alike. Although we can never truly take the uncertainty out of medical care, effectively reckoning with uncertainty, conveying it on rounds, and expressing it to patients and families can ultimately deepen our relationships with patients and improve trust in health care.

### 2023 HRS / EHRA / APHRS / LAHRS expert consensus statement on practical management of the remote device clinic [^115uEtZo]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Remote monitoring (RM) patient education — timing and hands-on instruction — Formalized education on RM is an opportunity to enhance the understanding of practical device function and alert management, and it is recommended that these educational efforts begin prior to implantation, preferably during the discussion for indication of the device; as ongoing connectivity is paramount for appropriate monitoring, the importance of its maintenance should be included in standardized education. Survey-based studies have demonstrated that patients feel they receive less information and interact less with providers when they are remotely monitored than if they had in-person care, and doing an in-person, hands-on demonstration of the manufacturer-specific transmitter or the software that the patient will use for RM can provide an opportunity to answer all questions about the system; while this is not feasible for all patients all of the time, it should be considered as part of the initial educational process to establish trust, and increased knowledge and understanding may improve patient adherence and connectivity to RM.

Cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) remote monitoring (RM) — documentation and patient engagement — emphasizes that information from RM visits can be recorded so the whole team can access it, noting that the data "can be documented in the device clinic database, the electronic health record, or both, with critical information available to the entire care team". It identifies a common actionable alert because "Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation is perhaps the most frequent abnormality detected by RM and is a trigger for the clinic staff to assess patients' risk of thromboembolic events", and states that "Operational efficiency and quality of care can be greatly enhanced by establishing, in advance, a clear strategy for documenting anticoagulation considerations and lines for communicating this information between allied professionals and physicians". For patient and family engagement, "we recommend that clinics develop a guidance document for patients and families to facilitate their engagement in the RM process by clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of each party", with either "a signed patient–clinician agreement" or medical-record documentation of education acceptable because "either approach is reasonable".

### Regulation catches up to reality [^111q4rws]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

The FDA recently conducted an Advisory Panel meeting to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and benefits of granting a nonadjunctive label claim for the DEXCOM G5 Mobile continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. If approved, this claim will allow users to make day-to-day treatment decisions, including insulin dosing directly from the glucose values and rate of changes arrows generated by the CGM device, without the requirement of a confirmatory measurement with a self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) meter. Sporadic SMBG testing gives limited data, while CGM gives a value every 5 minutes and has alerts, alarms, trending information and allows caregivers to follow the user in real time 24/7. This indication will lead to more wide spread use of CGM and improve overall care with protection of hypoglycemia.

### Establishing a continuous glucose monitoring program [^113scBGp]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2008). Low credibility.

Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) devices provide detailed information on glucose patterns and trends, and alarms that alert the patient to both hyper- and hypoglycemia. This technology can dramatically improve the day-to-day management of patients with diabetes and promises to be a major advance in diabetes care. The safe and effective use of RT-CGM in diabetes management rests on an understanding of several physiological as well as technological issues. This article outlines the key issues that should be addressed in the training curriculum for patients starting on RT-CGM: (1) physiologic lag between interstitial and blood glucose levels and the implications for device calibration, and interpretation and use of data in diabetes management; (2) practical considerations with the use of sensor alarms and caveats in the setting of alarm thresholds; and (3) potential risk for hypoglycemia related to excessive postprandial bolusing by RT-CGM users, and the practical implications for patient training.

ACMG — PRS reporting and counseling: Negative or low risk results should have language to ensure that these results are not misunderstood as having no risk for disease, and individuals indicated as negative or low risk by a polygenic risk score (PRS) or integrated risk score should still monitor their risk of developing that disease as nongenetic risk factors may increase risk with time. Recommendations for post-test counseling are covered in the accompanying points to consider, including issues surrounding clinical management/actionability, familial risks, and personal utility/psychosocial considerations. Integration of PRSs into clinical reporting has been implemented in multiple disease settings; however, the approaches of communicating PRS are highly variable, a more personalized way of risk communication is required for PRS reporting, and the limitations and uncertainties of PRSs should be clearly indicated in the report.

### Time signal [^114MGGtj]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

A time signal is a visible, audible, mechanical, or electronic signal used as a reference to determine the time of day. Today, global navigation satellite systems radio signals are used to precisely distribute time signals over much of the world. There are many commercially available radio controlled clocks available to accurately indicate the local time, both for business and residential use. Computers often set their time from an Internet atomic clock source. Where this is not available, a locally connected GNSS receiver can precisely set the time using one of several software applications. Audible and visible time signals One sort of public time signal is a striking clock. These clocks are only as good as the clockwork that activates them, but they have improved substantially since the first clocks from the 14th century. Until modern times, a public clock such as Big Ben was the only time standard the general public needed.

Accurate knowledge of time of day is essential for navigation, and ships carried the most accurate marine chronometers available, although they did not keep perfect time. A number of accurate audible or visible time signals were established in many seaport cities to enable navigators to set their chronometers. Sirens, whistles, and other audible signals In many Midwestern US cities where tornadoes are a common hazard, the emergency sirens are tested regularly at a specified time; while not primarily intended to mark the time, local people often check their watches when they hear this signal. In many non-seafaring communities, loud factory whistles served as public time signals before radio made them obsolete. The first time ball was erected at Portsmouth, England in 1829 by its inventor Robert Wauchope. One was installed in 1833 on the roof of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London, and the time ball has dropped at 1: 00 pm every day since then.

The first American time ball went into service in 1845. In New York City, the ceremonial Times Square Ball drop on New Year's Eve in Times Square is a vestige of a visual time signal. United States Telegraph signals were used regularly for time coordination by the United States Naval Observatory starting in 1865. By the late 1800s, many U. S. observatories were selling accurate time by offering a regional time signal service. Sandford Fleming proposed a single 24-hour clock for the entire world. At a meeting of the Royal Canadian Institute on 8 February 1879 he linked it to the anti-meridian of Greenwich. He suggested that standard time zones could be used locally, but they were subordinate to his single world time. Standard time came into existence in the United States on 18 November 1883. Earlier, on 11 October 1883, the General Time Convention, forerunner to the American Railway Association, approved a plan that divided the United States into several time zones.

On that November day, the US Naval Observatory telegraphed a signal that coordinated noon at Eastern standard time with 11 am Central, 10 am Mountain, and 9 am Pacific standard time. A March 1905 issue of The Technical World describes the role of the United States Naval Observatory as a source of time signals: One of the most important functions of the Naval Observatory is found in the daily distribution of the correct time to every portion of the United States. This is effected by means of telegraphic signals, which are sent out from Washington at noon daily, except Sundays. The original object of this time service was to furnish mariners in the seaboard cities with the means of regulating their chronometers; but, like many another governmental activity, its scope has gradually broadened until it has become of general usefulness.

### Committee for accuracy in middle east reporting and analysis [^116pjGpB]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

The Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis, formerly the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America, is an American nonprofit pro-Israel media-monitoring, research, and membership organization. According to its website, CAMERA is "devoted to promoting accurate and balanced coverage of Israel and the Middle East. " The group says it was founded in 1982 "to respond to The Washington Post's coverage of Israel's Lebanon incursion", and to respond to what it considers the media's "general anti-Israel bias". CAMERA is known for its media monitoring and advocacy. It releases reports to counter what it calls "frequently inaccurate and skewed characterizations of Israel and of events in the Middle East" that it believes may fuel anti-Israel and anti-Jewish prejudice.

The group mobilizes protests against what it deems unfair media coverage by issuing full-page ads in newspapers, organizing demonstrations, and encouraging sponsors to withhold funds. History CAMERA has chapters in major US cities and Israel, including New York City, Chicago, Washington, D. C. Los Angeles, Miami, and in 1988 a Boston chapter and headquarters, founded and led by Andrea Levin; Charles Jacobs became deputy director of the Boston chapter. In 1991, Levin succeeded Winifred Meiselman as executive director of CAMERA. According to the organization's website, CAMERA's membership grew from 1, 000 in 1991 to 55, 000 in 2007. The director of CAMERA's Washington office is Eric Rozenman. In 2002, The Jewish Daily Forward named CAMERA executive director and regular Jerusalem Post contributor Andrea Levin America's fifth most influential Jewish citizen, writing, "Media-monitoring was the great proxy war of the last year, and its general is Andrea Levin".

Structure, staff, and activities On its website, CAMERA calls itself "a media-monitoring, research and membership organization devoted to promoting accurate and balanced coverage of Israel and the Middle East" that "fosters rigorous reporting, while educating news consumers about Middle East issues and the role of the media. " CAMERA also calls itself a "non-partisan organization" that "takes no position with regard to American or Israeli political issues or with regard to ultimate solutions to the Arab–Israeli conflict". When CAMERA perceives an inaccurate statement in the media, it says it gathers information, sends findings, and asks for a printed or broadcast correction. CAMERA lists 46 news outlets it says have issued corrections based on its work. The organization also publishes monographs about topics relating to the Arab-Israeli conflict. CAMERA reports it has over 65, 000 paying members.

CAMERA runs a student-focused site containing specialized information available for countering misinformation. It also provides one-on-one assistance to students who encounter Middle East distortions in campus publications, flyers, rallies and classroom teaching. CAMERA has offered student representative positions that include compensation and training in Israel. CAMERA-UK is the UK division of CAMERA. Criticism by CAMERA Among the organizations and works that have been criticized by CAMERA are: National Public Radio. CAMERA's 2001 report "A Record of Bias: National Public Radio's Coverage of the Arab–Israeli Conflict: September 26 – November 26, 2000" asserted that National Public Radio's "coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict has long been marred by a striking anti-Israel tilt, with severe bias, error and lack of balance commonplace".

### Input hypothesis [^114GkTzv]. Wikipedia (2024). Medium credibility.

The input hypothesis, also known as the monitor model, is a group of five hypotheses of second-language acquisition developed by the linguist Stephen Krashen in the 1970s and 1980s. Krashen originally formulated the input hypothesis as just one of the five hypotheses, but over time the term has come to refer to the five hypotheses as a group. The hypotheses are the input hypothesis, the acquisition–learning hypothesis, the monitor hypothesis, the natural order hypothesis and the affective filter hypothesis. The input hypothesis was first published in 1977. Input hypothesis If i represents previously acquired linguistic competence and extra-linguistic knowledge, the hypothesis claims that we move from i to i+1 by understanding input that contains i+1. Extra-linguistic knowledge includes our knowledge of the world and of the situation, that is, the context.

The +1 represents 'the next increment' of new knowledge or language structure that will be within the learner's capacity to acquire. model of a language, a "theory" about a language. Monitor hypothesis The monitor hypothesis asserts that a learner's learned system acts as a monitor to what they are producing. In other words, while only the acquired system is able to produce spontaneous speech, the learned system is used to check what is being spoken. Before the learner produces an utterance, he or she internally scans it for errors, and uses the learned system to make corrections. Self-correction occurs when the learner uses the Monitor to correct a sentence after it is uttered. According to the hypothesis, such self-monitoring and self-correction are the only functions of conscious language learning.

The Monitor model then predicts faster initial progress by adults than children, as adults use this 'monitor' when producing L2 utterances before having acquired the ability for natural performance, and adult learners will input more into conversations earlier than children. Three conditions for use of the monitor According to Krashen, for the Monitor to be successfully used, three conditions must be met: The acquirer/learner must know the rule This is a very difficult condition to meet because it means that the speaker must have had explicit instruction on the language form that he or she is trying to produce. The acquirer must be focused on correctness He or she must be thinking about form, and it is difficult to focus on meaning and form at the same time. The acquirer/learner must have time to use the monitor Using the monitor requires the speaker to slow down and focus on form.

Difficulties using the monitor There are many difficulties with the use of the monitor, making the monitor rather weak as a language tool. Knowing the rule: this is a difficult condition to meet, because even the best students do not learn every rule that is taught, cannot remember every rule they have learned, and can't always correctly apply the rules they do remember. Furthermore, not every rule of a language is always included in a text or taught by the teacher. Having time to use the monitor: there is a price that is paid for the use of the monitor- the speaker is then focused on form rather than meaning, resulting in the production and exchange of less information, thus slowing the flow of conversation. Some speakers over-monitor to the point that the conversation is painfully slow and sometimes difficult to listen to. The rules of language make up only a small portion of our language competence: Acquisition does not provide 100% language competence.

### 2010s global surveillance disclosures [^112yqq4p]. Wikipedia (2025). Medium credibility.

The Guardian not to publish any more leaks, or it will receive a DA-Notice. In November 2013, a criminal investigation of the disclosure was undertaken by Britain's Metropolitan Police Service. In December 2013, The Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said: "We have published I think 26 documents so far out of the 58, 000 we've seen".
- Journalist Leslie Cauley of USA Today, who revealed in 2006 that the NSA is keeping a massive database of Americans' phone calls
- AT&T employee Mark Klein, who revealed in 2006 the existence of Room 641A of the NSA
- Activists Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning, who revealed in 2011 the existence of the mass surveillance industry
- Journalist Michael Hastings, who revealed in 2012 that protestors of the Occupy Wall Street movement were kept under surveillance.

Under the order, the numbers of both parties on a call, as well as the location data, unique identifiers, time of call, and duration of call were handed over to the FBI, which turned over the records to the NSA. According to The Wall Street Journal, the Verizon order is part of a controversial data program, which seeks to stockpile records on all calls made in the U. S., but does not collect information directly from T-Mobile US and Verizon Wireless, in part because of their foreign ownership ties. On June 6, 2013, the second media disclosure, the revelation of the PRISM surveillance program, was published simultaneously by The Guardian and The Washington Post.

During the 2009 G-20 London summit, the British intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters intercepted the communications of foreign diplomats. In addition, GCHQ has been intercepting and storing mass quantities of fiber-optic traffic via Tempora. Two principal components of Tempora are called "Mastering the Internet" and "Global Telecoms Exploitation". The data is preserved for three days while metadata is kept for thirty days. Data collected by the GCHQ under Tempora is shared with the National Security Agency in the United States. From 2001 to 2011, the NSA collected vast amounts of metadata records detailing the email and internet usage of Americans via Stellar Wind, which was later terminated due to operational and resource constraints. It was subsequently replaced by newer surveillance programs such as ShellTrumpet, which " processed its one trillionth metadata record" by the end of December 2012.
- keep data that could potentially contain details of U. S. persons for up to five years;
- retain and make use of "inadvertently acquired" domestic communications if they contain usable intelligence, information on criminal activity, threat of harm to people or property, are encrypted, or are believed to contain any information relevant to cybersecurity;.
- preserve "foreign intelligence information" contained within attorney–client communications; and
- access the content of communications gathered from "U. S. based machine" or phone numbers in order to establish if targets are located in the U. S., for the purposes of ceasing further surveillance. According to Boundless Informant, over 97 billion pieces of intelligence were collected over a 30-day period ending in March 2013. Out of all 97 billion sets of information, about 3 billion data sets originated from U. S. computer networks and around 500 million metadata records were collected from German networks.
