## Question

What conditions can lead to chronic hyperkalemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which conditions can lead to chronic hyperkalemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how chronic hyperkalemia is defined and distinguished from acute or transient elevations. Then, I should verify the core renal-aldosterone mechanisms that normally maintain potassium balance. Next, I will categorize causal conditions by organ system and by drug effects, making sure to check common high-risk combinations. After that, I will assess the strength of evidence behind each category. Finally, I will synthesize a concise summary and briefly note management implications that interact with these etiologies, anchoring each step in the literature to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the working definition so we are not mixing acute with chronic processes. Chronic hyperkalemia typically refers to persistently elevated serum potassium above 5.0–5.5 mmol/L over time rather than a single spike, and while mild elevations are often asymptomatic, sustained hyperkalemia raises the risk of arrhythmias, neuromuscular symptoms, and mortality, so I need to keep both the numeric threshold and chronicity in view as I proceed [^113hTA5U] [^114LR5UT] [^113MwkGx].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiologic pillars that, when impaired, cause sustained hyperkalemia; wait, let me verify them against mechanistic sources. Chronic hyperkalemia results when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in GFR, distal tubular flow, distal sodium delivery, or aldosterone-dependent transporter expression in the distal nephron, with urinary pH dynamics sometimes contributing; importantly, with normal renal and adrenal function, sustained hyperkalemia is uncommon, so I should keep defects in these axes front-and-center [^116K12bP] [^1157By8d] [^1144kANq].

> I will now examine renal disorders, since they are the most common drivers and often set the stage for chronicity. Chronic kidney disease, especially once eGFR falls below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², shows a stepwise rise in risk such that each ~15 mL/min decrement roughly doubles hyperkalemia odds; end-stage kidney disease and dialysis cohorts show frequent pre-dialysis potassium > 5.5 mmol/L, and even AKI can precipitate sustained elevations if tubular secretion is impaired, while diabetic nephropathy and tubulointerstitial nephritis contribute via distal secretory defects that persist beyond acute episodes [^113MwkGx] [^114XLerS] [^113DtGn3] [^114pkijU] [^114LR5UT].

> Hold on, I should verify endocrine and metabolic contributors because they often coexist with renal disease and amplify risk. Diabetes mellitus is a key independent risk factor via hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism and insulin deficiency that reduces cellular potassium uptake; primary adrenal insufficiency and other hypoaldosterone states also impair distal secretion, and type 4 renal tubular acidosis presents with hyperkalemia and a non–anion gap metabolic acidosis out of proportion to GFR decline, reflecting aldosterone deficiency or resistance and impaired ammoniagenesis in chronic settings [^1157By8d] [^1152VKcy] [^113Ufgrd].

> Let me consider cardiovascular disease next, but I need to be careful not to conflate disease and treatment effects. Heart failure, particularly HFrEF, predisposes to chronic hyperkalemia through renal hypoperfusion and frequent use of RAAS inhibitors and MRAs, and hypertension contributes largely via treatment exposure and overlapping CKD; prevalence estimates in HF vary with therapy intensity, underscoring the interplay between disease biology and guideline-directed medications [^1162h5y3] [^111pQ93Y] [^111T7zcF].

> I should double-check medication-induced causes because they are both common and modifiable. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors reduce aldosterone signaling; MRAs further block mineralocorticoid action with trial-level hyperkalemia rates around 9.3% on MRA versus 4.3% on placebo and higher with spironolactone than eplerenone; potassium-sparing diuretics such as amiloride and triamterene, NSAIDs that blunt renin and reduce renal perfusion, trimethoprim acting like an ENaC blocker, beta-blockers reducing cellular uptake, and agents like heparin or azoles that suppress aldosterone synthesis all contribute to sustained elevations when background renal reserve is limited [^111T7zcF] [^113jGwY1] [^116k6yrZ] [^115ZVoGL] [^116K12bP].

> But wait, what about patient-level risk modifiers that tip a marginal system into chronic hyperkalemia; I should review those. Older age, male sex, lower BMI, smoking, and comorbid cardiovascular disease such as coronary disease or stroke, as well as gout in HF cohorts, are associated with higher risk and often cluster with CKD and polypharmacy, increasing the likelihood that hyperkalemia becomes recurrent or chronic rather than isolated [^114XLerS] [^111pQ93Y] [^114LR5UT].

> I need to check for genetic conditions, even if rare, that produce sustained abnormalities in distal sodium-potassium handling. Gordon's syndrome (pseudohypoaldosteronism type II) increases NCC activity, reduces distal sodium delivery, and causes chronic hyperkalemia with hypertension, with experimental models linking hyperkalemia to impaired ammoniagenesis and metabolic acidosis that are reversible with thiazide therapy, underscoring the mechanistic role of distal tubular transport [^116TbWtp] [^113Ufgrd].

> Hold on, I should verify the special case of dialysis populations because the dynamics differ and chronicity is the rule. In hemodialysis, pre-dialysis hyperkalemia is common, especially across the long interdialytic interval, and contributes to arrhythmic risk and hospitalizations; although extrarenal disposal mechanisms adapt, the sustained interdialytic elevation qualifies as chronic hyperkalemia and often necessitates binder use and dietary strategies tailored to dialysis schedules [^113DtGn3] [^117ADNFa] [^112Ruzdf].

> Let me synthesize common clinical scenarios that reliably produce chronic hyperkalemia so I do not miss high-yield combinations. The most frequent is CKD plus RAAS inhibitor therapy, where declining GFR and pharmacologic aldosterone blockade converge; diabetes with CKD on an MRA compounds hypoaldosteronism with receptor antagonism; heart failure with CKD and polypharmacy (ACEi or ARB plus MRA plus beta-blocker) adds renal hypoperfusion and impaired cellular uptake; and diabetic type 4 RTA presents with persistent hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis even when GFR decline is modest [^1158LEyx] [^113jGwY1] [^111pQ93Y] [^114pkijU].

> I should confirm the strength of evidence behind these links to ensure I am weighting them appropriately. Large CKD meta-analyses and pharmacoepidemiologic studies support CKD stage, diabetes, and RAASi/MRA exposure as dominant risks, and randomized trial data quantify MRA-attributable hyperkalemia, while cardiovascular outcome datasets in CKD associate hyperkalemia with adverse events, albeit with residual confounding that warrants cautious interpretation [^113MwkGx] [^116k6yrZ] [^115gTidH].

> Hmm, wait a minute, the user did not ask for management, but etiologies interact tightly with therapeutic decisions; briefly, I should note how this shapes practice. Guidelines emphasize identifying and monitoring at-risk patients, treating detected hyperkalemia at ≥ 5.5–6.0 mmol/L depending on context, and considering potassium binders such as patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate to enable continuation of life-prolonging RAASi/MRA therapy when feasible rather than reflexively discontinuing these agents, with close laboratory follow-up to prevent recurrence [^113YXfBL] [^111k6kg1] [^1158LEyx] [^114m84Ux] [^116TbWtp].

> Finalizing the synthesis, I need to ensure I have clearly answered the question about conditions leading to chronic hyperkalemia. Chronic hyperkalemia most often reflects sustained impairment of renal potassium excretion due to renal disorders such as CKD (including diabetic nephropathy), ESRD and dialysis dependence, or AKI with persistent distal secretory defects; endocrine-metabolic states including diabetes with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, primary hypoaldosteronism, and type 4 RTA; cardiovascular disease, especially heart failure and hypertension, largely via neurohormonal effects and required RAASi/MRA therapy; medication effects from RAAS inhibitors, MRAs, potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs, trimethoprim, beta-blockers, heparin, and azoles; patient-specific amplifiers including older age, male sex, low BMI, smoking, and vascular comorbidity; and rarer genetic disorders such as Gordon's syndrome, with risk magnified when these factors co-occur, particularly CKD plus RAAS blockade [^1158LEyx] [^114XLerS] [^113jGwY1] [^113DtGn3] [^116TbWtp].

---

Chronic hyperkalemia is most often due to **impaired renal excretion** [^113hTA5U] from CKD or AKI, and is frequently worsened by **RAAS inhibitors** (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, MRAs) [^113jGwY1], potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs, heparin [^113MwkGx], and trimethoprim [^116TbWtp]. Additional causes include **hypoaldosteronism** [^1152VKcy] (Addison's, type IV RTA), **diabetes**, adrenal disease, and high potassium intake or supplements, especially with reduced kidney function [^113MwkGx] [^114dKtnY]. Chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular risk [^115gTidH], particularly in CKD and heart failure [^113MwkGx].

---

## Impaired renal excretion

The kidneys are central to potassium homeostasis [^113hTA5U]; **CKD and AKI** are the principal drivers of chronic hyperkalemia [^113MwkGx].

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Hyperkalemia risk rises as eGFR falls, especially below 15 mL/min/1.73 m² [^114XLerS] [^113MwkGx].
- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Reduced GFR and distal sodium delivery acutely impair potassium excretion [^113hTA5U].
- **Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) type IV**: Hypoaldosteronism or aldosterone resistance causes hyperkalemia with metabolic acidosis [^1152VKcy] [^117JSfaR].

---

## Medications

Several drug classes impair **renal potassium excretion** or cause transcellular shifts, increasing hyperkalemia risk.

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| RAAS inhibitors | ACE inhibitors, ARBs, MRAs | Reduced aldosterone, decreased renal K+ excretion [^113jGwY1] [^111T7zcF] |
| Potassium-sparing diuretics | Spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride, triamterene | Reduced renal K+ excretion [^113jGwY1] [^116k6yrZ] |
| NSAIDs | Ibuprofen, naproxen | Reduced renal perfusion, decreased K+ excretion [^113MwkGx] [^116TbWtp] |
| Heparin | Heparin | Suppresses aldosterone, reduced K+ excretion [^113MwkGx] |
| Trimethoprim | Trimethoprim | Amiloride-like effect, reduced K+ excretion [^113jGwY1] |

---

## Endocrine disorders

Endocrine conditions that **reduce aldosterone** or its action promote hyperkalemia, including **hypoaldosteronism** [^1152VKcy] — as in Addison's disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia — which impairs K+ excretion, and **diabetes mellitus**, in which hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism (type IV RTA) is common and causes hyperkalemia [^114dKtnY].

---

## Increased potassium intake

Excess intake rarely causes hyperkalemia alone [^114dKtnY] but can **precipitate it when excretion is impaired** [^113hTA5U]. Sources include **dietary** high-potassium foods and salt substitutes [^113MwkGx] when renal function is reduced, and **potassium supplements** (oral or IV), which can cause hyperkalemia, especially with impaired excretion [^116TbWtp].

---

## Transcellular shifts

Conditions that **shift potassium from cells to plasma** [^114dKtnY] can contribute to chronic hyperkalemia, including **metabolic acidosis** [^113hTA5U], where H+/K+ exchange increases extracellular K+, and **cell lysis** (rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis, hemolysis), which releases intracellular K+.

---

## Clinical implications

Chronic hyperkalemia **increases mortality and cardiovascular risk** [^115gTidH], particularly in CKD and heart failure [^113MwkGx]. **Management** focuses on identifying and correcting causes, adjusting medications, and monitoring potassium and renal function [^112sDH5S].

---

Chronic hyperkalemia is primarily due to impaired renal excretion, medication effects, endocrine disorders, increased intake, and transcellular shifts [^113hTA5U], with **CKD and RAAS inhibitors** as the most common contributors [^111T7zcF].

### Hyperkalemia: Pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^113jGwY1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Due to the pivotal role of aldosterone in the control of potassium homeostasis, MR antagonist (MRA) therapy is a risk factor for hyperkalemia. In a meta-analysis of RCTs conducted in over 16,000 patients with heart failure or after myocardial infarction, hyperkalemia — defined by the individual studies as [K+] > 5.5 or 6.0 mM — occurred in 4.3% of patients allocated to placebo versus 9.3% of patients allocated to MRAs.

Famously, dangerous hyperkalemia became more common after the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) study, which demonstrated a morbidity and mortality benefit from spironolactone therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Large-scale data linkage in a Canadian population revealed that the rates of both hospitalization for hyperkalemia and in-hospital hyperkalemia-related mortality more than doubled after the publication of RALES in September 1999.

In animal models and in Phase 1/2 clinical trials, novel non-steroidal MR antagonists have a more favorable therapeutic index than spironolactone or eplerenone; that is, they carry a lower risk of hyperkalemia at therapeutic doses in heart failure and proteinuric CKD.

Large data-linkage studies are helping to quantify the risk of hyperkalemia associated with other medications. For example, trimethoprim prescription for urinary tract infection (compared with alternative antibiotics) was associated with a small increase in the odds of hyperkalemia in patients over 65 years of age. For every 1000 infections, treatment with trimethoprim rather than alternative options increased the risk of hyperkalemia.

### Hyperkalemia: Pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^116K12bP]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

These molecular processes explain why hyperkalemia invariably occurs in response to stimuli that limit any of five key parameters: (i) glomerular filtration rate, (ii) tubular flow rate, (iii) sodium delivery to the distal nephron, (iv) the expression of potassium and sodium channels in the apical cell membrane and the sodium–potassium pump in the basolateral membrane (controlled by aldosterone signaling), and (v) urinary pH.

In clinical practice, the first three of these are frequently encountered together, explaining the pathogenesis of hyperkalemia in acute kidney injury (AKI). The normal physiological response to volume depletion drives upregulation of aldosterone synthesis so that any reductions in (i)–(iii) are offset by increases in (iv), maintaining potassium homeostasis. Hyperkalemia ensues when this response is prevented, for example, by renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors or MR blockers.

Hyperkalemia can occur when NCC activity is stimulated, leading to reduced reabsorption of sodium through the electrogenic pathway. The archetypal example of this is type II pseudohypoaldosteronism (Gordon's syndrome), in which inherited mutations disrupt normal ion transport processes.

### Potassium management with finerenone: Practical aspects [^113MwkGx]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Abnormal serum potassium concentrations represent one of the most important electrolyte disorders in clinical practice. Potassium plays a critical role in normal cell membrane electrophysiology, with both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia leading to electrophysiological perturbations. While mild hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic, high potassium concentrations can cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or paralysis. The kidneys play a central role in potassium homeostasis. Kidney dysfunction and acquired or inherited defects in potassium excretion in the distal nephron are among the most important risk factors for hyperkalemia. Accordingly, the main risk factors for hyperkalemia are kidney failure, diabetes mellitus, and adrenal disease.

An international meta-analysis of over 1.2 million patients with CKD from 27 different cohorts examined the risk factors leading to hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia correlated strongly with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): a decrease in eGFR of 15 ml/min per 1.73 m² approximately doubled the risk of hyperkalemia. While lower eGFR was a strong risk factor for hyperkalemia, higher albuminuria was a weaker risk factor. Furthermore, medications such as potassium-sparing diuretics, MRAs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, direct renin antagonists, β-blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, heparin, and penicillin are associated with hyperkalemia. Potassium supplements and potassium-based salt substitutes may also be a cause of hyperkalemia, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Mechanisms in hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis [^1152VKcy]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The form of renal tubular acidosis associated with hyperkalemia is usually attributable to real or apparent hypoaldosteronism. It is therefore a common feature in diabetes and a number of other conditions associated with underproduction of renin or aldosterone. In addition, the close relationship between potassium levels and ammonia production dictates that hyperkalemia per se can lead to acidosis. Here, I describe the modern relationship between the molecular function of the distal portion of the nephron, pathways of ammoniagenesis, and hyperkalemia.

### Antihypertensive medications and the prevalence of hyperkalemia in a large health system [^111T7zcF]. Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Little is known about the frequency and patterns of hyperkalemia in clinical settings. We evaluated the association between baseline antihypertensive medications that may affect potassium levels — angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, loop/thiazide diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics — and hyperkalemia, defined by potassium > 5 mEq/L and > 5.5 mEq/L, over a 3-year period in 194,456 outpatients in the Geisinger Health System, as well as actions taken after an episode of hyperkalemia.

- **Prevalence**: The proportions of patients with potassium levels > 5 mEq/L and > 5.5 mEq/L occurred in 10.8% and 2.3% of all patients over the 3-year period; among patients with ≥ 4 measurements per year, corresponding values were 39.4% and 14.6%. Most cases of hyperkalemia occurred only once during follow-up.

- **Association with medication**: The antihypertensive medication class most strongly associated with hyperkalemia was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

- **Follow-up care**: Among patients with a measurement of potassium > 5.5 mEq/L, only 24% were seen by a nephrologist and 5.2% were seen by a dietician during the 3-year period.

- **Short-term actions**: Short-term actions following a potassium measurement > 5.5 mEq/L included emergency room visits (3.1% within 7 days), remeasurement of potassium (44.3% within 14 days), and change in a potassium-altering medication (26.4% within 60 days). The most common medication changes were discontinuation or dose reduction of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker or potassium-sparing diuretic.

### Hyperkalemia and the risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^115gTidH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Proposed mechanisms linking hyperkalemia to cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have long been based on increased levels of aldosterone secretion due to higher serum potassium concentrations. The acutely elevated serum potassium levels associated with hyperkalemia can lead to kidney inflammation and fibrosis and have been associated with a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmia, caused by disruptions of myocardial action potentials that can interrupt typical heart rhythms. Although this underlying pathway may partially explain the observed outcomes, the majority of patients with hyperkalemia in the study had mild or moderate hyperkalemia at the index date. This suggests that hyperkalemia increases the risk of cardiovascular events through multiple mechanisms.

A prior study examining the impact of mild hyperkalemia compared with normokalemia on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure in the United States and Canada between 1991 and 1993 found no association between mild hyperkalemia and cardiovascular-related hospitalization. However, the sample size was smaller and the follow-up duration was shorter relative to the present study, which may explain the difference between findings. Together, the overall evidence suggests that hyperkalemia is implicated as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease in a population with CKD.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^113YXfBL]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to indications for outpatient treatment, UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend initiating interventions to lower serum potassium in patients with serum potassium levels ≥ 5.5 mmol/L.

### Hyperkalemia and the risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116ye132]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

This study established a clear temporal relationship between hyperkalemia and cardiovascular events by implementing a rigorous design to ensure a robust estimate of the association and to mitigate potential bias due to reverse causality as well as residual confounding. The large database of adjudicated and closed insurance medical and pharmacy claims, as well as more detailed data from the electronic medical records used for this study, provided a rich set of data on a large number of eligible patients, with all encounters covered by the insurance provider visible in the database. To mitigate differences between patients with and without hyperkalemia, we employed double matching techniques to tightly control for baseline CKD stage and other potential confounding factors. Furthermore, the study is the first to provide a characterization of the risk of cardiovascular event outcomes by substudies of patients with mild hyperkalemia, patients treated with RAASi, and patients with CKD stage 3b, patients who are generally thought to be at modest risk of hyperkalemia and who may not experience associated complications.

The results of this study should be interpreted in light of certain limitations. First, some variables of interest, including the cause of death to determine the rate of cardiovascular mortality and the clinical cause of cardiovascular events, were not available. Second, although the double matching approach used in the study controls for many potential confounders, residual confounding by variables not included in the analysis remains a possibility.

### Mechanism of hyperkalemia-induced metabolic acidosis [^117JSfaR]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia in association with metabolic acidosis that is out of proportion to changes in glomerular filtration rate defines type 4 renal tubular acidosis (RTA), the most common RTA observed. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the associated metabolic acidosis are incompletely understood. We sought to determine whether hyperkalemia directly causes metabolic acidosis and, if so, the mechanisms through which this occurs.

- **Methods**: We studied a genetic model of hyperkalemia that results from early distal convoluted tubule (DCT)-specific overexpression of constitutively active Ste20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (DCT-CA-SPAK).

- **Results**: DCT-CA-SPAK mice developed hyperkalemia in association with metabolic acidosis and suppressed ammonia excretion; however, titratable acid excretion and urine pH were unchanged compared with those in wild-type mice. Abnormal ammonia excretion in DCT-CA-SPAK mice was associated with decreased proximal tubule expression of the ammonia-generating enzymes phosphate-dependent glutaminase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and overexpression of the ammonia-recycling enzyme glutamine synthetase. These mice also had decreased expression of the ammonia transporter family member Rhcg and decreased apical polarization of H+-ATPase in the inner stripe of the outer medullary collecting duct. Correcting the hyperkalemia by treatment with hydrochlorothiazide corrected the metabolic acidosis, increased ammonia excretion, and normalized ammoniagenic enzyme and Rhcg expression in DCT-CA-SPAK mice.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^1157By8d]. Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

There have been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article, we discuss these advances within a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors, and consequences of hyperkalemia. We highlight aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice.

Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery, or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron. Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or potassium-sparing diuretics.

Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, only partially explicable by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis. Hyperkalemia — or the fear of hyperkalemia — contributes to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure. The newer potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing of renin-angiotensin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid antagonists in this context.

### The burden of hyperkalemia in Germany - a real world evidence study assessing the treatment and costs of hyperkalemia [^114LR5UT]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia (HK) is a potentially life-threatening metabolic condition characterized by an increased serum concentration of potassium. Normal values of potassium range from 3.5 to 5 mmol/l, and hyperkalemia is defined by a value of ≥ 5.1 mmol/l; some authors prefer a low limit of 5.5 mmol/l.

Clinical symptoms of hyperkalemia are inconstant and unspecific, such as fatigue and muscular weakness; however, hyperkalemia can cause arrhythmia and heart arrest without pre-occurring clinical signs. The condition of hyperkalemia is usually detected during routine laboratory screening. In light of possibly life-threatening consequences, a finding of hyperkalemia implies an urgent demand for medical clarification and treatment.

The predominant risk factor of hyperkalemia is advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). In patients with CKD stage ≥ 3 (GFR < 60 ml/min), the decreased ability to excrete potassium, especially in combination with diabetes mellitus and/or heart failure, frequently results in recurrent and chronic hyperkalemia. Medication (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors), and lifestyle factors (e.g. irregular nutrition and circadian rhythm) are additional risk factors.

The true incidence and prevalence of hyperkalemia in the general population is not known, as there are no population-wide studies that examine it. A retrospective analysis based on a selected Canadian population (≥ 65 years) demonstrates that 2.6% of the individuals from the emergency department and 3.5% of the hospitalized patients were affected.

### Renal tubular acidosis type IV in hyperkalaemic patients — a fairy tale or reality [^114pkijU]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Hyperkalaemia is a common feature in hospitalized patients and is often attributed to drugs antagonizing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and/or acute kidney injury (AKI), despite a significantly preserved glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and role of renal tubular acidosis type IV (RTA IV) in the development of significant hyperkalaemia.

- **Design**: A single-centre retrospective study.
- **Patients**: Patients admitted to a University Hospital over 12 months.
- **Measurements**: Patients with a potassium value > 6.0 mm were identified. Clinical and laboratory data were revisited, and patients with a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis were evaluated for the existence of RTA IV.

A total of 57 patients with significant hyperkalaemia (> 6.0 mm) were identified. Twelve patients had end-stage renal disease, while 21 had solely AKI or progressive chronic renal failure. RTA IV was present in 24 patients (42%), of whom 71% had pre-existing renal insufficiency due to diabetic nephropathy or tubulointerstitial nephritis. All hyperkalaemic patients with urinary/serum electrolytes suggestive of RTA IV showed evidence of AKI, but creatinine levels were significantly lower (P < 0.05), while the number of drugs antagonizing the RAAS was comparable.

We demonstrated that RTA IV is very common in patients with hyperkalaemia, should always be suspected in hyperkalaemic patients with only moderately impaired GFR, and may result in significant hyperkalaemia in the presence of both conditions.

### Consensus-based recommendations for the management of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting [^112Ruzdf]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia (serum K+ > 5.0 mmol/L) is commonly observed among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and is associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. International guidelines may not reflect the latest evidence on managing hyperkalemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis, with a lack of high-quality published studies in this area. This consensus guideline aims to provide recommendations related to clinical practice. Available published evidence was evaluated through a systematic literature review, and the nominal group technique was used to develop consensus recommendations from a panel of experienced nephrologists. These recommendations cover monitoring, dietary restrictions, prescription of K+ binders, and concomitant prescription of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors.

Recent studies have shown that K+ binders reduce the incidence of hyperkalemia, but further evidence is needed on whether reduced-K+ diets or treatment with K+ binders improve patient-centered outcomes. Treatment of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting is complex, and decisions need to be tailored for individual patients.

### Hyperkalemia in patients with chronic renal failure [^1158LEyx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Although hyperkalemia is much more common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the reported frequency of hyperkalemia varies markedly across studies, primarily due to differences in the ascertainment of hyperkalemia and the severity of CKD. Major risk factors for hyperkalemia among CKD patients include a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis), diabetes, older age, and male gender. The use of two drugs to inhibit RAAS in diabetic CKD markedly increases the risk of hyperkalemia, as demonstrated in large multicenter clinical trials.

Hyperkalemia has consistently been associated with an increased risk of adverse events compared with normokalemia, including all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This risk is not explained by differences in comorbidity or estimated GFR, nor by concomitant metabolic abnormalities such as acidosis among those with hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate has been used commonly for decades to treat hyperkalemia in CKD patients, but without any high-quality clinical data to support its efficacy, and with an increased risk of rare but serious colonic complications.

The newer oral potassium-binding agents, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, have been shown to be effective and safe for the non-emergent treatment of hyperkalemia in CKD patients, including patients treated with RAASis. Although the long-term use of these medications may permit the continuation of RAASis in CKD patients with hyperkalemia, the overall impact of this approach remains to be fully understood.

### Frequency and predictors of hyperkalemia in patients ≥ 60 years of age with heart failure undergoing intense medical therapy [^111pQ93Y]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a concern in heart failure (HF), especially in older patients with co-morbidities. Previous studies addressing this issue have focused mainly on younger patients. This study aimed to determine the frequency and predictors of hyperkalemia in older patients with HF undergoing intense medical therapy.

The frequency and predictors of hyperkalemia were defined in patients (n = 566) participating in the Trial of Intensified versus Standard Medical Therapy in Elderly Patients with Congestive Heart Failure, in which patients ≥ 60 years of age were randomized to a standard versus an intensified N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide-guided HF therapy. During an 18-month follow-up, 76 patients (13.4%) had hyperkalemia (≥ 5.5 mmol/L), and 28 (4.9%) had severe hyperkalemia (≥ 6.0 mmol/L).

Higher baseline serum potassium (odds ratio [OR] 2.92 per mmol/L), baseline creatinine (OR 1.11 per 10 μmol/L), gout (OR 2.56), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (compared to NYHA class II, IV OR 3.08), higher dosage of spironolactone at baseline (OR 1.20 per 12.5 mg/day), and higher dose changes of spironolactone (compared to no dose change: 12.5 mg, OR 1.45; 25 mg, OR 2.52; > 25 mg, OR 3.24) were independent predictors for the development of hyperkalemia (p < 0.05 for all comparisons).

In conclusion, hyperkalemia is common in patients ≥ 60 years of age with HF undergoing intense medical therapy. Risk is increased in patients treated with spironolactone, in addition to patient-specific risk factors such as chronic kidney disease, higher serum potassium, advanced NYHA class, and gout.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: Foe or friend [^1162h5y3]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome with high morbidity and mortality that has acquired pandemic dimensions, affecting more than 38 million people worldwide. In addition, the progressive nature of HF makes it a leading cause of hospitalization due to the deleterious effects of sustained neurohormonal activation and comorbidities. Electrolytic disturbances, most notably of potassium levels, very often accompany HF, posing a hindrance to the optimization of medication and imposing a further burden on the patient. Since potassium plays a major role in cardiac excitability and arrhythmias, dyskalemia is an important clinical problem associated with significant life‐threatening complications. Although the definition is not consistently applied, hyperkalemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level > 5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L and can be further classified as mild (5.6‐6.0 mEq/L), moderate (6.1‐7.0 mEq/L), and severe (> 7.0 mEq/L).

Potassium secretion is highly dependent on renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) activity, renal perfusion, and sodium availability to the distal nephron. Hyperkalemia represents both a direct risk for cardiovascular morbidity and a potential biomarker of adverse prognosis and disease severity. Patients with HF are at particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, likely reflecting some medical comorbidities, especially renal dysfunction. Additionally, it is one of the most common factors that impede the optimum pharmaceutical approach to HF, leading to the underuse of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi).

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^11415M5d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depend on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content.

Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period of time, and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy, and correcting metabolic acidosis if present.

The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of non-plant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining potassium levels within a safe range.

Hyperkalemia represents a widespread and potentially lethal condition that affects millions of people across their lives. Despite the prevalence and severity of the condition, there are no consensus guidelines on the treatment of hyperkalemia or even a standard definition. Herein, we provide a succinct review of what we believe to be the most significant misconceptions encountered in the emergency care of hyperkalemia, examine available literature, and discuss practical points on several modalities of hyperkalemia treatment. Additionally, we review the pathophysiology of the electrocardiographic effects of hyperkalemia and how intravenous calcium preparations can antagonize these effects. We conclude each section with recommendations to aid emergency physicians in making safe and efficacious choices for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

### Potassium disorders: Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U]. American Family Physician (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

### Disorders of potassium [^114WHxyU]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Potassium disorders are the most common electrolyte abnormality identified in clinical practice. Presenting symptoms are similar for both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, primarily affecting the cardiac, neuromuscular, and gastrointestinal systems. Generally, mild hypokalemia is the most common potassium disorder seen clinically; however, severe complications can occur. Hyperkalemia is less common but more serious, especially if levels are rising rapidly. The etiologies and treatments for both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are discussed, with special emphasis on the role medications play in the etiologies of each.

### Advances in the management of hyperkalemia in chronic kidney disease [^111osyEJ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of hyperkalemia, which elevates both short-term and long-term mortality. Historically, managing hyperkalemia has relied upon dietary modifications, augmentation of urinary potassium excretion, and enhanced enteral potassium elimination. This review discusses treatments and their limitations and summarizes the evidence supporting novel agents for potassium lowering in patients with CKD.

Recent findings include the introduction of two novel ion exchange resins, representing the first new pharmacologic therapies for hyperkalemia in the last 50 years. Patiromer, recently approved for use in the United States, has been shown to be well tolerated and effective for decreasing serum potassium in patients with CKD when taken for up to a year. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, for which approval is pending, has also shown promise in treating both acute and chronic hyperkalemia in patients with CKD. Both medications have been well tolerated with minimal adverse events in relatively short-term follow-up.

Novel ion exchange resins have the potential to provide new strategies for safely and effectively managing hyperkalemia in the CKD population. This may decrease morbidity and mortality associated with hyperkalemia and allow more broad use of medications whose use is otherwise limited by hyperkalemia.

### Altace [^115ZVoGL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hyperkalemia**: In clinical trials with Altace, hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) occurred in approximately 1% of hypertensive patients receiving Altace. In most cases, these were isolated values, which resolved despite continued therapy. None of these patients were discontinued from the trials because of hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium in such patients [see drug interactions (7.2)].

- **Cough**: Presumably caused by inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. Consider the possibility of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor induced-cough in the differential diagnosis of cough.

### Development and outcomes of hyperkalemia in hospitalized patients: Potential implications for care [^117Jznpv]. American Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

While severe hyperkalemia is commonly encountered, its manifestation in hospitalized patients and related outcomes are unclear. We aimed to examine the development of hyperkalemia in hospitalized patients and associated outcomes.

- **Methods**: Data from a county hospital electronic health record were used to assess all inpatient admissions from 2012 to 2016 for non-dialysis-dependent patients with ≥ 1 K value for the development of hyperkalemia. Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for associations of the maximum K value with in-hospital mortality, and adjusted ORs were calculated for death associated with hyperkalemia.

- **Results**: In 47,018 individual patient hospitalizations, 1.3% had a maximum K ≥ 6.0 mEq/L, and 4.2% had < 3.5 mEq/L. Fifth and 95th percentiles for maximum K values were 3.5 and 5.3 mEq/L, respectively. For high-K patients with a prior K value, the mean (SD) of the immediate pre-maximum K value was 5.0 ± 1.0 mEq/L, and the mean difference in K values (immediate pre-maximum to maximum) was 1.5 ± 1.1 mEq/L; the mean duration between these two K tests was 10.7 ± 14.9 hours. Compared with maximum K values 3.5 to 4.0 mEq/L, ORs for death were 37.1 (95% confidence intervals, 25.8–53.3) for K 6.0 to < 6.5, 88.6 (56.8–138.2) for K ≥ 7.0, and 18.9 (4.3–82.2) for K < 3.0 mEq/L. In adjusted models, the OR for death for K ≥ 6.0 mEq/L was 4.9 (3.7–6.4).

- **Discussion/Conclusions**: Peak K values ≥ 6.0 mEq/L were associated with mortality. Values tended to increase rapidly, limiting opportunities for detection and treatment. Systems-based approaches to detect life-threatening hyperkalemia should be studied further.

### Hyperkalemia in dialysis patients [^117ADNFa]. Seminars in Dialysis (2001). Low credibility.

Serious hyperkalemia is common in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and accounts for considerable morbidity and death. Mechanisms of extrarenal disposal of potassium, such as gastrointestinal excretion and cellular uptake, play a crucial role in the defense against hyperkalemia in this population. In this article, we review extrarenal potassium homeostasis and its alteration in patients with ESRD. We pay particular attention to the factors that influence the movement of potassium across cell membranes. With that background, we discuss the emergency treatment of hyperkalemia in patients with ESRD. We conclude with a review of strategies to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia in this population of patients.

### Hyperkalemia: An adaptive response in chronic renal insufficiency [^117THG6R]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common feature of chronic renal insufficiency, usually ascribed to impaired K+ homeostasis. However, various experimental observations suggest that the increase in extracellular [K+] actually functions in a homeostatic fashion, directly stimulating renal K+ excretion through an effect that is independent of, and additive to, aldosterone.

- **Methods**: We have reviewed relevant studies in experimental animals and in human subjects that have examined the regulation of K+ excretion and its relation to plasma [K+].

- **Results**: Studies indicate that (1) extracellular [K+] in patients with renal insufficiency correlates directly with intracellular K+ content, and (2) hyperkalemia directly promotes K+ secretion in the principal cells of the collecting duct by increasing apical and basolateral membrane conductances. The effect of hyperkalemia differs from that of aldosterone in that K+ conductances are increased as the primary event. The changes in principal cell function and structure induced by hyperkalemia are indistinguishable from the effects seen in adaptation to a high K+ diet.

- **Conclusions**: We propose that hyperkalemia plays a pivotal role in K+ homeostasis in renal insufficiency by stimulating K+ excretion. In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, a new steady state develops in which extracellular [K+] rises to the level needed to stimulate K+ excretion so that it again matches intake. When this new steady state is achieved, plasma [K+] remains stable unless dietary intake increases, glomerular filtration rate falls, or drugs are administered.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^115cUUuf]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperkalemia, particularly in patients on RAAS inhibitor therapy, the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend discontinuing RAAS inhibitors in patients with serum potassium levels ≥ 6 mmol/L who do not meet the criteria for treatment with patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate.

---

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hyperkalemia [^114dKtnY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia generally is attributable to cell shifts or abnormal renal potassium excretion. Cell shifts account for transient increases in serum potassium levels, whereas sustained hyperkalemia generally is caused by decreased renal potassium excretion. Impaired renal potassium excretion can be caused by a primary decrease in distal sodium delivery, a primary decrease in mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormal cortical collecting duct function. Excessive potassium intake is an infrequent cause of hyperkalemia by itself, but can worsen the severity of hyperkalemia when renal excretion is impaired. Before concluding that a cell shift or renal defect in potassium excretion is present, pseudohyperkalemia should be excluded.

### Discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors secondary to hyperkalemia translates into higher cardiorenal outcomes [^112HDoVi]. American Journal of Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a frequent electrolyte disorder in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Major risk factors for hyperkalemia include the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis), which are core therapeutic options to prevent CKD progression and cardiovascular events. To manage hyperkalemia and prevent its recurrence and potential negative consequences, providers often discontinue RAASis. However, this discontinuation may result in a practice pattern where these important medications are not restarted, or patients themselves become nonadherent due to fear of hyperkalemia. This creates a potential clinical care gap where certain patients may be deprived of the benefits of RAASi continuation, especially in a high-risk population like those with CKD.

Prior studies investigating the risk of mortality and cardiovascular outcomes associated with RAASi discontinuation have generally found worsened outcomes following this discontinuation. These observations have been noted among patients with CKD, patients who have experienced hyperkalemia with or without CKD, and the general population previously treated with RAASis. However, the impact of RAASi discontinuation after hyperkalemia on kidney outcomes is less clear. Among patients with CKD, Leon et al. and Walther et al. reported a higher risk of dialysis initiation or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) associated with RAASi discontinuation for those who experienced hyperkalemia.

### An evidence-based narrative review of the emergency department management of acute hyperkalemia [^111ncDVe]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The normal range for potassium is within narrow limits. Hyperkalemia is an electrolyte disorder that frequently affects patients in the emergency department (ED) and can result in significant morbidity and mortality if not identified and treated rapidly.

- **Objective**: This article provides an evidence-based narrative review of the management of hyperkalemia, with focused updates for the emergency clinician.

- **Methods**: We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for articles in English published in peer-reviewed journals and indexed up until May 2020. We used multiple search terms, including hyperkalemia, potassium, acute hyperkalemia, emergency department, dyskalemia, potassium disorders, kidney disease, epidemiology, electrolyte disturbance, severe hyperkalemia, and emergency management.

- **Discussion**: In the ED, interventions aimed to protect patients from the immediate dangers of elevated serum potassium are divided into the following categories: stabilizing cardiac membrane potentials, reducing serum potassium levels through a shift from the extracellular fluid to intracellular fluid, and elimination of potassium through urinary or fecal excretion. Calcium is widely recommended to stabilize the myocardial cell membrane, but additional research is necessary to establish criteria for use, dosages, and preferred solutions. Redistribution of potassium ions from the bloodstream into the cells is based on intravenous insulin or nebulized β2-agonists.

- **Conclusions**: Hyperkalemia is a frequent electrolyte disorder in the ED. Because of the risk associated with this condition, timely diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial.

### Hyperkalemia: Pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^113KgDcX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

In classical models of potassium homeostasis, aldosterone exerts negative feedback control of renal potassium excretion. There is an increasing appreciation that feedforward gut-to-kidney signaling plays an important role.

Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in GFR, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery, or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron. Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease, and the use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or potassium-sparing diuretics.

Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, which is explicable only in part by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia may also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis. Fear of hyperkalemia might also contribute to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Novel potassium binders may find a role in maximizing the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) in heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease.

### New therapies for hyperkalemia [^114m84Ux]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

Although renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors have become the mainstay treatment for patients with chronic diseases, hyperkalemia is a major contributory deterrent to their use in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure. For the first time in 50 years, two new therapies, patiromer and ZS-9, have recently emerged for the concomitant treatment of hyperkalemia in these patients. The objective of this review is to discuss the efficacy and safety of these new agents.

- **Recent findings**: Patiromer effectively reduces serum potassium in patients with CKD and heart failure, even with the concomitant use of RAAS inhibitors. The most common adverse events reported in clinical trials were gastrointestinal events. ZS-9 (Lokelma) rapidly reduces serum potassium levels to a greater magnitude and has a role in the acute management of hyperkalemia. Despite having more adverse events than patiromer, ZS-9 is overall well tolerated.

- **Summary**: These new therapies show promising results for the chronic management of hyperkalemia while also potentially allowing for the concomitant use of RAAS inhibitors at optimal doses. More research is needed to examine the benefits of continuing RAAS inhibitors after an episode of hyperkalemia in patients with CKD and heart failure.

### A survey demonstrating lack of consensus on the sequence of medications for treatment of hyperkalemia among pediatric critical care providers [^112BjTwf]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is one of the reversible causes of cardiac arrest in children. The Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support guidelines have specific recommendations on the choice and sequence of medications for treatment of life-threatening hyperkalemia. However, the Pediatric Advanced Life Support guidelines have no specific treatment recommendations. The objective of this study was to measure the extent to which opinions diverge among pediatricians on the choice and sequence of medication administration in the management of hyperkalemia during cardiac arrest.

- **Design**: Scenario-based survey.

- **Setting**: A hypothetical hospital area covered by the pediatric rapid response team.

- **Patients**: A hypothetical scenario of a 7-year-old child receiving a blood transfusion who is suddenly unresponsive and found to be in pulseless ventricular tachycardia with stat labs revealing a potassium level of 8.3.

- **Interventions**: A scenario-based survey of PICU fellows and attendings at a PICU Fellows Boot Camp.

- **Measurement and main results**: Eighty-four fellows and 24 attendings responded to the survey. The response rate was 89%. Calcium was chosen most frequently as the first drug to be administered (calcium chloride, 40/115 [34.8%]; calcium gluconate, 62/115 [53.9%]), while 38 of 115 respondents (33%) chose a drug other than calcium. Only 17 of 115 respondents (15%) would use calcium, sodium bicarbonate, insulin, and dextrose in the Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support-recommended sequence. PICU attendings were significantly more likely to administer the advanced cardiovascular life support sequence.

### Hyperkalemia: Pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^113DtGn3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Consequences of hyperkalemia in patients receiving dialysis are significant. Patients on dialysis form a special group due to two main reasons: the high prevalence of hyperkalemia (pre-dialysis serum [K+] > 5.5 mM in approximately 20% of hemodialysis patients) and the prevalence of comorbidities that may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia and death, such as left ventricular hypertrophy.

In patients undergoing maintenance hemo- and peritoneal dialysis, hyperkalemia has been linked to an increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiac arrhythmia, and hospitalization. In hemodialysis, the risks associated with hyperkalemia can be exacerbated during the long interdialytic gap. An observational study involving more than 50,000 hemodialysis patients demonstrated that hyperkalemia (> 5.5 mM pre-dialysis) was associated with a heightened risk of hospitalization in the subsequent four days, being highest for [K+] measured on a Friday (before a 3-day gap) compared to [K+] measured on a Monday or Wednesday (before a 2-day gap).

- **Changes in prescribing practice**: The risk of hyperkalemia may discourage physicians or patients from selecting certain medications. For example, only 40% of eligible patients with heart failure were prescribed a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) according to a Swedish registry of over 11,000 heart failure patients. An investigation of 80,000 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) estimated the 'treatment gap' as the proportion of eligible patients who were not receiving MRAs.

### Real-world associations between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition therapy, hyperkalemia, and outcomes: A clinical and scientific call to action [^116TbWtp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

When hyperkalemia is identified, it should be treated, and all attempts should be made to maintain RAASi dosing quickly if normokalemia can be achieved with these strategies. When RAASi is withheld for acute management of hyperkalemia, attention to resuming the medication must be maintained. If a source of hyperkalemia is clearly identified and treated, RAASi should be resumed within as early as 72 hours.

Medication reconciliation and discontinuation or reduction of medications known to cause hyperkalemia is a key initial management step. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, trimethoprim, pentamidine, azole antifungals, and heparin have all been associated with hyperkalemia and should be discontinued if possible.

Reduction in dietary potassium intake can also be extremely helpful. In advanced CKD stage 4 (estimated glomerular filtration rate between 30 and 15 mL/min) or stage 5 (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 15 mL/min) populations, the recommendation is to restrict potassium intake to < 2.4 g/d. Support from dietitians who understand foods rich in potassium — such as citrus fruits, melons, spinach, kale, seaweed, kelp, figs, and avocado — is an important mechanism. They also have experience in identifying high-risk salt substitutes that should be avoided. While many of these foods are featured heavily in dietary approaches for improving cardiovascular health in patients with normal kidney and cardiac function, such as the DASH diet used for blood pressure control, in these more ill patients with CHF and CKD, these approaches may need to be modified.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications, especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represents an undesirable clinical compromise.

The emergence of two new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail the emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Hyperkalemia: Pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^113Ufgrd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

The combination of hyperkalemia and impaired renal acid excretion is termed type IV renal tubular acidosis. In the 1970s–1990s, experiments in cultured cells, intact rodents, dogs, and humans demonstrated that hyperkalemia can impair ammoniagenesis in the proximal renal tubule. Because net renal acid excretion is the sum of ammonium and titratable acid excretion minus bicarbonate excretion, this suggests that hyperkalemia per se could cause renal tubular acidosis. However, with otherwise normal renal and adrenal function, acid–base homeostasis is maintained in hyperkalemia by compensatory mechanisms, largely driven by increased aldosterone production. Consequently, type IV RTA is invariably encountered clinically in the context of hypoaldosteronism, either true or functional.

Compelling evidence that hyperkalemia can cause renal tubular acidosis was recently obtained from a mouse model of PHAII. These mice carry a mutation that drives constitutive activation of the thiazide-sensitive co-transporter, NCC. They exhibited hyperkalemia, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and reduced urinary ammonia excretion, phenomena that were all corrected by dietary potassium restriction or thiazide administration. Furthermore, this model was exploited to determine the molecular mechanisms whereby hyperkalemia impairs renal ammonium excretion. Mice had reduced expression of ammoniagenic enzymes, such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and phosphate-dependent glutaminase, and increased expression of an ammonia-recycling enzyme, glutamine synthetase, in the proximal tubule.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hyperkalemia, especially with respect to a low-potassium diet, the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend offering an expert assessment by a registered or specialist renal dietitian. They also advise on dietary strategies to modify potassium intake in patients with CKD and persistent hyperkalemia with a serum potassium level greater than 5.5 mmol/L.

### Long-term mortality and trajectory of potassium measurements following an episode of acute severe hyperkalaemia [^116Wgwwh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

Hyperkalaemia is a common condition in patients with comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) or congestive heart failure (HF). Moreover, severe hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening condition that is associated with a higher risk of adverse clinical events such as ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Currently, data regarding the prognostic implications of chronic hyperkalaemia are available; however, information about the long-term clinical consequences after an episode of severe hyperkalaemia remains scarce. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between the trajectory of potassium measurements in patients with acute hyperkalaemia and long-term all-cause mortality.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective observational study that included patients with acute severe hyperkalaemia [potassium (K) > 6mEq/L] without haemolysis in the emergency room of Dr Peset University Hospital in Valencia, Spain, searching the lab database from January 2016 to March 2017. The multivariable-adjusted association of serum potassium with mortality was assessed by using comprehensive state-of-the-art regression methods that can accommodate time-dependent exposure modelling.

- **Results**: We found 172 episodes of acute hyperkalaemia in 160 patients in the emergency room. The mean ± standard deviation age of the sample was 77 ± 12 years and 60.5% were males. The most frequent comorbidities were CKD (71.2%), HF (35%), and diabetes mellitus (56.9%). Only 11.9% of the patients were on chronic dialysis. A quarter of the patients did not have previous CK.

### The management of hyperkalemia in patients with cardiovascular disease [^113km3w7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The development of hyperkalemia is common in patients with cardiac and kidney disease who are administered drugs that antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). As the results of large-scale clinical trials in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure demonstrate benefits of RAAS blockade alone or, in some cases, in combination therapies, the incidence of hyperkalemia has increased in clinical practice. Although there is potential for adverse events in the presence of hyperkalemia, there also are potential benefits of RAAS blockers that support their use in high-risk patient populations. Management of hyperkalemia may be improved by identifying the levels of potassium that may potentially induce harm and using appropriate strategies to avert the levels that may be dangerous or life-threatening.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^114wT2Gr]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

The most notorious consequence of hyperkalemia is the potential for fatal cardiac dysrhythmia. However, several other consequences deserve discussion. Hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality, although it is unclear whether it causes increased mortality outside the context of cardiac arrhythmia in extreme hyperkalemia. Consequently, hyperkalemia — or the fear of it — may prompt changes in prescribing practices, such as avoiding RAS blockade and MRAs. Recent data also indicate that hyperkalemia can cause renal tubular acidosis and may contribute to peripheral neuropathy in patients with CKD.

- **Mortality: epidemiology**: Large observational studies demonstrate an association between hyperkalemia and an increased risk of death. In a meta-analysis of data from over 1.2 million individuals with CKD, serum [K+] exhibited a U-shaped relationship with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with a nadir at approximately 4.2 mM. The adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was approximately 1.22 for [K+] > 5.5 mM, and this association persisted after adjustment for a large number of covariates. However, since no large interventional studies have tested the effects of potassium-lowering therapies or plasma [K+] targets on mortality, it remains uncertain whether this association is due to residual confounding — specifically, whether mild-to-moderate hyperkalemia causes an increased risk of death.

The most plausible mechanism by which hyperkalemia could lead to death is through the induction of fatal cardiac arrhythmia. In patients with acute…

### Electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalemia [^116rNj3M]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is one of the more common acute life-threatening metabolic emergencies seen in the emergency department. Early diagnosis and empiric treatment of hyperkalemia depend in many cases on the emergency physician's ability to recognize the electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalemia. The electrocardiographic manifestations commonly include peaked T-waves, widening of the QRS complex, and other abnormalities of altered cardiac conduction. Peaked T-waves in the precordial leads are among the most common and frequently recognized findings on the electrocardiogram. Other "classic" electrocardiographic findings in patients with hyperkalemia include prolongation of the PR interval, flattening or absence of the P-wave, widening of the QRS complex, and a "sine-wave" appearance at severely elevated levels. A thorough knowledge of these findings is imperative for the rapid diagnosis and treatment of hyperkalemia.

### Impact of plasma potassium normalization on short-term mortality in patients with hypertension and hyperkalemia [^111u9NWC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Potassium plays a key role in maintaining normal myocardial electrical activity. A shift in potassium balance or persistent potassium disturbances can negatively affect the heart, regardless of the direction. Patients with persistent cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, are especially exposed to potassium disturbances attributable to treatment side effects.

We recently demonstrated a U-shaped relationship between potassium and mortality among patients with hypertension. Mortality risk was higher even for low and high normal potassium ranges, suggesting a stricter normal interval of 4.1 to 4.7 mmol/L. However, there are currently no data on the impact of plasma potassium normalization on short-term mortality in patients with hypertension and hyperkalemia. Therefore, it is important to investigate how correction and even overcorrection of hyperkalemia changes short-term prognosis in patients with hypertension.

Using Danish national registers, we investigated the 90-day mortality for patients with hypertension and an initial high potassium measurement, according to their subsequent plasma potassium concentrations measured within 6 to 100 days following the episode of elevated potassium.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder observed more frequently in patients with renal disease or heart failure, and in those using certain medications like renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors. Traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed via electrocardiogram and that specific hyperkalemia levels confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypical presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations between hyperkalemia and increased morbidity and mortality. However, these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and with differing clinical presentations. Factors such as physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and the degree of concurrent illness might predispose some patients to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked, yet data suggest the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia in determining patient outcomes. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Hyperkalemia [^116MgUnZ]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening metabolic problem caused by the inability of the kidneys to excrete potassium, impairment of the mechanisms that move potassium from the circulation into the cells, or a combination of these factors. Acute episodes of hyperkalemia are commonly triggered by the introduction of a medication affecting potassium homeostasis; illness or dehydration can also be triggers. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, hyperkalemia may be caused by the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The presence of typical electrocardiographic changes or a rapid rise in serum potassium indicates that hyperkalemia is potentially life-threatening.

- **Determining the cause of hyperkalemia**: Urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolarity should be obtained as a first step, which directs long-term treatment.
- **Treatment options**: Intravenous calcium is effective in reversing electrocardiographic changes and reducing the risk of arrhythmias but does not lower serum potassium. Serum potassium levels can be lowered acutely by using intravenous insulin and glucose, nebulized beta2 agonists, or both. Sodium polystyrene therapy, sometimes with intravenous furosemide and saline, is then initiated to lower total body potassium levels.

### Hyperkalemia: Pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^114XLerS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

- **Risk factors for hyperkalemia**: From the above, it is clear that the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal impairment — either acute kidney injury (AKI) or advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) — and any acquired or inherited defects in potassium excretion in the distal nephron. In CKD, hyperkalemia typically occurs after the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) drops below 15 mL/min.

	- The risk factors for hyperkalemia were studied in a meta-analysis of data from over 1.2 million individuals with CKD. The risk of hyperkalemia (K > 5.5 mM) was strongly correlated with eGFR across the entire range of kidney function (from eGFR 15 to 105 mL/min). A decrease in eGFR of 15 mL/min approximately doubled the odds of hyperkalemia. Albuminuria was also a risk factor, but the association was far weaker (odds ratio for hyperkalemia < 2 even in heavy albuminuria). Other risk factors for hyperkalemia included male sex; non-black race; lower body mass index; smoking; history of diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, or stroke; and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), or potassium-sparing diuretics. Unsurprisingly, the use of thiazide or loop diuretics was protective.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^111XW4c8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

There have been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article, we discuss these advances within a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors, and consequences of hyperkalemia, highlighting aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice. Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery, or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron.

Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia include renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or potassium-sparing diuretics. Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, which is only partly explicable by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis.

The presence of hyperkalemia — or even the fear of developing it — can lead to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure contexts. The newer potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing of renin–angiotensin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid antagonists in this setting.

### Long-term mortality and trajectory of potassium measurements following an episode of acute severe hyperkalaemia [^115B7JKF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

- **Key learning points**:

	- **What is already known about this subject**: Severe hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with a higher risk of short-term adverse clinical events such as ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Information about the long-term clinical consequences after an episode of severe hyperkalaemia remains scarce. We conducted a retrospective observational study that evaluated the long-term trajectory of potassium and risk of mortality in patients with acute severe hyperkalaemia (K > 6 mEq/L).

	- **What this study adds**: Severe hyperkalaemia may occur in patients who did not have chronic kidney disease (25% of our patients). After developing severe hyperkalaemia, reHyperkalaemia is a frequent finding, especially during the first 6 months after discharge. Following an acute severe hyperkalaemia episode, potassium trajectories predict the risk of death. During the post-discharge follow-up, transitioning from normal to higher potassium levels or persisting high values was associated with a higher risk of death.

	- **What impact this may have on practice or policy**: This study strengthens the importance of close clinical and potassium monitoring after an episode of acute hyperkalaemia. It reinforces the fact that new and well-tolerated treatments after discharge from a hyperkalaemia-related hospitalization should be strongly considered.

### Potassium disorders: Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115KhjSU]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia.

When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings. Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions.

Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

### Potassium disorders: Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^111QJpsS]. American Family Physician (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypokalemia:

- **Definition**: Hypokalemia refers to the presence of serum potassium levels < 3.6 mmol/L.

- **Pathophysiology**: Potassium depletion occurs due to inadequate dietary intake, increased renal excretion (e.g. due to diuretic therapy), or increased gastrointestinal losses in the context of diarrhea.

- **Epidemiology**: Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice.

- **Disease course**: Manifestations of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, ileus, and cardiac arrhythmias. Typical electrocardiographic changes include flat or inverted T waves, ST-segment depression, and prominent U waves.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe untreated hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis and malignant cardiac arrhythmias, such as VT and VF.

### True rate of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists-related hyperkalemia in placebo-controlled trials: A meta-analysis [^116k6yrZ]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) improve survival in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction but are often underused, mostly due to concerns of hyperkalemia. Because hyperkalemia also occurs with placebo, we aimed to determine the truly MRA-related rate of hyperkalemia.

- **Methods**: We performed a meta-analysis including randomized, placebo-controlled trials reporting hyperkalemia on MRAs in patients after myocardial infarction or with chronic heart failure. We evaluated the truly MRA-related rate of hyperkalemia, representing hyperkalemia on MRA, corrected for hyperkalemia on placebo (Pla), according to the equation: True MRA (%) = (MRA (%) - Pla (%)) / MRA (%).

- **Results**: A total of 16,065 patients from 7 trials were analyzed. Hyperkalemia was more frequently observed on MRA (9.3%) compared to placebo (4.3%) [risk ratio 2.17, 95% CI 1.92–2.45, p < 0.0001]. Truly MRA-related hyperkalemia was 54%, whereas 46% were non-MRA related. In trials using eplerenone, hyperkalemia was documented in 5.0% on eplerenone and in 2.6% on placebo (p < 0.0001). In spironolactone trials, hyperkalemia was documented in 17.5% and in 7.5% of patients on placebo (P = 0.0001). Hypokalemia occurred less frequently in patients on MRA (9.3%) compared with placebo (14.8%) [risk ratio 0.58, CI 0.47–0.72, p < 0.0001].

- **Conclusion**: This meta-analysis shows that in clinical trials, 54% of hyperkalemia cases were specifically related to the MRA treatment and 46% to other reasons. Therefore, non-MRA-related rises in potassium levels might be underestimated and should be rigorously explored before ceasing MRA treatment.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^116Vgddg]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia and a rational approach to its management.

- **Methods**: This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include a search of MEDLINE and a bibliographic search of textbooks and journal articles.

- **Results and conclusions**: A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Hyperkalemia: Pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^1144kANq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia results from defective potassium excretion in the distal nephron. Ninety percent of excreted potassium exits via the kidneys, which have a remarkable capacity to increase potassium excretion in the face of potassium excess. Consequently, hyperkalemia is almost never encountered clinically in the context of normal renal function and a normal adrenal–kidney axis.

Physiological control of potassium excretion is exercised in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron. An understanding of the molecular pathways of potassium excretion can help in diagnosing the clinical insults that induce hyperkalemia. Potassium is secreted through renal tubular cells via the sodium–potassium pump in the basolateral membrane and at least four different types of ion channels in the apical membrane. The most well-studied of these are the ROMK channel and the BK channel.
