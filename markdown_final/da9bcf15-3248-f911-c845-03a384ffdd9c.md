## Question

Medication for 15 year old with anxiety depression and adhd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medication management for a 15-year-old with comorbid anxiety, depression, and ADHD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnoses and assessing comorbidities and functional impairment. Then, I should prioritize which condition to treat first and why. Next, I will select first-line medications with dosing and monitoring plans, including suicide risk and cardiovascular screening. After that, I need to consider combination strategies and sequencing if monotherapy is insufficient. Finally, I will outline follow-up intervals, discontinuation planning, and special circumstances like substance use or trauma, and I will double-check any claims against guidelines and pivotal studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and comorbidity assessment, because misclassification here derails treatment. I need to ensure we meet DSM-5 criteria for ADHD with onset before age 12, and I should screen for anxiety and depressive disorders using standardized tools and collateral information from at least two teachers or equivalent sources given adolescent underreporting, while also assessing for substance use, trauma, and learning disorders that can mimic or worsen symptoms [^dcb62c23] [^07c38c2f] [^f8ccb4f1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about starting multiple medications at once. I should prioritize the condition causing the greatest functional impairment and safety risk. In adolescents, depression and anxiety often drive suicidality and academic failure, so treating mood/anxiety first is reasonable, while recognizing that untreated ADHD can perpetuate mood symptoms and that stimulants may actually reduce depression risk in ADHD, so I need to balance urgency and sequencing carefully [^8042e7af] [^24526778] [^5d27d1cd].

> For depression and anxiety, I will now examine first-line pharmacotherapy. SSRIs are first-line in pediatrics, with fluoxetine having the strongest evidence and FDA labeling down to age 8 for depression and age 12 for anxiety; escitalopram and sertraline are also supported, though escitalopram is not FDA-approved under age 12, so I should confirm age-appropriate choices and counsel on the boxed warning and monitoring needs [^a5fc97e4] [^9a2938fc] [^18e4021a].

> Wait, let me verify dosing and titration principles so I don't provoke activation or discontinuation. I should start low and go slow, for example fluoxetine 10 mg daily with a target of 10–20 mg for adolescents, reassessing weekly early on for side effects and suicidality, and expecting clinical response by about 6 weeks with maximal benefit by 12 weeks; if there is minimal response at 4–6 weeks, I should consider switching to a second SSRI rather than escalating beyond usual ranges, and I should monitor for behavioral activation, sleep changes, and GI symptoms throughout [^f952c5a6] [^9a2938fc] [^a5fc97e4].

> For ADHD, I need to check whether stimulants are appropriate despite comorbid anxiety. Contemporary data suggest stimulants are generally well tolerated and may reduce depression risk in youth with ADHD, so methylphenidate remains first-line; if anxiety worsens transiently, I can mitigate with dose adjustment, timing, or adjuncts rather than abandoning stimulants outright, and I should monitor growth, blood pressure, and heart rate at each visit [^24526778] [^af458919] [^8204f797].

> But wait, what if stimulants are contraindicated or not tolerated? Atomoxetine is a reasonable alternative, though I should confirm the suicide warning and monitor closely for mood and suicidality, especially during initiation and dose changes; guanfacine or clonidine can be considered for significant hyperactivity/impulsivity or when tics are present, again with slow titration to avoid hypotension or sedation [^376cdd48] [^8204f797].

> I should double-check the evidence for combination therapy when symptoms are severe or refractory. For anxiety, CBT plus an SSRI outperforms either alone in pediatric trials, and for depression, combined treatment is often superior in adolescents; for ADHD with comorbid anxiety, stimulants can be combined with SSRIs when indicated, though I need to monitor for interactions and additive activation, and coordinate care with the same team when possible [^7faf44c0] [^b3a57383] [^b6a9d25c].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and safety labs. Weekly contact for the first month after starting or changing SSRIs is prudent to assess suicidality, activation, and adherence, then spacing to every 2–4 weeks until stable; for stimulants, I should track height, weight, BP, and HR at each visit and consider growth charts if appetite suppression emerges; routine labs are not required for SSRIs or stimulants in otherwise healthy adolescents, but I should individualize based on medical history [^f952c5a6] [^8204f797].

> Hold on, I should verify discontinuation planning because abrupt stops risk relapse. For SSRIs, taper over at least 2–4 weeks to mitigate discontinuation symptoms, and for stimulants, consider drug holidays if feasible to reassess need; I need to ensure a written plan for relapse monitoring during dose changes and to revisit the diagnosis if symptoms recur, especially in the context of trauma or substance use [^c951488f] [^549ef078].

> I need to ensure I address special circumstances that change management. If there is active substance use, I should coordinate with addiction specialists and consider non-stimulant ADHD options initially; if there is trauma exposure, I should screen for PTSD and prioritize trauma-informed psychotherapy before assuming pharmacotherapy for "anxiety" or "ADHD"; if there is significant suicidality, I should escalate monitoring frequency and consider inpatient care as indicated [^58882497] [^bb260ac8] [^79b7375f].

> Let me reconsider the overall sequence to avoid overpromising. A practical approach is to initiate an SSRI for depression/anxiety while continuing careful ADHD symptom monitoring, then add a stimulant once mood is stabilized if ADHD remains functionally impairing; alternatively, if ADHD is the primary driver of impairment and mood is mild, starting with a stimulant and layering an SSRI if anxiety or depression persists is reasonable, with shared decision-making guiding the order and pace [^8042e7af] [^b3a57383] [^526daeaa].

> Finally, I should confirm that I have aligned with guideline-based care and documented informed consent. Primary care clinicians can manage mild-to-moderate presentations with appropriate monitoring and co-management, but I should refer to child and adolescent psychiatry for severe, complex, or treatment-resistant cases; throughout, I must document risks, benefits, alternatives, and the adolescent's assent alongside parental consent, and I should build in regular functional outcome tracking to judge response beyond symptom scales [^bec59c7c] [^a533330f] [^526daeaa].

For a 15-year-old with anxiety, depression, and ADHD, **start with an SSRI** (fluoxetine or sertraline) for anxiety/depression [^a5fc97e4] and add a stimulant (methylphenidate or amphetamine) for ADHD if symptoms persist after mood stabilization [^8042e7af]. Use **combination therapy** (SSRI + stimulant) when both conditions cause significant impairment, and monitor closely for side effects, suicidality, and substance use [^7faf44c0] [^8042e7af]. If stimulants are not tolerated, consider atomoxetine or guanfacine for ADHD [^4daae8d9]; if SSRIs are ineffective, consider SNRIs or CBT augmentation [^032ff504] [^7faf44c0]. Reassess every 2–4 weeks and adjust dosing based on response and tolerability [^f952c5a6].

## Pharmacological treatment strategies

### Anxiety and depression

- **First-line pharmacotherapy**: SSRIs are first-line for pediatric anxiety and depression [^a5fc97e4]; fluoxetine and sertraline have the strongest evidence [^a5fc97e4].

- **Alternative agents**: If SSRIs are ineffective or not tolerated, SNRIs (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine) may be considered, though evidence is weaker and monitoring for side effects is essential [^032ff504].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor for side effects, including activation, sleep disturbances, and suicidal ideation, especially during initiation and dose adjustments [^a5fc97e4].

---

### ADHD

- **First-line pharmacotherapy**: Stimulants (methylphenidate or amphetamines) are first-line for ADHD and are effective in adolescents [^af458919] [^8e2c903d].

- **Non-stimulant options**: Atomoxetine or alpha-2 agonists (guanfacine, clonidine) are alternatives if stimulants are ineffective or not tolerated [^4daae8d9].

- **Monitoring**: Monitor for side effects, including appetite suppression, sleep disturbances, and cardiovascular effects [^8204f797].

---

## Combination pharmacotherapy

Combination therapy with an SSRI plus a stimulant is often **necessary** when anxiety/depression and ADHD co-occur and cause significant impairment [^b3a57383]. Evidence supports **combined treatment** for faster and more robust symptom control than monotherapy, with close monitoring for side effects and interactions [^7faf44c0].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Suicidality risk**: SSRIs carry a boxed warning for increased suicidal ideation in adolescents; monitor closely, especially during initiation and dose changes [^a5fc97e4].

- **Substance use**: Assess for substance use, as stimulants have abuse potential; consider non-stimulant ADHD options if risk is high [^8042e7af].

- **Growth and cardiovascular monitoring**: Regularly monitor height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate during pharmacotherapy [^8204f797].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for anxiety and depression and can be **combined with medication** for optimal outcomes [^7faf44c0]. Behavioral therapy and school-based interventions are recommended for ADHD management, particularly in adolescents [^8e2c903d].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Condition** | **First-line pharmacotherapy** | **Alternative pharmacotherapy** | **Monitoring considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Anxiety/Depression | SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline) | SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine) | - Suicidality <br/> - Activation <br/> - Side effects |
| ADHD | Stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamines) | - Atomoxetine <br/> - Alpha-2 agonists | - Appetite <br/> - Sleep <br/> - Cardiovascular effects |
| Combination therapy | SSRI + stimulant | - SSRI + atomoxetine <br/> - SSRI + alpha-2 agonist | - Combined side effects <br/> - Interactions |

---

Pharmacological management of a 15-year-old with anxiety, depression, and ADHD should prioritize **SSRIs for mood** and stimulants for ADHD, with combination therapy when both conditions are impairing. Close monitoring for side effects, suicidality, and substance use is essential, and non-pharmacological interventions should be integrated for optimal outcomes.

### Pediatric psychopharmacology for treatment of ADHD, depression, and anxiety [^07c93a8b]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The pediatric practitioner is often the first point-of-contact for children and adolescents suffering from mental illness. Part of the treatment planning for psychiatric diagnoses includes consideration of medication. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, one of the most common diagnoses, is very responsive to stimulant medications; for children who are unable to tolerate stimulants or who do not achieve satisfactory symptom management, central α-agonists and atomoxetine are effective and generally well-tolerated alternative or augmentative agents. Depression and anxiety disorders are also frequently encountered in the pediatric office setting. The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is considered first-line psychopharmacology for depression and anxiety symptoms. Despite concerns for suicidal ideation related to this medication class, the benefits typically outweigh the risks. This review provides basic clinical pharmacology of stimulant and nonstimulant attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors intended to serve as a primer for the general pediatrician.

### Antidepressants: pediatric mental health minute series-AAP… [^a5fc97e4]. AAP (2020). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants are medications commonly used to treat depressive and anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. These medications are generally divided into selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Scope in Pediatrics
- SSRIs are the first line of psychopharmacologic treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders.
- Antidepressant selection should be evidence-based and currently the strongest evidence exists for SSRIs including escitalopram, fluoxetine, and sertraline. SNRIs may be less effective in children and adolescents.
- Dosing and titration should be guided by data from clinical trials which suggests starting low, but actively titrating medication to ensure the highest likelihood of success.
- Side effects of SSRIs may occur in 1 of 10 children or adolescents. Some side effects relate to blood levels while others are related to pharmacodynamic factors.

Frequently, the management strategy is to reduce the dose or discontinue the medication.
- SSRIs include a black-box warning with regard to the risk of suicidal ideation in children and adolescents. Although the risk is low, it is very important to monitor for any clue that the patient may be experiencing this side effect.
- One challenge in treating anxiety disorders is managing the dose to minimize the side effects without reducing the dose to a point where the benefit of the SSRI is lost. At times, side effects outweigh the medication's benefit and a change in medication is needed.
- Although FDA approved for depression, once a drug is licensed, it can be used "off-label" based on available evidence for safety and efficacy at the discretion of the prescribing clinician.
- Side effects are generally mild and dissipate relatively quickly, although some may require dose adjustment or — in some cases — a change in medication.
- The most common and most problematic side effects are abdominal symptoms, activation, and tiredness/insomnia.
- Clinicians selecting antidepressant medications to treat pediatric patients need to understand the cause of side effects as well as management strategies, particularly as antidepressant side effects increase the likelihood of discontinuation, slow the trajectory of improvement and potentially limit titration to effective doses.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^8042e7af]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Special circumstances — adolescents (Age 12 Years to the 18th Birthday) specify that, at a minimum, clinicians should assess adolescent patients with newly diagnosed ADHD for symptoms and signs of substance use, anxiety, depression, and learning disabilities, and to consider sequencing psychosocial and medication treatments to maximize the impact on areas of greatest risk and impairment while monitoring for possible risks such as stimulant abuse or suicidal ideation.

### Primary care clinician perspectives on medication prescribing for child mental health concerns [^7b039d55]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

This study describes the frequency and comfort of pediatric primary care clinicians (PCCs) as it relates to initiating, continuing, and stopping medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety/depression, and sleep problems across age groups (≤ 5 years, 6–12, and 13+). Primary care clinicians (N = 148) within an integrated primary care national research consortium participated in an anonymous online survey including questions examining practice settings, provider characteristics, prescribing frequency, and prescribing comfort. Results indicate that comfort and prescribing practices vary by patient age, practice setting, provider experience, and presenting diagnoses. Primary care clinicians generally felt more comfortable prescribing for school-age children and older and prescribing for ADHD-related concerns. Primary care clinicians appeared similarly comfortable starting, maintaining, and stopping medications. Rural PCCs reported greater comfort initiating and managing medication. Results highlight the need for ongoing training and support for PCCs in managing common childhood mental health conditions. Implications for establishing collaborative infrastructure support and team-based care are discussed.

### Mental health competencies for pediatric practice [^b3a57383]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pharmacologic and psychosocial therapies — evidence supports multiple modalities and specific sequencing and combinations. Many pharmacologic and psychosocial therapies have been proven effective in treating children with mental health disorders, and psychosocial therapies, either alone or in combination with pharmacologic therapies, may be more effective in some circumstances. American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry guidelines recommend at least 2 trials of psychosocial treatment before starting medication in young children up to 5 years of age. Studies show an advantage of combined psychosocial and medication treatment over either alone for ADHD in 7- to 9-year-old children, for common anxiety disorders in 7- to 9-year-old children, and for depression in 12- to 17-year-old children, and benefits of combined therapy likely go well beyond these age groups. Many children with mild or subthreshold anxiety or depression are likely to benefit from psychosocial therapy, mind-body approaches, and self-help resources without medication. If needed community services are not available, pediatricians can use common-elements approaches in the pediatric office and advocate for evidence-based therapies. Certain disorders (ADHD, common anxiety disorders, depression), if associated with no more than moderate impairment, are amenable to primary care medication management because there are indicated medications with a well-established safety profile.

### Primary pediatric care psychopharmacology: focus on medications for ADHD, depression, and anxiety [^024c8ad5]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2017). Low credibility.

The evidence base for psychopharmacologic interventions in youth with depressive and anxiety disorders as well as attention/deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has dramatically increased over the past two decades. Psychopharmacologic interventions commonly utilized in the pediatric primary care setting-selective serotonin (norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs/SSNRIs), stimulants and α 2 agonists-are reviewed. General pharmacologic principles are summarized along with class-related side effects and tolerability concerns (e.g., suicidality and activation in antidepressant-treated youth as well as insomnia, irritability, anorexia in stimulant-treated pediatric patients). Selected landmark trials of antidepressant medications in youth with depressive disorders [Treatment of Adolescent Depression Study (TADS) and the Treatment of SSRI-Resistant Depression Study (TADS)] and anxiety disorders [Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS) and Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Extended Long-term Study (CAMELS)] are described in addition to the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD Study. Finally, available data are presented that are related to prediction of treatment outcomes in youth with depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and ADHD.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^f2b6777a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) epidemiology and comorbidity in children and adolescents — In a national survey, 8.4% of children 2 to 17 years of age currently had ADHD, representing 5.4 million children; among those with current ADHD, almost two-thirds were taking medication, approximately half had received behavioral treatment in the past year, and nearly one quarter had received neither type of treatment of ADHD. The median age of diagnosis was 7 years, with approximately one-third diagnosed before 6 years of age, and more than half were first diagnosed by a PCC, often a pediatrician. Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to receive a diagnosis; as individuals with ADHD enter adolescence, their overt hyperactive and impulsive symptoms tend to decline, whereas their inattentive symptoms tend to persist. Learning and language problems are common comorbid conditions, the majority of both boys and girls meet diagnostic criteria for another mental disorder, boys are more likely to exhibit externalizing conditions like oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, and girls with ADHD are more likely than boys to have a comorbid internalizing condition like anxiety or depression. Although there is a greater risk of receiving a diagnosis of ADHD for children who are the youngest in their class, for most children, retention is not beneficial.

### Effects of ADHD and ADHD medications on depression and anxiety in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^24526778]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively assess the effects of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and ADHD medications on the risk of depression and anxiety in children and adolescents. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted up to January 30, 2024. The outcomes were depression and anxiety. Subgroup analysis was performed according to outcome population as youth onset, sex and duration of medication. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment were also performed. Thirty-three studies were included. The children and adolescents with ADHD had a significantly higher risk of depressive disorder than those without ADHD [pooled relative risk (RR) = 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.57–3.29, P < 0.001]. The children and adolescents with ADHD were at a higher risk of major depressive disorder than those without ADHD (pooled RR = 2.20, 95%CI = 1.47–3.29, P = 0.002). The children and adolescents with ADHD had an increased risk of specific phobia versus those without ADHD (pooled RR = 1.68, 95%CI = 1.16–2.44, P = 0.006). The risk of social phobia in the ADHD group was higher than that in the non-ADHD group (pooled RR = 1.71, 95%CI = 1.13–2.61, P = 0.012). The children and adolescents with ADHD were at an elevated risk of agoraphobia compared with those without ADHD (pooled RR = 4.99, 95%CI = 1.51–16.56, P = 0.009). Children and adolescents with stimulant medications had a significantly lower risk of depression than those without stimulant medications (pooled RR = 0.80, 95%CI = 0.72–0.89, P < 0.001). In conclusion, children and adolescents with ADHD had higher risks of depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, specific phobia, social phobia, and agoraphobia than those without ADHD. Stimulant medications for ADHD were associated with a reduced risk for depression.

### Practice parameter on the use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents [^c951488f]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Principle 13 — Discontinuing medication in children requires a specific plan explains that more is known about starting medication than about how long to treat and how best to discontinue, and that a thoughtful and safe plan for medication discontinuation is as important as a thoughtful and safe plan for starting medications. Discontinuation may occur because the patient seems to have recovered, because side effects make continued use untenable (e.g., weight gain, concerns about growth or the development of involuntary movements), or because the current prescriber believes the medication is not warranted or is no longer effective. The prescriber is encouraged to obtain the history of previous psychiatric symptoms and response to medication, starting with the patient and family, with review of medical records and discussion with previous prescribers also useful; collateral history may be critical, and reviewing the history is especially important to avoid a needless and unexpected return of symptoms. Developing a monitoring plan for a discontinuation trial is also critical; although it may take only hours to days to identify return of hyperactivity symptoms in a child with ADHD off stimulants, a more extended period may be required for the inattentive subtype, and patients with mood and anxiety disorders may have a return of symptoms weeks to months after the last dose; discontinuation in inpatient or partial hospital settings with short lengths of stay may be particularly problematic.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^bec59c7c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Implementation: preparing the practice — "It is generally the role of the primary care pediatrician to manage mild-to-moderate ADHD, anxiety, depression, and substance use". Foundational competencies are highlighted: "The AAP statement 'The Future of Pediatrics: Mental Health Competencies for Pediatric Primary Care' describes the competencies needed in both pediatric primary and specialty care to address the social-emotional and mental health needs of children and families. Broadly, these include incorporating mental health content and tools into health promotion, prevention, and primary care intervention, becoming knowledgeable about use of evidence-based treatments, and participating as a team member and comanaging with pediatric and mental health specialists".

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^b0a71820]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Process of care algorithm (PoCA) and systems barriers — the guideline is supported by 2 accompanying documents, including a PoCA and an article on systemic barriers to care. In this revised guideline and accompanying PoCA, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment are a continuous process, and the PoCA provides recommendations for implementing the guideline steps, although there is less evidence for the PoCA than for the guidelines; the section on evaluating and treating comorbidities has also been expanded. There are many system-level barriers that hamper adoption, and the procedures recommended in this guideline necessitate spending more time, developing a care management system with school and other community stakeholders, and providing continuous, coordinated care. There is some evidence that African American and Latino children are less likely to have ADHD diagnosed and are less likely to be treated for ADHD, and special attention should be given to these populations when assessing comorbidities and when treating ADHD symptoms. Given the nationwide problem of limited access to mental health clinicians, pediatricians and other PCCs are increasingly called on to provide services, and the AAP holds that primary care pediatricians should be prepared to diagnose and manage mild-to-moderate ADHD, anxiety, depression, and problematic substance use, as well as co-manage patients who have more severe conditions with mental health professionals.

### What is attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? [^6961635c]. Journal of Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is described as the most common neurobehavioral condition of childhood. We raise the concern that ADHD is not a disease per se but rather a group of symptoms representing a final common behavioral pathway for a gamut of emotional, psychological, and/or learning problems. Increasing numbers of children, especially boys, are diagnosed with ADHD and treated with stimulant medications according to a simplified approach. Methodical review of the literature, however, raised concerning issues. "Core" ADHD symptoms of inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsivity are not unique to ADHD. Rates of "comorbid" psychiatric and learning problems, including depression and anxiety, range from 12 to 60%, with significant symptom overlap with ADHD, difficulties in diagnosis, and evidence-based treatment methods that do not include stimulant medications. No neuropsychologic test result is pathognomic for ADHD, and structural and functional neuroimaging studies have not identified a unique etiology for ADHD. No genetic marker has been consistently identified, and heritability studies are confounded by familial environmental factors. The validity of the Conners' Rating Scale-Revised has been seriously questioned, and parent and teacher "ratings" of school children are frequently discrepant, suggesting that use of subjective informant data via scale or interview does not form an objective basis for diagnosis of ADHD. Empiric diagnostic trials of stimulant medication that produce a behavioral response have been shown not to distinguish between children with and without "ADHD". In summary, the working dogma that ADHD is a disease or neurobehavioral condition does not at this time hold up to scrutiny of evidence. Thorough evaluation of symptomatic children should be individualized, and include assessment of educational, psychologic, psychiatric, and family needs.

### Practice parameter on the use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents [^0b67c0f4]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Psychotropic medication use in children and adolescents — basic and clinical research supports the safe and effective use of psychotropic medications, and efficacy and safety data are available for single pharmacological agents in the short-term treatment of childhood psychiatric disorders including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), other anxiety disorders including separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder, and mania and tic disorders; there is also evidence supporting the use of medications for aggression and serious problems with impulse control in children with disruptive behavior disorders and autism, data from adult studies and from extensive clinical practice can guide medication choices for disorders that present similarly in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood (e.g., schizophrenia), and increasing knowledge about the longer term safety and usefulness of some medications in children and adolescents complements short-term safety and efficacy.

### Antipsychotic treatment among youths with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^96aeeda7]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How commonly are youths with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder treated with antipsychotic medications and what factors are associated with their use of antipsychotic treatment?

Findings

In this cohort study of 187 563 commercially insured youths with new episodes of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 2.3% were treated with an antipsychotic medication, among whom 52.7% had a potential clinical diagnostic rationale for antipsychotic treatment. Factors for antipsychotic medication use included older patient age, male sex, recent inpatient and other pharmacologic mental health treatments, self-harm/suicidal ideation; and oppositional defiant, substance use, depressive, and anxiety disorders.

Meaning

Approximately 1 in 40 commercially insured youths were treated with an antipsychotic medication without an approved indication in the year following a new attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosis; mental health comorbidities may be associated with antipsychotic treatment in this group.

### The impact of published guidance on trends in the pharmacological management of depression in children and adolescents-a whole population e-cohort data linkage study in wales, UK [^81c97267]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Measures

Demographic information (sex, age, and deprivation quintile) was collected at the onset of follow-up each year. Person time was calculated between the start and end dates for each year. Age was categorized into three groups 6–11 years, 12–14 years, and 15–17 years.

'Depression was assessed using externally validated measures applied to GP data including both diagnosis and symptom codes as defined and validated previously (Cornish, John, Boyd, Tilling, & Macleod; John et al.). These code lists have been developed and validated using multiple possible algorithms and have been extensively utilized in previous research. For a full description see'.

Incidence and prevalence of depression and antidepressant prescriptions were explored. Incidence was defined as no record in the previous 12 months. Prevalence was defined as any record of the above within a given year, independent of any previous events (John et al.). We explored 'Treated' events. This was defined as a diagnosis or symptom date with at least one antidepressant prescribing event within six months either side of the diagnosis or symptom event date.

We also explored antidepressant prescriptions in the population as a whole independent of diagnosis or indication. First ever incident prescriptions were divided by antidepressant type and proportions calculated to explore which antidepressants were being prescribed as first line antidepressant and which were most likely to be prescribed subsequently once another antidepressant has already been prescribed.

Antidepressants may be prescribed for a number of conditions other than depression. GP data does not explicitly list the indication for a prescription. We identified possible indications by temporal proximity within one year before and six months after annual incident antidepressant prescriptions. We firstly identified cases of depression, followed by anxiety and depression. For those without a record of depression/anxiety, we searched the GP records to identify the following probable indications: 'pain' (including neuropathic pain and headaches/migraine prophylaxis), enuresis and 'other', which included, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), psychosis, eating disorders, sleep problems and irritable bowel syndrome. We further categorized 'unknown', where no apparent indication was established. No hierarchical system was applied meaning prescriptions could be linked to more than one category i.e. both 'pain' and 'other'.

### Pediatrician-psychiatrist collaboration to care for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, and anxiety [^6b9ffbc6]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe pediatrician experiences collaborating with psychiatrists when caring for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and anxiety.

Method

A random sample of Massachusetts primary care pediatricians completed a mailed self-report survey.

Results

Response rate was 50% (100/198). Most pediatricians preferred psychiatrists to initiate medications for anxiety (87%) or depression (85%), but not ADHD (22%). Only 14% of respondents usually received information about a psychiatry consultation. For most (88%), the family was the primary conduit of information from psychiatrists, although few (14%) believed the family to be a dependable informant. Despite this lack of direct communication, most pediatricians reported refilling psychiatry-initiated prescriptions for ADHD (88%), depression (76%), and anxiety (72%).

Conclusions

Pediatricians preferred closer collaboration with psychiatrists for managing children with anxiety and depression, but not ADHD. The communication gap between psychiatrists and pediatricians raises concerns about quality of care for children with psychiatric conditions.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in adults [^8076ae6e]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder involving functionally disruptive inattentive and/or hyperactive/impulsive behaviors, such as being easily distracted, regularly failing to follow through on tasks, being restless, or often interrupting others. ADHD diagnosed in childhood often persists into adulthood, with 14.6% of U.S. adults meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., criteria for ADHD. When evaluating for adult ADHD, other mental disorders should be included in the differential diagnosis due to the substantial overlap of symptoms and ADHD concurrence with anxiety/stress, mood, personality, impulse control, and substance use disorders. An ADHD diagnosis requires a comprehensive clinical history and evaluation, patient symptom and function assessment (e.g. Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales), and gathering of collateral information. Clinical guidelines recommend a subset of amphetamine and methylphenidate stimulants as first-line pharmacotherapy, which may be more effective when combined with psychotherapy. For adults unable to take stimulants or with concurrent anxiety/depression, options include atomoxetine, viloxazine, and bupropion. To monitor for patient misuse or diversion of stimulants, physicians should consider employing controlled substance agreements and prescription drug monitoring programs.

### The 5-year course of medication treatment in childhood anxiety disorders [^44a54d72]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

For pediatric psychiatric disorders, given the marked increase in use of medications without an understanding of the typical treatment course, the primary goal of the current study was to examine the course of pharmacotherapy over 5 years in children with newly diagnosed anxiety disorders.

Methods

We reviewed provider billing and prescription ordering records of a tertiary medical center from 2008 through 2015 to identify children (aged 7–17 years) newly diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and to determine the psychopharmacologic treatment that they received from 2010 through 2015. The frequency at which patients received prescriptions from 9 classes of psychotropic medications at any point during the study period was determined. We used χ² analyses and independent sample t tests to examine the relationship between receiving a psychotropic prescription and various patient characteristics.

Results

The study cohort included 108 patients (mean [SD] age = 12.8 [3.3] years). In this group, 73.1% received pharmacotherapy on at least 1 occasion over the 5-year period, and 41.7% received medications from more than 1 class. Of those who received a prescription, 50% (27/54) of patients remained on medication for 5 years. This estimate rose to 71% (5/7) within the subset of patients who were medication-naive at the beginning of the observation period and were still in high school during year 5.

Conclusions

Guidelines implying discontinuation of medication after symptom remission and a limited period of stability do not accurately reflect clinical practice.

### ADHD diagnosis and timing of medication initiation among children aged 3 to 5 years [^e7034316]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Study Design and Cohort Selection

This was a retrospective cohort study of EHR data from all encounters (office, telehealth, telephone, and administrative) of children aged 3 to 5 years seen between January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2023, in primary care clinics affiliated with 8 academic institutions. We included children who were seen 2 or more times with at least 6 months of follow-up. Primary care clinics were identified using a procedure validated in 1 institution, requiring (1) 5% or more well-care visits among all visits, (2) 1 or more childhood immunization procedure code, and (3) removing care sites whose names were null or included the word laboratory (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).

We defined an ADHD-related encounter as an encounter with ADHD diagnoses or medication prescriptions (stimulants included methylphenidate or amphetamines; nonstimulants included α-agonists or atomoxetine). In a prior study, we found that PCPs frequently used symptom-level diagnoses of ADHD (eg, hyperactivity) in children younger than 6 years. Accordingly, we defined 2 types of ADHD diagnoses: (1) disorder level (eg, ADHD combined subtype) and (2) symptom level (eg, hyperactivity or inattention). Patients were included in the ADHD cohort if they received at least 1 disorder-level ADHD diagnosis between ages 4 and 5 years because guidelines recommend considering an ADHD diagnosis starting from age 4 years. ADHD medications prescribed after the initial diagnosis and before age 7 years were included.

To capture PCP documentation of common developmental and/or behavioral comorbid conditions, as recommended by practice guidelines, we extracted for each patient any visit diagnosis of comorbid conditions (autism, anxiety, depression, disruptive behavior disorder, global developmental delay or intellectual disability, language delay or disorder, learning problem or disability, and sleep problems) documented at or after the initial ADHD diagnosis. eTables 2 and 3 in Supplement 1 detail code sets for ADHD diagnoses, ADHD medications, and comorbid diagnoses.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^dcb62e23]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ADHD — adolescents (Age 12 Years to the 18th Birthday): Obtaining teacher reports for adolescents is often more challenging than for younger children, and clinicians need to try to obtain information from at least 2 teachers or other sources, such as coaches, school guidance counselors, or leaders of community activities in which the adolescent participates. For the evaluation to be successful, it is essential that adolescents agree with and participate in the evaluation, and variability in ratings is to be expected. Adolescents' reports of their own behaviors often differ from other observers because they tend to minimize their own problematic behaviors. To meet DSM-5 criteria, adolescents must have some reported or documented manifestations of inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity before age 12; therefore, clinicians must establish manifestations before age 12 and strongly consider whether a mimicking or comorbid condition, such as substance use, depression, and/or anxiety, is present. Risks that increase during adolescence include mood and anxiety disorders, risky sexual behaviors, intentional self-harm and suicidal behaviors, and clinicians should also be aware that adolescents are at greater risk for substance use than younger children; certain substances, such as marijuana, can have effects that mimic ADHD, and adolescent patients may also attempt to obtain stimulant medication to enhance performance (ie, academic, athletic, etc) by feigning symptoms. Trauma experiences, posttraumatic stress disorder, and toxic stress are additional comorbidities and risk factors of concern.

### Clinical update: collaborative mental health care for children and adolescents in pediatric primary care [^b6a9d25c]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Roles of integrated mental health care team members — primary care clinician (PCC), care manager/behavioral health consultant (CM/BHC), child and adolescent psychiatrist, and other specialist consultants — are outlined with typical functions across mental health (MH) screening, assessment, prescribing, coordination, psychotherapy, and consultation. The primary care clinician responsibilities include universal MH screening, initial MH assessment or triage, patient/family engagement, and joint diagnosis and treatment planning; first-line medication prescribing for anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as indicated; periodic meetings to review progress and collaboratively adjust care; consideration of child and adolescent psychiatrist consultation and treatment escalation if progress is lacking; second-line medication prescribing in consultation; specialty referrals; and planning for treatment discontinuation and follow-up. The CM/BHC coordinates care by maintaining a registry, conducting focused MH assessment and psychosocial needs evaluation, collaborating with the PCC and family on treatment planning, arranging psychosocial resources and services from child-serving entities, assessing barriers and treatment response via periodic symptom rating scales, meeting periodically with the PCC, facilitating care transitions, considering specialty referral and discontinuation timing, planning post-discontinuation follow-up, and using health information technology for information sharing and care coordination. Psychotherapeutic interventions include developing a therapeutic alliance, providing brief cross-diagnostic psychotherapy, problem-solving for challenging psychosocial situations, support for coping with chronic medical conditions, and MH education for the integrated team. The child and adolescent psychiatrist meets periodically with CM/BHC to review the patient registry, provides diagnostic clarification and review of the formulation and plan and treatment progress, and suggests psychosocial/psychotherapeutic, pharmacologic, and other specialty referrals as indicated. Other specialist consultants conduct additional physical, developmental, cognitive, social/emotional/behavioral, academic, and family assessments as indicated.

### Medication use in the management of comorbidities among individuals with autism spectrum disorder from a large nationwide insurance database [^2468232a]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2016, approximately 1.9% (1 in 54) of US children 8 years of age were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and the prevalence has increased since then. That growth has spurred more expansive efforts to understand not only the prevalence of the disease but also its comorbidities and corresponding pharmacological treatments.

Management of ASD has focused primarily on behavioral and educational interventions, which address core deficiencies in social communication and repetitive patterns of behavior. Although pharmacological intervention is not intended to reverse ASD-related disabilities, medications can treat symptoms of ASD and co-occurring conditions, including intellectual disabilities, language delays, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, agitation, irritability, disruptive behavior, and sleep disorders.,

At least 83% of children and adolescents with ASD in the US have at least 1 co-occurring developmental disorder, and 70% display a co-occurring psychiatric condition. Physicians have treated these comorbidities with pharmaceutical agents, with varying degrees of success.,

Overall, pharmacological agents used to treat patients with ASD fall into 3 broad categories, each of which is based on the symptoms targeted: (1) agitation and irritation; (2) hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentive-type ADHD; and (3) mood and anxiety disorders, including major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The major psychotropic medication classes used in individuals with ASD include ADHD medications (stimulants, α 2 -adrenergic agonists, and neurotransmitter modulators), antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, anxiolytics, and hypnotics.

The prescription rates of these medications for patients with ASD have not been clearly established. Some studies, have estimated that 30% to 50% of patients with ASD have been treated with at least 1 medication. However, these estimates may be unreliable because they were derived from studies that depended primarily on patient surveys; have not been replicated after shifts in diagnostic criteria for ASD; and/or predate the establishment of the Affordable Care Act and other significant changes to prescription drug coverage. Despite these limitations, however, the use of pharmacotherapy in patients with ASD appears to be growing rapidly; the prescription rate of stimulants to treat co-occurring ADHD and ASD increased 5-fold from 1990 to 2001.

### Trauma-informed care [^bb260ac8]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis considerations and comorbidities — the provider is encouraged to consider trauma as a possible etiology in the assessment of developmental, mental health, behavioral, and physical symptoms in all pediatric encounters because of the following: (1) the experience of adversity is so common; (2) the symptoms of trauma overlap with the symptoms of other common pediatric conditions; and (3) failure to do so might lead to an incorrect or incomplete diagnosis and treatment, enabling the effects of trauma to further embed; trauma may be mistaken for other conditions, such as attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder, and includes symptoms that overlap with other diagnostic categories, such as anxiety and depression; it has been proposed that trauma may result in a different "ecophenotype" of common conditions that have a different trajectory and different response to common treatments; children may also have comorbid conditions, such as ADHD, anxiety, depression, or developmental and learning issues, because they frequently accompany childhood trauma; a more detailed description of diagnoses that are commonly confused with trauma or comorbid with it are covered in the AAP clinical report "Children Exposed to Maltreatment: Assessment and the Role of Psychotropic Medication".

### Treatment rates for mental disorders among children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^406a11a9]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Over the past several decades, the prevalence of mental disorders among children and adolescents has been increasing substantially, which has caused a heavy burden on the public. Anxiety, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and behavior disorders, such as oppositional-defiant disorder and conduct disorders, are the most common mental disorders among children and adolescents: a meta-analysis showed that the worldwide pooled prevalence reached 7% for anxiety disorders, 3% for depressive disorders, 3% for ADHD, and 6% for behavior disorders. The prevalence of mental disorders varies considerably in different regions: 20% in North America, 12% in Europe and Asia, and 8% in Africa. Sex and age differences are also apparent: for instance, boys are more likely than girls to receive a diagnosis of ADHD and adolescents are more susceptible than children to affective disorders and behavior disorders.

Among children and adolescents, mental disorders are associated with a variety of negative outcomes, such as absenteeism, substance abuse, and suicidal behaviors. Moreover, the detrimental effect of early initiated mental disorders can extend into adulthood: longitudinal studies found that approximately 75% of psychiatric diseases diagnosed among adults had roots in childhood or adolescence. Timely and effective treatment of mental disorders significantly reduces the risk of subsequent negative outcomes and saves related health costs. Currently, evidence-based pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments have been used in managing mental disorders among children and adolescents. However, owing to concerns regarding safety and adverse effects, the use of medication among children and adolescents is still controversial. Nonpharmacologic methods have been more widely used in this age group. For example, abundant studies have proven that family-centered psychotherapies that require the involvement of parents are critical in the therapeutic success of mental disorders among children and adolescents.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^e774adb8]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

When an individual has a diagnosis of both ADHD and ASD, the trigger point for prescribing medication is when the ADHD symptom presentation is severe and/or associated with impairments that hamper personal, social and educational development and achievement. However, given the substantial symptom overlap between the two conditions, when an individual (child or adult) presents with both, there is merit in commencing with psychological/environmental interventions to treat the associated difficulties of ASD, monitor outcomes and review the need for medication as appropriate. In childhood and adolescence, should psychological/environmental interventions fail, then ADHD medications (stimulant and non-stimulant) are helpful for the characteristic symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity when these are clearly evident (e.g. distinguishing agitation for hyperactivity) and arise from ADHD. However, in adults with co-occurring ASD and ADHD, medication to treat their ADHD should be offered as appropriate, with regular monitoring, and should not wait until psychological treatment has been completed. This is especially the case where there is a shortage of specialised ASD/ADHD adult psychology services and where medication for ADHD may be a more immediately available treatment option. Medication for ADHD may also enable adults to better concentrate and maximise benefits from psychological treatment.

Prescribers need to be mindful of the presence of conditions or problems co-existing with combined ADHD and ASD and, if appropriate, prescribe medication, e.g. melatonin may help with the insomnia associated with stimulants. An SSRI may be prescribed to treat depression and/or curb anxiety, though should be used with caution, e.g. SSRI's can interact adversely with amfetamine and in the USA their dispensed packaging carries a 'black box' warning about suicidality in the young, (although this practice is not paralleled in te UK or Europe). The use of second-generation antipsychotics to reduce aggressive behaviour, especially in association with comorbid oppositional defiant or conduct disorder, is mentioned above. There is only limited evidence to suggest that stimulants worsen tics, although the possibility of an increase in tics in some individuals should not be ignored and medication adjusted accordingly.

### Children exposed to maltreatment: assessment and the role of psychotropic medication [^79b7375f]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Other diagnostic considerations in maltreated youth — Children and adolescents with a history of maltreatment are at increased risk of non–trauma-specific disorders, with anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) overrepresented; depending on provider experience, standardized measures should be used to assess possible psychiatric diagnoses or a referral to a child psychiatrist should be made. The intrusive and hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD can appear similar to anxiety or ADHD, so assessing additional traumatic stress symptoms, the temporal relationship of maltreatment to symptom onset/exacerbation, and responses to prior pharmacologic interventions may provide insight; symptoms initially labeled as anxiety or ADHD may be better explained by PTSD and may not be appropriate for pharmacotherapy. Over time, when anxiety, depression, and ADHD are clearly identified, monotherapy trials of psychotropic medications may be warranted. Suicidal ideation and attempts are often related to mental illness generally; older maltreated youth are at increased risk of suicidality and self-harm, asking about self-harm and suicidal ideation is critical, and measures such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale can assist practitioners in standardizing their approach.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology course on child and adolescent psychopharmacology has been run for more than 20years and is currently a very popular course, attracting around 140 delegates/year from across the United Kingdom and abroad. As Faculty of recent sessions of the course, we have selected the most common questions we have been asked in recent years and provided evidence-based and/or expert-informed answers. We have included 27 questions and answers related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depressive disorders, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, epilepsy (in differential diagnosis or comorbid with mental health conditions), obsessive-compulsive disorder, personality disorders, psychotic spectrum disorders, and tics/Tourette syndrome in children and young people. We hope that this article will be helpful for prescribers in their daily clinical practice and we look forward to further, high-level evidence informing the answers to these and other questions in child and adolescent psychopharmacology.

APA guideline — child/adolescent depression and co-morbidity: A large proportion of children and adolescents with depression also meet criteria for comorbid psychiatric disorders, with the most common disorders including anxiety and behavioral (conduct and oppositional defiant) disorders, and youth with primary depression, compared with youth with primary anxiety, are more likely to have other comorbidities. Research over the past 10 years suggests that almost half of community youth with primary depression also meet criteria for anxiety disorders, while just under 20% of community youth with primary anxiety also meet criteria for a depressive disorder; additional comorbidities include substance use and abuse, sleep problems, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Reports note some sex differences in comorbidity patterns, but recent research points to fewer sex differences with greater depressive illness severity associated with likelihood of co-morbidity equally between boys and girls, and physical health conditions such as smoking, obesity, and drug use are also associated with depression and differ across races/ethnicities.

### Deep learning algorithms reveal genomic markers for anxiety disorder in a large cohort of children with down syndrome [^35da2228]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents have become a global healthcare concern because of the rapid growth in prevalence over the past decades. Based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statistics, between 2016 and 2019, 9.4% of children aged 3–17 years were diagnosed with anxiety, which accounts for approximately 5.8 million individuals in the US. This rate has shown a notable upward trend in recent decades. Although anxiety is often considered alongside other mental disorders and is one of the most common co-occurring conditions, it has distinct characteristics that differentiate it from other mental illnesses. For instance, anxiety is primarily driven by emotional dysregulation, whereas other behavioral disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) — a neurodevelopmental disorder — exhibit fundamentally different core features. Even among mood disorders, anxiety and depression, though commonly comorbid and influenced by stress, have distinct clinical presentations. Anxiety is characterized by excessive worry and fear, whereas depression is marked by persistent sadness and loss of interest in activities. These differences also extend to their diagnosis and treatment, as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). For example, ADHD treatment typically involves stimulant or non-stimulant medications, while anxiety management often includes antidepressants or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Even among mood disorders, treatment approaches vary — anxiety therapy focuses on managing triggers, panic attacks, and excessive worry, whereas depression therapy emphasizes addressing feelings of hopelessness, low mood, and disinterest in activities. These distinctions underscore the importance of recognizing anxiety as a separate clinical entity, necessitating tailored approaches for its diagnosis and treatment.

### Utilization of psychotropic medications in children with FASD: a retrospective review [^28a649ca]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

FASD is a complex brain condition associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) affecting cognitive, neurological, social and interpersonal functions leading to lifelong disability. Neurodevelopmental disorder associated with PAE (ND-PAE) is recognised in the DSM-5. In Canada, an estimated 1.4–4% of babies are born with ND-PAE/FASD. The comorbidities associated with ND-PAE/FASD are wide ranging and can affect multiple areas of an individual's functioning, including their cognition, behaviour, mood, and general wellbeing. Many children with FASD require psychopharmacological treatments for comorbid emotional and behaviour problems.

While clear diagnostic thresholds and guidelines exist for ND-PAE/FASD, guidelines for treatment of the condition are still emerging. Currently, there are well agreed upon guidelines for psychosocial management in children with ND-PAE/FASD; the approach is largely targeted at the individual's personal relationships, as well as their symptoms specific to their particular neurodevelopmental deficits. Most recommended psychosocial interventions have been subjected to rigorous randomized double blind control studies providing the evidential basis. With respect to psychotropic medication interventions, the research is limited, and the findings lack consensus. The challenge herein is the result of the multiple comorbidities associated with ND-PAE/FASD: medical management risks overmedicating individuals and producing multiple adverse effects. Furthermore, many cases are underdiagnosed and have variance of symptom severity among patients and throughout an individual's life. Evidently, the challenges inherent to prescribing for ND-PAE/FASD are significant, especially for clinicians with limited exposure to the disorder.

The literature concerning medical intervention in ND-PAE/FASD is centred around stimulants, mood stabilisers, and medicines influencing dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine receptors. Early research in this area has shown promising treatment algorithms for disorders related to ND-PAE/FASD, namely, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. The need for a treatment algorithm for the entirety of ND-PAE/FASD is well known and has been advocated for by the Canada FASD Research Network and their Family Advisor Committee. As a result of this call to action, a multidisciplinary panel of experts was formed and developed an algorithm for the psychotropic medical management of individuals with ND-PAE/FASD. From their work, four clusters representing ND-PAE/FASD was outlined and a treatment for each cluster was proposed (Fig. 1.).

Anxiety disorders comprise the most prevalent mental health disorders among children and adults. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are effective in improving clinical impairments from anxiety disorders and maintaining these improvements. This article discusses how to obtain a suitable diagnosis for anxiety disorders in youth for implementing appropriate treatments, focusing on the evidence base for pharmacologic treatment. Clinical guidelines are discussed, including Food and Drug Administration indications and off-label use of medications, and considerations for special populations and youth with comorbidities are highlighted. Findings suggest moderate effectiveness of medication, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, in the treatment of anxiety disorders in youth.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: part I [^3d17c48a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Are they really 'treatment resistant'?

Pharmacologically treatment-resistant depression is defined, in adults, by at least two prior treatment failures with adequate dose and duration. Similarly, pharmacologically treatment-resistant anxiety has been recently defined in adults as at least two separate failed full trials of pharmacological monotherapy with first-line agents approved for those disorders by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency or other equivalent regulatory agencies, and recommended by guidelines. Treatment-resistant depression and anxiety in children and young people are difficult to treat, with little research evidence to guide the practitioner. However, we need to review the history of treatment before concluding there is treatment resistance. Notably, significant numbers of people stop antidepressants when they have minor side effects which may have worn off if they had persevered. The amount of time needed to wait until side effects go away is very variable, but we would advise patients to persevere for a month if side effects are tolerable, before stopping.

It may be worth going back to re-try the antidepressant with psychoeducation and encouragement to persevere. A slower dose titration may also reduce the impact of side effects. It is also appropriate to increase the dose to BNF dose limits if tolerated. It is important to discuss with the patient and their families the risks and benefits of this strategy, and how this is outside the license for adolescents, but is an acceptable treatment for adults, and often used in adolescents.

A particularly concerning side effect of SSRIs is increased suicidal thoughts. These have only been demonstrated to be significantly higher than placebo in randomised controlled trials of depression, not of anxiety, and indeed the UK 2003 MHRA and USA 2004 FDA Black Box warnings only applied to adolescent depression, not anxiety disorders. However, negative results in anxiety may reflect a lower baseline risk and fewer total participants in trials. Hence, prescribers need to watch carefully for suicidality. Due to the severe potential consequences of suicidal thoughts, many prescribers and families would choose not to continue SSRIs if they emerged.

### Atomoxetine alone or combined with fluoxetine for treating ADHD with comorbid depressive or anxiety symptoms [^185fe643]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Symptoms of depression and anxiety are commonly comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The authors assessed the safety and effectiveness of atomoxetine monotherapy compared with combined atomoxetine/fluoxetine therapy in a population of children and adolescents with ADHD and concurrent symptoms of depression or anxiety.

Method

Patients were randomized to treatment with fluoxetine (n = 127) or placebo (n = 46) under double-blind conditions for 8 weeks, with concomitant atomoxetine use the last 5 weeks.

Results

At end point, reductions in ADHD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms were marked for both treatment groups (p < .001 for the relevant scale in each symptom cluster). Some differences between treatment groups for depressive symptoms were significant, but the magnitudes of the differences were small and likely of limited clinical importance. Completion rates for the two groups were similar, as were discontinuation rates for adverse events. The combination group had greater increases in blood pressure and pulse than did the monotherapy group.

Conclusions

In pediatric patients with ADHD and comorbid symptoms of depression or anxiety, atomoxetine monotherapy appears to be effective for treating ADHD. Anxiety and depressive symptoms also improved, but the absence of a placebo-only arm does not allow us to conclude that these effects are specifically the result of treatment with atomoxetine. Combined atomoxetine/fluoxetine therapy was well tolerated.

### ADHD in adults with recurrent depression [^a997d462]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Our findings have important clinical implications. They suggest that in women with early onset, recurrent depression in adulthood, the possibility of depression masking underlying ADHD needs to be considered. Effective treatment of ADHD along with depression could improve functioning and associated depression symptoms. Even for those who do not meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD, higher ADHD symptoms appear to index a worse clinical picture. It is possible that they represent a 'neurodevelopmental type' of depression presentation, including earlier age of onset, increased severity and recurrence and more prominent irritability. Therefore, they may require more frequent follow-up or different types of management for depression. It will be important for future studies to examine whether this group might respond to different types of depression treatment to those that are typically used for depression such as cognitive behavioural therapy and SSRI antidepressants.

Limitations of this work include the measurement of ADHD was based on a questionnaire measure completed at one assessment wave. Also, in this study we focussed on women with adolescent children who had participated in a longitudinal study of recurrent depression so the findings may not apply to males or other groups, for example, hospitalised patients. The rate of ADHD observed may be influenced by specific characteristics of the present sample. Rates of ADHD may be higher in this sample because individuals all had recurrent depression. However, given that ADHD is associated with multiple social and educational impairments, those with comorbid ADHD also may be under-represented in this sample. As age of onset was reported retrospectively in this study, results may be affected by recall bias. In addition, the retrospective data did not allow for reliable differentiation between childhood, adolescent or early adulthood onset depression within the early-onset group, which have been found to behave differently in terms of associations and persistence when age of onset is inferred using prospectively collected data. Overall comorbidity as opposed to comorbidity with ADHD specifically may have contributed to results. Indeed, we observed high rates of co-occurring anxiety symptoms in the recurrently depressed adults with ADHD symptoms, which is consistent with previous studies that report high rates of comorbidity of ADHD with both anxiety and with depression. However, when adjusting our regressions for anxiety symptoms, results remained very similar (Supplement 5), suggesting the impact of ADHD on depression presentation is still observed when accounting for other comorbidity. It is also important to note that although use of non-first-line antidepressant medication can indicate poor response to first-line antidepressants or a complex clinical presentation, there may be other reasons that a non-first-line antidepressant is prescribed, for example, experience of side effects. As is common in longitudinal cohort studies, there was some attrition of the sample over time. Analysis of baseline factors associated with drop-out at wave 4 (Supplement 4), showed that while factors such as lower socioeconomic status and education were associated with attrition, other factors associated with severity of depression and history of depression treatment were not. These included the percentage of the participant's life that they had been unwell since depression onset and previous non-pharmacological treatment for depression (including talking therapies and electroconvulsive therapy). This might suggest that those with more severe depression or a history of depression treatment may be more likely to stay in the current study, which is likely due to the inclusion criteria of the EPAD study, namely that the participant had experienced at least 2 prior episodes of depression. Nevertheless, to account for any potential bias arising from attrition, analyses were adjusted for variables associated with missingness, helping to address potential bias due to missing data. In addition, regression results when inverse probability weights were applied remained similar, suggesting bias due to missingness was minimal (Supplement 3).

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^e0106a2f]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to pediatric and adolescent patients, pharmacotherapy, APA 2019 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend other medications in adolescent patients. Ensure shared decision-making regarding medication options with a child psychiatrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care, if fluoxetine is not a treatment option or is not acceptable.

### Cognitive-behavioural therapy in medication-treated adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and co-morbid psychopathology: a randomized controlled trial using multi-level analysis [^88d4ea12]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by high rates of co-morbid psychopathology. Randomized controlled trials of multimodal interventions, combining pharmacological and psychological treatments, have shown a robust treatment effect for ADHD symptoms but outcomes for co-morbid symptoms have been mixed. This may be accounted for by the type of intervention selected and/or by methodological problems including lack of follow-up and low power. The current study addressed these limitations in a parallel-group randomized controlled trial conducted in Iceland.

Method

A total of 95 adult ADHD patients who were already being treated with medication (MED) were randomly assigned to receive treatment as usual (TAU/MED) or 15 sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT/MED) using the R&R2ADHD intervention which employs both group and individual modalities. Primary measures of ADHD symptoms and severity of illness, and secondary measures of anxiety, depression and quality of life were given at baseline, end of treatment and 3-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were rated by clinicians blind to treatment condition assignment.

Results

CBT/MED showed overall (combined outcome at end of treatment and 3-month follow-up) significantly greater reduction in primary outcomes for clinician-rated and self-rated ADHD symptoms. Treatment effect of primary outcomes was maintained at follow-up, which suggests robust and lasting findings. In contrast to the primary outcomes, the secondary outcomes showed significant improvement over time.

Conclusions

The study provides evidence for the effectiveness of R&R2ADHD and demonstrates that there are differential effects over time for ADHD symptoms versus co-morbid problems, the latter taking longer to show positive effects.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity screening — KAS 3 directs that, in the evaluation of a child or adolescent for ADHD, the PCC should include a process to at least screen for comorbid conditions, including emotional or behavioral conditions (eg, anxiety, depression, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorders, substance use), developmental conditions (eg, learning and language disorders, autism spectrum disorders), and physical conditions (eg, tics, sleep apnea), with a Grade B: strong recommendation. The table classifies aggregate evidence quality as Grade B and strength as Strong recommendation, noting benefits that identifying comorbid conditions is important in developing the most appropriate treatment plan, risks that the major risk is misdiagnosing the comorbid condition(s) and providing inappropriate care, and an assessment that there is a preponderance of benefits over harm. The page also states that the majority of both boys and girls with ADHD also meet diagnostic criteria for another mental disorder and that in some cases, the presence of a comorbid condition will alter the treatment of ADHD.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^9bca9514]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Depression treatment — monitoring engagement with treatment — emphasizes evaluating patient comprehension and application of prescribed directions and verifying medication adherence. To better assess whether a treatment works involves determining the patient's actual comprehension or application of any suggestions or directions prescribed by the therapist, and from a pharmacotherapy perspective this includes identifying whether the patient followed directions regarding medication, such as taking the prescribed pills at the appropriate time.

### Evaluation of ADHD medications, externalizing symptoms, and suicidality in children… [^5d27d1cd]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Scatter plots and linear regression lines show estimated probabilities of baseline suicidality in 11 161 children not receiving antidepressant or antipsychotic medication and 259 children receiving AD or AP medication. Externalizing symptoms included ADHD hyperactivity symptoms, oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, and conduct disorder symptoms. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that ADHD medication treatment is associated with less suicidality in children with substantial externalizing symptoms and may be used to inform childhood suicide prevention strategies. The association of ADHD medication was similar in both the population of 11 161 children not receiving additional psychiatric medication and the 259 children receiving AD or AP medication. Leveraging the ABCD Study cohort, we document that ADHD medication is associated with less suicidality in preadolescent children with externalizing symptoms. The observed difference in suicidality between children receiving and not receiving ADHD medication was greatest among children with the most externalizing symptoms. In addition, amphetamines and α-2-agonists may be prescribed differently than methylphenidate, 45 confounding their associations by indication.

Our findings for methylphenidate are in line with prior evidence supporting the effectiveness of methylphenidate in reducing impulsivity, 46 which contributes to the suicide risk–bearing association of ADHD in youth. 47–49 Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the potential protective association of methylphenidate vs other medications with youth suicidality. In conclusion, this study found that ADHD medication was associated with less suicidality in children with high externalizing symptom burden, equally for both sexes. The findings reported here may provide immediate and practical implications to potentially reduce childhood suicidality. Given the high prevalence of externalizing disorders among children, including ADHD, ODD, and CD, it is critical that we optimize both psychoeducation and pharmacotherapy interventions to shift otherwise adverse developmental trajectories and improve functional and clinical outcomes.

Co-occurring disorders — scope and care coordination notes that this section addresses the most common and/or problematic co-occurring psychiatric disorders known to be caused by and/or exacerbated by StUDs, including psychosis, depression, and anxiety, and targets specific factors that would alter clinical management; ADHD is addressed in more detail due to the clinical complexity of utilizing psychostimulant medications in individuals with co-occurring StUD and ADHD. The CGC noted that people with StUDs and co-occurring psychiatric disorders experience additional barriers to accessing and remaining in SUD treatment, and clinicians should facilitate referrals and access to appropriate care whenever possible; care should be coordinated when patients are receiving concurrent care for a co-occurring condition.

### Effect of pharmacological treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder on later psychiatric comorbidity: a population-based prospective long-term study [^50bb8ffc]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Clinical implications

Clinicians should be aware that most children and adolescents with ADHD will be diagnosed with additional psychiatric disorders, and that pharmacological treatment may have protective effects on some of these comorbidities. However, although we did not find support for any harmful causal effect of ADHD medication on psychiatric comorbidity for patients on the margin of treatment, both benefits and risks should be monitored carefully in the follow-up of individual patients.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^58882497]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

ASAM/AAAP stimulant use disorder (StUD) with co-occurring psychiatric conditions — symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and/or attentional problems are commonly observed during stimulant use and withdrawal, and the CGC recommended considering initiation of pharmacotherapy if warranted based on symptom severity and chronicity, even if symptoms are judged to be stimulant induced. For patients with preexisting co-occurring psychiatric disorders, the CGC recommended continuing current medications when appropriate and with consideration for their safety in the context of potential continued use of stimulants or other substances, noting that continuing such medications is likely to yield improved outcomes in psychiatric disorder management compared to discontinuation of treatment in the majority of cases, particularly when psychiatric symptoms are severe or persistent. Clinicians should be aware that adherence to and effectiveness of medications for psychiatric conditions is likely to be reduced in the context of ongoing stimulant use, and unknown potential adverse interactions between medications and stimulants could occur; the CGC also noted that clinician expertise in both StUD and psychiatric disorders is helpful when treating patients with co-occurring conditions.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^42e65063]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has surged, with an estimated 1 in 36 eight-year-olds in the United States meeting criteria for ASD in 2020. Autistic individuals face elevated rates of co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and behavioral conditions compared to non-autistic individuals. The rising ASD-patient demand is increasingly outpacing the capacity of ASD-specialty clinics, resulting in urgent need for autism-competent providers in general practice settings. This work aims to empower healthcare providers, especially primary care providers (PCPs), with guidelines for the recognition and safe pharmacologic management of common co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral conditions in ASD.

Methods

Lurie Center for Autism medical providers, who have extensive experience in ASD care, delineated approaches for recognition and pharmacological treatment of sleep disturbances, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, and irritability tailored to ASD patients. Pharmacological guidelines were iteratively refined until consensus was reached. Treatment differences relative to standard of care (SOC) of non-autistic individuals are noted. Key literature and clinical trial results were reviewed to supplement clinical experience.

Results

The pharmacological treatment pathways reflect how appropriate medication options for ASD patients can depend on many factors unique to the patient and can differ from established non-autistic SOC. Key takeaways include: For sleep disturbances in ASD, initial strategies align with non-autistic SOC, emphasizing sleep hygiene and melatonin use. First-line recommendations for treating ADHD, anxiety, and depression in ASD differ from non-autistic SOC; α 2 -adrenergic agonists are more suitable than stimulants for some ASD-ADHD patients, buspirone and mirtazapine are preferred to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiety, and duloxetine, mirtazapine, bupropion, and vortioxetine are recommended ahead of SSRIs for depression. Addressing irritability in ASD requires interdisciplinary evaluation of contributing factors, and guanfacine, risperidone, or aripiprazole may be appropriate, depending on severity.

Conclusions

Recognition and treatment of co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral conditions in autistic patients must account for differences in clinical presentation and medication effectiveness and tolerability. Drawing on evidence-based clinical insights, these guidelines seek to support PCPs in making informed decisions when prescribing medications for ASD patients with co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral conditions, ultimately enhancing access to timely, comprehensive care for all individuals with ASD.

### Trajectories of psychiatric diagnoses and medication usage in youth with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: a 9-year longitudinal study [^193ea8b1]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with high rates of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia in up to 30% of individuals with the syndrome. Despite this, we know relatively little about trajectories and predictors of persistence of psychiatric disorders from middle childhood to early adulthood. Accordingly, we followed youth over four timepoints, every 3 years, to assess long-term trajectories of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, mood, and psychosis-spectrum disorders (PSDs), as well as medication usage.

Methods

Eighty-seven youth with 22q11DS and 65 controls between the ages of 9 and 15 years at the first timepoint (T1; mean age 11.88 ± 2.1) were followed for 9 years (mean age of 21.22 ± 2.01 years at T4). Baseline cognitive, clinical, and familial predictors of persistence were identified for each class of psychiatric disorders.

Results

Baseline age and parent-rated hyperactivity scores predicted ADHD persistence [area under curve (AUC) = 0.81]. The presence of family conflict predicted persistence of anxiety disorders (ADs) whereas parent ratings of child internalizing symptoms predicted persistence of both anxiety and mood disorders (MDs) (AUC = 0.84 and 0.83, respectively). Baseline prodromal symptoms predicted persistent and emergent PSDs (AUC = 0.83). Parent-reported use of anti-depressants/anxiolytics increased significantly from T1 to T4.

Conclusions

Psychiatric, behavioral, and cognitive functioning during late childhood and early adolescence successfully predicted children with 22q11DS who were at highest risk for persistent psychiatric illness in young adulthood. These findings emphasize the critical importance of early assessments and interventions in youth with 22q11DS.

Weigh the risks of initiating medication before the age of 6 years against the harm of delaying treatment in areas where evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available.

### Two-year outcome of treatment with central stimulant medication in adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a prospective study [^0034f725]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Given that adults with ADHD continue to use stimulants for extended periods of time, studies on the long-term effectiveness and adverse events are warranted. The aims of this study were to investigate factors associated with persistence in treatment in an exploratory manner and to document side effects and reasons for discontinuation.

Method

The current study describes the systematic follow-up of 133 psychiatric patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed ADHD treated with central stimulants at a specialized outpatient unit between January 1, 2001, and August 31, 2006. A standardized questionnaire, derived from the Targeted Attention-deficit Disorder Symptoms Rating Scale, was used in order to measure improvement of the following target symptoms: hyperactivity, impulsivity, irritability, distractibility, structure/organization problems, inattention, and restlessness.

Results

Eighty percent of the patients were successfully treated with stimulants at the 6- to 9-month follow-up. Fifty percent remained in treatment after 2 years or more. Forty-five percent were treated for comorbid anxiety and/or depression during the study period. Only 15% dropped out because of lack of efficacy. The amount of clinical response over the first 6 to 9 months (but not at 6 weeks) predicted adherence to treatment at 2 years. The patients' heart rate increased from a least squares mean ± SE of 70 ± 2.2 to 80 ± 2.1 bpm (P = 0.00003) while blood pressure remained unchanged at the ≥ 2-year follow-up. Severe side effects or drug abuse were not detected in this cohort.

Conclusions

The long-term treatment outcome shows that stimulants are effective in adult ADHD and side effects tend to be mild.

### Do stimulants protect against psychiatric disorders in youth with ADHD? A 10-year follow-up study [^6c42c39d]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Little is known about the effect of stimulant treatment in youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on the subsequent development of comorbid psychiatric disorders. We tested the association between stimulant treatment and the subsequent development of psychiatric comorbidity in a longitudinal sample of patients with ADHD.

Methods

We conducted a case-control, 10-year prospective follow-up study into young-adult years of youth with ADHD. At baseline, we assessed consecutively referred white male children with (n = 140) and without (n = 120) ADHD, aged 6 to 18 years. At the 10-year follow-up, 112 (80%) and 105 (88%) of the children in the ADHD and control groups, respectively, were reassessed (mean age: 22 years). We examined the association between stimulant treatment in childhood and adolescence and subsequent comorbid disorders and grade retention by using proportional hazards survival models.

Results

Of the 112 participants with ADHD, 82 (73%) were previously treated with stimulants. Participants with ADHD who were treated with stimulants were significantly less likely to subsequently develop depressive and anxiety disorders and disruptive behavior and less likely to repeat a grade compared with participants with ADHD who were not treated.

Conclusions

We found evidence that stimulant treatment decreases the risk for subsequent comorbid psychiatric disorders and academic failure in youth with ADHD.

### Effect of pharmacological treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder on later psychiatric comorbidity: a population-based prospective long-term study [^76a9d4f9]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Data sources

All data were obtained in de-identified form from nationwide, individually linked, complete population registers in Norway.

Sample

Our ADHD patient sample was defined as all persons in the Norwegian population who were aged between 5 and 18 and received an initial primary diagnosis of ADHD — corresponding to International Classification of Diseases-Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes F90.0 (81.3%), F90.1 (11.3%), F90.8 (6.2%) and F90.9 (1.1%) — from the Norwegian Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) during the years 2009–2011 (n = 8051).

Outcome

We defined psychiatric comorbidity as any mental or behavioural disorder diagnosed in addition to ADHD. We analysed the occurrence of incident psychiatric comorbidities, defined as disorders first diagnosed subsequent to the ADHD diagnosis. We had access to data on all ICD-10 Chapter V ('Mental and behavioural disorders', F00–F99) diagnoses registered in the CAMHS from 2009 to 2020. For feasibility reasons, and because of low prevalence of some of the disorders in children and adolescents, we grouped the relevant diagnoses into what we considered clinically meaningful categories of disorders: substance use disorder (SUD), psychotic, bipolar/other affective, depressive, anxiety, 'reactive' (including stress-related and somatoform disorders), sleep, eating, personality, pervasive developmental, specific developmental, conduct disorder (CD), tic, and various childhood disorders, and intellectual disability (ID). (See online supplemental table S1 for a detailed overview.)

Comorbidity was measured by counting the number of patients registered with one or more diagnoses within each disorder category separately. Possible multiple diagnoses within one category were thus not taken into consideration, while individuals registered with multiple comorbid diagnoses from different categories were counted multiple times.

For the multivariable analyses, we also created a summary diagnostic category, 'any', comprising all psychiatric comorbidities that are plausibly influenced by ADHD medication (hence excluding all developmental disorders and ID, based on authors' clinical judgement) and are considered properly recorded in the Norwegian registers (hence excluding sleep disorders, which are clinically commonbut infrequently registered).

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^cae21968]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Anxiety and depressive disorders

What do I do if a young person has depression and has not responded to two SSRIs and CBT?

National Institute for health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines currently recommend CBT as a first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe depression, fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), as a first-line antidepressant and, if that is not effective, sertraline or citalopram. There is limited evidence for other treatments beyond this, other than interpersonal psychotherapy, which is often not available.

The first thing to do when a patient is treatment-resistant is to revisit the formulation and diagnosis. Is this really depression, or does the pattern of symptoms since you started seeing the patient suggest a personality disorder as a more appropriate diagnosis? Are there any social factors that have not been addressed?

Then review whether the patient has indeed had all the treatments to which they appear to be 'resistant'. Did they stop fluoxetine after a few days of mild side effects and would they be prepared to try again? Did they have a good number of sessions of evidence-based psychological therapy from a fully trained and supervised therapist? If they stopped after a few sessions, was this due to a problem in the therapy or the therapist and would they consider trying a different therapist?

If the patient truly does have depression, and you have tried all the evidence-based treatments, there is no evidence to guide you. It would be reasonable to try two SSRIs up to the maximum tolerated dose, within BNF limits: although there is no evidence in favour of or against this, there is some evidence for a dose increase in adult depression; and there is plenty of safety data from paediatric OCD studies which use high doses of SSRIs. If the patient is nearly 18, it may be reasonable to try antidepressants shown to work in studies of 18–64 years old but not in studies of 12–17 years old, such as mirtazapine (adrenergic alpha-2 auto receptors and heteroceptors antagonist and 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors blocker) or venlafaxine (serotonin and norepinephrine inhibitor); caution should be used with the latter due to possible increased risk of suicidal ideation, and for that reason it is especially important to seek peer advice. It may be worth trying an augmenting agent that has evidence in adults such as lamotrigine, an atypical antipsychotic, lithium, or-thyroxine.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: part I [^c67d6bfb]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As Faculty of the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) course on child and adolescent psychopharmacology, we previously published a paper reporting the most common questions we have been asked in recent editions of the course, alongside evidence-based and/or expert-informed answers. Here, based on our experience during the course, we have selected what we deem are the most common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology, focusing on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders, and tic disorder. We have grouped the pitfalls by disorder to which they refer, in alphabetical order. Pitfalls in relation to the treatment of other disorders (autism and intellectual disability, eating disorders, neuropsychiatric correlates of epilepsy and psychosis) are addressed in a separate paper (part II).

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in children and adolescents — dosing and response patterns — generally permit single daily dosing, though at low doses of sertraline and at any dose of fluvoxamine, youths may require twice-daily dosing; response may show statistically significant improvement within 2 weeks, clinically significant improvement by week 6, and maximal improvement by week 12 or later, supporting slow up-titration. Most adverse effects emerge within the first few weeks of treatment. At present, there is no clear role for pharmacogenomic testing in medication selection.

Comorbidity Analysis

Across all medication groups, the prevalence of co-occurring disorders ranged widely, depending on the type of disorder and the prescribed medication (Figure 4). In 2.1% of individuals given guanfacine, for example, there was an episode of major depressive disorder, whereas the same was true of 26.4% of individuals given bupropion hydrochloride. Similarly, the prevalence of anxiety disorder ranged from 6.2% (of those prescribed divalproex sodium) to 35.2% (of those given fluoxetine). The combined type of ADHD appeared in 4.9% of individuals with ASD treated with alprazolam to 56.4% given dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride. Finally, epilepsy was diagnosed in 1.1% of individuals administered escitalopram and 31.8% treated with oxcarbazepine.

Level 3 Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) categorizations are ordered by level 1 ACT category. The intensity of the color in each square (ie, the percentage) represents the relative proportion of individuals within each column (ie, a given prescription group) that also had the corresponding diagnostic categorization. Each column represents individuals in the study cohort taking only the corresponding medication during the 6-year study period. ADHD indicates attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; MDD, major depressive disorder; NOS, not otherwise specified.

Certain co-occurring conditions appeared to be associated with many of the medications examined in this study (Figure 4). In 15 of 24 medication groups assessed in this study, 15% or more of the individuals in the group had either an unspecified anxiety disorder, anxiety neurosis, or major depressive disorder (single episode). In 11 of 24 medication groups, 15% or more of the individuals had a form of ADHD (hyperactive, inattentive, and/or combined type).

### Psychotropic medication treatment of adolescents: results from the national comorbidity survey-adolescent supplement [^176ca0f7]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the 12-month prevalence of psychotropic medication use among adolescents, and the match between mental disorder diagnoses and past-year antidepressant and stimulant use.

Method

Data are from the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement (2002–2004), a nationally representative survey of 10,123 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years that assesses DSM-IV disorders using a fully structured diagnostic interview, a modified version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Rates of 12-month psychotropic medication use are stratified by respondent socio-demographic characteristics, and the distribution of 12-month DSM-IV CIDI disorders is estimated among past-12-month use of antidepressants and stimulants.

Results

During a 1-year period, 7.0% of adolescents used at least one psychotropic medication; these medications were most commonly antidepressants (3.9%), followed by stimulants (2.8%), anxiolytics (0.8%), antipsychotics (0.5%), and mood stabilizers (0.4%). Nearly three-quarters (74.1%) of adolescents with any past-year psychotropic medication use had at least one CIDI mental disorder, and many had disorders for which the specific medication class is clinically indicated. Among adolescents using antidepressants, 48.8% had a past-12-month depressive or anxiety disorder, and an additional 20.3% had a lifetime depressive or anxiety disorder. Nearly one-half (49.1%) of adolescents using stimulants met past-12-month attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) criteria, and an additional 13.1% met lifetime criteria for ADHD.

Conclusions

Most adolescents who are treated with psychotropic medications have one or more psychiatric disorders and many, albeit far from all, have mental disorders for which the specific medications are clinically indicated.

### Pediatric psychopharmacology for treatment of ADHD, depression, and anxiety… [^4daae8d9]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

The pediatric practitioner is often the first point-of-contact for children and adolescents suffering from mental illness. Part of the treatment planning for psychiatric diagnoses includes consideration of medication. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, one of the most common diagnoses, is very responsive to stimulant medications; for children who are unable to tolerate stimulants or who do not achieve satisfactory symptom management, central α-agonists and atomoxetine are effective and generally well-tolerated alternative or augmentative agents. Depression and anxiety disorders are also frequently encountered in the pediatric office setting. The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is considered first-line psychopharmacology for depression and anxiety symptoms. Despite concerns for suicidal ideation related to this medication class, the benefits typically outweigh the risks.

This review provides basic clinical pharmacology of stimulant and nonstimulant attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors intended to serve as a primer for the general pediatrician.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^6b0ab28d]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The escalating prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in recent years has created an urgent need for additional medical providers capable of delivering autism-competent care. While the call for more medical providers could be justified across medical specialties, nowhere is the need greater than in managing co-occurring neuropsychiatric conditions. Individuals with ASD have a high prevalence of co-occurring neuropsychiatric conditions, with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and anxiety disorders being among the most common. Left untreated, these co-occuring conditions can have detrimental and potentially catastrophic impacts on ASD individuals and their families, such as decreased quality of life and increased stress, hindered educational and employment opportunities and increased risk of suicidality. While in some cases, the standard of care (SOC) for managing these conditions in an individual with ASD is comparable to the SOC for a non-autistic individual, treatment paths can differ significantly due to complex medical and behavioral profiles and differences in medication efficacy and tolerability. Currently, only two drugs have been approved by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the ASD population: risperidone and aripiprazole. Both drugs are approved for the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with ASD. Aside from these two exceptions, psychopharmacological treatments for ASD individuals are prescribed off-label. Navigating this treatment landscape can be challenging and time-consuming for providers who have not received specific training in ASD medical care but who nonetheless find themselves with ASD patients amidst the rising need.

### Overweight in children and adolescents in relation to attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: results from a national sample [^7293f769]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

As the prevalence of childhood obesity increases, identifying groups of children who are at increased risk of overweight is important. The current study estimated the prevalence of overweight in children and adolescents in relation to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and medication use.

Patients and Methods

This study was a cross-sectional analysis of 62 887 children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years from the 2003–2004 National Survey of Children's Health, a nationally representative sample of children and adolescents in the United States. Attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was determined by response to the question "Has a doctor or health professional ever told you that your child has attention-deficit disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder, that is, ADD or ADHD?" Children and adolescents were classified as underweight, normal weight, at risk of overweight, or overweight according to BMI for age and gender.

Results

After adjustment for age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and depression/anxiety, children and adolescents with attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder not currently using medication had approximately 1.5 times the odds of being overweight, and children and adolescents currently medicated for attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder had approximately 1.6 times the odds of being underweight compared with children and adolescents without either diagnosis.

Conclusions

This study provides heightened awareness for pediatric providers about the relationship between attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, medication use, and weight status. Future work is needed to better understand the longitudinal and pharmacologic factors that influence the relationship between attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and weight status in children and adolescents.

### Guidelines and practice on antipsychotics prescribing and physical health monitoring in children and young people: a cohort study using primary care data [^8bce140b]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Recorded incidence rates

Over the study period, 4985 CYP had their first antipsychotics prescription. Table 1 shows incidence rates, rate ratios and median duration of initial treatments for different demographic groups. Older patients were much more likely to start treatment, and, overall, boys were more likely than girls. White ethnicity CYP were more likely to start than other ethnicities. There were some variations between levels of deprivation and different regions but not consistently over the study period. Median duration of first treatment was 2.4 months (IQR 0.9; 8.3). Boys had longer initial exposure than girls (median 2.7 vs 2.1 months) but no other notable variations emerged (table 1). Incidence rates increased over the study period from 2.8 per 1000 person-years in 2007 to 4.8 in 2018, again most pronouncedly in older girls (online supplemental eFigure 4).

Recorded indications and durations

Table 2 breaks down most recently recorded indications for the first antipsychotic prescription, giving median durations (IQRs) for initial exposures, overall and by age group. 47.4% of patients had a mental health condition of interest: psychosis 10.9%, bipolar disorder 1.3%, ASD 29.3%, Tourette syndrome 5.8%. 12.0% had no such records but a mental health symptom record (aggressive/disruptive behaviour or self-harm). 22.2% had neither of these but a mental health comorbidity record (anxiety, ADHD, depression, eating disorders, learning difficulties). 18.5% had no relevant indications.

Age breakdowns showed sizeable differences between the conditions: psychosis (younger, 1.2%; older 13.6%) and bipolar disorder (younger, 0%; older, 1.7%) versus ASD (younger 45.8%; older 24.9%) and Tourette syndrome (younger 7.7%; older 5.3%). 5.7% of younger and 13.6% of the older patients had only symptom indication(s) while 17.8% of the younger and 23.4% of the older had only mental health comorbidity indication(s). 21.7% of the younger and 17.6% of the older patients had no recorded indications.

### Impact of treatments for depression on comorbid anxiety, attentional, and behavioral symptoms in adolescents with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-resistant depression [^69ff6ccc]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the relative efficacy of antidepressant medication, alone and in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), on comorbid symptoms of anxiety, attention, and disruptive behavior disorders in participants in the Treatment of Resistant Depression in Adolescents (TORDIA) trial.

Method

Adolescents with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-resistant depression (N = 334) were randomly assigned to a medication switch alone (to another SSRI or to venlafaxine) or to a medication switch plus CBT. Anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and disruptive behavior disorder (DBD) symptoms were assessed by psychiatric interview and self-report at regular intervals between baseline and 24 weeks. The differential effects of medication and of CBT, and the impact of remission on the course of comorbid symptoms and diagnoses, were assessed using generalized linear mixed models.

Results

Remission was associated with a greater reduction in scalar measures of anxiety, ADHD, and DBDs, and a greater decrease in the rate of diagnosed anxiety disorders. The correlations between the changes in symptoms of depression on the CDRS-R and anxiety, ADHD, and oppositional symptoms were modest, ranging from r = 0.12 to r = 0.28. There were no significant differential treatment effects on diagnoses, or corresponding symptoms.

Conclusion

The achievement of remission had a beneficial effect on anxiety, ADHD, and DBD symptoms, regardless of the type of treatment received. There were no differential effects of medication or CBT on outcome, except for a nonsignificant trend that those adolescents treated with SSRIs showed a greater decrease in rates of comorbid DBDs relative to those treated with venlafaxine.

### Cognitive-behavioural therapy in medication-treated adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and co-morbid psychopathology: a randomized controlled trial using multi-level analysis [^9f401e00]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The current study therefore addressed these methodological weaknesses by using a larger sample randomized to either CBT/MED or TAU/MED and including a 3-month follow-up. We performed an intention-to treat analysis using a linear mixed model and analysed for three possible predictors of missing data: gender, age, and ASP traits. Thus we analysed the effects of treatment over time (i.e. end of treatment versus at 3-month follow-up) as well as overall group differences in the outcome measures whilst controlling for possible group imbalances caused by missing data. It was hypothesized that the CBT/MED group would show significantly greater reduction in the primary outcomes of ADHD core symptoms and illness severity compared with the TAU/MED group after adjusting for missing data and possible confounders. A similar treatment effect was expected for secondary outcomes of anxiety, depression and quality of life. Treatment gains were expected to be maintained at 3-month follow-up.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^f952c5a6]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with MDD — illustrative SSRI trial parameters and next steps indicate that for mild-to-moderate presentations clinicians should prescribe the recommended therapeutic dose, monitor weekly for adverse effects, and assess for response in 4 to 6 weeks; minimal data support higher dosing improving efficacy and higher doses typically cause more adverse effects; if the 4- to 6-week assessments show minimal response, a trial of a second SSRI could be considered, and in TORDIA 55% of adolescents who were nonresponders to an initial SSRI demonstrated significant response when prescribed a second SSRI or an SNRI with CBT.

### Antidepressant pharmacotherapy in childhood PTSD with and without comorbid ADHD: a nationwide retrospective study [^e57a894c]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are prevalent in youth, with psychotherapy as the first-line PTSD treatment and stimulants as the primary ADHD treatment. However, antidepressants are commonly prescribed to manage comorbid internalizing (depression, anxiety, and irritability) symptoms seen in patients with both disorders. Despite the high occurrence and complexity of comorbid PTSD with ADHD, little empirical data exist on antidepressant use in youth with PTSD, and particularly in youth with co-occurring externalizing disorders.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study utilized the U.S. TriNetX database, examining 83,252 records of children and adolescents under 21 with PTSD. Of these, 37,003 (44.4%) also had ADHD (PTSD-ADHD), and 46,249 (55.6%) had PTSD alone. We compared the prevalence of SSRI and SNRI prescriptions and the progression of antidepressant treatments in both cohorts.

Results

Youth with PTSD-ADHD were more likely to be prescribed SSRIs than those with PTSD alone (OR 1.24, p < 0.05). When matched by age, sex, race, and ethnicity, the PTSD-ADHD cohort had higher rates of SSRI (OR 1.45, p < 0.05) and SNRI (OR 1.33, p < 0.05) use. After PTSD diagnosis, 60.4% of the PTSD-only group and 42.3% of the PTSD-ADHD group did not initiate antidepressants (p < 0.001). Among those prescribed antidepressants, 81.54% of the PTSD-only and 74.72% of the PTSD-ADHD group remained on the initial medication without switching to other medications (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Youth with PTSD-ADHD are more likely to be prescribed and switch antidepressants than those with PTSD alone, emphasizing the need for further research into treatment mechanisms in this population.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder and related conditions

Insufficient evidence base

It is a common pitfall to think that the evidence base accurately covers the full range of obsessive and compulsive conditions. This is not the case. For instance, to date, there is no published evidence supporting the role of low-dose antipsychotic augmentation in body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) nor is any clear evidence that SSRI medications are helpful in the treatment of trichotillomania. It is important therefore to be clear about the dominant aspect of the mental state in the child and make decisions on the evidence base, where it exists and, in turn, being clear where there is a lack of evidence or indeed evidence that medication is not likely to be of benefit.

Co-morbidity in obsessive-compulsive disorders

The issue of co-morbidity in the presentation requires careful thought. A common pitfall in treatment planning is not comprehensively assessing the full clinical presentation and then missing opportunities to design the best treatment plan. Co-morbid mood (more than 60%) and anxiety (more than 75%) diagnoses are extremely common in young people with obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD). These co-morbidities may require careful additional consideration, as they will undoubtedly influence the choice and sequencing of pharmacological interventions for OCD. As an example, whilst trichotillomania is unlikely to respond to treatment with SSRI medication, the presence of a co-morbid affective disorder might increase the likelihood of a better medication response, in a young person with trichotillomania.

The broader neurodevelopmental profile can help guide the best choice of medications, as well as their sequencing. For instance, a common pitfall can be to attempt to treat OCD with psychological therapy in a patient with co-morbid ADHD, without adequately addressing the impact of ADHD. This can render treatment much less effective in our experience. We therefore find that ensuring ADHD symptoms are adequately treated pharmacologically can be a helpful precursor to better treatment outcomes of OCD. Some young people, however, can become more focussed on their compulsions when treated for ADHD.

Regarding specific circumstances for generalized anxiety disorder, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, treatment, BAP 2014 guidelines recommend to offer the same drugs in pediatric and adolescent as for adult patients, with SSRIs as first-line pharmacotherapy (fluoxetine may be the SSRI with the best balance of potential benefit and risk).

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: part I [^2796c4f7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Dosing

Failing to 'start low and go slow': When initiating medication, typically adverse effects occur before therapeutic benefits are seen – and can lead to premature discontinuation. This can be avoided by gradual titration; 'starting low and going slow'. For example, initial syncope (due to postural hypotension) can be related to the initiation of clonidine (which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic receptors) and guanfacine (which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2A-adrenergic receptors) and sedation is potentially related to all medications for tics. These adverse effects are often encountered if the initial dose is too high. However, with careful low-dose initiation and slow titration, these adverse effects are much less likely to occur. Doses of 25 mcg of clonidine, 1 mg guanfacine and 0.5–1 mg aripiprazole once daily are suggested as appropriate initial doses, with titrations using a weekly, fortnightly or even monthly approach according to the response. However, the initial dose and the titration speed could differ according to body weight, age and other characteristics of the patient.

Failing to achieve an adequate therapeutic dose: When a medication has been initiated, it is important to titrate to recommended therapeutic doses. In the case of clonidine, this relates to an average daily dose of 3–5 mcg/kg, for aripiprazole around 5–10 mg daily and for guanfacine between 1 and 4 mg in young children and up to 7 mg in older adolescents according to weight. Often young people are sub-optimally medicated to reduce potential side effects. However, it is a common pitfall to conclude that a medication is ineffective, when in fact it has been used at a sub-therapeutic dose.

Drug choice – is the drug correct?

Awareness of co-morbidities is important in determining the best drug choice. Commonly, young people with co-morbid tics and ADHD find noradrenergic agents (clonidine, guanfacine) beneficial for tic symptom control, whereas young people with anxiety disorders or OCD co-morbidities may find an approach using aripiprazole or treatment primarily targeting anxiety and/or OCD with an SSRI most beneficial in managing tic symptoms.

### Treating ADHD and comorbid anxiety in children: a guide for clinical practice [^ef4f3e3e]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently comorbid with anxiety disorders with rates as high as 25% to 50% in children and adolescents. Despite various treatment options for ADHD symptoms, limited research addresses treatment in the context of comorbidity. This article seeks to provide a review of the evidence regarding treatment of this comorbid population. Distinct emotional, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms have been observed in this population, suggesting a need for tailored treatment. Despite common concerns about anxiety exacerbation, stimulant medications demonstrate good tolerability and good response in addressing symptoms. Atomoxetine has also demonstrated some benefit and good tolerability for treating this comorbid population. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be used as adjunctive treatment for anxiety but require careful monitoring of side effects. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an important treatment to improve anxiety symptoms in the absence of significant ADHD symptoms. Psychosocial interventions are also essential to improve outcomes.

### Pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents [^90170cb4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Anxiety disorders are a potentially disabling group of disorders which are prevalent in childhood and adolescence. The recognition of the early onset of anxiety disorders, and their successful treatment with medication in adults, has led to the growing interest in using medication for paediatric anxiety disorders.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of medication for treating paediatric anxiety disorders.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety & Neurosis Group specialised register (CCDANCTR-Studies), MEDLINE (via PubMed 1966 to August 2008), EMBASE (1966 to August 2008), and PsycINFO (1972 to August 2008). Various electronic registers were searched for unpublished studies. Reference lists of retrieved articles were searched for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy in childhood/adolescent anxiety disorders.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two raters independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data, and assessed trial quality. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. Summary statistics were stratified by medication class, and by medication agent for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Dichotomous and continuous measures were calculated using a random effects model, heterogeneity was assessed, and subgroup/sensitivity analyses were undertaken.

Main Results

22 short-term (≤ 16 weeks) RCTs were included in the analysis (2519 participants). The majority of the trials assessed the efficacy of the SSRIs (N = 15). Medication and placebo response occurred in 58.1% and 31.5% of patients, respectively (Number of studies (N) = 14, Number needed to treat (NNT) = 4). Medication was more effective than placebo in reducing overall symptom severity in OCD in a post-hoc comparison (N = 7, Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) = -4.45, 95%CI = -5.94, -2.97, n = 765). Medication was less well tolerated than placebo overall, though the absolute proportion of participants who withdrew due to drug-related adverse events was low (4.9%).

Authors' Conclusions

Medication treatments can be effective in paediatric anxiety disorders, acting to reduce core symptoms, and should be considered as part of the treatment of these disorders. The greatest number of trials showing efficacy to date have assessed the SSRIs in treating paediatric OCD. There is no clear evidence to show that any particular class of medication is more effective or better tolerated than any other. As quantitative data was only available for the SSRIs and venlafaxine the routine use of benzodiazepines cannot be recommended, especially given concerns of dependency and treatment -related emergent adverse events associated with this class of drugs. Future RCTs could help identify potential clinical moderators of treatment efficacy. Studies of the long-term efficacy of medication treatment, optimal dosage, as well as direct comparisons of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are also warranted.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^f8ccb4f1]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Psychiatric comorbidities and cross-cutting screening — overlapping presentations and assessment: Mental conditions that may include symptoms similar to anxiety disorders include ADHD, depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychotic disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and learning disorders. Anxiety disorders commonly co-occur with each other; other common comorbidities include depression, ADHD, and behavior, bipolar, obsessive-compulsive, eating, learning, language, and substance-related disorders, and with selective mutism, developmental and communication disorders frequently co-occur. Comorbidities may heighten distress and functional impairment and may worsen treatment outcomes, and each comorbid disorder may require a separate treatment plan and may influence the selection of treatment for the anxiety disorder. Use of the Parent- and Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure or screening questions embedded in structured interview guides can standardize and enhance the efficiency of the psychiatric review of symptoms to assess for psychiatric comorbidities; if screen questions are positively endorsed, the ensuing interview can ascertain whether full diagnostic criteria are met for the given disorder, and each condition with full diagnostic criteria is diagnosed as such unless DSM-5 hierarchical rules apply.

Regarding specific circumstances for generalized anxiety disorder, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, treatment, BAP 2014 guidelines recommend to ensure that the daily dose takes account of the age and weight of the patient, and start with a low dose, recognizing that more rapid metabolism may lead to the need for adult doses.

Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) — for all SNRIs, medical monitoring should include height, weight, pulse, and blood pressure, and no specific laboratory tests are recommended. As with SSRIs, a discontinuation syndrome has been reported following missed doses or acute discontinuation of SNRIs, and SNRIs also warrant a slow discontinuation taper.

### Recent trends in primary-care antidepressant prescribing to children and young people: an e-cohort study [^a4ab709e]. Psychological Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

We conducted time trend analyses to determine whether significant changes in rates of recorded depression diagnosis or symptom codes occurred following the introduction of NICE guidance in 2004 and 2005 and the introduction of QOF indicators for depression in quarterly blocks, as conducted in previous literature (Kendrick et al.). We also conducted a time trend analysis by quarter in the 24 months prior to the United States Food and Drug Administration (August), Safety Communication (United States Food and Drug Administration) followed by a UK Government Drug Safety Update (December 2011), (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency,) that considered citalopram was associated with dose-dependent QT interval prolongation of antidepressant subtype to assess any change in prescribing of type of antidepressant.

Routine data does not explicitly link medication prescription with a diagnosis. The records of individuals with a new antidepressant prescription were further analysed to identify the indication for which the medication was prescribed. GP records were reviewed for 1 year before and 6 months after the initial incident prescription date for depression and anxiety diagnoses (including mixed anxiety and depression) and symptoms before searching for other possible indications. After depression and anxiety, the indications searched were: pain, enuresis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorders, autism, headaches, migraine prophylaxis sleep problems, other codes of interest (including tearfulness and psychosis), irritable bowel syndrome, stress, phobias and obsessive disorders, dissociative disorders and eating disorders (Gardarsdottir et al.). If an individual with a new antidepressant prescription had a diagnosis or symptom of depression, anxiety or mixed anxiety depression recorded it was assumed that this was the indication for which the medication was prescribed and they were not examined for any further diagnoses.

Age, gender and deprivation quintile data were collected based upon the onset of data collection for each year. Age was categorized into three groups; 6–10, 11–14 and 15–18 years.

### Health supervision for children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: clinical report [^b9cc8d59]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Mental health — 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) commonly includes anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), each occurring in about a third of patients, with depressive disorders diagnosable from childhood (2%) to adulthood (16%) and bipolar disorder much less common at 4% in adulthood. Childhood-onset psychosis is less common than in adults with 22q11.2DS but more common than in the general population (2%), with risk in adolescents and young adults increasing to 25% to 30%; during adolescence and early adulthood, clinicians should screen for hallucinations and delusions at all primary care visits, and early intervention for psychosis is associated with improved outcomes. Assessment for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) should use standardized tools and multiple modalities with a broad differential, and patients typically respond to standard treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy, applied behavior analysis therapy for ASD, and medication regimens as in the general population.

Results: The most common age of presentation was 15 and 16 years, constituting 47% of the 51 patients studied, with a notable female predominance (75%). Unspecified longstanding duration was reported in 49% of cases, while 31.3% had symptoms persisting for 1–2 years. Localised pain was noted in 41% of patients, whereas 56.8% presented with generalised pain. Clinic diagnoses given included terms like hypermobility spectrum disorder (29%), mechanical back pain (24%), chronic musculoskeletal pain (8%), and generalized pain (6%). No comorbidities were noted in 50.9% of patients, while 13.7% had Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and 1.9% suffered with anxiety/depression. 33% reported a family history of musculoskeletal pain conditions. Laboratory investigations revealed positive antibodies in 21.5% of cases: ANA (14%), RF (4%), ENA (4%), HLA B27 (6%), and Anti CCP (2%). Radiological investigations were conducted in 56.8% of patients. Treatment modalities included NSAIDs (21.5%), Amitriptyline (5.8%), and physiotherapy referral (84.3%). 51% were given a follow-up appointment.

Conclusion: In our study, children and young people with chronic musculoskeletal pain commonly presented around 15 to 16 years of age, with female predominance. A notable number had neurodevelopmental conditions such as ASD and ADHD, and mental health issues including anxiety and depression. One fifth of the patients had positive antibodies without any clinical evidence of inflammatory arthritis. Physiotherapy was the mainstay of management. Further research is warranted to explore underlying mechanisms and refine management strategies.

### Diagnosis and management of ADHD in children [^8204f797]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder in children, and the prevalence is increasing. Physicians should evaluate for ADHD in children with behavioral concerns (e.g., inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, oppositionality) or poor academic progress using validated assessment tools with observers from several settings (home, school, community) and self-observation, if possible. Physicians who inherit a patient with a previous ADHD diagnosis should review the diagnostic process, and current symptoms and treatment needs. Coexisting conditions (e.g., anxiety, learning, mood, or sleep disorders) should be identified and treated. Behavioral treatments are recommended for preschool-aged children and may be helpful at older ages. Effective behavioral therapies include parent training, classroom management, and peer interventions. Medications are recommended as first-line therapy for older children. Psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine, are most effective for the treatment of core ADHD symptoms and have generally acceptable adverse effect profiles. There are fewer supporting studies for atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine, and they are less effective than the psychostimulants. Height, weight, heart rate, blood pressure, symptoms, mood, and treatment adherence should be recorded at follow-up visits.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^7faf44c0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AACAP anxiety guideline — combination cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (recommendation 3) suggests (2C) that combination treatment (CBT and an SSRI) could be offered preferentially over CBT alone or an SSRI alone to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, or panic disorder. In the AHRQ/Mayo review, two RCTs compared combination treatment to either treatment alone and these 2 studies included 550 patients (52.6% male; mean age 12.2 years, range 7–17 years). Compared to CBT alone and to sertraline alone, combination CBT plus sertraline improved primary anxiety (clinician report), global function, response to treatment, and remission of disorder (all moderate SOE), whereas combination CBT plus fluoxetine did not separate from CBT alone for global function, secondary measures, or response to treatment (all low SOE) and may have reduced remission of disorder compared to CBT alone (low SOE). For adverse effects (AEs), combination CBT plus sertraline did not differ from CBT alone with respect to short-term AEs including suicidal ideation or behavior (all low SOE) but increased AEs related to behavior activation (moderate SOE) and increased any AEs and AEs related to sleep (both low SOE); compared to sertraline alone, combination CBT plus sertraline decreased AEs related to behavior activation and reduced AEs due to fatigue/somnolence (both moderate SOE), and insufficient evidence precluded assessment of AEs related to suicidal ideation or behavior. Because there were only two studies with conflicting results, the AHRQ/Mayo review did not find definitive evidence for the superiority of combination treatment over monotherapy, yet expert consensus generally supports the prioritization of combination treatment; in CAMS, youths who received combination treatment had significantly higher rates of remission than monotherapy with SSRI or CBT or placebo at week 12 and week 24, and in clinical practice, combination treatment may be favored if there is a need for acute symptom reduction in a severe, functionally impairing disorder or a partial response to monotherapy. Combination treatment typically involves concurrent administration of psychotherapy and medication, optimally delivered in the same facility to enhance convenience and provider communication, and naturalistic follow-up (CAMELS) failed to demonstrate long-term maintenance of treatment effects by original randomized treatment while initial response — significantly superior in the combination treatment — was a strong predictor of long-term outcome.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: part II [^8fdcd903]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As Faculty of the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) course on child and adolescent psychopharmacology, we previously published a paper reporting the most common questions we have been asked in recent editions of the course, alongside evidence-based and/or expert-informed answers. Here, based on our experience during the course, we have selected what we deem are the most common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology, focusing on autism and intellectual disability, eating disorders, neuropsychiatric correlates of epilepsy, and psychosis. We have grouped the pitfalls by disorder to which they refer, in alphabetical order. Pitfalls in relation to the treatment of other disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders, and tic disorder) are addressed in a separate paper (Part I).

### Committee opinion no. 705: mental health disorders in adolescents [^5c355bd0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Mood disorders in adolescents — Depression is more common in female adolescents than in male adolescents, and adolescents with mood disorders are at increased risk of suicidal behavior. Approximately two thirds of adolescents with a mood disorder have one or more mental disorders, including anxiety disorders, conduct disorders, and ADHD. Depressed mood may interfere with motivation for effective measures to prevent pregnancy and STIs, and depression may inhibit motivation to take medications as directed, including oral contraceptives. Unprotected sex with multiple partners is common during manic episodes. Adolescents who report depressive symptoms only during the 7–10 days preceding each menstrual period may have premenstrual dysphoric disorder and they should be evaluated for co-occurring mood or anxiety disorders. Mood disorders include adjustment disorder with depressed mood, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^032ff504]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AACAP anxiety guideline — serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (recommendation 4) suggests (2C) that serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) could be offered to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, or panic disorder. In the AHRQ/Mayo review, 4 RCTs compared SNRIs to pill placebo and these studies included 911 patients (63.4% male; mean age 12.4 years, range 6–17 years). Compared to pill placebo, SNRIs as a class improved primary anxiety symptoms (clinician report) (high SOE), did not separate from pill placebo for primary anxiety (parent report) or global function (both low SOE), and insufficient data precluded assessment of primary anxiety (child report). Except as noted, SNRIs as a class did not separate from pill placebo with respect to short-term AEs including suicidal ideation or behavior (all moderate to low SOE).

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medications and work disability and mental health outcomes [^9da5ebe4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, or both. The prevalence of ADHD has been estimated to be approximately 5%. Although symptoms start in childhood, they often persist into adulthood, with an estimated ADHD prevalence of 2.5% among adults. ADHD often co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders, such as communication disorders, intellectual and learning disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. Heterogeneity in symptom profiles and psychiatric comorbidities are challenges in the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults.

Clinical care guidelines typically recommend pharmacotherapy as a part of the treatment regimen for ADHD, in addition to psychosocial interventions. Both stimulant and nonstimulant medications are generally efficacious for ADHD symptoms according to a meta-analysisof short-term, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials. When considering both efficacy and safety, that meta-analysissupported methylphenidate use in children and adolescents and amphetamine use in adults as first-choice medications. In addition to ADHD core symptoms, there is considerable evidence that ADHD medications, especially stimulants, improve functioning and quality of life. Less is known about the long-term effectiveness and safety of ADHD pharmacotherapies. Previous observational studies have reported that ADHD medication use, mainly regarding stimulants, is associated with several beneficial outcomes, such as decreased risk of suicide attempts, substance use disorders, depression, motor vehicle accidents, unintentional injuries, and long-term unemployment. However, there are also concerns that long-term stimulant use may be associated with adverse outcomes. Because these medications tend to increase blood pressure and heart rate, they might increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. An increased risk of seizures, and possibly an increased risk of psychosis or mania, are also concerns. There is only preliminary and conflicting evidence from small studies on whether ADHD medication improves labor market outcomes, such as work ability.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^86904f75]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders — treatment evidence states that both cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication have considerable empirical support as safe and effective short-term treatments, while serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medication has some empirical support as an additional treatment option. In the context of a protracted severe shortage of child and adolescent–trained behavioral health specialists, research demonstrating convenient, efficient, cost-effective, and user-friendly delivery mechanisms for safe and effective treatments is an urgent priority; other key research needs include the comparative effectiveness of anxiety treatments, delineation of mediators and moderators of effective anxiety treatments, long-term effects of SSRI and SNRI use in children and adolescents, and additional evaluation of the degree of suicide risk associated with SSRIs and SNRIs.

### Antipsychotic treatment among youths with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^221ac417]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Data Source

Data were obtained from the Truven Health MarketScan database of commercially insured individuals from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015. This database comprises medical and prescription drug data for more than 115 million enrollees, including demographic characteristics, outpatient and inpatient service codes, diagnostic codes, and detailed pharmacy files. The data were deidentified and the study was determined to be exempt from human subjects review by the Rutgers University Institutional Review Board. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort studies.

Study Design, Participants, and Cohort Assembly

We examined records for youths with a new ADHD diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (code 314.xx), and International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (code F90.xx), aged 3 to 24 years, after at least 120 days without an ADHD diagnosis. This 4-month period was chosen because youths with ADHD often are not seen by clinicians during summer months. Youths were excluded if they had been prescribed an antipsychotic or stimulant or had received a diagnosis with an indication for an antipsychotic medication (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, and Tourette disorder) in the previous 6 months. This process excluded 4555 youths (2.4% of the total sample). In addition, we required 12 months of continuous health care enrollment following the initial ADHD diagnosis.

Clinical and Demographic Characteristics

Background Characteristics

Youths were characterized by sex, age at ADHD diagnosis (3–5, 6–12, 13–18, 19–24 years), other mental health clinical diagnoses (depression, substance use, anxiety, self-harm and/or suicidal ideation, developmental disability, ODD, and CD) and recent mental health treatment, including inpatient care, being seen by a psychiatrist, and other psychopharmacologic treatments during the 180 days before the initial ADHD diagnosis (eTable in the Supplement).

Diagnoses

Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and psychotic/delusional disorders, autism spectrum disorder, tic disorders, and Tourette disorder were considered as FDA-indicated diagnoses for antipsychotic treatment (eTable in the Supplement). Given the evidence of efficacy for risperidone in the treatment of ODD and CD, we considered these disorders to be evidence-supported diagnoses.

### Child anxiety in primary care: prevalent but untreated [^044ee057]. Depression and Anxiety (2004). Low credibility.

We present prevalence and treatment utilization rates for child anxiety disorders in a university-affiliated primary care clinic. Families were recruited from a pediatric patient list and 714 families participated in an initial study wherein they completed child anxiety questionnaires. According to parent and child self-report questionnaires (n = 714), 22% and 20% of children, respectively, were above a suggested clinical cutoff on a brief anxiety screen; 19% and 14% of children exceeded clinical cutoffs on a separate social anxiety questionnaire. All families were invited to participate in a second study that included the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children-Parent Version and questions about treatment utilization; telephone interviews with 190 parents showed 1-year prevalence rates of DSM-IV child disorders to be 10.0% (se = 2.2%) for specific phobia, 6.8% (se = 1.8%) for social phobia, 3.2% (se = 1.3%) for generalized anxiety disorder, 0.5% (se = .7%) for selective mutism, 1.6% (se = .9%) for major depressive disorder, 1.1% (se = .7%) for dysthymia, and 12.6% (se = 2.4%) for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Among children with a current anxiety disorder, 31% had received counseling or medication treatment during their lifetime, compared to 40% of children with depression and 79% with ADHD. Adolescent age and being Caucasian were predictors of psychotherapy use; having an ADHD diagnosis was a predictor of both psychotherapy and medication use. The high prevalence of impairing anxiety disorders, in concert with the very low extent of treatment utilization, suggests a need for methods to identify and disseminate empirically validated treatments for these disorders in the primary care setting.

### Treatment… [^8e2c903d]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can often be managed with the right treatment.
- Treatment recommendations vary by age group.
- Types of treatment for ADHD include behavior therapy and medications. Treatment types Behavior Therapy
- Behavior therapy, including training for parents; and Medications
- Stimulants
- Non-stimulants. Treatment recommendations By Age Group For children with ADHD younger than 6 years of age, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends parent training in behavior management as the first line of treatment, before medication is tried. For children 6 years of age and older, the recommendations include medication and behavior therapy together — parent training in behavior management for children up to age 12 and other types of behavior therapy and training for adolescents. Schools can be part of the treatment as well.

AAP recommendations also include adding behavioral classroom intervention and school supports. Learn more about how the school environment can be part of treatment. School-age children and adolescents For children ages 6 years and older, AAP recommends combining medication treatment with behavior therapy. Several types of behavior therapies are considered effective, including:

- Parent training in behavior management;
- Behavioral interventions in the classroom;
- Peer interventions that focus on behavior; and
- Organizational skills training. These approaches are often most effective if they are used together, depending on the needs of the individual child and the family. Parents, healthcare providers, and the school can work together on developing the right treatment plan. Medications Medication can help children manage their ADHD symptoms in their everyday life and can help them control the behaviors that cause difficulties with family, friends, and at school.

Several different types of medications are FDA-approved to treat ADHD in children as young as 6 years of age: Stimulantsare the best-known and most widely used ADHD medications. Between 70–80% of children with ADHD have fewer ADHD symptoms when taking these fast-acting medications. Nonstimulantswere approved for the treatment of ADHD in 2003. They do not work as quickly as stimulants, but their effect can last up to 24 hours. Medications can affect children differently and can have side effects such as decreased appetite or sleep problems. One child may respond well to one medication, but not to another.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^526daeaa]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Considerations for treatment implementation — importance of informed consent emphasizes that the panel "encourages all clinicians to provide informed consent to patients", and that "psychologists should obtain an informed consent from the patient prior to implementing psychological services". Informed consent requires clinicians to "inform clients/patients as early as is feasible in the therapeutic relationship about the nature and anticipated course of therapy, fees, involvement of third parties, and limits of confidentiality and provide sufficient opportunity for the client/patient to ask questions and receive answers", and the Code of Ethics notes it "should include information about any known diagnosis; why particular interventions are recommended and what is involved in these interventions; and benefits, harms, and burdens of possible interventions including those for choosing to receive no treatment", thereby allowing patients "to make an informed decision of whether to initiate or continue treatment", and satisfying "the General Principles of Beneficence and Nonmaleficence". For minors, "the provider should convey the same information to the parent/guardian who must provide consent for treatment" and also to "adolescents who must assent to treatment", and "for children, it also would be helpful to convey some of the information… in an age-appropriate manner".
