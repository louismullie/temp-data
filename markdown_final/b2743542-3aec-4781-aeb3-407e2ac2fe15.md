## Question

Is PVI essentially just looking at variability in the SpO2 monitor waveforms, similar to variability in an arterial line (A-line) waveform?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the Pleth Variability Index (PVI) is essentially measuring variability in the pulse oximeter (SpO2) pleth waveform and whether that variability parallels what is seen in an arterial line (A‑line) waveform. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how PVI is defined and exactly what signal it analyzes. Then, I should verify what dynamic variables are derived from an A‑line and the physiological basis behind them. Next, I will examine the comparative evidence linking PVI to A‑line indices for fluid responsiveness. After that, I need to check important limitations that could make PVI diverge from A‑line measures. Finally, I will synthesize when PVI can substitute for A‑line variability and when it should not, grounding all steps in the available literature on PVI, deltaPOP, PPV, and SVV [^111uqrN7] [^111aBpGQ] [^1112tegC] [^111yuDtN].

> Let me first confirm what PVI actually measures. PVI is an automated proprietary algorithm that quantifies the respiratory-induced variation in the perfusion index (PI), which itself comes from the amplitude of the pulse oximeter's photoplethysmographic waveform; in other words, PVI reflects the cyclic changes in pleth amplitude over several breaths rather than the SpO2 percentage value, so yes, it is variability of the pleth waveform displayed on the SpO2 monitor, not the saturation number per se [^111uqrN7] [^111aBpGQ]. Wait, let me verify the performance context: a meta-analysis pooling ∆POP and PVI studies showed that these pleth-based indices have good discrimination for fluid responsiveness, consistent with the idea that PVI operationalizes pleth waveform variability linked to respiration [^1112tegC].

> Next, I should review what the arterial line provides. An A‑line gives a beat-to-beat arterial pressure waveform from which dynamic indices such as pulse pressure variation (PPV), stroke volume variation (SVV), and systolic pressure variation (SPV) are computed over the respiratory cycle; these indices quantify heart–lung interaction effects on preload and stroke volume during positive-pressure ventilation, and they are considered reference dynamic measures under appropriate conditions [^111yuDtN] [^116TQZp5]. Hold on, I should verify the physiologic principle: these indices rise when the ventilatory-induced swings in intrathoracic pressure unmask preload dependence, tracking respiratory modulation of stroke volume and arterial pressure, which is why they predict fluid responsiveness better than static measures in controlled settings [^111yuDtN] [^111ETmAz].

> Now, I will examine how similar PVI and A‑line variability are conceptually and empirically. Conceptually, both are driven by the same heart–lung interactions: respiration modulates venous return and stroke volume, which changes central arterial pressure and peripheral arterial volume; the A‑line captures pressure swings while PVI captures pleth amplitude swings, so the physiologic origin is shared [^111yuDtN] [^111uqrN7]. Let me check empirical links: PVI correlates strongly with manually computed pleth variation (∆POP, r ≈ 0.92) and shows moderate similarity to arterial dynamic indices in predicting fluid responsiveness, with pooled AUCs around 0.80–0.85 for pleth-based measures and often around 0.90 for PPV/SVV, acknowledging cohort variability [^111uqrN7] [^1112tegC] [^116TQZp5]. I should double-check earlier comparative studies: arterial and plethysmographic dynamic indices had similar AUCs in hypotensive patients, supporting that pleth variability tracks the same phenomenon, albeit sometimes with slightly reduced accuracy compared with PPV/SVV [^112tFq3m].

> But wait, what if they are interchangeable in practice? Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to ensure we account for source-specific limitations. PVI depends on peripheral perfusion and the quality of the pleth signal; vasoconstriction or high-dose vasopressors can degrade signal and attenuate pleth amplitude modulation, making PVI less reliable, whereas a well-damped A‑line waveform often remains interpretable in the same context [^1177S6Kn]. I should review site effects and measurement robustness: forehead and ear sensors may outperform finger probes in low-perfusion or postoperative states, and data in neurosurgical sitting position show ear PVI can approach PPV performance, but site failure rates and missing data can limit usability [^111AggmK] [^115hBBSu]. Let me verify broader consistency: systematic reviews highlight heterogeneous cutoffs and only moderate pooled performance for PVI, with reliability influenced by fluid type, surgical vs ICU setting, and perfusion index, underscoring that PVI is a surrogate with context sensitivity [^111TGNv6] [^112Dqpmt] [^1167mofH].

> I will now examine comparative outcome data to see where PVI can stand in for PPV. In low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery, randomized trials show PVI-guided goal-directed fluid therapy yields outcomes comparable to PPV-guided strategies, with the advantage of being noninvasive, implying PVI can operationalize the same physiologic signal sufficiently for perioperative guidance in well-perfused patients under controlled ventilation [^116qsqWy] [^114AqRCX] [^1134hdMc]. Let me reconsider tracking changes: in major hepatic resection, PVI predicted fluid responsiveness similarly to PPV/SVV at baseline, but it did not track fluid-induced changes as reliably as arterial indices, reminding me that dynamic tracking and point prediction are related but distinct tasks [^114LCHum].

> Next, I should review edge cases and assumptions that can break dynamic indices. All dynamic preload indices, pleth- or pressure-based, require controlled mechanical ventilation with regular rhythm and adequate tidal volume; violating these assumptions (spontaneous breathing, arrhythmias, very low tidal volumes) reduces diagnostic accuracy, and pleth-based measures often degrade earlier because of their dependency on peripheral vascular tone and signal-to-noise ratio, a pattern evident in ICU cohorts and meta-analytic subgroup analyses [^111yuDtN] [^1112tegC] [^112Dqpmt]. Hold on, I should verify vasopressor effects again: critically ill patients receiving norepinephrine demonstrate significantly lower AUC for PVI relative to PPV/SVV, including instances where pleth signals are unobtainable, reinforcing caution in vasoconstricted states [^1177S6Kn].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line addresses both parts of the question clearly. Yes, PVI examines respiratory-induced variability in the SpO2 monitor's plethysmographic waveform amplitude, not the saturation percentage, and that variability is physiologically analogous to the respiratory swings quantified from an A‑line as PPV/SVV because both arise from the same heart–lung interaction effects on preload and stroke volume [^111uqrN7] [^111aBpGQ] [^111yuDtN]. However, I should confirm they are not strictly interchangeable: A‑line indices directly measure central arterial pressure variation and generally remain more robust across vasomotor and signal-quality perturbations, whereas PVI is a noninvasive surrogate whose accuracy depends on peripheral perfusion, sensor site, and adherence to dynamic-index assumptions, with performance gaps most apparent in vasoconstricted ICU patients on pressors [^116TQZp5] [^1177S6Kn] [^111TGNv6].

> Final take: PVI does look at variability of the SpO2 pleth waveform and is similar in physiologic meaning to A‑line dynamic indices, with supportive correlation and predictive evidence; in elective, well-perfused, mechanically ventilated patients, PVI can often substitute for PPV to guide fluids, but in unstable, vasoconstricted, or signal-challenged settings, A‑line–derived PPV/SVV remain the reference, and PVI should be interpreted cautiously or complemented by other maneuvers such as passive leg raising or echocardiography [^1112tegC] [^116qsqWy] [^114AqRCX] [^1177S6Kn].

---

No, PVI is not simply visual assessment of SpO2 waveform variability; it is an **automated, quantitative index** [^111uqrN7] of respiratory variation in the plethysmographic waveform, calculated by the monitor and displayed as a percentage [^111aBpGQ]. PVI correlates with fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients [^1112tegC] [^112Dqpmt], but is **less reliable than invasive arterial waveform indices** (PPV/SVV) [^1177S6Kn] and is affected by perfusion, vasoconstriction, and arrhythmias [^111TGNv6]. PVI is a noninvasive, continuous surrogate for PPV/SVV, not a direct substitute [^112tFq3m], and should be interpreted with clinical context and awareness of its limitations [^1112tegC] [^111yuDtN].

---

## Physiological basis of PVI

- **Respiratory-induced variation**: Positive-pressure ventilation causes cyclic preload changes, producing respiratory variation in stroke volume and arterial pressure; these are captured by invasive PPV/SVV [^111yuDtN] and noninvasive plethysmographic waveforms [^111uqrN7] [^111ETmAz].

- **Plethysmographic waveform**: The pulse oximeter waveform reflects arterial pulsations and peripheral perfusion [^115wyK9A] [^113wDHQY]; respiratory variation in its amplitude (deltaPOP) tracks preload dependence [^111uqrN7].

- **Automated calculation**: PVI is continuously calculated [^111aBpGQ] from the pleth waveform as the ratio of maximum to minimum perfusion index over several breaths, expressed as a percentage [^111uqrN7].

## Comparison with arterial line waveform variability

| **Parameter** | **PVI (pleth variability index)** | **Arterial line waveform variability (PPV/SVV)** |
|-|-|-|
| Measurement method | Noninvasive, automated from pleth waveform [^111uqrN7] | Invasive, direct arterial pressure waveform [^111yuDtN] |
| Clinical utility | Predicts fluid responsiveness in ventilated patients; noninvasive alternative to PPV/SVV [^112Dqpmt] [^1134hdMc] | Gold standard for fluid responsiveness; direct hemodynamic measurement [^111yuDtN] |
| Accuracy | Moderate accuracy (AUC ~0.85) [^1112tegC]; affected by perfusion, vasoconstriction, arrhythmias [^112Dqpmt] | High accuracy (AUC ~0.93) [^116TQZp5]; less affected by peripheral perfusion [^1177S6Kn] |
| Limitations | Less reliable with vasoconstrictors [^1177S6Kn], low perfusion, arrhythmias, spontaneous breathing [^112Dqpmt] [^1168hYtP] | Invasive; requires arterial catheter; risks of infection, bleeding |

## Clinical implications and limitations

- **Clinical utility**: PVI is a practical, noninvasive tool for fluid responsiveness in ventilated patients [^1112tegC], especially when arterial lines are undesirable [^1134hdMc] [^116qsqWy].

- **Limitations**: PVI is less reliable with vasoconstrictors [^1177S6Kn], low perfusion, arrhythmias, or spontaneous breathing; it is a surrogate, not a replacement, for PPV/SVV [^112Dqpmt].

- **Clinical context**: Use PVI alongside other hemodynamic data and clinical judgment, recognizing its limitations and the patient's condition [^1112tegC] [^111yuDtN].

---

PVI is an **automated, quantitative index** [^111uqrN7] of respiratory variation in the pleth waveform, not just visual assessment. It offers a noninvasive alternative to PPV/SVV for fluid responsiveness [^112Dqpmt], but is less accurate and affected by perfusion and rhythm; interpret it within the clinical context [^1131Rcdm].

## References

### Pleth variability index is a weak predictor of fluid responsiveness in patients receiving norepinephrine [^1177S6Kn]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

In patients receiving an infusion of norepinephrine, the relationship between the amplitude of the oximeter plethysmographic waveform and stroke volume may be variable, and the quality of the waveform might be reduced compared to patients not receiving norepinephrine. We assessed the reliability of the pleth variability index (PVI), an automatic measurement of the respiratory variation of the plethysmographic waveform, for predicting fluid responsiveness in patients receiving norepinephrine infusions.

- **Methods**: We measured the response of cardiac index (transpulmonary thermodilution) to intravenous fluid administration in 42 critically ill patients receiving norepinephrine. Patients with arrhythmias, spontaneous breathing, tidal volume less than 8 ml/kg, and respiratory system compliance less than 30 ml/cm H(2)O were excluded. Before fluid administration, we recorded the arterial pulse pressure variation (PPV) and pulse contour analysis-derived stroke volume variation (SVV, PiCCO2), as well as PVI (Masimo Radical-7).

- **Results**: In seven patients, the plethysmographic signal could not be obtained. Among the 35 remaining patients [mean SAPS II score = 77 (SD = 17)], intravenous fluid increased cardiac index by at least 15% in 15 'responders'. A baseline PVI of at least 16% predicted fluid responsiveness with a sensitivity of 47% (inter-quartile range: 21–73%) and a specificity of 90% (range: 68–99%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was significantly lower for PVI [0.68 (0.09)] than for PPV and SVV [0.93 (0.06) and 0.89 (0.07), respectively]. Considering all pairs of measurements, PVI was correlated with PPV.

### Does the pleth variability index indicate the respiratory-induced variation in the plethysmogram and arterial pressure waveforms [^111uqrN7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Respiratory variations in the pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform amplitude (deltaPOP) are sensitive to changes in preload and can predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients. However, they cannot be easily calculated from a bedside monitor. Pleth variability index (PVI, Masimo Corp, Irvine, CA) is a new algorithm that automatically calculates deltaPOP. The aim of our study was to test the ability of this new device to automatically and continuously monitor deltaPOP.

- **Methods**: Twenty-five patients were studied after induction of general anesthesia. PVI automatically and continuously calculates the respiratory variations in the plethysmography waveform amplitude (perfusion index). Data (mean arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, respiratory variations in arterial pulse pressure, deltaPOP, and PVI) were recorded at baseline in anti-Trendelenburg position and, finally, in Trendelenburg position.

- **Results**: There was a significant relationship between PVI and deltaPOP (r = 0.92; P < 0.05). A PVI threshold value of 11.5% was able to discriminate between deltaPOP > 13% and deltaPOP ≤ 13%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for PVI to predict deltaPOP > 13% was 0.990 ± 0.07.

- **Conclusion**: This study is the first to demonstrate the ability of PVI, an index automatically derived from the pulse oximeter waveform analysis, to automatically and continuously monitor deltaPOP. This new index has potential clinical applications.

### Pleth variability index to monitor the respiratory variations in the pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform amplitude and predict fluid responsiveness in the operating theatre [^111aBpGQ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Respiratory variations in pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform amplitude (DeltaPOP) can predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients but cannot be easily assessed at the bedside. The pleth variability index (PVI) is a new algorithm allowing for automated and continuous monitoring of DeltaPOP. We hypothesized that PVI can predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients under general anaesthesia.

- **Methods**: Twenty-five patients were studied after the induction of general anaesthesia. Hemodynamic data, including cardiac index (CI), respiratory variations in arterial pulse pressure (DeltaPP), DeltaPOP, and PVI, were recorded before and after volume expansion (500 mL of hetastarch 6%). Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in CI ≥ 15%.

- **Results**: Volume expansion induced changes in CI from 2.0 (SD 0.9) to 2.5 (1.2) litres min(-1) m(-2); PVI variations of > 14% before volume expansion discriminated between responders and non-responders with 81% sensitivity and 100% specificity. There was a significant relationship between PVI before volume expansion and change in CI after volume expansion (r = 0.67; P < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: PVI, an automatic and continuous monitor of DeltaPOP, can predict fluid responsiveness non-invasively in mechanically ventilated patients during general anaesthesia. This index has potential clinical applications.

### Accuracy of plethysmographic indices as predictors of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1112tegC]. Intensive Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

To systematically review the accuracy of the variation in pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform amplitude (∆POP) and the Pleth Variability Index (PVI) as predictors of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated adults, several methods were employed. MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were screened for clinical studies examining the accuracy of ∆POP/PVI in predicting the hemodynamic response to a subsequent fluid bolus. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to summarize the results. Data were stratified according to the amount of fluid bolus (large vs. small) and the study index (∆POP vs. PVI).

Ten studies involving 233 patients were included in this meta-analysis. All patients were in normal sinus rhythm. The pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for identification of fluid responders was 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79–0.92]. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.80 (95% CI 0.74–0.85) and 0.76 (0.68–0.82), respectively. No heterogeneity was found within studies with the same amount of fluid bolus nor between studies on ∆POP and those on PVI. The AUC was significantly larger in studies with a large bolus amount than in those with a small bolus [0.92 (95% CI 0.87–0.96) vs. 0.70 (0.62–0.79), p < 0.0001]. Sensitivity and specificity were also higher in studies with a large bolus [0.84 (95% CI 0.77–0.90) vs. 0.72 (0.60–0.82) (small bolus), p = 0.08, and 0.86 (95% CI 0.75–0.93) vs. 0.68 (0.56–0.77) (small bolus), p = 0.02], respectively.

### Nitroglycerin (NITRO-BID) [^11219x8m]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, leading to the dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. This dilation promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.

Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates had been absent from the body for several hours was their anti-anginal efficacy restored.

### Central venous pressure: Current uses and prospects for an old parameter [^112iBV7B]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Despite being a pivotal parameter in hemodynamic management, central venous pressure (CVP) fell out of favor when several meta-analyses demonstrated its inability to predict fluid responsiveness (FR). CVP is measured in the superior vena cava via a jugular or subclavian catheter and serves as a surrogate for right atrial pressure (RAP). Zeroing to the midpoint of the right atrium ('phlebostatic axis') is crucial since even small differences may induce high variability in measured values. Measurement is ideally performed at end-expiration at minimal intrathoracic pressure, at the base of the c-wave. The CVP displayed by the monitor provides a reasonable estimation in spontaneously breathing patients (SBP) with irregular respiratory patterns. Beyond the value, the appearance of the waveform can offer diagnostic insights into various pathologies. There may be three distinct uses.

### Pleth variability index versus pulse pressure variation for intraoperative goal-directed fluid therapy in patients undergoing low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^116qsqWy]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

In patients undergoing low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery, pleth variability index (PVI) and pulse pressure variation (PPV) guided goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) are considered equivalent for the primary outcome of hospital length of stay, with no difference found between the secondary outcomes. Both strategies seem to optimize preload equally and lead to similar outcomes. PVI, nonetheless, has the distinct advantage of being totally non-invasive, whereas PPV can be displayed continuously with certain monitors but remains invasive and does not improve outcomes compared to PVI in this population.

Several studies have shown that PVI-guided GDFT, when compared to fluid therapy guided by static parameters of fluid responsiveness, can lead to decreased infused fluid volume, decreased time to first stool, and decreased perioperative lactate levels. Trials comparing different GDFT strategies to PVI, such as esophageal Doppler, have resulted in conflicting outcomes.

- **Comparison to esophageal Doppler in renal transplantation**: PVI was shown to detect fluid responsiveness less consistently. These patients may have pathological endothelial changes affecting arterial compliance, leading to poor capillary distribution. Since PVI is a direct measure of arterial compliance, these effects may alter the fluid response threshold.

- **Comparison to esophageal Doppler in colorectal resection**: In this population, which is more comparable to ours, fluid administration and outcomes were not different.

Bahlmann et al. also showed that PVI and stroke volume optimization assessed by esophageal Doppler during open abdominal surgery resulted in comparable outcomes.

### Prediction of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated cardiac surgical patients: The performance of seven different functional hemodynamic parameters [^116TQZp5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Functional hemodynamic parameters, such as stroke volume and pulse pressure variation (SVV and PPV), have been shown to be reliable predictors of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients. Today, different minimally- and non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems measure these parameters. Although some parameters are described by the same name, they differ in measurement technique and may provide different results. We aimed to test the performance of seven functional hemodynamic parameters simultaneously in the same clinical setting.

- **Methods**: Hemodynamic measurements were conducted in 30 mechanically ventilated cardiac surgery patients. Before and following a standardized intravenous fluid bolus, hemodynamics were measured using the following monitoring systems: PiCCOplus (SVV PiCCO, PPV PiCCO), LiDCO rapid (SVV LiDCO, PPV LiDCO), FloTrac (SVV FloTrac), Philips Intellivue (PPV Philips), and Masimo pulse oximeter (pleth variability index, PVI). Prediction of fluid responsiveness was tested by calculating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, including a gray zone approach, and compared using Fisher's Z-Test.

- **Results**: Fluid administration resulted in an increase in cardiac output, while all functional hemodynamic parameters decreased. A wide range of areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) was observed: AUC-SVV PiCCO = 0.91, AUC-PPV PiCCO = 0.88, AUC-SVV LiDCO = 0.78, AUC-PPV LiDCO = 0.89, AUC-SVV FloTrac = 0.87, AUC-PPV Philips = 0.92, and AUC-PVI = 0.68.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: A narrative review [^116VQkNM]. Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Pressure transducers are zeroed to atmospheric pressure via a three-way tap and repeated periodically to account for cable faults or baseline drift. To address the various pieces of equipment used to monitor central venous pressure (CVP), a fast-flush test to elicit a square waveform is conducted. This test measures the dynamic response of the system to assess overdamping or underdamping, considering the natural frequency and damping coefficient.

In contemporary practice, CVP waveforms and values are displayed digitally, which can introduce errors. Cardiac mechanical events follow corresponding electrical events with a delay of 0.2 seconds. The concept of a CVP 'value' is abstract and derived using filtering techniques incorporating peak and trough values. The difference between the instantaneous CVP value and the derived value can be up to 4 mmHg in patients whose lungs are ventilated spontaneously or mechanically. Measurement timed to right ventricular end-diastolic pressure, or when the tricuspid valve closes, provides the most accurate indication of cardiac preload.

- **The most accurate methods**: For obtaining a CVP numerical value involve reading a waveform directly or freezing the bedside monitor at the base of the c-wave at end expiration over three breaths. This occurs where pleural pressure is closest to atmospheric in patients whose lungs are both spontaneously and mechanically ventilated, thereby reducing the effects of intrathoracic pressure. However, if there is elevated end-expiratory pressure from obstruction or bronchospasm, then…

### Extracting arterial flow waveforms from pulse oximeter waveforms apparatus [^113wDHQY]. Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

A method is described that allows an approximation of the arterial flow waveform to be derived from a pulse oximeter waveform. The observed pulse oximeter waveform is the sum of arterial inflow and venous outflow. These components are separated mathematically. Subtraction of the venous outflow reveals the underlying arterial flow waveform. The assumptions on which the method is based are stated explicitly and discussed.

### Pleth variability index versus pulse pressure variation for intraoperative goal-directed fluid therapy in patients undergoing low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^1167mofH]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

It is important to consider, nevertheless, that low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery may itself explain the lack of difference between groups. Two recent studies on the impact of non-invasively guided goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) (Clearsight/ccNexfin) in patients undergoing moderate-risk abdominal surgery, when compared to restrictive fluid therapy, were unable to demonstrate any difference between groups. Two possible reasons for these findings are that the non-invasive monitor did not adequately optimize cardiac output, or that preload optimization has little impact on outcome in low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery. However, other studies focusing on low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery reported that perioperative fluid management could still have an impact on postoperative outcomes in this particular population, indicating that fluid administration should be individualized and goal-directed.

This randomized controlled trial had several limitations. In addition to the limitations intrinsic to a single-center study, we did not measure protocol compliance, which is a key predictor of GDFT impact. However, since both interventions required similar workloads, compliance should have been similar in both groups. In addition, this study was performed according to an intention-to-treat analysis, and our results consequently reflect clinical practice. The vast majority of patients were women undergoing laparoscopic surgery, and this should be noted when applying our GDFT strategies to patients. Another limitation inherent to pleth variability index (PVI) is its dependence on the perfusion index, which varies depending on vascular conditions.

### Respiratory waveform variation can prevent pulsus paradoxus measurement by sphygmomanometry [^116jJhwt]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Low credibility.

Pulsus paradoxus (PP) represents increased fluctuation of systolic pressure during the respiratory cycle. PP increases in pathological conditions, including asthma and other obstructive airway diseases. Respiratory waveform variation (RWV) represents arterial waveform baseline variability resulting from intrapleural pressure changes during the respiratory cycle in the presence of airway obstruction. It is not known whether RWV influences manual PP measurement using a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope.

- **Methods**: We performed an observational study in six healthy adults. Participants performed tidal-breathing through a breathing apparatus with predetermined inspiratory (0–45.6 cm H₂O) and expiratory (0–24.4 cm H₂O) resistance levels for a total of 23 data sets per participant. PP was measured from continuous radial artery pressure recordings as the absolute difference between maximum and minimum systolic pressure levels during a complete respiratory cycle.

- **Results**: In this study, PP values measured without applied airway resistance exceeded 10 mmHg, the traditional definition of PP, in five of the six participants. Manual measurement of PP would not be possible at greater RWV because the maximum diastolic pressure exceeded minimum systolic pressure during RWV.

- **Conclusions**: PP in normal adults may exceed 10 mmHg, and RWV may be of sufficient magnitude to preclude manual PP measurement.

### First day of life reference values for pleth variability index in spontaneously breathing term newborns [^111xpu4Y]. Neonatology (2012). Low credibility.

The perfusion index (PI), derived from the pulse oximetry signal, has been shown to be an accurate predictor for identifying high illness severity in neonates. The plethysmographic variability index (PVI) is a measure of the dynamic change in PI occurring during a complete respiratory cycle.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this study was to establish the reference range of PVI in spontaneously breathing term newborns.

- **Methods**: PI and PVI values were assessed in 242 term newborns during the first day of life.

- **Results**: The median PVI value on the first day of life was 20% [95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean 19–20%; inter-quartile range 15 (95% CI 15–16) - 24 (95% CI 23–24)]. The 10th and 90th percentile cutoff values were 12% (95% CI 11–12) and 28% (95% CI 27–29), respectively, with the 97.5th percentile of 35% (95% CI 34–38). PVI was also significantly influenced by the behavioral status of the newborn and was positively correlated with PI and pulse rate, while it was inversely correlated with oxygen saturation (p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest: (1) evaluation of PVI values is an easily applicable, noninvasive procedure for monitoring early postnatal respiratory changes in newborns, and (2) the feasibility of a noninvasive pulse-oximeter postnatal screening for early identification of adverse neonatal cardiorespiratory outcomes.

### Cephalic versus digital plethysmographic variability index measurement: A comparative pilot study in cardiac surgery patients [^111AggmK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Noninvasive measurement of digital plethysmographic variability index (PVI(digital)) has been proposed to predict fluid responsiveness, with conflicting results. The authors tested the hypothesis that cephalic sites of PVI measurement, namely PVI(ear) and PVI(forehead), could be more discriminant than PVI(digital) in predicting fluid responsiveness after cardiac surgery.

- **Design**: A prospective observational study conducted in a cardiac surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital.

- **Participants**: Fifty adult patients were included.

- **Interventions**: Investigation was performed before and following a fluid challenge.

Patients were prospectively included within the first 6-hour postoperative period. A positive response to the fluid challenge was defined as a 15% increase in cardiac index. PVI(digital), PVI(ear), PVI(forehead), and invasive arterial pulse-pressure variation (PPV) measurements were recorded simultaneously, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed.

- **Main results**: Forty-one (82%) patients were responders, and 9 (18%) were nonresponders to the fluid challenge. The area under the ROC curve (ROCAUC) values were 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60–0.86) for PVI(digital), 0.81 (95% CI: 0.68–0.91) for PVI(ear), 0.88 (95% CI: 0.75–0.95) for PVI(forehead), and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.75–0.95) for PPV. Significant differences were observed between PVI(forehead) and PVI(digital) (absolute difference in ROCAUC = 0.134 [95% CI: 0.003–0.265], p = 0.045), and between PPV and PVI(digital) (absolute difference in ROCAUC = 0.129 [95% CI: 0.011-).

### Value and variability of pulse shape indicator for estimating mean arterial pressure in the radial and femoral arteries [^112qr7HS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

In regard to intraindividual FF variability, a noninvasive study conducted with 19 healthy young volunteers found that brachial FF significantly increased following mental stress. It is worth noting that invasive recordings provide a precise quantification of intrinsic FF variability, whereas noninvasive recordings may introduce additional variability due to unavoidable technical biases. In our invasive study, we assessed the intraindividual variability of FF during therapeutic interventions that led to acute changes in hemodynamic and respiratory conditions in a subgroup of patients requiring these changes in the standard management of their critical illness. This included adjustments in norepinephrine dosage, fluid administration, increases in positive end-expiratory pressure, and prone positioning. Most of these interventions were expected to significantly alter the cardiovascular state, including vasomotor tone and left ventricular stroke volume. Interestingly, on average, FF remained essentially unchanged following these interventions at both arterial sites. The only exception was an increase in femoral FF induced by fluid administration. It should be noted that patients with a femoral arterial catheter had more severe conditions compared with those with a radial arterial catheter, and differences in their overall hemodynamic status may explain this finding. Finally, after all the maneuvers, using a fixed FF value of 0.33 resulted in highly accurate estimations of the time-averaged MAP at both arterial sites.

### Dynamic changes in arterial waveform derived variables and fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients: A systematic review of the literature [^111yuDtN]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

A systematic review of the literature was conducted to determine the ability of dynamic changes in arterial waveform-derived variables to predict fluid responsiveness, comparing these with static indices of fluid responsiveness. The assessment of a patient's intravascular volume is one of the most challenging tasks in critical care medicine. Conventional static hemodynamic variables have proven unreliable as predictors of volume responsiveness. Dynamic changes in systolic pressure, pulse pressure, and stroke volume in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation have emerged as useful techniques to assess volume responsiveness.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles.

- **Study selection**: Clinical studies evaluated the association between stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, and/or stroke volume variation, and the change in stroke volume/cardiac index following a fluid or positive end-expiratory pressure challenge.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Data were abstracted on study design, study size, study setting, patient population, and the correlation coefficient and/or receiver operating characteristic between the baseline systolic pressure variation, stroke volume variation, and/or pulse pressure variation and the change in stroke index/cardiac index following a fluid challenge. When reported, the receiver operating characteristic of the central venous pressure, global end-diastolic volume index, and left ventricular end-diastolic area index were also recorded.

### The effect of haemodynamic and peripheral vascular variability on cardiac output monitoring: Thermodilution and non-invasive pulse contour cardiac output during cardiothoracic surgery [^114sGckC]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

While haemodynamic variability interferes with the assumption of constant flow underlying thermodilution cardiac output calculation, variability in peripheral arterial vascular physiology may affect pulse contour cardiac output methods. We compared non-invasive finger arterial pressure-derived continuous cardiac output measurements (Nexfin®) with cardiac output measured using thermodilution during cardiothoracic surgery and determined the impact of cardiovascular variability on either method.

We compared cardiac output derived from non-invasive finger arterial pressure with cardiac output measured by thermodilution at four grades (A-D) of cardiovascular variability.

- **Grade A**: Defined as heart rate and mean arterial pressure variability 30 beats.
- **Grade B**: Included all levels of heart rate/mean arterial pressure variability and arrhythmias (Physiocal 5% and arrhythmias excluded).
- **Grade D**: Included all data.

Comparison results were quantified as percentage errors. We analyzed measurements in 27 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Before extracorporeal circulation, the percentage error was 23% (n = 14 patients) in grade A, 28% (n = 20) in grade B, 32% (n = 22) in grade C, and 37% (n = 26) in grade D, with a significant increase in variance (p = 0.035). Bias did not differ between grades.

### Is the pleth variability index a surrogate for pulse pressure variation in a pediatric population undergoing spine fusion [^115xh7xH]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

To compare simultaneous measurements of pulse pressure variation (PPV) and pleth variability index (PVI) in patients undergoing spinal fusion, we aimed to determine if PVI can be used as a surrogate for PPV and also the influence of the prone position on these measurements.

Spine fusion is an involved surgical procedure that requires careful attention to fluid administration. Dynamic indices for assessing fluid responsiveness, such as PPV, have proven useful in guiding fluid administration. Plethysmographic waveform variation, like PVI, is an appealing surrogate for measurements like PPV, which require invasive arterial pressure measurement. The potential of either PPV or PVI to guide fluid therapy in spine fusion patients has not been previously studied.

Patients undergoing spine fusion for scoliosis were studied. In addition to the usual monitors, including direct arterial pressure measurement, a multi-wavelength pulse co-oximeter was applied to measure PVI. Paired measurements of PPV and PVI were obtained, and limits of agreement were determined using the method of Bland and Altman. PPV and PVI in prone and supine positions were compared using a paired t-test.

The bias between PVI and PPV measurements was -0.56%, with 95% limits of agreement from +21.67% to -20.55%. There was no significant difference between the prone and supine measurements at the P = 0.05 level.

Our data indicate that PVI is not a surrogate for PPV. PVI measurements were not influenced by changing from the supine to prone position and may, therefore, prove useful for patient management.

### Blood pressure measurement and assessment of arterial structure and function: an expert group position paper [^113zbuAm]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

- **Central aortic blood pressure and pulse wave analysis**: The pressure pulse generated in the proximal aorta due to left ventricular ejection generally increases in amplitude as it propagates towards the periphery due to characteristics of structure and function of the arterial vasculature. In large arteries, mean arterial pressure (MAP) is constant, so change in pulse amplitude is always associated with alterations in wave morphology, such that the area under the central and peripheral pulse wave is similar. In addition, central (cDBP) and peripheral (pDBP) arterial diastolic pressure are also almost similar, so changes in the shape of the pressure pulse wave are predominantly related to differences in central (cSBP) and peripheral (pSBP) systolic pressure. These fundamental physiological observations have been made from invasive measurements and are consistent with physiological considerations of pulse wave propagation. The differences between cSBP and pSBP have been shown to spread over the range of 0–30 mmHg, with an average difference of 12 mmHg. Because of the distribution of differences, it is not possible to estimate cSBP by subtracting 12 mmHg from measured pSBP. This would only capture 19% of the values that would be in the similarity range of MAP and DBP. These considerations generated interest in using the peripheral pulse wave to uncover the quantitative relative difference in cSBP and pSBP from noninvasive measurements.

The peripheral pressure pulse can be readily obtained noninvasively from the radial or carotid arteries using applanation tonometry.

### Pulse pressure variations and plethysmographic variability index measured at ear are able to predict fluid responsiveness in the sitting position for neurosurgery [^115hBBSu]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2020). Low credibility.

Pulse pressure variation (PPV) and plethysmographic variability index (PVI) are dynamic indicators of preload dependence based on heart-lung interactions. They are used to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients in the supine position. The sitting position for neurosurgery changes intrathoracic blood volume, potentially affecting the capacity of PPV and PVI to predict fluid responsiveness. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of PPV and PVI to predict fluid responsiveness during general anesthesia in the sitting position.

- **Methods**: In total, 31 patients were included after settling in the sitting position but before surgery began. PPV, PVI with a finger sensor (PVI finger), and PVI with an ear sensor (PVI ear) were recorded before and following a fluid challenge of hydroxylethylstarch 250 mL over 10 minutes. Esophageal Doppler was used to record stroke volume. Patients were defined as fluid responders if stroke volume increased by more than 10% after the fluid challenge.

- **Results**: In total, 13 (42%) patients were fluid responders. PPV and PVI ear were higher in responders than in non-responders before the fluid challenge (12 ± 5 vs. 7 ± 3; P = 0.0005 and 14 ± 5 vs. 8 ± 3; P = 0.001, respectively). Areas under the receiver-operating curves to predict fluid responsiveness were 0.87 for PPV (P < 0.0001), 0.87 for PVI ear (P < 0.0001), and 0.64 for PVI finger (P = 0.17). PPV ≥ 8% or PVI ear ≥ 11% predicted fluid responsiveness with sensitivities of 83% for both, and specificities of 83% and 91%, respectively. However, PVI ear data were not available in 26% of patients.

### Reliability of pleth variability index in predicting preload responsiveness of mechanically ventilated patients under various conditions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111TGNv6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

The results of the synthesis show that the subgroups with colloid injection (Youden index = 0.59, AUC = 0.83) are more reliable than the subgroups with crystalloid injection (Youden index = 0.46, AUC = 0.79). This may be because the colloidal fluid has a better effect on the macrocirculation and the microcirculation, thus increasing the reliability of the pleth variability index (PVI).

The included results show that the PVI has a wide range of best cut-off values for defining responders to preload responsiveness, ranging from 7 to 20%. The different conditions for each study, such as the patients' underlying disease, volume stroke, age, type of surgery, whether they are in the operating room or in the ICU, and their different fluid management, including the application of vasoactive drugs, rate of intravenous infusion, and type of volume expansion, may contribute to high variability. It is suggested that readers refer to the cut-off values reported in the corresponding articles when applying PVI to different patients.

The monitored site can affect the morphology and respiratory variation of the PVI. Desgranges et al. compared finger, forehead, and ear as monitored sites, reporting that the choice among these sites has no significant impact on accuracy. However, Hood et al. reported that the PVI finger can reliably predict increases in stroke volume, while the PVI earlobe cannot reliably predict increases in stroke volume in dynamic intraoperative conditions. Fischer et al. demonstrated that the PVI forehead was more accurate than the PVI finger in patients after cardiac surgery.

### Pleth variability index versus pulse pressure variation for intraoperative goal-directed fluid therapy in patients undergoing low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^114AqRCX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

In patients undergoing low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery, the pleth variability index (PVI) seems to guide goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) similarly to pulse pressure variation (PPV) with regard to hospital length of stay (LOS), the amount of fluid administered, and the incidence of postoperative complications. However, in low-risk patients undergoing these surgical procedures, optimizing stroke volume may have a limited impact on outcomes.

### Pleth variability index versus pulse pressure variation for intraoperative goal-directed fluid therapy in patients undergoing low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^1134hdMc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT), guided by dynamic indicators of fluid responsiveness (e.g. pulse pressure variation (PPV)), has been shown to decrease postoperative complications and shorten length of stay (LOS) during major abdominal surgery. These dynamic indicators are based on cardiopulmonary interactions during mechanical ventilation and predict fluid responsiveness better than static indicators (e.g. central venous pressure and non-invasive blood pressure).

Pulse pressure variation can guide GDFT, but it requires the insertion of an arterial catheter with inherent risks. This invasive approach is not always desirable, especially for low-to-moderate risk surgeries where blood loss and fluid shifts are minimal. In cases where the risks of an invasive catheter outweigh its potential benefits, the pleth variability index (PVI) may be a valuable alternative. PVI is a completely non-invasive monitor that only requires a pulse oximeter. PVI-based GDFT has been shown to reduce postoperative lactate levels and improve postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing high-risk abdominal surgery. It is safe, easily implemented, and non-invasive.

Nevertheless, PVI's correlation to PPV has been shown to be weak during major abdominal and cardiac surgeries, possibly due to intraoperative or chronic changes in arteriolar compliance, sympathetic tone, and heart rate variability. However, in low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery, such effects on arteriolar and sympathetic tone are probably less frequent, and the clinical impact of PVI remains to be determined. PVI may thus be useful in these cases.

### Comparative efficacy of finger versus forehead plethysmographic variability index monitoring in pediatric surgical patients [^116CXFUk]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

The Plethysmographic Variability Index (PVI) can be measured by both finger and forehead probes. Vasoconstriction may jeopardize the reliability of finger PVI measurements in pediatric patients undergoing surgery; however, forehead vasculature exhibits more marked resistance to alterations in the vasomotor tonus.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to compare the Plethysmographic Variability Index measured via finger or forehead probes in mechanically ventilated pediatric surgery patients in terms of their ability to predict fluid responsiveness, as well as to determine the best cut-off values for these two measurements.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 50 pediatric patients undergoing minor elective surgery were included after provision of parental consent and ethics committee approval. Perfusion index measured at the finger or forehead and Plethysmographic Variability Index monitoring comprised the primary assessments. Hemodynamic parameters monitored included perfusion index, Plethysmographic Variability Index, and cardiac output. A ≥ 15% increase in cardiac output following a passive leg raise maneuver was considered to show fluid responsiveness. Two groups were defined based on fluid responsiveness: Group R (responsive) and Group NR (non-responsive). Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, DeLong test, and ROC were used for statistical analysis.

- **Results**: The area under curve for finger and forehead Plethysmographic Variability Index prior to passive leg raise maneuver were 0.699 (p = .011) and 0.847 (p < .001), respectively. The sensitivity for finger and forehead measurements

### The use of oxygen reserve index in one-lung ventilation and its impact on peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion index and, pleth variability index [^113Dm6gT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

Later, we evaluated the representative trends of the ORi and PI values, as well as the ORi and PVI values, at different time points during anesthesia induction and maintenance of thoracic surgeries. These trends are represented in the figures referenced below:

- **Figure 2**: The oxygen reserve index (ORi) and perfusion index (PI) values at different time points of surgery.
- **Figure 3**: The oxygen reserve index (ORi) and pleth variability index (PVI) values at different time points of surgery.

For hemodynamic and oximeter parameters, including heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) values, no correlation was found among these parameters in the statistical analysis (p > 0.05). In our study, we demonstrated a time-dependent correlation between PVI and MAP at the time point of OLV90, indicating that PVI showed a relation to MAP at a late stage of the thoracic surgical procedure.

In our study, we investigated the ORi and PVI values at different time points during anesthesia induction and maintenance of thoracic surgery. Our findings show that fluid deficit or fluid overload causes changes in PI and PVI values, as observed in our representative trend graphs in Figures 2 and 3. Our study provides valuable data for the investigation of correlations between ORi and PI, and PVI. At the time point of DS5, there is a significant negative correlation with PI (r = −0.332, p = 0.019), whereas no correlations with PVI were noted.

Table 3 shows the median values and interquartile range of PI and PVI values at different measurement points during the study.

### Plethysmographic variability index (PVI) accuracy in predicting fluid responsiveness in anesthetized children [^112JaKU5]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Plethysmographic Variability Index (PVI) has been shown to accurately predict responsiveness to fluid loads in adults. The goal of this study was to evaluate PVI accuracy when predicting fluid responsiveness during noncardiac surgery in children.

- **Material and methods**: Children aged 2–10 years scheduled for noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia were included. PVI was assessed concomitantly with the stroke volume index (SVI). A response to fluid load was defined by an SVI increase of more than 15%. A 10 ml·kg⁻¹ normal saline intravenous fluid challenge was administered before surgical incision and after anesthetic induction. After incision, fluid challenges were administered when SVI values decreased by more than 15% or where judged necessary by the anesthesiologist. Statistical analyses included receiving operator characteristics (ROC) analysis and the determination of the gray zone method with an error tolerance of 10%.

- **Results**: Fifty-four patients were included, 97 fluid challenges administered, and 45 responses recorded. The area under the curve of ROC curves was 0.85 [0.77–0.93] and 0.8 [0.7–0.89] for baseline PVI and SVI values, respectively. Corresponding gray zone limits were [10–17%] and [22–31 ml·m⁻²], respectively. PVI values exhibited different gray zone limits for pre-incision and post-incision fluid challenges, whereas SVI values were comparable. PVI value percentages in the gray zone were 34% overall and 44% for challenges performed after surgical incision.

- **Discussion**: This study found both PVI and pre-challenge SVI to be accurate when used to predict fluid responsiveness in anesthetized children during noncardiac surgery.

### The use of oxygen reserve index in one-lung ventilation and its impact on peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion index and, pleth variability index [^115tui1E]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

Our goal is to investigate the use of the oxygen reserve index (ORi) to detect hypoxemia and its relation with parameters such as peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion index (PI), and pleth variability index (PVI) during one-lung ventilation (OLV).

- **Methods**: Fifty patients undergoing general anesthesia and OLV for elective thoracic surgeries were enrolled in an observational cohort study in a tertiary care teaching hospital. All patients required OLV following a left-sided double-lumen tube insertion during intubation. The definition of hypoxemia during OLV is a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) value of less than 95%, while the inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) is higher than 50% on a pulse oximetry device. ORi, pulse oximetry, PI, and PVI values were measured continuously. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios, and accuracy were calculated for ORi values equal to zero at different time points during surgery to predict hypoxemia. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the Registration ID NCT05050552.

- **Results**: Hypoxemia was observed in 19 patients (38%). The accuracy for predicting hypoxemia during anesthesia induction at an ORi value of zero at 5 minutes after intubation in the supine position (DS5) showed a sensitivity of 92.3% (95% CI 84.9–99.6), a specificity of 81.1% (95% CI 70.2–91.9), and an accuracy of 84.0% (95% CI 73.8–94.2). For predicting hypoxemia, an ORi value of zero shows good sensitivity, specificity, and statistical accuracy for time points from DS5 until OLV30, where the sensitivity is 43.8% and specificity is…

### Arterial waveform analysis for the anesthesiologist: past, present, and future concepts [^111ETmAz]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Qualitative arterial waveform analysis has been in existence for millennia; however, quantitative arterial waveform analysis techniques, which can be traced back to Euler's work in the 18th century, have not been widely used by anesthesiologists and other clinicians. This is likely attributable, in part, to the widespread use of the sphygmomanometer, allowing practitioners to assess arterial blood pressure without needing to understand the higher-order characteristics of the arterial waveform. A 20-year delay in developing devices to measure these traits is a testament to the primitiveness of our appreciation for this information.

The shape of the peripheral arterial pressure waveform may indeed contain information useful to the anesthesiologist and intensivist. The maximal slope of the peripheral arterial pressure tracing seems to be related to left ventricular contractility, although the relationship may be confounded by other hemodynamic variables. The area under the peripheral arterial pressure tracing is related to stroke volume when loading conditions are stable; this finding has been used in developing several continuous cardiac output monitors. Pulse wave velocity may be related to vascular impedance and could potentially improve the accuracy of waveform-based stroke volume estimates. Estimates of central arterial pressures (e.g. aortic) can be produced from peripheral (e.g. brachial, radial) tracings using a Generalized Transfer Function and are incorporated into the algorithms of several continuous cardiac output monitors.

### Evidence for pressure-independent sympathetic modulation of central pulse wave velocity [^112sKGtz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Whether the sympathetic nervous system can directly alter central aortic stiffness remains controversial, mainly because of the difficulty in experimentally augmenting peripheral vasoconstrictor activity without changing blood pressure.

- **Methods and results**: To address this limitation, we utilized low-level cardiopulmonary baroreflex loading and unloading previously shown to alter sympathetic outflow without evoking parallel hemodynamic modulation. Blood pressure and carotid-femoral aortic pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) were measured in 32 healthy participants (24 ± 2 years; women: n = 15) before and during 12-minute applications of low-level lower body negative pressure (−7 mm Hg) and lower body positive pressure (+7 mm Hg), applied in a random order. Fibular nerve microneurography was used to collect muscle sympathetic nerve activity in a subset (n = 8) to confirm peripheral sympathetic responses.

	- During lower body negative pressure, heart rate, blood pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance were not statistically different (all P > 0.05); burst frequency increased by 15% (P = 0.007), total muscle sympathetic nerve activity increased by 44% (P = 0.006), and cf-PWV showed a change of +0.3 ± 0.2 m/s (P > 0.05). On the other hand, during lower body positive pressure, blood pressure increased (P < 0.05) and pulse pressure decreased (P = 0.01); burst frequency decreased by 4% (P = 0.37) and total muscle sympathetic nerve activity decreased by 7% (P = 0.89).

### Pleth variability index predicts fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients [^1113xo7s]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether the pleth variability index, a noninvasive and continuous tool, can predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients with circulatory insufficiency.

The study design was a prospective study, set in the surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital. The patients involved were forty mechanically ventilated patients with circulatory insufficiency for whom volume expansion was planned by the attending physician. Exclusion criteria included spontaneous respiratory activity, cardiac arrhythmia, known intracardiac shunt, severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mm Hg), contraindication for passive leg raising, left ventricular ejection fraction of < 50%, and hemodynamic instability during the procedure.

Interventions included a fluid challenge with 500 mL of 130/0.4 hydroxyethyl-starch if respiratory variations in arterial pulse pressure were ≥ 13%, or passive leg raising if variations in arterial pulse pressure were < 13%.

- **Measurements and main results**: Pleth variability index, variations in arterial pulse pressure, and cardiac output estimated by echocardiography were recorded before and after the fluid challenge. Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in cardiac output of ≥ 15%. Among the participants, 21 patients were responders and 19 were nonresponders. The mean ± SD pleth variability index (28% ± 13% vs. 11% ± 4%) and arterial pulse pressure variation (22% ± 11% vs. 5% ± 2%) values at baseline were significantly higher in responders than in nonresponders. The pleth variability index threshold value of 17% allowed discrimination between responders and nonresponders with a sensitivi

### Central-to-peripheral stiffness gradients determine diastolic pressure and flow fluctuation waveforms: time domain analysis of femoral artery pulse [^1121B7XM]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Blood pressure fluctuates during diastole to create a dicrotic wave, but the mechanistic origin remains poorly understood. This study investigates the characteristics and determinants of diastolic pressure and flow fluctuations, focusing on stiffness gradients between the central aorta and peripheral arteries.

Using applanation tonometry and duplex ultrasound, pulse waveforms were recorded on the femoral artery in 592 patients (age: 55 ± 14 years). The aim was to estimate the diastolic pressure fluctuation as a residual wave against the mono-exponential decay and the diastolic flow fluctuation as a bidirectional (forward and reverse) velocity wave. The radial, carotid, and dorsalis pedis pressures were also recorded to measure the peripheral/aortic pulse pressure (PP) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) ratios.

Results showed close resemblances between the femoral pressure and flow fluctuation waveforms. The pressure and flow fluctuations were mutually correlated in relative amplitude as indexed to the total pulse height (r = 0.63), with the pressure fluctuation following the flow fluctuation temporally. In multivariate-adjusted models, higher peripheral/aortic PP and PWV ratios were independently associated with greater pressure and flow fluctuation indices (P < 0.001). Mediation analysis revealed that the associations of PP and PWV ratios with the pressure fluctuation index were largely mediated by the flow fluctuation index [indirect/total effect ratio: 57% (95% CI 42–80) and 54% (30–100), respectively].

These results suggest that central-to-peripheral pulse amplification and stiffness gradients significantly influence diastolic pressure and flow fluctuations.

### Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure fail to predict ventricular filling volume, cardiac performance, or the response to volume infusion in normal subjects [^113UtweC]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure have been considered reliable measures of left and right ventricular preload in patients requiring invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Recent studies have raised questions about the correlation between these estimates of ventricular filling pressures and ventricular end-diastolic volumes or cardiac performance variables in specific patient groups. However, clinicians still consider this relationship valid in a broader context. The study's objective was to assess the relationship between pressure estimates of ventricular preload (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, central venous pressure) and end-diastolic ventricular volumes or cardiac performance in healthy volunteers.

- **Design**: Prospective, nonrandomized, nonblinded interventional study.

- **Setting**: Cardiac catheterization and echocardiography laboratories.

- **Subjects**: Normal healthy volunteers (n = 12 group 1, n = 32 group 2).

- **Interventions**: Pulmonary catheterization and radionuclide cineangiography (group 1) and volumetric echocardiography (group 2) during a 3-liter normal saline infusion over 3 hours.

- **Measurements and main results**: In group 1, the initial pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure did not significantly correlate with initial end-diastolic ventricular volume indexes or cardiac performance (cardiac index and stroke volume index). Changes in pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure following saline infusion also did not correlate with changes in end-diastolic ventricular volume indexes.

### Prediction of arterial pressure increase after fluid challenge [^1131L9U1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg is recommended for critically ill hypotensive patients, whereas they do not benefit from supranormal cardiac output values. In this study, we investigated if the increase of mean arterial pressure after volume expansion could be predicted by cardiovascular and renal variables. This is a relevant topic because unnecessary positive fluid balance increases mortality, organ dysfunction, and Intensive Care Unit length of stay.

- **Methods**: Thirty-six hypotensive patients (mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg) received a fluid challenge with hydroxyethyl starch. Patients were excluded if they had active bleeding and/or required changes in vasoactive agents infusion rate in the previous 30 minutes. Responders were defined by the increase of mean arterial pressure value to over 65 mmHg or by more than 20% with respect to the value recorded before the fluid challenge. Measurements were performed before and at one hour after the end of the fluid challenge.

- **Results**: Twenty-two patients (61%) increased arterial pressure after volume expansion. Baseline heart rate, arterial pressure, central venous pressure, central venous saturation, central venous to arterial PCO2 difference, lactate, urinary output, fractional excretion of sodium, and urinary sodium/potassium ratio were similar between responders and non-responders. Only 7 out of 36 patients had valuable dynamic indices, and they were excluded from further analysis. When the variables were tested as predictors of responders, they showed values of areas under the ROC curve ranging between 0.502 and 0.604.

### Accuracy of stroke volume variation compared with pleth variability index to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients undergoing major surgery [^1131Rcdm]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Accurate assessment of a patient's volume status is an important goal for an anaesthetist. However, most variables assessing fluid responsiveness are either invasive or technically challenging. This study was designed to compare the accuracy of arterial pressure-based stroke volume variation (SVV) and variations in the pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform amplitude as evaluated with the noninvasive calculated pleth variability index (PVI) with central venous pressure to predict the response of stroke volume index (SVI) to volume replacement in patients undergoing major surgery.

- **Methods**: We studied 20 patients scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery. After induction of anaesthesia, all haemodynamic variables were recorded immediately before (T1) and subsequent to volume replacement (T2) by infusion of 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 (7 ml/kg) at a rate of 1 ml/kg/min.

- **Results**: The volume-induced increase in SVI was at least 15% in 15 patients (responders) and less than 15% in five patients (nonresponders). Baseline SVV correlated significantly with changes in SVI (DeltaSVI; r = 0.80; P < 0.001) as did baseline PVI (r = 0.61; P < 0.004), whereas baseline values of central venous pressure showed no correlation to DeltaSVI. There was no significant difference between the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for SVV (0.993) and PVI (0.973). The best threshold values to predict fluid responsiveness were more than 11% for SVV and more than 9.5% for PVI.

- **Conclusion**: Although arterial pressure-derived SVV revealed the benefits of accurate fluid assessment, PVI remains a valuable noninvasive tool for predicting fluid responsiveness.

### Estimating central SBP from the peripheral pulse: Influence of waveform analysis and calibration error [^113XZPka]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the estimation of central SBP (cSBP) by applying a generalized transfer function (GTF) to a peripheral arterial waveform and from the late systolic shoulder (SBP(2)) of such a waveform. It also aimed to assess errors introduced by noninvasive calibration of the waveform.

Methods involved acquiring the digital arterial pulse noninvasively with a servo-controlled finger cuff. A high-fidelity pressure-tipped catheter was placed in the proximal aortic root. Measurements were made at baseline (n = 40), after nitrovasodilation, handgrip exercise (n = 18), and during pacing (n = 10). Estimates of cSBP were obtained using a GTF and from SBP(2) (using an algorithm applied to individual cardiac cycles) of the digital arterial waveform and compared with values measured at the aortic root.

Results indicated that when arterial waveforms were calibrated from aortic intra-arterial mean and DBP, there was close agreement between estimated and measured cSBP: mean difference between estimated and measured cSBP (SD) was 1.0 (5.7) mmHg and -0.7 (5.5) mmHg for GTF and SBP(2), respectively. Noninvasive oscillometric calibration increased variability in the estimation of cSBP [mean difference, 1.3 (11) mmHg for SBP(2)], but estimates of the cSBP to peripheral systolic pressure increment from oscillometric calibration of SBP(2) agreed well with those obtained using invasive calibration [mean difference -2.4 (6.1) mmHg].

In conclusion, SBP(2) potentially provides a simple measure of cSBP and is of comparable accuracy to a GTF. Noninvasive calibration increases variability for both methods but has less effect on the cSBP to peripheral systolic pressure increment.

### Prediction of arterial pressure increase after fluid challenge [^115rHkmy]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

- **Measurements and calculations**: Electrocardiography, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, and pulse oximetry were continuously monitored using the Datex-Engstrom CS/3 Critical Care Monitor (Datex-Engstrom Division, Instrumentarium Corp, Helsinki, Finland). Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and central venous pressure values were sampled every ten seconds, while waveforms of arterial pressure, central venous pressure, and pulse oximetry plethysmography were recorded at a sampling rate of 100 Hz for three minutes immediately before and one hour after the end of the fluid challenge. These data were then converted to ASCII files using Datex-Ohmeda S/5 Collect (Datex-Ohmeda Division, Instrumentarium Corp, Helsinki, Finland).

	- The definitive values of heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and central venous pressure were calculated as the mean of the recorded data, excluding data below the 10th centile or above the 90th centile. Pulse pressure variation and pulse plethysmographic variation were calculated only in patients without arrhythmias and spontaneous respiratory activity, as evaluated by airway and flow waveforms. These calculations were carried out as previously described.

- **Sample collection and analysis**: Samples of arterial blood, central venous blood, and urine were collected simultaneously just before and one hour after the fluid challenge. Central venous saturation, central venous to arterial CO2 partial pressure difference (Δv-aPCO2), arterial blood lactate, plasmatic and urinary creatinine, plasmatic and urinary sodium, urinary potassium, and last hour urinary output were measured and analyzed.

Blood pressure regulation

The main determinant of arterial blood pressure (BP) is the stretch on the walls of the artery by the volume of blood it contains. This pressure increases during systole, due to an increased inflow of blood into the arterial system, and decreases after the peak of ejection, referred to as diastole. These dynamic and cyclical changes in the blood volume entering the aorta are reflected as cyclic changes in the aortic BP waveform. The elastic aortic compliance buffers changes in stroke volume, while autonomic and hormonal influences govern the tone of the muscular peripheral artery, which regulates arterial BP essential for maintaining adequate perfusion to meet metabolic demands.

The relationship between arterial wall compliance and arterial volume is curvilinear, known as the aortic volume–pressure relationship. Due to this curvilinear relationship, the change in arterial pressure associated with the change in volume is greater at a higher initial volume. This means a higher pulse pressure will be produced even with a similar stroke volume if the initial arterial volume is higher. The initial higher volume elicits a greater arterial tone and, therefore, lowers the buffering capacity. Conditions affecting aortic compliance — such as premature or advanced aortic stiffening or reduced aortic compliance related to aging, chronic hypertension, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or heart failure — may blunt the aortic capacity to regulate and maintain an optimal BP and increase BP variability toward unhealthy levels.

### Peripheral venous pressure as a measure of venous compliance during pheochromocytoma resection [^116mnuNe]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Venous pressures measured from peripheral venous catheters (PVP) closely estimate the central venous pressure (CVP) in surgical and critically ill patients. CVP is often used to estimate intravascular volume; however, fluctuations of CVP may also be induced by changes in venous tone caused by alpha-adrenergic catecholamine stimulation. During resection of pheochromocytoma in a 63-year-old woman, we simultaneously monitored PVP, CVP, and mean arterial blood pressure. We found an excellent correlation between the three pressure variables, suggesting that fluctuations of PVP reflect overall changes in vascular tone.

### The predictive value of the Pleth Variability Index on fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing anaesthetized children — a prospective observational study [^1168hYtP]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

Between December 2019 and February 2020, 50 patients were enrolled in this study. Data from ten patients had to be secondarily excluded from analysis; in seven children, the fluid bolus was administered too slowly, two patients received pressure support ventilation, and in one patient, equipment failure resulted in the loss of PVI data. Characteristics of the remaining 40 patients available for data analysis are presented in Table 1.

- **Patient characteristics**: In 17 children, fluid administration resulted in a ≥ 10% increase in SV, and these patients were classified as fluid responsive (FR pos). Twenty-three patients showed an increase of less than 10% in SV after fluid administration, and they were classified as not fluid responsive (FR neg).

- **Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis**: A receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis, investigating the performance of the PVI as a predictor of fluid responsiveness, revealed an area under the ROC curve of 0.781 (95% CI: 0.623 to 0.896, P = 0.0002). More detailed information is given in Table 2 and Figure 1.

- **PVI values comparison**: In group FR pos, PVI values were higher at baseline than after fluid administration (21.4 ± 5.9 vs 15.0 ± 9.4%, 95% CI of difference 1.1% to 11.8%, P = 0.02). In group FR neg, there was no evidence of a difference between PVI values at baseline and after fluid administration.

### Prediction of arterial pressure increase after fluid challenge [^113VTr4c]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg is recommended for critically ill hypotensive patients, as they do not benefit from supranormal cardiac output values. In this study, we investigated if the increase in mean arterial pressure after volume expansion could be predicted by cardiovascular and renal variables. This topic is relevant because unnecessary positive fluid balance increases mortality, organ dysfunction, and Intensive Care Unit length of stay.

- **Methods**: Thirty-six hypotensive patients (mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg) received a fluid challenge with hydroxyethyl starch. Patients were excluded if they had active bleeding and/or required changes in vasoactive agent infusion rates in the previous 30 minutes. Responders were defined by an increase in mean arterial pressure to over 65 mmHg or by more than 20% relative to the value recorded before the fluid challenge. Measurements were performed before and at one hour after the end of the fluid challenge.

- **Results**: Twenty-two patients (61%) increased arterial pressure after volume expansion. Baseline heart rate, arterial pressure, central venous pressure, central venous saturation, central venous to arterial PCO2 difference, lactate levels, urinary output, fractional excretion of sodium, and urinary sodium/potassium ratio were similar between responders and non-responders. Only 7 out of 36 patients had valuable dynamic indices, and they were excluded from analysis. When the variables were tested as predictors of responders, they showed values of areas under the ROC curve ranging between 0.502 and 0.604.

### Pulse volume recording does not enhance segmental pressure readings for peripheral arterial disease stratification [^11322sYN]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Noninvasive vascular laboratory determinations for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) often combine pulse volume recordings (PVRs), segmental pressure readings (SPs), and Doppler waveform traces (DWs) into a single diagnostic report. Our objective was to assess the corresponding diagnostic values for each test when subjected to interpretation by four vascular specialists.

A total of 2,226 noninvasive diagnostic reports were reviewed through our institutional database between January 2009 and December 2011. Data from noninvasive records with corresponding angiograms performed within 3 months led to a cohort of 76 patients (89 limbs) for analysis. Four vascular specialists, blinded to the angiographic results, stratified the noninvasive studies as representative of normal, < 50% "subcritical", or ≥ 50% "critical" stenosis at the upper thigh, lower thigh, popliteal, and calf segments using four randomized noninvasive modalities:

1. PVR alone
2. SP alone
3. SP+DW
4. SP+DW+PVR

The angiographic records were independently graded by another three evaluators and used as a standard to determine the noninvasive diagnostic values and interobserver agreements for each modality. Statistical tests used included the Fleiss-modified kappa analysis, Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance with Dunn's multiple comparison test, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and the unpaired t-test with Welch's correction.

Interobserver variance for all modalities was high, except for SP. When surveying for any stenosis (< 50% and ≥ 50%), sensitivity (range 25–75%) was lower than specific.

### Comparison of arterial pressure and plethysmographic waveform-based dynamic preload variables in assessing fluid responsiveness and dynamic arterial tone in patients undergoing major hepatic resection [^114LCHum]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Dynamic preload variables to predict fluid responsiveness are based either on the arterial pressure waveform (APW) or on the plethysmographic waveform (PW). We compared the ability of APW-based variations in stroke volume (SVV) and pulse pressure (PPV), and of PW-based plethysmographic variability index (PVI), to predict fluid responsiveness and track fluid changes in patients undergoing major hepatic resection. Furthermore, we assessed whether the PPV/SVV ratio, as a measure of dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn), could predict a reduction in norepinephrine requirement after fluid administration.

- **Methods**: Thirty patients received intravenous fluid (15 ml/kg in 30 minutes) after hepatic resection and were considered responders when stroke volume index (SVI) increased ≥ 20% after fluid administration. SVV and SVI were measured by the FloTrac-Vigileo® device, and PVI was measured by the Masimo Radical 7 pulse co-oximeter®.

- **Results**: The areas under a receiver operating characteristic curve for SVV, PPV, and PVI were 0.81, 0.77, and 0.78, respectively. In responders, all dynamic variables, except PVI, decreased after fluid administration. Eadyn predicted a reduced norepinephrine requirement (AUC = 0.81).

- **Conclusions**: In patients undergoing major hepatic resection, both APW- and PW-based dynamic preload variables predict fluid responsiveness (preload) to a similar extent. Most variables (except PVI) also tracked fluid changes. Eadyn, as a measure of arterial elastance (afterload), might be helpful to distinguish the origin of hypotension.

### The predictive value of the pleth variability index on fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing anaesthetized children-a prospective observational study [^117HA62b]. Paediatric Anesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

- **Passive leg raising test and fluid responsiveness**: A passive leg raising (PLR) test can be best described as a reversible pseudo-volume challenge, as venous blood from the lower extremities is translocated to the upper body. Lukito et al. applied a PLR test in pediatric ICU patients using a setting comparable to ours, defining fluid responsiveness as an increase in cardiac output of ≥ 10% following a fluid challenge of 10 mL/kg of NaCl 0.9% administered over 15 minutes. In adult subjects, combining a PLR test and the pleth variability index (PVI) has been shown to improve the validity of the obtained information regarding the prediction of fluid responsiveness under spontaneous breathing conditions.

	- We applied two PLR tests and found significant effects of PLR on PVI, stroke volume (SV), and cardiac index (CI) both before and after fluid administration in the fluid responsive positive (FRpos) patient group, and no effect in the fluid responsive negative (FRneg) group.

	- The following new question arises: If a drop in PVI values during a PLR test is reliably associated with a rise in SV/CI, do we still need the advanced technology of cardiac output monitors to predict fluid responsiveness? This question is of significant practical importance, as many hospitals have the PVI incorporated in their standard monitoring, while very few have noninvasive cardiac output monitors available. PVI changes during a PLR test may be an alternative approach to define a PVI cutoff value indicating fluid responsiveness, not necessarily as an absolute number, but probably as a percentage of change compared to baseline. Large-scale trials would be necessary to answer this question.

### The use of oxygen reserve index in one-lung ventilation and its impact on peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion index, and pleth variability index [^115d2R3F]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

A p-value of less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

- **ORi oxygen reserve index, SpO2 peripheral oxygen saturation, PI perfusion index, PVI pleth variability index**. DLV refers to double-lung ventilation, while OLV denotes one-lung ventilation. DS5 signifies the condition under mechanical ventilation 5 minutes after intubation in the supine position. DL5 indicates mechanical ventilation 5 minutes after positioning in the lateral decubitus position. OLV1 marks the first minute of one-lung ventilation (OLV), followed by OLV2 at the second minute. Subsequent time points include OLV5 at 5 minutes, OLV10 at 10 minutes, OLV15 at 15 minutes, OLV30 at 30 minutes, OLV45 at 45 minutes, OLV60 at 60 minutes, and OLV90 after 90 minutes of OLV.

### Noninvasive assessment of the digital volume pulse. Comparison with the peripheral pressure pulse [^115wyK9A]. Hypertension (2000). Low credibility.

The digital volume pulse can be recorded simply and noninvasively by photoplethysmography. The objective of the present study was to determine whether a generalized transfer function can be used to relate the digital volume pulse to the peripheral pressure pulse and, hence, to determine whether both volume and pressure pulse waveforms are influenced by the same mechanism. The digital volume pulse was recorded by photoplethysmography in 60 subjects (10 women, aged 24 to 80 years), including 20 subjects with previously diagnosed hypertension. Simultaneous recordings of the peripheral radial pulse and digital artery pulse were obtained by applanation tonometry and a servocontrolled pressure cuff (Finapres), respectively. In 20 normotensive subjects, measurements were obtained after the administration of nitroglycerin (NTG, 500 microgram sublingually). Transfer functions obtained by Fourier analysis of the waveforms were similar in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. In normotensive subjects, transfer functions were similar before and after NTG. By use of a single generalized transfer function for all subjects, the radial and digital artery pressure waveforms could be predicted from the volume pulse with an average root mean square error of 4.4 ± 2.0 and 4.3 ± 1.9 mm Hg (mean ± SD) for radial and digital artery waveforms, respectively, similar to the error between the two pressure waveforms (4.4 ± 1.4 mm Hg). The peripheral pressure pulse is related to the digital volume pulse by a transfer function, which is not influenced by effects of hypertension or NTG.

### The use of oxygen reserve index in one-lung ventilation and its impact on peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion index and, pleth variability index [^113zViwS]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

Our goal is to investigate the use of the oxygen reserve index (ORi) to detect hypoxemia and its relation with parameters such as peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion index (PI), and pleth variability index (PVI) during one-lung ventilation (OLV).

- **Methods**: Fifty patients undergoing general anesthesia and OLV for elective thoracic surgeries were enrolled in an observational cohort study in a tertiary care teaching hospital. All patients required OLV following a left-sided double-lumen tube insertion during intubation. The definition of hypoxemia during OLV is a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) value of less than 95% while the inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) is higher than 50% on a pulse oximetry device. ORi, pulse oximetry, PI, and PVI values were measured continuously. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios, and accuracy were calculated for ORi values equal to zero at different time points during surgery to predict hypoxemia. At ClinicalTrials.gov registry, the registration ID is NCT05050552.

- **Results**: Hypoxemia was observed in 19 patients (38%). The accuracy for predicting hypoxemia during anesthesia induction at an ORi value of zero at 5 minutes after intubation in the supine position (DS5) showed a sensitivity of 92.3% (95% CI 84.9–99.6), specificity of 81.1% (95% CI 70.2–91.9), and an accuracy of 84.0% (95% CI 73.8–94.2). For predicting hypoxemia, an ORi of zero shows good sensitivity, specificity, and statistical accuracy values for time points from DS5 until OLV30.

### Nitro-time [^114MHfTy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and the consequent dilation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.

Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates had been absent from the body for several hours was their anti-anginal efficacy restored.

### Arterial versus plethysmographic dynamic indices to test responsiveness for testing fluid administration in hypotensive patients: a clinical trial [^112tFq3m]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

In the present study, we compared indices of respiratory-induced variation obtained from direct arterial blood pressure measurements with analogous indices obtained from the plethysmogram measured by the pulse oximeter to assess the value of these indices for predicting the cardiac output increase in response to a fluid challenge. Thirty-two fluid challenges were performed in 22 hypotensive patients who were also monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter. Hemodynamic and plethysmographic data were collected before and after intravascular volume expansion.

Patients were classified as nonresponders if their cardiac index did not increase by 15% from baseline. Nonresponding patients had both lower arterial pulse variation ([10 ± 4]% vs [19 ± 13]%, P = 0.020) and lower plethysmographic pulse variation ([12 ± 7]% vs [21 ± 14]%, P = 0.034) when compared with responders. Fluid responsiveness was similarly predicted by arterial and plethysmographic pulse variations (area under ROC curve 0.74 vs 0.72, respectively, P = 0.90) and by arterial and plethysmographic systolic variation (area under ROC curve 0.64 vs 0.72, respectively, P = 0.50).

Nonresponders were identified by changes in pulse variation both on arterial and plethysmographic waveform (area under ROC curve 0.80 vs 0.87, respectively, P = 0.40) and by changes in arterial and plethysmographic systolic variations (area under ROC curve 0.84 vs 0.80, respectively, P = 0.76). In the population studied, plethysmographic dynamic indices of respiratory-induced variation were just as useful for predicting fluid responsiveness.

### Pulse oximetry-derived pleth variability index can predict dexmedetomidine-induced changes in blood pressure in spontaneously breathing patients [^112t5Hjg]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

The study investigates how hypertension or hypotension in patients receiving continuous infusions of dexmedetomidine (DEX) often results from changes in vascular resistance due to α2 receptor stimulation. Researchers examined whether baseline perfusion index (PI) and pleth variability index (PVI), derived from pulse oximetry readings, can predict DEX-induced changes in the hemodynamic status of spontaneously breathing patients.

- **Design**: This was an observational study conducted in an operating room setting.

- **Patients**: Patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists performance status of 1 or 2, scheduled for lower extremity or abdominal procedures under regional anesthesia, were included.

- **Interventions**: The PI and PVI were measured upon arrival in the theater and at 2.5-minute intervals thereafter. Intravenous DEX was initiated at a rate of 6 μg kg(-1) h(-1) for 10 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion at 0.6 μg kg(-1) h(-1) upon achieving stable hemodynamic status under spontaneous breathing.

- **Measurements**: Variables measured included blood pressure, heart rate, PI, and PVI. Hypertension was defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 15%, and hypotension as a decrease in SBP < 15% from baseline.

- **Main Results**: Baseline PI and PVI were correlated with the degree of change in SBP. The study found the maximum percentage increase and decrease in SBP from baseline correlated with baseline PI (r = 0.418 [P = 0.005] and r = 0.507 [p < 0.001], respectively) and PVI (r = -0.658 [p < 0.001] and r = -0.438 [P = 0.003], respectively). A PVI < 15 effectively identified DEX-induced hypertension with a sensitivity of 94%.

### Reliability of pleth variability index in predicting preload responsiveness of mechanically ventilated patients under various conditions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Dqpmt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

Goal-directed volume expansion is increasingly used for fluid management in mechanically ventilated patients. The Pleth Variability Index (PVI) has been shown to reliably predict preload responsiveness; however, a lot of research on PVI has been published recently, and an update of the meta-analysis needs to be completed.

- **Methods**: We searched PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science (updated to November 7, 2018) and the associated references. Relevant authors and researchers were contacted for complete data.

- **Results**: Twenty-five studies with 975 mechanically ventilated patients were included in this meta-analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) to predict preload responsiveness was 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79–0.85). The pooled sensitivity was 0.77 (95% CI 0.67–0.85) and the pooled specificity was 0.77 (95% CI 0.71–0.82). The results of the subgroup of patients not undergoing surgery (AUC = 0.86, Youden index = 0.65) and the results of the subgroup of patients in ICU (AUC = 0.89, Youden index = 0.67) were reliable.

- **Conclusion**: The reliability of the PVI is limited, but the PVI can play an important role in bedside monitoring for mechanically ventilated patients who are not undergoing surgery. Patients who are expanded with colloid may be more suitable for PVI.
