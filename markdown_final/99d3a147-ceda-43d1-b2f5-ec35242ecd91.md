## Question

treatment for refractory otitis media

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for refractory otitis media. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entities that constitute "refractory" disease. Then, I should verify the initial management principles and when to escalate. Next, I will examine antibiotic strategies for refractory acute otitis media, including dosing, duration, and sequencing. After that, I need to check the role of tympanocentesis and culture-directed therapy. Then, I will review surgical options for recurrent AOM and for persistent OME, including adenoidectomy and tympanostomy tubes. I should also consider special populations such as eosinophilic otitis media and chronic suppurative otitis media. Finally, I will integrate prevention, follow-up, and documentation requirements to close the loop on care pathways [^115vFj9E] [^111V3q59] [^114r7BTp].

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities encompassed by "refractory otitis media". Refractory disease typically includes persistent acute otitis media despite appropriate initial therapy, recurrent AOM defined as 3 episodes in 6 months or 4 in 12 months with at least 1 in the prior 6 months, persistent OME beyond 3 months with hearing or functional impact, and chronic suppurative otitis media with persistent otorrhea despite maximal conservative care, so I need to ensure I tailor management to each subtype rather than a one-size-fits-all approach [^115vFj9E] [^114KJyqh] [^114VNq7z] [^113A8zCA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the foundational management principles before escalation. For AOM, reassess at 48–72 hours if symptoms fail to improve or worsen, and for OME, observe for 3 months in children not at risk while documenting effusion with pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry and obtaining age-appropriate hearing testing if effusion persists or the child is at risk, because premature escalation can cause harm without benefit [^116ZUjvu] [^113y75pc] [^1142nRLf] [^111V3q59] [^113WF1cB].

> Next, I should review antibiotic strategies for refractory AOM. If amoxicillin was used initially and failed, high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate at 90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component with 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate in two divided doses is recommended; if adherence is uncertain or there was recent amoxicillin exposure, ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IM or IV for 1–3 days is appropriate, and I should double-check that a 3-day ceftriaxone course outperforms 1 day in persistent cases, with clindamycin as an alternative when beta-lactams are contraindicated or unavailable [^114HRxCA] [^115y988r] [^116ujukL].

> Wait, let me verify the role of tympanocentesis and culture-directed therapy. In children with persistent or recurrent AOM after multiple antibiotic courses, tympanocentesis for middle ear fluid culture can guide targeted therapy and is particularly useful when resistance patterns are unpredictable or immunologic factors are suspected, and I should confirm that this aligns with expert recommendations to escalate to culture rather than empirically cycling antibiotics [^114HRxCA] [^111a7pz8].

> I will now examine surgical management for recurrent AOM. Tympanostomy tubes are a reasonable option after 3 episodes in 6 months or 4 in 12 months, with the benefit of reducing recurrence and enabling topical therapy, but I need to balance risks such as anesthesia, otorrhea, tympanic membrane scarring, and chronic perforation, and I should confirm that shared decision-making is emphasized in guidelines [^114KJyqh].

> Let me consider persistent OME next. If effusion persists for 3 months or longer with documented hearing difficulties or functional impact, tympanostomy tube insertion is recommended, and I should confirm that adenoidectomy is generally not indicated for primary OME in children under 4 years unless there is distinct nasal obstruction or chronic adenoiditis, whereas in children aged 4 years and older, adenoidectomy with or without tubes may be considered based on shared decision-making and local expertise [^114r7BTp] [^114VNq7z] [^112EPWma].

> But wait, what if the presentation reflects eosinophilic otitis media rather than typical OME or AOM. EOM is a type 2 inflammatory disease associated with asthma and nasal polyps and is often refractory to steroids and surgery; dupilumab targeting IL-4/IL-13 signaling has emerging case-level evidence of benefit, and I should note that interferon-alpha has limited retrospective data but notable toxicity, so I need to ensure careful selection and monitoring if considering biologics off-label [^112HZ6F7] [^1133xt3M].

> I should confirm the approach to chronic suppurative otitis media when otorrhea persists despite topical and oral antibiotics and aural toilet. In refractory CSOM with mastoid involvement, mastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration using bioactive glass has shown superior dry-ear rates and fewer revisions compared with mastoidectomy alone in retrospective cohorts, but I need to emphasize that this is surgical salvage after maximal conservative therapy and that patient selection and imaging assessment of mastoid disease are critical [^113A8zCA] [^113yg8zP] [^114hBzpi].

> Next, I should review prevention and supportive care because reducing recurrence alters the threshold for escalation. Ensure up-to-date pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, consider influenza vaccination in children with seasonal exacerbations, address modifiable risk factors such as smoke exposure and daycare attendance, and reinforce adherence to therapy and follow-up plans, as these measures reduce recurrence and the need for procedures [^113tSKY3] [^113fCrs2].

> Hold on, I should verify documentation and follow-up requirements to close the loop. For OME, document effusion status with pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry, obtain hearing testing at 3 months if effusion persists or at any time for at-risk children, counsel families on natural history and sequelae, and re-evaluate every 3–6 months until resolution or intervention; for AOM, reassess at 48–72 hours if not improving and record the rationale for any antibiotic changes or procedural decisions to support continuity and quality improvement [^111V3q59] [^113WF1cB] [^116ZUjvu].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated that "systemic antibiotics are ineffective for OME"; I should correct that nuance. While antibiotics can produce a small short-term increase in resolution of effusion, they do not improve hearing outcomes or reduce the need for surgery and carry risks of adverse effects and resistance, so guidelines strongly recommend against routine systemic antibiotics for OME, reserving them for coexisting bacterial infections that warrant treatment on their own merits [^113boyzE] [^111eJxRX].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Start with accurate diagnosis and risk stratification, apply guideline-concordant observation or first-line therapy, reassess strictly at 48–72 hours for AOM or 3 months for OME, escalate antibiotics thoughtfully with culture when indicated, and proceed to tympanostomy tubes or disease-specific surgery for persistent functional impact or refractory disease, integrating prevention and shared decision-making throughout [^115vFj9E] [^1142nRLf] [^114r7BTp].

Refractory otitis media is defined by persistent middle ear effusion or recurrent acute infections despite appropriate therapy [^notfound]. Management centers on **tympanostomy tubes** for persistent effusion or recurrent infections, with **adenoidectomy** for children older than 4 years or when adenoid hypertrophy is present [^112EPWma] [^114VNq7z]. Medical therapy is limited: avoid routine antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines, or decongestants for OME [^111eJxRX] [^113ame9A] [^112EjPNp]; reserve antibiotics for AOM with systemic features or after tympanocentesis if symptoms persist beyond 48–72 hours [^112QStUz] [^114HRxCA]. For refractory CSOM, consider mastoidectomy with bioactive glass obliteration [^114hBzpi] [^113yg8zP]. Address risk factors (smoke exposure, daycare, bottle feeding) and ensure hearing monitoring and speech support [^114G4Uh5] [^112TZrgR].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

Refractory otitis media includes persistent OME (> 3 months) [^114r7BTp], recurrent AOM (≥ 3 episodes in 6 months or ≥ 4 in 12 months) [^114KJyqh], and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) with persistent otorrhea despite medical therapy [^113A8zCA]. These entities can cause **hearing loss**, **speech and language delays**, and **quality-of-life impairment** [^113WF1cB].

---

## Medical management

### Antibiotic therapy

- **First-line therapy**: Amoxicillin remains first-line for AOM [^116ujukL]; use high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day amoxicillin, 6.4 mg/kg/day clavulanate) for refractory cases or beta-lactamase producers [^114HRxCA].

- **Second-line therapy**: Ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg IM/IV) for 1–3 days is an option when oral therapy fails or adherence is uncertain [^115y988r].

- **Tympanocentesis**: Consider for persistent AOM after multiple antibiotics to guide therapy and relieve symptoms [^114HRxCA].

---

### Steroids and other medications

Steroids (intranasal or systemic) are **not recommended** for OME due to limited benefit and potential harms [^113ame9A] [^112EjPNp]. Antihistamines and decongestants are likewise **not recommended** for OME [^111V3q59] [^112EjPNp].

---

## Surgical management

### Tympanostomy tube insertion

- **Indications**: Persistent OME ≥ 3 months with hearing loss or speech/language risk; recurrent AOM (≥ 3 episodes in 6 months or ≥ 4 in 12 months) [^114VNq7z] [^114KJyqh].

- **Benefits**: Improved hearing, reduced effusion duration, fewer AOM episodes, and improved quality of life [^115YsAMz].

- **Risks**: Otorrhea, tympanosclerosis, persistent perforation, and need for repeat procedures [^115YsAMz].

---

### Adenoidectomy

Adenoidectomy is **recommended for children aged ≥ 4 years with persistent OME or recurrent AOM**, especially with adenoid hypertrophy or nasal obstruction [^112EPWma]. It reduces recurrence and improves outcomes when combined with tympanostomy tubes [^115YsAMz].

---

### Mastoidectomy and advanced surgical techniques

For refractory CSOM with mastoid involvement, **mastoidectomy with bioactive glass obliteration** achieves superior dry-ear rates and fewer revisions than mastoidectomy alone [^113yg8zP].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and emerging treatments

Adjunctive options include **topical antibiotics** for otorrhea in tympanostomy tubes or CSOM [^114WLTvd] and **bioactive glass obliteration** for refractory CSOM with mastoid disease [^114hBzpi]. Emerging biologics such as dupilumab show promise for eosinophilic OME but require further study [^112HZ6F7] [^115Qy2MY].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Vaccination**: Pneumococcal and influenza vaccines reduce AOM incidence and recurrence [^113tSKY3].

- **Risk factor modification**: Reduce smoke exposure, limit daycare exposure, and promote breastfeeding [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence, follow-up, and recognition of recurrence [^112nBRd5].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include **regular hearing assessments** and speech-language support as indicated [^113WF1cB] [^114G4Uh5]. Clinicians should document resolution, improved hearing, or improved quality of life to track outcomes [^112zLhzB] [^116dAKSh].

---

Refractory otitis media requires a **stepwise approach**: optimize medical therapy, consider tympanostomy tubes, and use adenoidectomy or mastoid surgery when indicated, with prevention and close follow-up to reduce recurrence and complications.

## References

### Treatment and prevention of otitis media [^113tSKY3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and summarize recent advances in the treatment and prevention of otitis media (OM).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1996-March 2000) was performed to identify relevant primary and review articles. References from these articles were also reviewed if deemed important.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language primary and review articles focusing on the treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) were included. Studies focusing exclusively on OM with effusion or serous OM and chronic suppurative OM were excluded. Information regarding prevention and drug therapy was reviewed, with an emphasis placed on advances made in the last two years.

Data Synthesis

Recently, an expert panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended use of only three of 16 systemic antibiotics approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AOM: amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and ceftriaxone. Controversy exists over the importance of key selection factors used by the expert panel in determining which antibiotics to recommend in a two-step treatment algorithm, that is, in vitro data, pharmacodynamic profiles, and necessity for coverage of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae at all steps of empiric treatment. Additional antibiotic and patient selection factors useful for individualizing therapy include clinical efficacy, adverse effects, frequency and duration of administration, taste, cost, comorbid infections, and ramifications should bacterial resistance develop to the chosen antibiotic. Presumed or past patient/caregiver adherence (especially when antibiotic failure has occurred) is also paramount in selecting antibiotic therapy. A three-step treatment algorithm for refractory AOM that employs amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (depending on the prior dose of and adherence to amoxicillin therapy), and ceftriaxone or tympanocentesis at steps 1, 2, and 3, respectively, appears rational and cost-effective. The recent upsurge in antimicrobial resistance is highlighted, and recommendations are presented for the treatment of AOM and prevention of recurrent otitis media (rAOM).

Conclusions

Amoxicillin remains the antibiotic of choice for initial empiric treatment of AOM, although the traditional dosage should be increased in patients at risk for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. In cases refractory to high-dose amoxicillin, TMP/SMX should be prescribed if adherence to prior therapy seemed good or complete, or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate if adherence was incomplete or questionable. Ceftriaxone should be reserved as third-line treatment. The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae emphasizes the importance of alternative medical approaches for the prevention of OM, as well as judicious antibiotic use in established cases. Removal of modifiable risk factors should be first-line therapy for prevention of rAOM. We support the use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine per guidelines for prevention of rAOM from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with consideration given to influenza vaccine for cases of rAOM that historically worsen during the flu season. Sulfisoxazole prophylaxis should be reserved for children who are immunocompromised, have concurrent disease states exacerbated by AOM, or meet the criteria of rAOM despite conjugate pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Therapy should be intermittent, beginning at the first sign of an upper respiratory infection, and should continue for 10 days. The invasive nature and risks of anesthesia relegate myringotomy, tympanostomy tubes, and adenoidectomy to last-line therapies for rAOM.

OM, though frequent and seemingly simple to evaluate and manage, remains a treatment challenge. Increasingly sophisticated clinical trials assessing OM medical treatment efficacy and outcome have demonstrated that many treatment regimens that were commonly used a decade ago are no longer recommended. Surgical therapy for OM, though remaining the same, has come under intense scrutiny from several angles but still plays a central role for this disease. Given the multiple facets of OM, its frequency, and its potential to cause short- and long-term morbidity in children, the next decade is sure to bring further treatment innovations.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion executive summary (update) [^117Y9bUu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery featuring the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Effusion". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 18 recommendations developed emphasize diagnostic accuracy, identification of children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from otitis media with effusion, and education of clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most otitis media with effusion and the lack of efficacy for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### The challenge of recalcitrant acute otitis media: pathogens, resistance, and treatment strategy [^114TvSg5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Recalcitrant acute otitis media (AOM), including 2 well-defined and sometimes related entities (persistent AOM and recurrent AOM), is a common pediatric problem. Episodes of AOM in children with either persistent or recurrent AOM were shown to be associated with recovery of middle ear fluid bacterial pathogens (particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae) with higher resistance to antibiotics compared with children with AOM not recently treated with antibiotics. The relationships between nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and persistence of middle ear fluid pathogens despite clinical improvement or cure and subsequent recurrence are discussed in depth. The findings emphasize the importance of bacteriologic eradication in the prevention of recurrent AOM episodes.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^114FpdgU]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, more specifically with respect to systemic antibiotics, regimens, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend to administer an antibiotic with additional β-lactamase coverage in patients meeting any of the following criteria:

- receipt of amoxicillin in the last 30 days

- presence of concurrent purulent conjunctivitis

- history of recurrent AOM unresponsive to amoxicillin.

### Ceftriaxone for refractory acute otitis media: impact of a clinical practice guideline [^116ZTG9V]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of a clinical practice guideline (CPG) on the use of ceftriaxone for the treatment of refractory acute otitis media (AOM) at a tertiary care pediatric hospital.

Methods

Charts of all patients aged 3 to 60 months referred from an emergency department to a day treatment center for management of refractory AOM with ceftriaxone were reviewed. Data were collected during two 18-month periods before and after implementation of a CPG developed by a local group of experts. Ceftriaxone was indicated for children with symptomatic AOM despite 48 hours of treatment with high-dosage amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate (> 75 mg/kg per day) or despite receiving 1 of these 2 antibiotics over the previous month. Overall treatment was considered adequate if patients met these indications for ceftriaxone, if at least 3 daily doses had been prescribed, and if all doses were within the 40- to 60-mg/kg range.

Results

Thirty-two emergency physicians referred 127 patients to the day treatment center (60 preimplementation and 67 postimplementation of the CPG). The mean (SD) patient ages were 16.7 (7.4) and 19.7 (12.4) months in the preimplementation and postimplementation groups, respectively. Indications for prescription of ceftriaxone were adequate in 16.7% of the preguideline and 22.4% of the postguideline groups (P = 0.4). Physicians were twice as likely to use ceftriaxone adequately after the guideline's implementation, but this result was not statistically significant (crude odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.5–9.0).

Conclusions

Implementation of a CPG for the treatment of refractory AOM with ceftriaxone did not improve indications for its use.

### Pathogen shifts and changing cure rates for otitis media and tonsillopharyngitis [^113fCrs2]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine use has caused a decrease in the incidence of recurrent and refractory acute otitis media in the United States and a shift in the predominant pathogens. Now Haemophilus influenzae is the most commonly isolated organism (about 60% of the total), and more than half the strains make beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to amoxicillin. Penicillin nonsusceptible pneumococci, the main target of antibiotic therapy in the 1990s, has become a much less common isolate (10%- 25% of the total). These changes impact antibiotic selection for acute otitis media. Penicillin treatment of group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis does not meet the minimum United States Food and Drug Administration standards for first-line treatment, which is 85% or greater eradication at the end of therapy. Recent results with amoxicillin suggest its efficacy is also waning. Cephalosporins have the highest bacteriologic and clinical efficacy. This has implications for optimal antibiotic therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116Pji9w]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) medical therapy — For purposes of counseling parents, the clinician should convey that drugs and medications are not recommended for managing OME. Antihistamines, decongestants, antireflux therapy, and topical nasal steroids are ineffective. Orally administered steroids have short-term efficacy, but after 1 or 2 months the benefit is no longer significant. Antibiotics have a small benefit in resolving OME, but they have significant adverse effects and do not improve HLs or reduce the need for future surgery. Last, despite the popularity of complementary and alternative therapy, there are no RCTs to show benefits in managing OME.

### Bacillus cereus is a key microbial determinant of intractable otitis media with effusion [^1173VjWg]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is characterized by the presence of effusion behind an intact tympanic membrane in the absence of other signs or symptoms of acute inflammation. Spontaneous resolution occurs in 37% of patients within 3 months, with middle ear effusions (MEEs) discharged through the eustachian tube or absorbed on their own. However, in some cases, the condition persists and progresses to intractable OME, which is resistant to conventional treatment. Approximately 5–10% of patients may have symptoms for a year, and 30–40% relapse. Patients with intractable OME receive little benefit from medication or physical therapy, and the illness eventually results in cholesteatoma, adhesive otitis media, and tympanic atelectasis, which can cause severe hearing loss and significantly lower a patient's quality of life. Preventing OME from becoming intractable is a critical clinical issue since managing refractory OME has long been difficult. However, little is known about the processes by which OME worsens and becomes uncontrollable even with therapy. Upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, eustachian tube dysfunction, nasal polyps, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and concealed skull base lesions (both benign and malignant) are all linked to adult OME. It can also occur after radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Infection has received more attention as the cause of OME. Before Senturia et al. found harmful bacteria in 40% of MEE samples in 1958, OME was long thought to be an aseptic inflammatory illness. Numerous investigations have documented the identification of different bacterial infections from MEE in OME patients due to advancements in clinical testing. It has long been unknown what causes inflammation to persist in OME and what part certain bacteria play in this process.

### Mastoid obliteration using S53P4 bioactive glass versus mastoidectomy alone for refractory chronic suppurative otitis media [^114hBzpi]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, within the limitation of our retrospective study, obliteration using BAG results in superior results compared to mastoidectomy alone in cases with refractory CSOM and mastoid involvement. Obliteration with BAG therefore is a relevant treatment strategy for the ENT-surgeon when dealing with difficult and refractory cases of CSOM that are not resolvable using maximal conservative efforts.

### Mastoid obliteration using S53P4 bioactive glass versus mastoidectomy alone for refractory chronic suppurative otitis media [^113A8zCA]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma (CSOM) is a relatively common disease for the ENT-surgeon, with a high incidence depending on the definition used. The WHO defines CSOM as recurrent ear infections originating from the middle ear, presenting as otorrhea and hearing loss and lasting for a period of at least 2 to 6 weeks. General treatment consists of oral or topical antibiotics, water restrictions, and regular cleaning. Routine surgery has no place in the standard treatment of CSOM. However, in cases where symptoms persist despite maximal conservative therapy, that is, refractory CSOM, surgical interventions may be required to alleviate symptoms.

Since 2011, our hospital gradually started to obliterate the mastoid cavity after mastoidectomy in cases of refractory CSOM. The obliterative technique has hence become our standard of care. We use S53P4 bioactive glass (BAG) as material of choice for obliteration. This synthetic material has several important properties, such as in vitro antibacterial properties and unlimited supply, and it holds volume over time.

The main aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of mastoid obliteration using BAG for refractory CSOM and compare the outcomes to mastoidectomy alone. An earlier preliminary study from our hospital showed superior outcomes for mastoid obliteration. However, this study was limited by several factors, such as a cohort of only 23 obliteration cases, relatively short follow-up, and only evaluating otorrhea as outcome In our current study, the cohort is substantially larger, the follow-up period is more extensive, and we evaluate additional outcomes such as revision operations, tympanic membrane perforations, and the need for ventilation tubes.

### Open label, multicenter study of gatifloxacin treatment of recurrent otitis media and acute otitis media treatment failure [^114wb8b8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent otitis media and treatment failures of acute infections are refractory to therapy. Newer fluoroquinolones have excellent activity against respiratory pathogens, but their use in children has been limited because of concerns about adverse effects.

Methods

This was an open label, multicenter trial in which patients with recurrent otitis media or acute otitis media (AOM) treatment failure were treated with 10 mg/kg gatifloxacin oral suspension once daily for 10 days. Before treatment a tympanocentesis or a swab of middle ear fluid was obtained. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained at baseline and at the end of therapy. Efficacy was evaluated 3 to 10 days after cessation of treatment and at 3 to 4 weeks. Safety monitoring included special attention to any sign or symptom suggestive of joint or bone abnormality.

Results

The study enrolled 254 patients 6 months to 7 years of age, with one-half (52%) of the patients having recurrent otitis media, 17% having AOM treatment failure and 28% having both. Cure was achieved posttreatment in 88% of 198 clinically evaluable patients, with similar outcomes for patients younger or older than 2 years of age. Of the 45 evaluable patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 (84%) were cured, including 25 of 28 with penicillin-nonsusceptible strains. Also cured were 89% of those with Haemophilus influenzae and those with Moraxella catarrhalis. No selection of resistance to gatifloxacin was detected among nasopharyngeal pathogens. Eighty-three percent of the children had sustained cure at the 4 weeks follow-up visit. Adverse events were primarily mild gastrointestinal, with no occurrences of arthropathy.

Conclusion

Gatifloxacin is safe and effective for treatment of recurrent otitis media and AOM treatment failure in children.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^113Rhcve]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — guideline scope and target population includes children aged 2 through 12 years and applies to any setting where OME is identified, monitored, or managed; however, it does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years of age. The document does not explicitly discuss indications for tympanostomy tubes, despite OME being the leading indication for tube insertion, because those indications are covered in a companion guideline; instead, surgical discussions focus on adjuvant procedures (eg, adenoidectomy, myringotomy) and sequelae of OME. It also aims to educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME, the lack of clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants), and includes goals for OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^115Ssjx4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion guideline — evidence-based statements and clinical judgment state that guidelines are intended to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, produce optimal health outcomes for patients, and minimize harm; the evidence-based approach requires that evidence be identified, appraised, and summarized with an explicit link between evidence and statements, and statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm. Guidelines are never intended to supplant professional judgment; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than with a recommendation, options offer the most opportunity for practice variability, and Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations.

Recommendation: the quality of evidence is not as high (grade B or C), and Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences and modifying factors. Option: either the quality of evidence is suspect (grade D) or well-done studies (grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage, and Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

Acute otitis media guideline — evidence-based statement definitions and implications set four tiers with specific clinician guidance: For Strong Recommendation, "A strong recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits of the recommended intervention clearly exceed the harms (as a strong recommendation against an action is made when the anticipated harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent", and "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". For Recommendation, "A recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong", with the implication that "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". For Option, "Options define courses that may be taken when either the quality of evidence is suspect or carefully performed studies have shown little clear advantage to 1 approach over another", and "Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role". For No Recommendation, "No recommendation indicates that there is a lack of pertinent published evidence and that the anticipated balance of benefits and harms is presently unclear", and "Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm".

### Treatment of eosinophilic otitis media with pegylated interferon-α 2a and 2b [^1133xt3M]. The Laryngoscope (2017). Low credibility.

Objective/Hypothesis

Eosinophilic otitis media (EOM) is a variant of chronic otitis media that is characterized by the development of thick mucoid middle ear effusion, adult onset bronchial asthma, sinonasal polyposis, and aspirin sensitivity. EOM is typically refractory to corticosteroid therapy and surgical intervention. Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) has effectively treated hypereosinophilic syndrome in clinical trials; however, the efficacy of this medication for EOM treatment remains undefined.

Study Design

Retrospective, case series, tertiary academic center.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on EOM patients from 2008–2014. A total of 32 patients met the clinical criteria for EOM according to established diagnostic guidelines. Outcomes of all patients with severe, refractory EOM who initiated PEG-IFN therapy are reported.

Results

Eight patients were treated with pegylated interferon-α 2a or 2b for refractory EOM. Half of the patients had significant side effects with interferon treatment. Three of these were able to continue at a reduced dosage without side effect reoccurrence, and one patient stopped the medication permanently. Four of eight (50%) patients had a complete clinical response with total resolution of otorrhea and normalization of middle ear mucosa, and were able to discontinue corticosteroid treatment. Two patients attempted to stop PEG-IFN therapy after prolonged symptom remission and had recurrent otorrhea. Both patients had symptom resolution after PEG-IFN reinitiation.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate that pegylated interferon-α 2a and 2b therapy may benefit patients with severe, refractory EOM. Further larger studies with long-term follow-up are required to validate these early but promising results.

### Panel 7: otitis media: treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice. Data Sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). Review Methods All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments. Implications for Practice Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is important to reduce overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and antibiotic resistance. Children at risk for otitis media and its complications deserve special attention.

### Mastoid obliteration using S53P4 bioactive glass versus mastoidectomy alone for refractory chronic suppurative otitis media [^116BnqzK]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this retrospective comparative cohort study, we have presented that the obliteration cohort more frequently had a dry ear at 1 year postoperatively and would not require revision operations of the mastoid, as compared to 12% of the non-obliteration cases. Therefore, our study demonstrates that obliteration has an important role and should be considered if mastoidectomy is performed for CSOM. Among the strengths of this study are the size, the similar preoperative symptoms and indication, as all cases suffered from Merchant grade 2 or 3 for at least 6 months in an attempt to grade the severity of the disease, and the follow-up time.

CSOM can be a challenge for ENT-surgeons. Most patients grow out of it or can be treated using topical or oral antibiotics, but in some cases, the disease will be persistent despite maximal therapy. In such refractory cases, surgical procedures can help alleviate symptoms. However, the role of mastoid surgery in non-cholesteatoma refractory CSOM cases is a topic of debate. Several systematic reviews report no benefit for performing a standard mastoidectomy as addition to a tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media. However, most studies only investigated ears without recent preoperative otorrhea and without assessment of mastoid involvement, which is a vastly different population compared to our study. Also, studies that did include some cases with active CSOM found that discharge was associated with worse outcomes. Additionally, most other studies would define a successful surgery as graft uptake, not a dry ear, therefore limiting comparison. Furthermore, we found that tympanostomy tubes inserted during surgery or unrepaired micro-perforations did not affect the dry ear rate, further emphasizing the limitations of graft uptake as an outcome parameter, as drum status was less relevant in our study. It showed that mastoid obliteration can help control refractory CSOM even when the tympanic membrane is not intact. As also advocated by Rickers et al. once conservative treatment fails surgery may be warranted. Surgery should therefore be considered for these complex and challenging cases, and our opinion is that mastoid obliteration using BAG results in improved outcomes compared to mastoidectomy alone.

### Panel 7: treatment and comparative effectiveness research [^11774gMz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Otitis media (OM) is one of the most common reasons for antibiotic treatment in children. Controversies regarding antibiotic treatment for OM have accumulated in the past decade, and there seem to be more dilemmas than certainties. The objectives of this article are to provide the state-of-the art review on achievements in treatment of all different stages of OM, including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), and chronic suppurative otitis media, and to outline the future research areas.

Data Sources

PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Database, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing).

Review Methods

All types of articles related to OM treatment published in English between January 2007 and June 2011 were identified. A total of 286 articles related to OM treatment were reviewed by the panel members; 114 relevant quality articles were identified and summarized.

Results

New evidence emerged on beneficial results of antibiotic treatment, compared with observation of AOM in young children who were diagnosed based on stringent criteria. In OME, the main results were related to a nonsignificant benefit of adenoidectomy versus tympanostomy tube placement alone in the treatment of chronic OME in younger children. Other modalities of OM treatment were studied and described herein.

Conclusions and Implications For Practice

Significant progress has been made in advancing the knowledge on the treatment of OM. Areas of potential future research have been identified and outlined.

### Complete remission of severe eosinophilic otitis media with dupilumab: a case report [^112HZ6F7]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Eosinophilic otitis media (EOM) is a difficult‐to‐treat otitis media (OM) characterized by eosinophilic accumulation in the middle ear (ME) mucosa and ME effusion with a predominant bilateral prevalence (80%). Diagnostic criteria were set in 2011 and later supplemented with a severity classification (Table I). Alongside bothersome OM symptoms, marked sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) with gradual and/or sudden deterioration can develop, resulting in functional deafness in ~6%. Treatment is notoriously challenging and comprises local instillation and systemic administration of corticosteroids. Surgery is often ineffective.

TABLE I
Diagnostic Criteria of Eosinophilic Otitis Media (EOM).

EOM is strongly associated with asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Recently, biologicals directed against type 2 inflammatory pathway components have been approved for and implemented in the treatment strategies of atopic dermatitis, asthma, and CRSwNP. Here, we report on the successful treatment of an adult patient suffering from intractable EOM with severe mixed hearing loss with the anti‐interleukin (IL)‐4Rα antibody dupilumab, preceded by poor response to (anti‐IL)‐5 antibodies.

### Mastoid obliteration using S53P4 bioactive glass versus mastoidectomy alone for refractory chronic suppurative otitis media [^113yg8zP]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To present the outcomes of mastoid obliteration using S53P4 bioactive glass (BAG) for refractory chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and compare these to mastoidectomy alone.

Study Design

Retrospective comparative cohort study.

Setting

Single-center study.

Patients

All cases that underwent a canal wall up (CWU) mastoidectomy between 2010 and 2022 for refractory CSOM. Inclusion criteria were refractory purulent otorrhea preoperatively as indicated by Merchant grade 2 or 3 despite conservative treatment for at least 6 months, at least 1 year of follow-up and mastoid involvement as indicated by subtotal or total opacification on the preoperative imaging. Patients with cholesteatoma were excluded.

Intervention(s)

Mastoid obliteration using S53P4 BAG.

Main Outcome Measures(s)

Merchant grade 1-year postoperatively, incidence of revision surgery during follow-up, frequency of tympanic membrane perforations, ventilation tube need, and audiological outcomes.

Results

In total, 124 obliteration cases and 84 non-obliteration cases were included. At 1-year postoperatively, the dry ear rate was 116 of 124 (94%) in the obliteration cohort and 71 of 84 (85%) in the non-obliteration cohort (p = 0.02). Continuous discharge (merchant grade 3) was only observed in one non-obliteration case. During follow-up, revision surgery due to refractory otorrhea was necessary in none of the obliteration cases and 10 non-obliteration cases (p < 0.001). The frequency of tympanic membrane perforations, ventilation tube need, and audiological results were comparable between the two groups.

Conclusions

Our study indicates that for refractory cases of CSOM, mastoid obliteration using BAG results in superior outcomes compared to mastoidectomy alone. It results in significantly less postoperative otorrhea and revision operations and should therefore be considered.

Chronic ear disease encompasses a wide range of clinical entities amenable to medical and surgical intervention. The otolaryngologist must always consider the goals of surgery — first and foremost to achieve a safe ear. The least invasive procedure capable of eradicating disease is generally chosen. During surgery, a delicate balance has to exist between the careful preservation of function and the aggressive prevention of potentially recurrent disease. Postoperatively, thorough follow-up and good judgment are paramount in avoiding complications and preventing unnecessary additional surgical procedures.

### Contemporary concepts in management of acute otitis media in children [^116E8E4w]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common disease of childhood. AOM is most appropriately diagnosed by careful otoscopy with an understanding of clinical signs and symptoms. The distinction between AOM and chronic otitis media with effusion should be emphasized. Treatment should include pain management, and initial antibiotic treatment should be given to those most likely to benefit, including young children, children with severe symptoms, and those with otorrhea and/or bilateral AOM. Tympanostomy tube placement may be helpful for those who experience frequent episodes of AOM or fail medical therapy. Recent practice guidelines may assist the clinician with such decisions.

### Surgical treatments for otitis media with effusion: a systematic review [^115YsAMz]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The near universality of otitis media with effusion (OME) in children makes a comparative review of treatment modalities important. This study's objective was to compare the effectiveness of surgical strategies currently used for managing OME.

Methods

We identified 3 recent systematic reviews and searched 4 major electronic databases. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized trials, and cohort studies that compared myringotomy, adenoidectomy, tympanostomy tubes (tubes), and watchful waiting. Using established criteria, pairs of reviewers independently selected, extracted data, rated risk of bias, and graded strength of evidence of relevant studies. We incorporated meta-analyses from the earlier reviews and synthesized additional evidence qualitatively.

Results

We identified 41 unique studies through the earlier reviews and our independent searches. In comparison with watchful waiting or myringotomy (or both), tubes decreased time with OME and improved hearing; no specific tube type was superior. Adenoidectomy alone, as an adjunct to myringotomy, or combined with tubes, reduced OME and improved hearing in comparison with either myringotomy or watchful waiting. Tubes and watchful waiting did not differ in language, cognitive, or academic outcomes. Otorrhea and tympanosclerosis were more common in ears with tubes. Adenoidectomy increased the risk of postsurgical hemorrhage.

Conclusions

Tubes and adenoidectomy reduce time with OME and improve hearing in the short-term. Both treatments have associated harms. Large, well-controlled studies could help resolve the risk-benefit ratio by measuring acute otitis media recurrence, functional outcomes, quality of life, and long-term outcomes. Research is needed to support treatment decisions in subpopulations, particularly in patients with comorbidities.

### Otitis media: beyond the examining room [^112TZrgR]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The management of hearing loss associated with otitis media is multifaceted. Clinical practice guidelines set the collaborative prescriptive standards for the medical management of otitis media in children. Treatment of this condition does not end with the medical practitioner. There are far-reaching effects of otitis media and its sequelae that permeate every aspect of patients' lives including physiological, educational, and psychosocial. Therefore, a comprehensive interprofessional treatment plan must be designed taking into consideration best practices from a range of professions to maximize clinical outcomes, including the treating physician, speech-language pathologist, clinical audiologist, educational audiologist, and professionals in the educational setting.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media: evaluating the evidence [^111MDeQS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common illnesses for which children in the United States receive an antimicrobial agent. Of the six recommendations offered in recent guidelines for treatment of AOM, only one, the assessment and treatment of pain with analgesics, is based on strong evidence. This article reviews the diagnosis of AOM and the accuracy of various signs and symptoms in indicating a bacterial origin, the data on the effect of antimicrobial agents compared with placebo in the treatment of AOM, and the gaps in knowledge that should be addressed by future research and clinical trials.

Antibiotics for OME: A 2012 Cochrane review of 23 studies showed a small benefit for complete resolution of the effusion, but antibiotic therapy did not have any significant impact on hearing levels or the rate of subsequent tympanostomy tube insertion; the authors concluded that antibiotic therapy should not be used to treat OME because small benefits are offset by adverse events, bacterial resistance, and no impact on hearing levels or future surgery, although these findings would not preclude using antibiotics when associated illnesses are present that would benefit from antibiotics, such as acute bacterial sinusitis or group A streptococcal infection.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115y988r]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Initial antibiotic treatment failure in AOM — monitoring and next steps are as follows: When antibiotics are prescribed, clinical improvement should be noted within 48 to 72 hours; during the 24 hours after diagnosis symptoms may worsen slightly, then should begin to improve in the next 24 hours, and if initially febrile, temperature should decline within 48 to 72 hours. If the patient is not improved by 48 to 72 hours, reassess for another disease, concomitant viral infection, or resistance. Evidence on clinical–bacteriologic correlation is mixed, with some studies reporting good correlation ranging from 86% to 91% and others reporting sterile middle ear fluid in 42% to 49% of cases. A change in antibiotic may not be required in some children with mild persistent symptoms; however, in children with persistent, severe symptoms and unimproved otologic findings after initial treatment, the clinician may consider changing the antibiotic. If initially treated with amoxicillin and failed to improve, amoxicillin-clavulanate should be used; patients previously given amoxicillin-clavulanate or oral third-generation cephalosporins may receive intramuscular ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg), and in AOM unresponsive to initial antibiotics, a 3-day course of ceftriaxone has been shown to be better than a 1-day regimen.

### Otitis media in severe asthma associated with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps: a new therapeutic target for biologics [^112qtSwU]. The Journal of Asthma (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNPs) is associated with otitis media with effusion (OME) in about 25% of cases. The objective of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy of the 4 biologic agents currently available in France for severe asthma (omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab and dupilumab) in 17 patients followed for both asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and presenting otitis media with effusion (OME) on otoscopy. Methods: It was a multicenter retrospective study performed in 4 academic ENT and respiratory departments in Paris, France, with assessment of the clinical evolution of 17 patients with severe eosinophilic asthma and with chronic refractory OME and CRSwNPs treated by biologic agents. Global evaluation of treatment effectiveness (GETE) on asthma, CRSwNP and OME was classified on a 5-point scale as 1, excellent; 2, good; 3, moderate; 4, poor; or 5, symptoms worsening. Response was defined as an excellent/good score (1 or 2). Results: 17 patients were prescribed a total of 30 biologics. The evolution of OME did not follow that of asthma and CRSwNPs in 15 (88%) and 12 (70%) cases, respectively. Concerning OME, 19/30 (63%) patients were non-responders. Among the 10 patients who successively received ≥ 2 biologic agents, the OME response differed, depending on the considered agent Dupilumab had the highest response rate. Conclusions: Resistant OME, associated with asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, can present a disconnected evolution under biologics. CRSwNP-associated OME requires a specific evaluation to define the best treatment.

### The variable clinical presentation of tuberculosis otitis media and the importance of early detection [^117VCA16]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is a rare cause of otitis media. This study aims to increase awareness on the clinical presentation of TB otitis media and illustrate how early detection affects treatment outcome.

Methods

Chart review of 12 patients (13 ears) from a tertiary hospital in Manila, Philippines, seen from 2004 to 2009. Clinical predictors of the disease were summarized. Clinical, radiologic, and audiometric outcomes after treatment were compared between treatment groups.

Results

The 5 otoscopic presentations were multiple perforations, single perforation with refractory otorrhea and exuberant granulation tissue formation, single perforation with minimal otorrhea and no granulation tissue formation, intact tympanic membrane with middle ear effusion, and intact tympanic membrane with tumorlike tissue in the middle ear. Clinical predictors of the disease were history of pulmonary TB, work-related contamination of the infection, positive purified protein derivative test, positive chest radiographic finding and intraoperative granulation tissue with cheesy material, and temporal bone computed tomographic scan findings. Patients who had no middle ear surgery showed significantly better clinical, radiologic, and audiometric outcomes than those who were diagnosed late and had more complicated surgical procedure.

Conclusion

The clinical presentation of TB otitis media is variable. Early detection of the early forms entail less surgical intervention and favors better treatment results.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112YAxw6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years old.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

### A sticky situation: case series of successful treatment of glue ear with dupilumab [^115Qy2MY]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To highlight the efficacy of dupilumab in treating chronic otitis media with effusion (glue ear).

Patients

Three patients with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) refractory to medical and surgical treatment were retrospectively identified. All patients had medical history suggestive of the presence of eosinophilic inflammation.

Interventions

Each patient received a 300-mg injection of dupilumab every 4 weeks for a total of three injections.

Main Outcome Measures

Audiometric data, patient-reported incidence of new ear infections, patient-reported symptoms.

Results

All patients reported subjective improvement in ear pain, drainage, and hearing loss between 2 weeks and 6 months on dupilumab therapy. In case 1 and case 2, audiograms showed some improvement in hearing loss posttreatment. Case 2 had an unexpected interruption of treatment for 4 weeks and reported return of thick ear drainage and difficulty with hearing.

Conclusions

Dupilumab may be a novel, effective, and nonsurgical treatment option for patients with chronic otitis media with effusion and underlying atopic conditions.

### Treatment of acute otitis media consensus recommendations [^111a7pz8]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to provide consensus recommendations for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) that pediatricians can incorporate into their daily practices. These recommendations were developed during a roundtable meeting that convened clinicians versed in the management of AOM. This meeting was sponsored by an educational grant from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. In addition, clinical studies on AOM identified via MEDLINE search were considered in the development of these recommendations. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group guidelines for the management of AOM are reviewed in detail. All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. AOM is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting infants and children and one of the leading causes of office visits and antibiotic prescriptions for this population. The incidence of AOM has increased during the past 25 years, probably the result of an increased utilization of day care facilities in the United States. The predominant pathogens in AOM include S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The high prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing organisms presents a clinical challenge for practitioners in the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles should be considered in addition to minimum inhibitory concentrations in selecting antibiotics for AOM. Amoxicillin at conventional or high doses (80–90 mg/kg/day) remains an appropriate choice for first-line therapy for AOM. For patients in whom amoxicillin is unsuccessful, second-line therapy should have demonstrated activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. Appropriate options for second-line therapy include high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day based on the amoxicillin component) and ceftriaxone. Cefuroxime has been suggested as a second-line agent in the past, but recent surveillance data suggest it may no longer be active against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. Tympanocentesis is useful for identifying the causative pathogen, and it may be beneficial for patients who have failed multiple courses of antibiotics. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine recently was approved for use in children and should be administered to all children less than 2 years old and those at risk for recurrent AOM (e.g., day care attendance, siblings with a history of recurrent AOM). Consensus recommendations are provided for the management of AOM, with a focus on antimicrobial therapy. The current challenges in the management of AOM include the need for an increased understanding of epidemiology, increasing resistance among common middle ear pathogens, use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles in designing treatment strategies, and understanding the potential impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

### Otitis media: review of the 2004 treatment guidelines [^114T49UA]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the 2004 treatment guidelines provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) regarding the treatment of otitis media in pediatric patients.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, restricted to English-language articles about pediatric patients, was conducted (1966-May 2005) using the key words acute otitis media (AOM), guideline, observation therapy, and vaccination. Additional references were located through review of the bibliographies of cited articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies related to the fundamental basis of the updated guidelines and articles addressing current issues related to otitis media infection were included.

Data Synthesis

Otitis media affects many children in the US. Concerns have been raised about the proper treatment of AOM in the face of increasing drug resistance among primary pathogens responsible for infection. Some countries have chosen to observe patients for a designated period of time prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. The AAP and AAFP have updated the treatment guidelines for otitis media to include the option of observation therapy, recommendations for dosing of various antibiotic regimens and their place in therapy, and the importance of initial pain management.

Conclusions

Updated treatment guidelines for otitis media have been developed in an effort to properly treat children while decreasing current resistance rates for common organisms that cause AOM. In the future, the therapeutic outcomes of observation therapy related to both the incidence of drug resistance and the possibility of increased complications related to otitis media will need to be evaluated in the US.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115vFj9E]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) guideline — this evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM and focuses on appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM and addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures, and it also addresses recurrent AOM. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships, and the practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance; rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making, not to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children, and these recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to management.

### Mastoid obliteration using S53P4 bioactive glass versus mastoidectomy alone for refractory chronic suppurative otitis media [^117TNt8Z]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient Characteristics

Patients who underwent a canal wall up (CWU) mastoidectomy between 2010 and 2022 for CSOM were investigated. This time frame was chosen as our hospital electronic patient record, from where the data were extracted, was introduced in 2010. Inclusion criteria were minimally 1 year of follow-up and refractory otorrhea preoperatively, defined as a preoperative merchant grade 2 or 3 despite maximal conservative treatment with empirical topical and oral antibiotics and regular aural cleaning for a period of at least 6 months (Table 1). Antibiotics would be rotated if therapy failed to empirically cover all potential pathogens. Removal of occasionally preoperatively inserted tympanostomy tubes, placed due to recurrent purulent otorrhea, was not part of the conservative treatment. Bacterial cultures and immune deficiency assays were used but not routinely and therefore not part of the inclusion criteria. Additionally, if the inclusion criteria as mentioned above were met, we investigated the preoperative imaging of the mastoid. CT imaging is routinely performed in our hospital in cases with persistent otorrhea despite maximal conservative treatment. Only cases with subtotal or total opacification were included; if the mastoid air system was clear, then no mastoidectomy was performed. Opacification by itself, without refractory otorrhea, would not be an indication for mastoidectomy. Both adult and pediatric cases were included. Patients with cholesteatoma or a previous canal wall down (CWD) surgery were excluded. The frequency of non-obliteration operations decreased during the study period, and mastoid obliteration gradually increased. Since 2018, all cases were obliterated. The operations were performed by five otologists; four performed both obliteration and non-obliteration operations, and one only performed non-obliteration operations.

Merchant grading system for otorrhea

Additionally, we also described the indications and outcomes of a small cohort of cases with refractory CSOM in whom a CWD was performed instead of a CWU. In these cases, the posterior wall of the external ear canal (EAC) would be removed for additional oversight in certain specific situations with challenging anatomy and, in obliteration cases, subsequently reconstructed using cartilage.

Acute otitis media (AOM) duration of therapy by age and severity: The optimal duration is uncertain, but for children younger than 2 years and children with severe symptoms, a standard 10-day course is recommended. A 7-day course appears equally effective in children 2 to 5 years of age with mild or moderate AOM, and for children 6 years and older with mild to moderate symptoms, a 5- to 7-day course is adequate treatment.

Otitis media with effusion — at-risk infants and children: At-risk children with OME require more frequent hearing assessment and prompt management to prevent additional impact on developmental outcomes. This category includes children with speech-language or academic delay and those with developmental disability of any cause, especially Down syndrome and other craniofacial anomalies in which OME is very common and persistent. Children in these categories should receive otologic and hearing screening or assessment when speech-language delay is identified to allow prompt treatment for OME, and hearing should be reassessed following medical or surgical treatment, at ongoing intervals (at least annually), or as recommended in relevant clinical practice guidelines.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116SMup9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion — economic burden and medical therapy evidence indicates substantial costs and limited benefits of common medications. Direct costs related to otitis media, which includes OME and acute otitis media (AOM), are S3 billion to S5 billion annually, and studies report that the indirect cost of lost caregiver productivity may far exceed direct medical costs; the estimated net cost of impaired well-being from otitis media is S1.1 billion to S2.6 billion. Regarding medical therapy, antibiotics have short-term efficacy but long-term use cannot be justified because of concerns over adverse events and induced bacterial resistance, the limited evidence regarding antireflux therapy does not show significant benefits, and there are no benefits to routinely treating with antihistamines, decongestants, or steroids (systemic or topical intranasal).

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, more specifically with respect to systemic antibiotics, indications, young children, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend to initiate antibiotic therapy in ≥ 6 months old patients with AOM (bilateral or unilateral) with severe signs or symptoms, including:

- moderate or severe otalgia

- duration of otalgia ≥ 48 hours

- temperature > 39 °C.

Consultation for CRS or RARS — consultation with a specialist should be sought regarding CRS or RARS when (1) there is a need to investigate a possible allergic or immunologic risk factor, (2) disease is refractory to the usual treatment, (3) disease is recurrent, (4) disease is associated with unusual opportunistic infections, or (5) disease significantly affects performance and QOL; consultation also is appropriate when concomitant conditions are present that complicate assessment or treatment, including chronic otitis media, asthma, nasal polyps, recurrent pneumonia, recurrent or chronic bronchitis, severe headaches, immunodeficiency, aspirin sensitivity, allergic fungal disease, granulomas, and multiple antibiotic sensitivities.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis media with effusion (OME) — scope and population defines OME as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection, targets a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed, and does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years old.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — antibiotic benefit magnitude and NNT: To prevent mastoiditis, the number needed to treat is approximately 4800 patients to prevent 1 case of mastoiditis. When otoscopic improvement (resolution of tympanic membrane bulging or intense erythema) is required for success, the NNT is 3 to 4, compared with 8 to 16 for symptom improvement alone, and middle ear effusion may persist for weeks or months and is not a criterion for otoscopic failure.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^116wXkHe]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

The main findings favouring placebo at one and nine months provide evidence that topical intranasal corticosteroids are not likely to be an effective means of treating children with bilateral otitis media with effusion. The study has demonstrated the feasibility of active monitoring in general practice, with particularly high natural resolution rates occurring after as little as one month of follow-up.

Acute otitis media (AOM) management terminology — Key terms are defined for consistent use: "Otitis externa — an infection of the external auditory canal", "Tympanometry — measuring acoustic immittance (transfer of acoustic energy) of the ear as a function of ear canal air pressure", and "Number needed to treat (NNT) — the number of patients who need to be treated to prevent 1 additional bad outcome". Initial antibiotic therapy is defined as "treatment of AOM with antibiotics that are prescribed at the time of diagnosis with the intent of starting antibiotic therapy as soon as possible after the encounter", whereas initial observation is "initial management of AOM limited to symptomatic relief, with commencement of antibiotic therapy only if the child's condition worsens at any time or does not show clinical improvement within 48 to 72 hours of diagnosis; a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and initiation of antibiotics if the child fails observation".

Acute otitis media — systematic review methods and evidence grading report the search, selection, abstraction, and grading processes and counts: "In total, the reviewers examined 7646 titles, of which 686 titles were identified for further review. Of those, 72 articles that met the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed in detail". "Data abstracted included parameters necessary to define study groups, inclusion/exclusion criteria, influencing factors, and outcome measures", with accuracy checks and a "sequential resolution strategy" so that "the screening and review results of the 2 pediatrician reviewers" were matched and resolved. Quality assessment used established tools: "For randomized controlled trials, the Jadad criteria were used", "QUADAS criteria were used to evaluate the studies that pertained to diagnosis", and "GRADE criteria were applied to pooled analyses". For treatment efficacy, "pooled analyses were performed for comparisons for which 3 or more trials could be identified". The literature synthesis was disseminated as "evidence tables" and "published in the final evidence report", and guideline governance is noted: "In June 2009, the AAP convened a new subcommittee to review and revise the May 2004 AOM guideline" comprising "primary care physicians and experts in the fields of pediatrics, family practice, otolaryngology, epidemiology, infectious disease, emergency medicine, and guideline methodology".
