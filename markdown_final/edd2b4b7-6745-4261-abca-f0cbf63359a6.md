## Question

Is there any literature on the use of oral urea in the emergency department for hyponatremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is any literature on the use of oral urea in the emergency department for hyponatremia, and how to interpret the existing evidence for ED practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any studies explicitly studied ED initiation of oral urea. Then, I should verify the care setting and timing of urea use in available cohorts. Next, I will consider whether ED data can be inferred from inpatient, ICU, or outpatient studies. After that, I should review safety and monitoring implications relevant to the ED. Finally, I will align with guideline positions and synthesize practical ED considerations and knowledge gaps that remain.

> Let me first confirm whether any of the identified studies explicitly enrolled ED patients or initiated urea in the ED, because that would be the most direct answer. Wait, let me verify the setting descriptions across the large recent cohorts and reviews. The recent multi-center retrospective studies clearly describe hospitalized patients and do not specify ED initiation, the meta-analyses synthesize inpatient cohorts without isolating ED data, and guideline-focused reviews likewise address inpatient and specialty settings rather than ED-specific protocols, so I do not see any study that prospectively or retrospectively evaluated ED initiation of oral urea as a defined intervention in the ED setting [^115Bozzx] [^114uQn6M].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should check the temporal window of urea's effect and whether that overlaps with ED time frames even if therapy was started on the floor. The largest contemporary cohorts report a mean increase in sodium of about 4.9 mmol/L at 24 hours with a commonly used 30 g/day dose, which suggests that if urea were initiated in the ED, a clinically meaningful early rise could be observed during a typical ED stay, though the studies did not test ED initiation specifically [^114PPF5B] [^114aNjKF] [^112T1rhr].

> I will now examine the care settings represented in the literature to ensure I'm not missing ED-specific data. Most robust data come from general inpatient cohorts and ICU series, with additional reports from oncology inpatients and a small number of outpatient series; critically, none of these isolate ED initiation, so the evidence base is indirect for ED practice [^115Bozzx] [^115grtD5] [^1167DUX8] [^114yEAQA].

> But wait, what if the pathophysiologic mechanism and onset of action make ED use plausible despite the absence of ED-specific trials. Let me think about mechanism and kinetics. Urea increases free water excretion via osmotic diuresis, and clinical series show measurable sodium rises within 24 to 48 hours; in severe cases, ICU protocols using 0.5–1 g/kg/day achieved several mmol/L increases within the first day, which supports biological plausibility for ED initiation if close monitoring is available, though again this is extrapolated from non-ED cohorts [^113awCLX] [^112T1rhr] [^115grtD5].

> Next, I should review safety signals and monitoring requirements, because these dictate feasibility in the ED. Observational cohorts report low overcorrection rates around 3% with urea and no cases of osmotic demyelination, but overcorrection risk rises with lower baseline sodium and concurrent therapies; thus, if used in the ED, sodium should be checked frequently, ideally every 6–8 hours initially, and teams should be prepared to stop urea and, if needed, administer desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to re-lower sodium if limits are exceeded, mirroring inpatient safety practices [^115Bozzx] [^116VvNY1] [^112nVQKK].

> I need to ensure alignment with guideline positions, even though guidelines rarely specify ED workflows. European and international guidance recommend urea as a second-line option for SIADH after fluid restriction, with typical dosing of 0.25–0.5 g/kg/day, and recent expert reviews place urea alongside vaptans as effective second-line therapy, but none provide ED-specific protocols or timing recommendations, reinforcing the evidence gap for ED-first administration [^112MGZPb] [^111k51YW] [^1169CfKA].

> Let me consider practical ED issues that could influence uptake and safety if a clinician contemplated early urea. Taste and tolerability are commonly cited barriers, but flavored liquid formulations and mixing with sweetened beverages improve adherence; cost is low for generic powder, though proprietary flavored products are more expensive; importantly, urea requires reliable follow-up and monitoring that may be easier to ensure with admission or a structured observation protocol rather than discharge from the ED, which argues against routine ED-only initiation without a clear plan [^115tpC1o] [^114BfmKN].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the bottom line. Direct evidence for initiating oral urea in the ED is lacking. The available evidence base is inpatient and ICU focused, with supportive but indirect data on early sodium response that could justify ED initiation in select cases when close monitoring is assured, yet no ED-specific studies, protocols, or outcomes have been published to date [^115Bozzx] [^114PPF5B] [^114aNjKF].

> Finally, I should double-check what we can reasonably conclude for ED practice. Given guideline endorsement of urea as a second-line therapy for SIADH and the observed early sodium rise within 24 hours, it is reasonable to consider oral urea in the ED for SIADH patients who are being admitted or placed in observation, particularly when fluid restriction is impractical or has failed, provided that frequent sodium checks and a plan to prevent or treat overcorrection are in place. However, ED-only initiation with discharge remains unsupported by direct evidence and should be approached cautiously pending ED-specific studies [^112MGZPb] [^112T1rhr] [^111k51YW].

There is **no direct evidence** on the use of oral urea in the emergency department for hyponatremia, as most data come from inpatient or ICU settings [^112ykbco] [^115grtD5]. However, oral urea is effective and safe for SIADH-related hyponatremia [^114PPF5B], with a mean sodium rise of 4.9 mmol/L at 24 hours [^114PPF5B] and low overcorrection risk, making it a reasonable ED option for stable, non-acute cases when fluid restriction is impractical or ineffective [^113tpb9e]. Use is limited by taste intolerance and lack of ED-specific protocols; **monitor sodium closely** and avoid in severe symptomatic hyponatremia, where hypertonic saline is indicated [^1169CfKA].

---

## Evidence supporting oral urea for hyponatremia

### Clinical efficacy

Oral urea increases serum sodium by about 4.9 mmol/L within 24 hours and by about 9.6 mmol/L overall, with larger rises in severe hyponatremia [^114PPF5B] [^114aNjKF]. It is **comparable to fluid restriction and vaptans** and superior to no treatment [^114aNjKF]. In inpatients, 30 g/day for a median of 4 days raised sodium from 127 to 134 mmol/L, normalizing sodium in 47% of episodes [^115Bozzx].

---

### Safety profile

Oral urea has a favorable safety profile, with low overcorrection risk and no reported osmotic demyelination syndrome in pooled analyses [^114aNjKF] [^114PPF5B]. The most common adverse effects are taste intolerance and gastrointestinal upset, leading to discontinuation in about 11% of cases [^115Bozzx].

---

### Guidelines and expert consensus

European guidelines recommend urea as a second-line option for SIADH-related hyponatremia, particularly when fluid restriction fails or is not feasible [^112MGZPb]. Expert reviews also support its use as a **safe, effective, and inexpensive** alternative to vaptans [^113awCLX].

---

## Limitations and considerations for ED use

### Lack of ED-specific evidence

There are **no ED-specific studies** or protocols for oral urea, so its use in the ED is extrapolated from inpatient and ICU data [^notfound].

---

### Practical considerations

- **Palatability**: Poor taste can reduce adherence; mixing with flavored beverages or using commercial formulations may help [^114BfmKN].

- **Monitoring**: Frequent sodium checks are needed to avoid overcorrection, which may be challenging in busy EDs [^111Fe3u4].

- **Patient selection**: Best suited for stable, non-acute SIADH cases; not for severe symptomatic hyponatremia requiring rapid correction [^1169CfKA].

---

## Comparison with other ED therapies

| **Therapy** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Ed feasibility** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hypertonic saline | Rapid correction; first-line for severe symptomatic cases | Risk of overcorrection and ODS | High |
| Fluid restriction | First-line for SIADH; modest efficacy | Safe; low overcorrection risk | Moderate; adherence issues |
| Vaptans | Effective; rapid correction | Risk of overcorrection; liver toxicity | High; expensive |
| Oral urea | Effective; gradual correction | Low overcorrection risk; taste intolerance | Moderate; inexpensive |

---

## Clinical scenarios for oral urea use in the ED

Oral urea may be appropriate in the ED for **SIADH-related hyponatremia** when fluid restriction is impractical or ineffective, such as when patients cannot adhere to fluid limits, when severe antidiuresis limits response to fluid restriction, or when vaptans are contraindicated or unavailable [^111Fe3u4] [^112MGZPb]. It is not appropriate for **severe symptomatic hyponatremia**, which requires hypertonic saline [^1169CfKA].

---

## Monitoring and safety protocols

If oral urea is used in the ED, **monitor sodium every 4–6 hours initially**, then space out as stable; avoid increases > 10 mmol/L in 24 hours or > 8 mmol/L in subsequent 24-hour periods; and be ready to administer desmopressin and hypotonic fluids if overcorrection occurs [^114C7k4P] [^116VvNY1] [^112nVQKK].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Oral urea is effective and safe for SIADH-related hyponatremia, with low overcorrection risk and minimal adverse effects, but **ED-specific evidence is lacking**. It is reasonable to consider oral urea in the ED for stable, non-acute SIADH cases when fluid restriction is impractical or ineffective, with close monitoring and clear stop criteria. For severe symptomatic hyponatremia, hypertonic saline remains first-line [^1169CfKA].

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^113ho7wX]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. Hyponatraemia is present in 15–20% of emergency admissions to hospital and occurs in up to 20% of critically ill patients. Symptomatology may vary from subtle to severe or even life threatening. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. Against this background, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, represented by European Renal Best Practice have developed a Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with SIADH, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider offering either of the following second-line treatments in patients with the SIADH and moderate or profound hyponatremia:

- increasing solute intake with urea (0.25–0.50 g/kg/day)

- a combination of low-dose loop diuretics and oral sodium chloride.

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia: clinical manifestations and pathophysiology [^111oUoRs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia can complicate thiazide use in a minority of susceptible individuals and can result in significant morbidity and even mortality. Risk factors for thiazide-associated hyponatremia include age, female sex, and possibly low body mass. A genetic susceptibility has recently been uncovered. Although frequently developing early after thiazide treatment initiation, many cases of hyponatremia present after months or years of use. Many cases are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, but seizures and/or coma may develop, especially in those with acute onset. The pathophysiology is incompletely understood and includes some combination of excessive fluid intake, cation (sodium and potassium) depletion, osmotic inactivation of sodium, and reduced ability to excrete free water. Reduced distal delivery of filtrate, reduced solute load (urea), direct inhibition of the sodium-chloride cotransporter, and increased collecting duct permeability to water mediated by some combination of antidiuretic hormone, prostaglandins, and thiazides themselves may contribute to this diluting defect. The predominant pathophysiologic mechanism(s) varies from patient to patient. The cornerstone of therapy is cessation of thiazide use, cation repletion, and oral fluid restriction. If severely symptomatic, 3% saline solution may be indicated. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia must be avoided in all cases.

Conclusion and Directions for Future Research

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitals and is associated with short- and long-term morbidity and mortality, though causality remains to be clarified in future trials. SIAD is a frequent cause, but is a diagnosis of exclusion that requires careful workup. Approximately half of patients with SIAD do not respond to first-line therapy with FR. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to definitively guide second-line management of hypotonic hyponatremia, with only tolvaptan and empagliflozin subject to RCTs compared with placebo.

Based on current guidelines, and new information published since, tolvaptan and urea have emerged as the most effective second-line therapies in SIAD if FR fails. There is a need for further research such as RCTs of FR with and without urea (the use of placebo comparison complicated by urea's distinctive taste); tolvaptan vs FR; and comparison of second-line therapy after FR with tolvaptan, urea, or SGLT2is. Trials conducted in inpatients with moderate-severe hyponatremia reflecting real-world clinical care needs are lacking. It is possible that with further evidence, medications such as vaptans or urea may ultimately complement or supersede FR as the first-line treatment for SIAD, where targeted treatment addressing the underlying cause is not effective or if there are clinical or biochemical characteristics to suggest FR is unlikely to succeed.

Tolvaptan, urea, and SGLT2is (as all active hyponatremia treatments) carry a potential risk of sodium overcorrection — likely tolvaptan more so, though direct comparison is lacking. Close monitoring and readiness to administer prophylactic hypotonic fluid and/or DDAVP are key when prescribing medication to raise serum sodium concentration, to ensure optimal patient outcomes.

Areas for future research

Diagnosis

Identify point-of-care markers that can reliably diagnose SIAD and distinguish it from other causes of hyponatremia
Investigate whether subtypes of SIAD predict treatment response to vaptans or other therapeutic options
Identify markers (eg, genetic variation) that make patients more prone to SIAD and/or medication-associated hyponatremia (eg, thiazide induced)
Investigate value of copeptin measurement in the diagnosis of nephrogenic SIAD
Determine the degree to which chronic hyponatremia is a causal mediator of associated adverse clinical outcomes (eg, osteoporosis, fracture, falls, neurocognitive decline, and mortality)

### Oral sodium to preserve renal efficiency in acute heart failure: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study [^113yJcZM]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence for modulating the sodium chloride (NaCl) intake of patients hospitalized with acute heart failure (AHF) is inconclusive. Salt restriction may not benefit; hypertonic saline may aid diuresis.

Objective

To compare the safety and efficacy of oral NaCl during intravenous (IV) diuretic therapy in renal function and weight.

Methods

Seventy hospitalized patients with AHF who were being treated with IV furosemide infusion consented to receive, randomly, 2 grams of oral NaCl or placebo 3 times a day in a double-blind manner during diuresis. Treatment efficacy (bivariate primary endpoints of change in serum creatinine levels and change in weight) was measured at 96 hours, and adverse safety events were tracked for 90 days.

Results

Sixty-five patients (34 NaCl, 31 placebo) were included for analysis after 5 withdrew. A median of 13 grams of NaCl was given compared to placebo. At 96 hours, there was no significant difference between treatment groups with respect to the primary endpoint (P = 0.33); however, the trial was underpowered, and there was greater than expected standard deviation in weight change. The mean change in creatinine levels and weight was 0.15 ± 0.44 mg/dL and 4.6 ± 4.2 kg in the placebo group compared with 0.04 ± 0.40 mg/dL and 4.0 ± 4.3 kg in the NaCl group (P = 0.30 and 0.57, respectively). Across efficacy and safety endpoints, we observed no significant difference between the 2 groups other than changes in serum sodium levels (-2.6 ± 2.7 in the placebo group and -0.3 ± 3.3 mEq/L in the NaCl group; P < 0.001) and in serum blood urea nitrogen levels (11 ± 15 in the placebo group; 3.1 ± 13 mEq/L in the NaCl group; P = 0.025).

Conclusions

In this single-center study, liberal vs restrictive oral sodium chloride intake strategies did not impact the safety and efficacy of intravenous diuretic therapy in patients with AHF. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT04334668.).

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^111kfy7K]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Data collection

Principal data collection items included the following: admitting diagnosis; volume status; time of hospitalization; demographics including age (in years of age, except as > 89 years if ⩾90 years old) gender, and race; severity of the underlying condition using standard measures; etiology for SIADH including tumor, CNS disorder, drug induced, pulmonary disease, other specified cause, idiopathic (cause sought but not found), or unknown; history of prior HN; and acuity of onset of HN, if known. HN-inducing medications, HN treatment medications, diuretics, other medications, vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate at admission or onset of HN and discharge, input and output measurements, daily weights, type and volume of intravenous fluids administered, and FR limits were also recorded. Any isonatric fluid was considered to be NS for purposes of analysis. Serum osmolality, [Na +], blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose values were recorded daily as available, as were urine osmolality and [Na +] and the results of testing performed to elucidate the cause of HN or to assess severity of comorbidities including serum potassium, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, cortisol, albumin, total bilirubin, and uric acid; adrenocorticotropic hormone, B-type natriuretic hormone, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; hematocrit, hemoglobin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio; and urine urea nitrogen. Comorbidity procedures; HN symptoms; conditions developing during hospitalization; intensive care unit, intermediate care unit, and emergency department stay information; treating physician specialty and subspecialist consults for HN were also collected. Race was classified by the investigators (US only) and assessed to see whether race affected treatment or outcome. The following were also collected at discharge: timing of discharge, discharge diagnoses, disposition, discharge location, early termination reason (if applicable), and possibility of earlier discharge.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116NqJCy]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Current international hyponatremia guidelines differ in their recommendations regarding the use of tolvaptan. US expert panel recommendations, while acknowledging insufficient evidence for tolvaptan use with serum sodium less than 120 mmol/L, endorse its use as a second-line treatment, with appropriate monitoring and prompt intervention if the recommended rate of serum sodium increase is exceeded, and even raise the possibility that it may be a potential first-line therapy option in the future. European guidelines, however, recommend against the use of tolvaptan in moderate-profound hyponatremia, primarily out of concern regarding the potential risk of excessively rapid serum sodium correction. Other potential concerns raised about tolvaptan include cost and risk of liver function derangement seen with sustained higher-dose tolvaptan therapy used for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (up to 120 mg daily). A US FDA safety notice was issued in 2013 limiting the use of tolvaptan in hyponatremia to less than 30 days' duration, and removing the indication for patients with cirrhosis. Safe long-term tolvaptan use for up to 4 years has been reported in 111 participants in the SALTWATER trial (the SALT trial extension study), though 1 patient with cirrhosis developed hepatorenal syndrome and died, which was considered "possibly related" to tolvaptan use. So far, there are no reported cases of liver dysfunction directly attributed to the lower doses and typically short durations of tolvaptan in SIAD.

We use tolvaptan as a second-line therapy in selected inpatients and occasional outpatients with SIAD, typically when refractory to FR. Safety information recommends initiation and reinitiation in the hospital to allow monitoring. Careful patient selection is important, plus close monitoring of serum sodium and urine output, readiness to administer IV dextrose if correction targets are exceeded, and daily reevaluation of each dose. Based on existing evidence and clinical experience, we have developed the following recommendations for tolvaptan use (Table 8), which form the basis of an inpatient RCT protocol that is currently underway (ACTRN12619001683123), aiming to provide a prospective evidence base to evaluate these recommendations. We use tolvaptan less frequently in outpatients because of the product information recommending against long-term use, high cost, and limited monitoring capacity — in this situation we prefer oral urea.

### Biochemical and etiological characteristics of acute hyponatremia in the emergency department [^112BuaCU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia can be classified as acute or chronic depending on its duration, and treatment options are tailored to this classification. However, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate acute from chronic hyponatremia in the Emergency Department (ED). The objective of this study was to identify characteristics to help diagnose and manage acute hyponatremia in the ED. Patients with acute hyponatremia in the ED were enrolled from a retrospective 2-year chart review. Eleven patients (0.8%) were identified with acute hyponatremia out of a total of 1321 hyponatremic patients. There were nine women and two men. The mean age was 48.9 years. The mean sodium (Na(+)) level was 115 ± 4 mmol/L. Accompanying biochemical abnormalities included hypouricemia and hypouremia with increased fractional excretions of uric acid (UA) and urea. The estimated amount of water intake ranged from 2.5 to 10 liters (mean, 5.1 ± 2.3 liters) during the day before ED presentation. All patients were treated with hypertonic saline and furosemide at a correction rate of 1.6 ± 0.5 mmol/L/h. No patients had neurological sequelae after treatment. The causes of acute hyponatremia included induction of abortion with oxytocin (n = 1), primary polydipsia on neuroleptic agents (n = 2), polyethylene glycol (PEG) preparation for colonoscopy (n = 1), diuretic therapy for hypertension (n = 4), ecstasy use (n = 1), and weight-reducing herbal teas (n = 2). We conclude that in the right clinical setting, high free water intake and low serum urea and UA favor acute hyponatremia. A detailed drug history may be helpful in the differential diagnosis of acute hyponatremia.

### Overcorrection of hyponatremia is a medical emergency [^112nVQKK]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Overcorrection of hyponatremia is a medical emergency. Excessive correction usually results from the unexpected emergence of a water diuresis after resolution of the cause of water retention. The concurrent administration of desmopressin and 5% dextrose in water can be given to cautiously re-lower the serum sodium concentration when therapeutic limits have been exceeded. Nephrologists should be equally aggressive in correcting hyponatremia and in un-correcting it when their patients get too much of a good thing.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients (inadequate response to initial management), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to discontinue IV infusion of 3% hypertonic saline when symptoms improve, the serum sodium concentration increases by ≥ 10 mmol/L in total, or the serum sodium concentration reaches 130 mmol/L, whichever occurs first.

### Evaluation and management of dehydration in children [^117E2Vwv]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The article discusses the evaluation of dehydration in children and reviews the literature on physical findings of dehydration. Pediatric dehydration is a common problem in emergency departments and wide practice variation in treatment exists. Dehydration can be treated with oral, nasogastric, subcutaneous, or intravenous fluids. Although oral rehydration is underutilized in the United States, most children with dehydration can be successfully rehydrated via the oral route. Selection of oral rehydration solution and techniques for successful oral rehydration are presented. Appropriate selection and rate of administration of intravenous fluids are also discussed for isonatremic, hyponatremic, and hypernatremic dehydration.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^112sQu88]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral urea is being used more commonly to treat hyponatremia, but factors contributing to the correction rate are unknown. We hypothesized that clinically relevant factors can be identified to help guide hyponatremia correction with oral urea.

Methods

This was a retrospective study in two university hospitals including hospitalized patients with hyponatremia (plasma sodium < 135 mmol/L) treated with oral urea. Linear mixed-effects models were used to identify factors associated with hyponatremia correction. Rates of overcorrection, osmotic demyelination and treatment discontinuation were also assessed.

Results

We included 161 urea treatment episodes in 140 patients (median age 69 years, 46% females, 93% syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis). Oral urea succeeded fluid restriction in 117 treatment episodes (73%), was combined with fluid restriction in 104 treatment episodes (65%) and was given as the only treatment in 27 treatment episodes (17%). A median dose of 30 g/day of urea for 4 days (interquartile range 2–7 days) increased plasma sodium from 127 to 134 mmol/L and normalized hyponatremia in 47% of treatment episodes. Older age (β 0.09, 95% CI 0.02–0.16), lower baseline plasma sodium (β -0.65, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.62) and higher cumulative urea dose (β 0.03, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.03) were independently associated with a greater rise in plasma sodium. Concurrent fluid restriction was associated with a greater rise in plasma sodium only during the first 48 h of treatment (β 1.81, 95% CI 0.40–3.08). Overcorrection occurred in 5 cases (3%), no cases of osmotic demyelination were identified and oral urea was discontinued in 11 cases (11%) due to side effects.

Conclusion

During treatment with oral urea, older age, higher cumulative dose, lower baseline plasma sodium and initial fluid restriction are associated with a greater correction rate of hyponatremia. These factors may guide clinicians to achieve a gradual correction of hyponatremia with oral urea.

ABSTRACT

Background

Oral urea is being used more commonly to treat hyponatremia, but factors contributing to the correction rate are unknown. We hypothesized that clinically relevant factors can be identified to help guide hyponatremia correction with oral urea.

Methods

This was a retrospective study in two university hospitals including hospitalized patients with hyponatremia (plasma sodium < 135 mmol/L) treated with oral urea. Linear mixed-effects models were used to identify factors associated with hyponatremia correction. Rates of overcorrection, osmotic demyelination and treatment discontinuation were also assessed.

Results

We included 161 urea treatment episodes in 140 patients (median age 69 years, 46% females, 93% syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis). Oral urea succeeded fluid restriction in 117 treatment episodes (73%), was combined with fluid restriction in 104 treatment episodes (65%) and was given as the only treatment in 27 treatment episodes (17%). A median dose of 30 g/day of urea for 4 days (interquartile range 2–7 days) increased plasma sodium from 127 to 134 mmol/L and normalized hyponatremia in 47% of treatment episodes. Older age (β 0.09, 95% CI 0.02–0.16), lower baseline plasma sodium (β –0.65, 95% CI –0.78 to –0.62) and higher cumulative urea dose (β 0.03, 95% CI –0.02 to –0.03) were independently associated with a greater rise in plasma sodium. Concurrent fluid restriction was associated with a greater rise in plasma sodium only during the first 48 h of treatment (β 1.81, 95% CI 0.40–3.08). Overcorrection occurred in 5 cases (3%), no cases of osmotic demyelination were identified and oral urea was discontinued in 11 cases (11%) due to side effects.

Conclusion

During treatment with oral urea, older age, higher cumulative dose, lower baseline plasma sodium and initial fluid restriction are associated with a greater correction rate of hyponatremia. These factors may guide clinicians to achieve a gradual correction of hyponatremia with oral urea.

Study objective and definitions

Our main objective was to identify patient and treatment-related factors associated with a rise in plasma sodium during treatment with oral urea. All treatments that were given alongside oral urea and may have influenced plasma sodium were recorded, including fluid restriction, isotonic intravenous fluids, hypertonic saline, sodium chloride tablets, potassium chloride supplementation, glucocorticoids, loop diuretics and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. We defined treatments that were prescribed because of hyponatremia as "concurrent treatments", and those that were not prescribed because of the hyponatremia but still could have influenced the course of plasma sodium as "co-medication". Fluid restriction was defined as ≤ 1 L/day. Safety was assessed by determining the incidence of overcorrection and ODS. Overcorrection was defined as increase in plasma sodium > 10 mmol/L in 24 h or > 18 mmol/L in 48 h. ODS was defined as the development of neurological symptoms after overcorrection or radiological confirmation by magnetic resonance imaging. Tolerability was assessed by determining the number of side effects as documented in patient charts and whether they resulted in discontinuation of oral urea.

### Urea to treat hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114aNjKF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

The use of urea to treat hyponatremia related to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) has not been universally adopted due to questions about effectiveness, safety, and tolerability. This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies addresses these questions.

Study Design

This PRISMA-guided study examined published research across 4 electronic databases.

Study Populations

Patients with SIADH-related hyponatremia.

Selection Criteria

Clinical trials and observational studies reporting at least 1 outcome related to serum sodium concentration, symptom resolution, or adverse effects after oral or nasogastric urea administration.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed independently by 2 reviewers using a standardized form recording study characteristics, participant demographics, intervention details, and treatment outcomes.

Analytical Approach

A meta-analysis was conducted using the restricted maximum likelihood method for the random effects model to assess the effect of urea treatment on serum sodium and serum urea compared with other treatment modalities. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on treatment duration and SIADH severity.

Results

Urea treatment significantly increased serum sodium (mean difference [MD], 9.08 [95% CI, 7.64–10.52], P < 0.01) and urea (MD, 31.66 [95% CI, 16.05–47.26], P < 0.01) in patients with SIADH, albeit with significantly high heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis based on the treatment duration showed a significant rise in the serum sodium level after 24 hours and 2, 5, 7, and 14 days, as well as after 1 year of treatment. Greater increases in serum sodium levels after treatment with urea occurred in patients with severe (< 120 mEq/L) (MD, 18.04 [95% CI, 13.68–22.39]) than with moderate (120–129 mEq/L) (MD, 7.86 [95% CI, 6.78–8.94]) or mild (130–135 mEq/L) (MD, 8.00 [95% CI, 7.31–8.69]) SIADH-induced hyponatremia. Urea treatment was comparable to fluid restriction (MD, 0.81 [95% CI, -0.93 to 2.55], P = 0.4) and vaptans (MD, -1.96 [95% CI, -4.59 to 0.66], P = 0.1) but superior to no treatment (MD, 7.99 [95% CI, 6.25–9.72], P < 0.01). Urea was associated with minor adverse events, with poor palatability being the most common.

Limitations

As no randomized controlled trials investigating urea as a treatment for hyponatremia were identified for inclusion, these analyses were based on observational studies.

Conclusions

Urea is safe and effective for managing SIADH-induced hyponatremia. These finding suggest that urea may be a useful treatment modality in resource-limited settings or when other treatments are contraindicated or poorly tolerated.

### A systematic review of known interventions for the treatment of chronic nonhypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia and a meta-analysis of the vaptans [^113UpjhP]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

International and national guidelines on the treatment of chronic nonhypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia differ; therefore, we have undertaken this systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of interventions for the treatment of chronic nonhypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia. Following registration of the review protocol with PROSPERO, systematic literature searches were conducted to identify randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials assessing any degree of fluid restriction or any drug treatment with the aim of increasing serum sodium concentration in patients with chronic nonhypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia. Where appropriate, outcome data were synthesized in a meta-analysis. A total of 45 716 bibliographic records were identified from the searches and 18 trials (assessing conivaptan, lixivaptan, tolvaptan and satavaptan) met the eligibility criteria. Results suggest that all four vasopressin receptor agonists ("vaptans") significantly improve serum sodium concentration. Lixivaptan, satavaptan and tolvaptan were associated with greater rates of response versus placebo. There was no evidence of a difference between each of the vaptans compared with placebo for mortality, discontinuation and rates of hypernatraemia. No RCT evidence of treatments other than the vaptans for hyponatraemia such as oral urea, salt tablets, mannitol, loop diuretics demeclocycline or lithium was identified. Vaptans demonstrated superiority over placebo for outcomes relating to serum sodium correction. Few trials documented the potential benefit of vaptans on change in health-related quality of life as a result of treatment. There was also a lack of high-quality RCT evidence on the comparative efficacy of the vaptans and other treatment strategies for the treatment of chronic nonhypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia.

### Treatment of the polydipsia-hyponatremia syndrome with urea [^113Muwct]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The polydipsiahyponatremia syndrome is difficult to control in patients with severe mental illness, and there is no established effective therapeutic approach. We investigate the effect of oral daily intake of large amounts of urea to prevent hyponatremic episodes.

Method

Seven patients were treated during 4 to 18 months with urea (0.3–0.9 g/kg/day). Five of these patients had schizophrenia. Body weight variation between morning and evening was determined before and during the course of therapy in 5 patients. The dose of urea was increased if morning serum sodium level (SNa) was lower than 132 mmol/L.

Results

Urea therapy increased mean ± SD morning SNa (from 127.5 ± 3.4 mmol/L before initiation of urea treatment to 136.5 ± 2.4 mmol/L during the second month of urea treatment; p < .01) and mean ± SD urine osmolality (from 86 ± 39 mOsm/kg H(2)O to 159 ± 58 mOsm/kg H(2)O; p < .05), probably without changes in water intake or urine volume excretion as attested by the level of urinary creatinine concentration. Mean ± SD body weight variation decreased from 4.5% ± 1.0% before initiation of urea treatment to 2.8% ± 1.0% during the second month of urea treatment (p < .05). Two patients stopped urea treatment after 1 year and subsequently developed symptomatic hyponatremia.

Conclusion

These preliminary data show that urea appears to be an effective therapeutic approach for the polydipsiahyponatremia syndrome.

### Treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in the intensive care unit by urea [^111RLE29]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the intensive care unit, hyponatremia occurs frequently and is associated with an increased mortality. It is mostly related to the presence of inappropriate antidiuresis due to an excess of ADH. Management of this condition usually implies water restriction. This is of poor applicability in patients requiring multiple intravenous medications and/or nutritional support. Recently a new class of drugs antagonizing the V2 receptor (V2RA) has been developed: the vaptans.

Two of them are already available on the market: Conivaptan for the intravenous route and Tolvaptan for the oral route. The present data recall that urea is an effective and easy therapeutic choice to correct hyponatremia related to SIADH with special attention for patients in the intensive care unit. The main criticism to the use of urea orally is its taste; this is not a problem in the intensive care unit as it is usually administered by gastric tube or intravenously. No prospective data comparing V2 antagonists to urea are available. We present a large retrospective series of patients with moderate or severe hyponatremia treated with urea and shows that its use is a easy, save and inexpensive treatment.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^1116ARCm]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The HN Registry has a number of limitations, most of which derive from its observational design. Patients with hypovolemic HN were excluded, as were those with hypervolemic HN in the EU cohort. A large number of patients were excluded at the time of adjudication. Sensitivity analysis showed no difference in the major outcomes when patients with suspected hypovolemia were restored to the analysis. We believe that the exclusion of these patients represents a conservative approach. Ascertainment varied from center to center; enrollment of consecutive cases was not required. Consequently, the study provides no information about relative prevalence of different etiologies of HN. Accurate determination of clinical volume status is difficult under the best of circumstances. The selection of diagnostic studies and treatments was left up to the clinicians responsible for patients, and the study relied on treating clinicians to make a diagnosis. Neither a fluid challenge nor a urine sodium determination was required as an entry criterion for putatively euvolemic patients. This limited our ability to exclude hypovolemia and independently confirm the presence of SIADH with precision. Because the study's intent was to capture 'real-world' practice, this limitation did not detract from observing how clinician-diagnosed SIADH is treated. Indeed, a principal conclusion is that diagnostic rigor in the case of SIADH is severely lacking, even in a study situation where some treating physicians were aware that their diagnostic choices were being observed. Some therapies were used too infrequently to assess. For example, urea, a treatment shown to be effective in SIADH, and recommended in recent EU guidelines, was used in only 10 patients. Because of the large number of combinations used at low frequency, analysis focused on monotherapy and initial therapy episodes. The study did not specify, much less randomize, treatment choices. We were unable to determine the rationale for choosing a particular treatment. In particular, we could not determine how often NS was used initially in a diagnostic trial to exclude volume depletion in patients suspected of SIADH, a reasonable strategy for its use. Choice of treatments was likely confounded by indication, and the study cannot accurately assess whether any particular treatment shortened hospital stay. We were not able to fully assess how maneuvers such as discontinuation of a HN-inducing medication or treatment of CHF affected [Na +] changes or the decision to add another treatment maneuver. As a result, even the limited comparisons showing superiority or inferiority of particular treatments that were feasible must be interpreted with much circumspection.

### The management of children with gastroenteritis and dehydration in the emergency department [^117B7Nr4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute gastroenteritis is characterized by diarrhea, which may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain.

Objective

To review the evidence on the assessment of dehydration, methods of rehydration, and the utility of antiemetics in the child presenting with acute gastroenteritis.

Discussion

The evidence suggests that the three most useful predictors of 5% or more dehydration are abnormal capillary refill, abnormal skin turgor, and abnormal respiratory pattern. Studies are conflicting on whether blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or BUN/creatinine ratio correlates with dehydration, but several studies found that low serum bicarbonate combined with certain clinical parameters predicts dehydration. In most studies, oral or nasogastric rehydration with an oral rehydration solution was equally efficacious as intravenous (i.v.) rehydration. Many experts discourage the routine use of antiemetics in young children. However, children receiving ondensetron are less likely to vomit, have greater oral intake, and are less likely to be treated by intravenous rehydration. Mean length of Emergency Department (ED) stay is also less, and very few serious side effects have been reported.

Conclusions

In the ED, dehydration is evaluated by synthesizing the historical and physical examination, and obtaining laboratory data points in select patients. No single laboratory value has been found to be accurate in predicting the degree of dehydration and this is not routinely recommended. The evidence suggests that the majority of children with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated successfully with oral rehydration therapy. Ondansetron (orally or intravenously) may be effective in decreasing the rate of vomiting, improving the success rate of oral hydration, preventing the need for i.v. hydration, and preventing the need for hospital admission in those receiving i.v. hydration.

### Use of urea for the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone: a systematic review [^117Vqf7e]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

We included full-length manuscripts, research letters and brief reports, and abstracts and conference proceedings in English, French, or German in which treatment options studied included oral urea. The patient cohort or subgroup had to consist of only (or had to be close to 100%) patients with hyponatremia and a presumed etiology of SIADH. Any or no comparator were acceptable. End points had to include 1 or more of the following: plasma or serum sodium level; ODS; and resource use, eg, length of stay or costs (or components of either). Identified reviews of urea treatment for hyponatremia were searched for references of original studies. We operationalized the following exclusion criteria for the counts in the PRISMA chart with the short descriptor mentioned in bracket: a manuscript in a language other than English, French, or German ("wrong language"); one of the treatments did not consist of only (or close to 100%) patients with hyponatremia with a presumed etiology of SIADH ("wrong treatment"); a patient cohort or subgroup that did not consist of only (or close to 100%) patients with hyponatremia who had a presumed etiology of SIADH ("wrong patients"); and/or none of the end points match our designated end point ("wrong outcomes").

Data Analysis

We extracted characteristics about the studies — such as study type — as well as about the setting, the patient population, the urea dose (as well as comparator treatments, if applicable), baseline sodium and sodium levels after treatment, as well as resources used, such as length of hospital stay, and treatment length. We arbitrarily defined long-term treatment as mean treatment time measured by months. In terms of quantitative synthesis, we attempted a random-effects meta-analysis. However, since there was no one or more uniform treatment available as control group (most studies were uncontrolled), we decided to pool the effects of urea and other treatments, as available, on the sodium level, weighted by sample sizes of the studies. We also calculated the sample size of a potential prospective study that would compare urea with VRAs as well as another one comparing with fluid restriction, assuming a 2-sided α-level of.05 and a power of 80%. Analyses were performed in Excel (Microsoft Corporation) and STATA/SE version 17.0 (Stata Corp).

(c) Evolution of SNa (mean ± SD) each four hours in 10 patients with severe hyponatremia treated with 1 L isotonic saline over 12 hr and urea (0.5 g/kg) (P < 0.01 compared to time 0).

In 12 of these patients urea was added 24 hr after 1 or 2 L isotonic saline (Figure 2b).

In 10 patients, SNa and S urea were measured before and every 4 hr after urea (0.5 g/kg/12h) administration combined with perfusion of 1 L isotonic saline each 12 hr (Figure 2c).

In all the patients SNa was measured at least two times (a few hours to 24 hrs before urea therapy).

For Studies I and II, an ethical approval was obtained. Data are provided as mean ± SD, we use the one-way analysis of variance and the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test.

### Effect of oral urea ingestion on growth hormone levels in healthy adults-a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial [^1161KwKF]. Pituitary (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diagnosing growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is important, as treatment improves quality of life, body composition and exercise capacity. The diagnosis of GHD in adults relies on measurement of stimulated GH. Established stimulation tests are the insulin tolerance test (ITT), GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) - arginine test, glucagon stimulation test and Macimorelin. The ITT, GHRH-arginine, and glucagon test require the injection or infusion of the stimulating agent, and may therefore be burdensome for patients. Macimorelin, the sole oral option, is costly and unavailable in several countries, making other oral options for GH stimulation highly desirable.

Plasma urea, the end product of protein metabolism rises with increased protein degradation. GH promotes protein synthesis and lowers plasma urea by reducing urea production. High levels of plasma urea might therefore stimulate GH secretion. The stimulatory effect of arginine, a key component of the urea cycle, on GH further supports this hypothesis.

Urea may be administered orally – dissolved in a beverage – and is currently used to treat hyponatremia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. The use of urea is cost-effective and safe.

In this analysis, we investigated the potential of urea as an alternative stimulation test for GHD by assessing the effect of oral urea on GH secretion in healthy adults.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^117RWnJQ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prevention and hydration guidance — Preventing EAH is the key factor in protecting participants in endurance events and other wilderness recreation activities. Currently, there is no single hydration recommendation that fits all individuals for fluid and salt consumption during all exercise scenarios. We recommend for the majority of participants a hydration strategy that relies on their innate thirst mechanism. Thirst is triggered by changes in serum osmolality and should prevent severe dehydration while minimizing the risk for overhydration and hyponatremia (especially if ADH is present). We recognize that there are situations in which body fluid losses may be excessive and rapid; in these circumstances, thirst may not keep up with body fluid losses, and other hydration strategies may be needed, and in these situations, participants should consider increasing their fluid intake to account for these excessive losses. The typical field response is to encourage oral hypotonic fluid intake or administer rapid isotonic IV fluids to endurance activity participants with the suspicion that they are dehydrated; however, such universal treatment may result in increased morbidity and mortality in the EAH patient.

### Investigation and management of moderate to severe inpatient hyponatraemia in an Australian tertiary hospital [^111Ti2tL]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Second line treatments were only used in a small proportion of patients. Of the patients who received urea there was a substantial increase in serum Na levels over the following 72 h, noting that this group had either already failed fluid restriction or were unable to be fluid restricted. Adverse effects, while common, were mild and easily tolerable. These pilot data resulted in a change of practice at our institution, such that urea is now routinely used in patients with SIADH who do not respond to fluid restriction within 24–48 h.

Previous research which supports the use of urea for the management of SIADH includes a retrospective analysis of 42 patients who were admitted to the Intensive care unit. Patients were treated with a standardised protocol which implemented urea after clinical deterioration (measured as drop in GCS by 2 points) or serum Na < 130 mmol/L despite 0.9% saline. Hyponatraemia was corrected in all patients and was well tolerated with no adverse effects. Similar data were obtained by Decaux et al. who compared 50 patients with mild hyponatraemia to 35 patients with severe hyponatraemia treated with urea. All the patients in the mild and severe group achieved resolution of hyponatraemia, however 6 patients in the mild group developed hypernatraemia without any associated adverse outcomes. The only prospective data to date compared 1 year of treatment with a vaptan followed by 1 year of treatment with urea in 13 patients. In this cohort, urea was shown to have the same efficacy as vaptans.

Hypovolaemic patients treated with 0.9% saline demonstrated a significant increase in serum Na, suggesting that treatment of non-renal salt wasting is less refractory than SIADH. Hypertonic (3%) saline was utilized in cases of severe symptomatic hyponatraemia using varying volumes and over different time periods. There was a significant increase in serum Na using this mode of treatment, however the time frame in which this occurred varied between patients. Frequent monitoring of serum Na is necessary to prevent over correction.

While acknowledging the limitations of the retrospective design, this is the first Australian study to examine the investigation and management of moderate to severe inpatient hyponatraemia in detail, including the efficacy of fluid restriction and in particular the use of second line treatments. The data have been analysed according to documentation by the treating team, as well as reanalysed by the investigators. It is possible that volume status and diagnosis were discussed but not recorded in patients' notes, however laboratory data has been captured for all analysed patients.

### Treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in the intensive care unit by urea [^115PmBHv]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Urea in large doses (1 g/kg), when administered rapidly by gastric tube in a matter of minutes, has a purgative effect which creates troublesome nursing problems in the comatose patients. This effect could be avoided by administering the urea over a long period of time, or by fractioning the dose. In our study, this was never a problem; no tracheal aspiration was reported, but we avoided giving urea rapidly in large amounts. We also administered urea continuously (for example in the liquid nutritional support) in patients with brain haemorrhage, to avoid any brain shrinkage. As previously mentioned, urea was not used to treat brain oedema in this study (although this could represent a good indication, particularly if the intravenous route is used). We can expect that acute administration of urea at 0.5 gr/kgBW intravenously over one hour or orally will rapidly (one hour) increase serum osmolality by 15 mOsm/kg/H 2 O during a few hours (renal elimination).

These data report the use of urea in an intensive care unit, but urea can also be used to treat many patients over the long-term (years) without problems and likely with similar efficacy than the V2 antagonists but at a much lower price. In many patients, taste is not a complaint, particularly if low doses are sufficient to control hyponatremia (15 to 30 g/day).

### Urea for the treatment of hyponatremia [^112ykbco]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Current therapies for hyponatremia have variable effectiveness and tolerability, and in certain instances, they are very expensive. We examined the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of urea for the treatment of inpatient hyponatremia.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We identified all patients hospitalized at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between July 2016 and August 2017 with hyponatremia (plasma sodium < 135 mEq/L) who received urea, including a subgroup of patients who received urea as the sole drug therapy for hyponatremia (urea-only treated). We matched urea only-treated patients to a group of patients with hyponatremia who did not receive urea (urea untreated) and compared changes in plasma sodium at 24 hours and the end of therapy as well as the proportion of patients who achieved plasma sodium ≥ 135 mEq/L. We abstracted data on adverse events and reported side effects of urea.

Results

Fifty-eight patients received urea (7.5–90 g/d) over a median of 4.5 (interquartile range, 3–8) days and showed an increase in plasma sodium from 124 mEq/L (interquartile range, 122–126) to 131 mEq/L (interquartile range, 127–134; P < 0.001). Among 12 urea only-treated patients, plasma sodium increased from 125 mEq/L (interquartile range, 122–127) to 131 mEq/L (interquartile range, 129–136; P = 0.001) by the end of urea therapy. There was a larger increase in plasma sodium at 24 hours in urea only-treated patients compared with urea-untreated patients (2.5 mEq/L; interquartile range, 0–4.5 versus -0.5 mEq/L; interquartile range, -2.5 to 1.5; P = 0.04), with no difference in change in plasma sodium by the end of therapy (6 mEq/L; interquartile range, 3.5–10 versus 5.5 mEq/L; interquartile range, 3–7.5; P = 0.51). A greater proportion of urea only-treated patients achieved normonatremia, but this difference was not statistically significant (33% versus 8%; P = 0.08). No patients experienced overly rapid correction of plasma sodium, and no serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

Urea seems effective and safe for the treatment of inpatient hyponatremia, and it is well tolerated.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^112NjGpe]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to the identification of factors associated with hyponatremia correction, this study also gives a useful impression of how oral urea is currently positioned in the treatment of hyponatremia.

The majority of patients first received fluid restriction, indicating that oral urea is typically started as second-line treatment, which is in line with the guidelines. When oral urea was started, it was usually combined with fluid restriction and this combination led to a greater rise of plasma sodium during the first 2 days of treatment. Fluid restriction was likely not identified in the main analysis because fluid restriction was frequently liberalized during treatment. Garrahy and colleagues also showed that the effect of fluid restriction plateaus after a couple of days. For clinical practice it would be relevant to know whether oral urea should always be combined with fluid restriction or whether it can also be given as first-line treatment without fluid restriction. A previous retrospective study analyzed the effects of oral urea as first-line treatment without fluid restriction in cancer patients with SIAD-induced hyponatremia. The correction rate in this previous study was in fact higher (5 mmol/L in 24 h), which may be attributable to the lower baseline plasma sodium (123 mmol/L) or low solute intake in patients with cancer. In another recent study, oral urea was also given without fluid restriction and produced a more modest rise in plasma sodium (2 mmol/L in 7 days). However, this study was performed in an ambulatory setting in which transient causes for AVP release are less common than in hospitalized patients; patients also had a higher baseline plasma sodium (132 mmol/L). To address this issue more conclusively, a randomized controlled trial comparing oral urea with or without fluid restriction would be desirable.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^114bTxzD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

Older age (0.09 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.02–0.16), lower baseline plasma sodium (–0.65 mmol/L, 95% CI –0.78 to –0.52) and higher cumulative urea dose (0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.02–0.03) were independently associated with a rise in plasma sodium during treatment with oral urea (Table 3). The subanalysis of the first 48 h of treatment with oral urea demonstrated that a concomitant fluid restriction was independently associated with a rise in plasma sodium (1.81 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.40–3.08) (Table 4).

### Urea treatment in fluid restriction-refractory hyponatraemia [^115mH3g4]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hyponatraemia in hospitalized patients is common and associated with increased mortality. International guidelines give conflicting advice regarding the role of urea in the treatment of SIADH. We hypothesized that urea is a safe, effective treatment for fluid restriction-refractory hyponatraemia.

Design

Review of urea for the treatment of hyponatraemia in patients admitted to a tertiary hospital during 2016–2017. Primary end-point: proportion of patients achieving a serum sodium ≥ 130 mmol/L at 72 hours.

Patients

Urea was used on 78 occasions in 69 patients. The median age was 67 (IQR 52–76), 41% were female. Seventy (89.7%) had hyponatraemia due to SIADH-CNS pathology (64.3%) was the most common cause. The duration was acute in 32 (41%), chronic in 35 (44.9%) and unknown in the rest.

Results

The median nadir serum sodium was 122 mmol/L (IQR 118–126). Fluid restriction was first-line treatment in 65.4%. Urea was used first line in 21.8% and second line in 78.2%. Fifty treatment episodes (64.1%) resulted in serum sodium ≥ 130 mmol/L at 72 hours. In 56 patients who received other prior treatment, the mean sodium change at 72 hours (6.9 ± 4.8 mmol/L) was greater than with the preceding treatments (-1.0 ± 4.7 mmol/L; P < 0.001). Seventeen patients (22.7%) had side effects (principally distaste), none were severe. No patients developed hypernatraemia, overcorrection (> 10 mmol/L in 24 hours or > 18 mmol/L in 48 hours), or died.

Conclusions

Urea is safe and effective in fluid restriction-refractory hyponatraemia. We recommend urea with a starting dose of ≥ 30 g/d, in patients with SIADH and moderate to profound hyponatraemia who are unable to undergo, or have failed fluid restriction.

### Disorders of salt and water balance after pituitary surgery [^115vb8qU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Urea induces mild osmotic diuresis and progressive rise in plasma sodium in patients with SIAD, with a low risk of overcorrection or serious adverse effects. A dose of 7.5 to 90 g/day results in a mean rise in plasma sodium of 2.5 to 5 mmol/L over the first 24 hours (80,82). Urea is an effective and safe treatment for acute hyponatremia in neurosurgical patients (83,84), including after pituitary surgery. Experimental data suggest that urea is protective against osmotic demyelination; however, overcorrection of plasma sodium in chronic hyponatremia should still be avoided. Recommended dosing of urea is 30 to 60 g daily in 2 divided doses. Urea has a bitter taste, and tolerability can be improved by combination with sweet-tasting substances such as orange juice.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116nHVaS]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, the evidence base for the use of urea is limited by the retrospective observational nature of most current studies, heterogeneous inclusion criteria, and lack of control groups — which are particularly important in hyponatremia given the potential for autocorrection. Despite the limited evidence base, there is support for its use as an adjunct therapy to FR in chronic SIAD not responsive to FR alone in current guidelines, given its lower cost, low risk, and potential efficacy.

The only study to compare vaptans and urea, indirectly, was a small, single-arm trial in 12 participants with chronic SIAD (mean pNa 125 mmol/L, mean age 73 years) comparing sequential long-term treatment with a vaptan (tolvaptan or satavaptan), followed by urea 15 to 30 g/d after a treatment interruption. The authors reported a good response to treatment with both agents (mean pNa on treatment 135 mmol/L with both) and no difference in tolerability. However, methodologic limitations including the small size of the study do not allow accurate inferences to be made. This is an important topic for future research.

Current clinical practice differs across different centers, but urea is being increasingly used (see Fig. 10). Considerations that may make urea the preferred second-line therapy include risk factors for overcorrection, frailty, requirement for longer-term SIAD therapy to prevent recurrent hyponatremia-associated hospitalization (given the 30-day treatment limit for tolvaptan), and specific contraindications to tolvaptan (eg, deranged liver function). Though there are no direct published comparisons of overcorrection rate, clinical experience and the available literature of overcorrection in urea and tolvaptan individually suggest urea may carry a lower risk.

### Use of urea for the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone: a systematic review [^113tpb9e]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

We systematically searched previous studies including patients with SIADH who received urea treatment. In the 23 studies analyzed, 537 patients with SIADH were reported and 462 were treated with urea as the only therapy. Due to the absence of randomized clinical trials, in particular ones with adequate sample sizes, there is no definite evidence for the efficiency of urea in the treatment of hyponatremia in patients with SIADH. However, the available, lower-quality evidence suggests that urea is an effective treatment option with a very low risk of overcorrection and rarely reported adverse effects aside from dysgeusia.

In the pooled analysis we present here, urea increased serum sodium by 10.2 mmol/L within the reported follow-up time and seemed to be as effective in increasing serum sodium concentration as the VRA tolvaptan (serum sodium increase of 10.4 mmol/L until end of follow up). The rise in serum sodium starts as early as 24 to 48 hours after treatment initiation. Nearly all reported patients improved their serum sodium concentration with urea treatment to a level above 130 mmol/L. The average urea dose in the 23 studies was 15 g to 30 g urea per day with no reported adjustment to urine osmolality. For context, the dose recommendation in the European guidelines for treatment of SIADHwith urea is 0.25 to 0.50 g/kg per day. Urea raises serum sodium by increasing free water excretion through an osmotic-diuretic mechanism. The amount of free water excretion and therefore effectiveness of urea depends among others on the applied dose of urea and the urine osmolality. With increasing urine osmolality, the necessary dose of urea to improve serum sodium is higher. A practical guideline on dosing of urea in hyponatremia patients with regard to the initial urine osmolality exists. The risk of overcorrection of serum sodium concentration with urea is very low. Overcorrection is assumed to be a major contributor to the development of ODS even though a recent work showed only very low incidences of ODS in a large retrospective cohort of patients with hyponatremia and found no correlation between rapid corrections of serum sodium and ODS. Of note, the incidence was higher in patients with serum sodium below 110 mmol/L and overcorrection should, in our opinion, still be avoided especially in high-risk patients. The risk for ODS is still a matter of concern, and especially in patients at higher risk urea might be a safe and effective therapeutic option. However, in animal models, urea seemed to protect from ODS. Regarding the most common adverse effect of urea, dysgeusia, previous studies suggest that taste of urea can be improved by adding sucrose and citric acidor by dissolving urea in sweetened beverages.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^113awCLX]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Urea

Urea is recommended as a second-line treatment after FR both in the European hyponatremia guidelines and the US expert panel recommendations, despite an absence of randomized trials. Urea is a product of hepatic nitrogen metabolism that is renally excreted and exerts an osmotic effect to promote free water excretion. In SIAD, in which urine osmolality remains inappropriately high due to persistent AVP action, osmotic intake becomes an important determinant of urine volume. In addition to the main antidiuretic action of AVP (via vasopressin V2 receptors, to increase aquaporin insertion in the renal collecting duct), AVP also promotes water retention by upregulating expression of UT-A1s to increase reabsorption of urea, augmenting medullary interstitial osmolality and therefore urinary concentrating ability. In hyponatremic patients, treatment with exogenous urea overwhelms this mechanism by achieving a high concentration of urea in the glomerular filtrate, which induces an osmotic diuresis and reduces natriuresis, resulting in increased electrolyte-free water clearance (see Fig. 11). Urea administration is a much more efficient means of solute supplementation than oral sodium chloride administration. For example, a 15-g sachet of urea provides a renal solute load of 250 mOsm, whereas a single 600-mg sodium chloride tablet provides a renal solute load of 20.6 mOsm, and a 1000-mg NaCl tablet provides 34 mOsm. In other words, a 30-g dose of urea provides the same solute load as 14 to 25 salt tablets, depending on their strength (see Table 9).

Adjudication

To assure that entry criteria were met and that duration of HN was evaluable, data from patients who met a prespecified review threshold were subject to review by two members of the study Steering Committee. Discrepancies were resolved by review by the Steering Committee co-chairmen. Prespecified criteria triggering adjudication are listed in Supplementary Table S4 online. Among those who failed adjudication and were excluded were as follows: (1) individuals stated to be euvolemic but who presented with elevated blood urea nitrogen:creatinine ratios and/or low urine [Na +]s whose HN responded to administration of NS alone coincident with a fall in blood urea nitrogen:creatinine ratio; (2) individuals who were stated to be euvolemic but whose admission findings included edema or anasarca; (3) individuals with only a single [Na +] < 130 mEq/l who did not receive an active treatment for HN, and (4) patients with a qualifying episode of euvolemic or hypervolemic HN who also had a separate episode of hypovolemic HN during the same hospitalization that would have interfered with computerized parsing of data.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^111scz7b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The strengths of this study are the large sample size and the combined data from two university hospitals increasing external validity. In addition, we used linear mixed-effects models which is a powerful approach to analyzing repeated measurements obtained at varying time points. The limitations of this study are mostly related to its retrospective nature, which limits inferences regarding causality.

In conclusion, our study has identified clinically relevant factors associated with the correction rate of hyponatremia during treatment with oral urea, including age, baseline plasma sodium and the cumulative dose of oral urea. Combining oral urea with fluid restriction in the first 48 h might increase efficacy and should thus be prescribed with caution in patients at risk of ODS. Our study adds to the growing body of evidence from observational studies supporting the use of oral urea as an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment to gradually correct chronic hyponatremia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patient selection and data extraction

This retrospective cohort study was performed at two university hospitals — Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands and the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. Medical ethics approval was obtained (MEC-2022–0093 and EKNZ 2022–00 755). Urea treatment episodes were identified by searching for inpatient prescriptions of urea between August 2018 and January 2023. At Erasmus Medical Center urea is available as pre-formulated liquid containing lemon flavor (essence) and sugar syrup, while at University Hospital Basel urea powder is dissolved in orange juice or another flavored beverage before intake. Electronic health records of hospitalized adult patients who received at least one dose of oral urea for hyponatremia were reviewed. Treatment episodes were excluded in case oral urea use was not documented, no follow-up plasma sodium measurements were available or if the patient was not hyponatremic at the time of treatment. Data collection included patient demographics, vital signs, hyponatremia etiology, relevant baseline and follow-up biochemical parameters, urea treatment details including side effects, concomitant treatments for hyponatremia, rates of overcorrection and development of ODS. Modifications in oral urea dose or degree of fluid restriction were also recorded. Follow-up plasma sodium measurements were collected until 24 h after the last dose of oral urea. Plasma sodium was corrected for plasma glucose using the Katz correction if plasma glucose was > 10 mmol/L and if it was measured concurrently with plasma sodium. The etiology of hyponatremia was based on the documented diagnosis by the treating physician and verified using guideline definitions. SIAD was defined as urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg and urine sodium > 30 mmol/L in the absence of diuretic use, adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism. When no cause of hyponatremia was recorded, the most probable cause using clinical and biochemical data was determined as described previously.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^1162Mnj7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

In patients with chronic hyponatremia plasma sodium should be gradually corrected to prevent osmotic demyelination.
Recent observational studies have reported positive experiences with oral urea for the treatment of hyponatremia, but factors associated with the correction rate are unknown.

This study adds:

Older age, lower baseline plasma sodium and higher cumulative urea dose increase the correction rate of hyponatremia during treatment with oral urea.
Combining oral urea with fluid restriction may further increase the correction rate of hyponatremia.

Potential impact:

In patients with hyponatremia who are older or have a low initial plasma sodium, oral urea may need to be given for a shorter duration without fluid restriction.
Our study also adds to the growing body of evidence that oral urea generally is a safe and effective treatment for hyponatremia.

Second, the need for comparison head-to-head studies between different therapeutic options for SIAD, which was already highlighted in 2014, has not as yet been met, with the exception of a small prospective study comparing the efficacy and safety of vaptans with oral urea in patients with SIAD. Prospective studies should compare tolvaptan versus other therapies, such as fluid restriction and urea, not only with regard to their ability to correct hyponatraemia, but also to alter patient-related outcomes and safety. Taking into account the heterogeneity of SIAD, further studies are also warranted to evaluate the therapeutic role of tolvaptan in homogeneous cohorts, for example, in malignant SIAD or in neurosurgical settings, since tolvaptan may translate into reduced length of hospitalisation and use of hospital resources in these subgroups.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^116F8M1C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### Efficacy and tolerance of urea compared with vaptans for long-term treatment of patients with SIADH [^114yEAQA]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Vaptans (vasopressin V(2)-receptor antagonists) are a new approach for the treatment of hyponatremia. However, their indications remain to be determined, and their benefit compared with that of the usual treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) have not been evaluated. This prospective, long-term study compared the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of two oral vaptans with those of oral urea in patients with SIADH.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Patients with chronic SIADH of various origins were treated first with vaptans for 1 year. After an 8-day holiday period, they received oral urea for an additional 1-year follow-up. Serum sodium was measured every 2 months, and drug doses were adjusted accordingly.

Results

Thirteen participants were initially included in the study (serum sodium, 125 ± 3 mEq/L); 12 completed the 2-year treatment period. Treatment with vaptans (satavaptan, 5–50 mg/d, n = 10; tolvaptan, 30–60 mg/day, n = 2) increased natremia (serum sodium, 135 ± 3 mEq/L) during the 1-year vaptan period without escape. Hyponatremia recurred in the 12 participants when vaptans were stopped (holiday period). Urea improved the natremia with the same efficacy (serum sodium, 135 ± 2 mEq/L) as vaptans during the 1-year urea treatment period. One participant treated with tolvaptan withdrew from the study early because of excessive thirst. Another patient receiving urea developed hypernatremia without complications.

Conclusions

Urea has efficacy similar to that of vaptans for treatment of chronic SIADH. Tolerance is generally good for both agents.

DISCUSSION

Oral urea is increasingly used for the treatment of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients, but it is not known which clinical factors determine the correction rate during treatment. Our findings demonstrate that older age, lower baseline plasma sodium and higher cumulative urea dose were independently associated with a greater rise in plasma sodium during treatment with oral urea. Fluid restriction was also associated with hyponatremia correction when focusing on the first 2 days of treatment. The safety and tolerability of oral urea were relatively good, with an overcorrection rate of 3% and a discontinuation rate of 11%. Our study offers several new insights regarding the treatment with oral urea for hyponatremia in hospitalized patients, which will be further discussed below.

A clinically relevant finding is that a higher cumulative dose of oral urea is associated with a greater change in plasma sodium. This dose–response relationship was characterized by a steady increase in plasma urea until 11–12 mmol/L after which a plateau was reached. Of interest, plasma sodium kept on rising during this plateau phase suggesting a steady state of osmotic diuresis. Our observation that a lower baseline plasma sodium was associated with a greater change in plasma sodium was also identified in previous studies in which hyponatremia was treated with tolvaptan or hypertonic saline. There may be several reasons for this association. First, from a pathophysiological perspective, one might expect any treatment for hyponatremia to produce a stronger effect on plasma sodium when hyponatremia is more profound. Second, patients with profound hyponatremia may have multiple reasons for AVP release, some of which may be transient in nature. Third, physicians may be more likely to give multiple treatments or more aggressive treatment in patients with profound hyponatremia. Since a lower baseline plasma sodium is also consistently associated with a risk of overcorrection, it should be treated cautiously in patients with chronic hyponatremia to prevent overcorrection and ODS. Finally, we also identified a weak association between higher age and more rapid correction of hyponatremia. Possible explanations are a lower urinary concentrating ability with higher age, a component of low solute intake or an effect of decreased total body water in the elderly.

Urea has been in clinical use since at least 1980; however, its uptake had been limited; an international hyponatremia registry published in 2016 of more than 1000 patients with SIAD in the United States and European Union reported use of urea in only 0.2% of patients. The main barriers to uptake appear to have been difficult access and concern about tolerability (in particular, bitter taste), which can be ameliorated by combining it with citric acid, sucrose and bicarbonate, or a small volume of orange juice. The dose of urea endorsed by the EU guidelines is 0.25 to 0.5 g/kg/day (ie, 15–30 g daily for a 60-kg patient), and US guidelines recommend 15 to 60 g daily, and use of doses up to 90 g daily is reported. In general, 30 g daily is a commonly recommended starting dose. Clinicians should be aware that urea therapy causes an increase in serum urea concentration and BUN usually double baseline, but this does not necessarily represent deterioration in renal function or hypovolemia. Urea powder is low cost, at less than USD $3 per 30-g dose. Proprietary flavored formulations that may be more palatable are also available in the United States and elsewhere by special order, albeit more expensive (eg, "Ure-Na" approximately USD $7.50 per 30-g dose).

Severe hyponatremia

Figure 2a presents the evolution of SNa in 35 patients with severe hyponatremia which was acquired outside the hospitals (in 10 patients it was due to thiazides, in 8 to neoplasic diseases, and so on). Most patients presented neurological symptoms (four were asymptomatic, four were comatose, three presented seizures, all the other were described as confused or somnolent). SNa increased from 111 ± 3 mEq/L to 122 ± 4 mEq/L in one day (P < 0.001) and all the patients with neurological symptoms made a rapid recovery.

SNa increased more than 12 mmol/L the first day in 12 patients and in 13 patients the increase in SNa was higher than 18 mmol/L/48 hr. In two of these patients the intensivist lowered the SNa again by giving desmopressin (DDAVP) and water. No cases of clinical osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) developed. When high doses of urea are used (≥ 60 g/day) it is usual to avoid the next dose of urea if blood urea level is higher than 150 mg/dL (SNa and urea are measured in most patients every 8 to 12 hr when large doses are used). No cases of hypernatremia were observed. The 10 patients with thiazides induced hyponatremia presented biological data similar to patients with SIADH (low urea and uric acid levels); it is likely that isotonic saline alone was sufficient in most of these patients.

Seven patients presented hypokaliemia (range 2.3 to 3.4 mmol, four were taking diuretics).

All the patients presented with a systolic blood pressure over 100 mmHg and showed no signs of overt hypovolemia (clinically or biologically).

In 12 patients (Figure 2b) urea therapy was initiated after 1 or 2 L isotonic saline (given over one day) and which did not improved natremia (two were on thiazide).

In 10 patients (Figure 2c), 1 L isotonic saline was administered each 12 hr with 0.5 g/kg of urea (given by mouth or gastric tube). In these patients, mean SNa increased by 7 ± 4 mmol/L in eight hours (range 1 to 11 mmol/L; P < 0.01). Urea increased from 27 ± 14 mg/dL to 96 ± 30 mg/dL four hours after urea administration (P < 0.001).

### Urea for hyponatremia? [^113wC389]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Once the standard of care for cerebral edema, urea can also be used to treat hyponatremia. The 2014 European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend urea for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, while discouraging use of vasopressin antagonists. Although there is evidence that urea can diminish hypertonic injury to brain cells caused by rapid correction of hyponatremia, clinical trials are needed that include patients at high risk to develop complications from overcorrection.

We report the successful use of oral urea in the management of children with chronic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIAD). We performed a retrospective review of four children with chronic SIAD. After initial attempts at management with fluid restriction, each was started on a 30% to 50% oral urea solution, and the dose was titrated until normal serum sodium was achieved. Fluid intake was liberalized after serum sodium normalization. All four children normalized their serum sodium. No side effects or toxicities were experienced. Oral urea is a safe, effective treatment for chronic SIAD in children.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^114zYH9K]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and by laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to cure symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of grave or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and the indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear. Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures and means (fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, demeclocycline), with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline commonly used. Recently vasopressin receptor antagonists, called vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy of SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous to patients because there is no need for fluid restriction and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably and within a short time. Vaptans also appear to be beneficial for physicians and staff because of their efficiency and reliability. The side effects are thirst, polydipsia and frequency of urination. In any therapy of chronic SIADH it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8–10 mmol/liter because higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 h are critical for prevention of an overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and the serum sodium should be measured after 0, 6, 24 and 48 h of treatment. Discontinuation of any vaptan therapy for longer than 5 or 6 days should be monitored to prevent hyponatremic relapse. It may be necessary to taper the vaptan dose or restrict fluid intake or both.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^115vMp42]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of oral urea was reported as early as the 1980s, but its use remained rather limited. In recent years oral urea was "rediscovered", with several observational studies reporting positive experiences for the treatment of hyponatremia. A recent systematic review confirmed that oral urea is an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment option for SIAD despite the lack of data from randomized controlled trials.

With the use of oral urea for SIAD becoming more widespread, it is also becoming increasingly important to better understand which clinical factors determine the hyponatremia correction rate during treatment. For example, several studies have shown that a lower baseline plasma sodium concentration predicts more rapid correction of hyponatremia, but it is not known whether this also pertains to treatment with oral urea. Previous studies also identified specific parameters that were associated with the response to therapy, including urine osmolality for fluid restriction and body weight for hypertonic saline. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate which clinical factors are associated with hyponatremia correction. To address this, we analyzed the hyponatremia correction rate during oral urea treatment in 140 patients from two university medical centers.

INTRODUCTION

Hyponatremia, defined as a plasma sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is one of the most common electrolyte disorders in hospitalized patients. While acute hyponatremia can cause cerebral edema with severe symptoms and requires prompt treatment with hypertonic saline, chronic hyponatremia does not pose an immediate risk. However, it can also have several adverse effects, including neurocognitive impairment, gait instability and falls, and osteoporosis and fractures, some of which are reversible upon treatment. This provides a rationale for the treatment of chronic hyponatremia, although overcorrection should be avoided to prevent the development of the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS).

The most common cause of chronic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). In SIAD, the non-osmotic release of arginine vasopressin (AVP) impairs free water excretion and treatment therefore relies on fluid restriction or stimulation of free water excretion. Although fluid restriction is an effective first-line treatment for hyponatremia secondary to SIAD, patients with severe antidiuresis often require additional treatment to increase free water excretion. Second-line treatments for SIAD include vasopressin receptor antagonists, loop diuretics, sodium chloride tablets, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and oral urea. Of these options, oral urea is increasingly recognized as an effective treatment for SIAD because it produces a gradual correction of hyponatremia. Urea is a crystalline powder that is administered at a dose of 15–60 g per day and increases free water excretion by inducing osmotic diuresis. In a patient with SIAD who has a "fixed" urine osmolality of 500 mOsm/kg, solute intake of 700 mOsm/day and water intake of 2 L/day, adding 30 g urea (molecular weight 60 g/mol) will increase solute intake by 500 mOsm and will result in a negative water balance [urine volume = number of osmoles/urine osmolality, (700 + 500)/500 = 2.4 L].

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

### Investigation and management of moderate to severe inpatient hyponatraemia in an Australian tertiary hospital [^112Ugf7D]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte disturbance amongst hospitalised patients. Both American and European guidelines recommend fluid restriction as first line treatment for SIADH, however differ on second line recommendations. The objective of this study was to examine investigation and management of hyponatraemia in hospitalised patients in an Australian tertiary hospital.

Methods

A retrospective audit was conducted of electronic medical records and laboratory data of inpatients with serum sodium (Na) ≤ 125mmol/L, admitted over a 3month period to the Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. The main outcomes measured included: demographic characteristics, investigations, accuracy of diagnosis, management strategy, change in Na and patient outcomes.

Results

The working clinical diagnosis was considered accurate in only 37.5% of cases. Urine Na and osmolality were requested in 72 of 152 patients (47.4%) and in 43 of 70 euvolaemic patients (61.4%). Thyroid function tests (67.1%) and morning cortisol (45.7%) were underutilized in the euvolaemic group. In the SIADH cohort, fluid restriction resulted in a median (IQR) 7.5mmol/L (4–10.5) increase in Na after 3days; no treatment resulted in a median 0mmol/L (-0.5–1.5) change. Oral urea was utilized in 5 SIADH patients where Na failed to increase with fluid restriction alone. This resulted in a median 10.5mmol/L (3.5–13) increase in Na from baseline to day 3. There were no cases of osmotic demyelination. The median length of stay was 8days (4–18.5). Mortality was 11.2% (17 patients). There was a weak but significant correlation between nadir serum Na and mortality (R = 0.18, P = 0.031).

Conclusion

Inpatient hyponatraemia is often inadequately investigated, causing errors in diagnosis. Treatment is heterogeneous and often incorrect. In cases with hyponatraemia refractory to fluid restriction, oral urea presents an effective alternative treatment.

### Treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in the intensive care unit by urea [^115grtD5]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatremia in the intensive care unit (ICU) is most commonly related to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Fluid restriction is difficult to apply in these patients. We wanted to report the treatment of hyponatremia with urea in these patients.

Methods

Two groups of patients are reported. The first one is represented by a retrospective study of 50 consecutive patients with mild hyponatremia treated with urea. The second group is presented by a series of 35 consecutive patients with severe hyponatremia acquired outside the hospital (≤ 115 mEq/L) who where treated by isotonic saline and urea (0.5 to 1 g/kg/day), administered usually by gastric tube.

Results

In the first group with mild hyponatremia (128 ± 4 mEq/L) the serum sodium (SNa) increased to a mean value of 135 ± 4 mEq/L (P < 0.001) after two days of urea therapy (46 ± 25 g/day), despite a large fluid intake (> 2 L/day). The mean duration of urea therapy was six days (from 2 to 42 days). Six patients developed hyponatremia again once the urea was stopped, which necessitated its reintroduction. Six patients developed hypernatremia (maximum value 155 mEq/L). In the second group, SNa increased from 111 ± 3 mEq/L to 122 ± 4 mEq/L in one day (P < 0.001). All the patients with neurological symptoms made a rapid recovery. No side effects were observed.

Conclusions

These data show that urea is a simple and inexpensive therapy to treat euvolemic hyponatremia in the ICU.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116m8pt2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Use of urea for the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone: a systematic review [^114PPF5B]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) are associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The effectiveness and safety of oral urea for SIADH are still debated.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of urea for the treatment of SIADH.

Evidence Review

A systematic search of Medline and Embase was conducted for controlled and uncontrolled studies of urea for SIADH in adult patients. The primary outcome was serum sodium concentration after treatment. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), intracranial pressure, and resource use such as length of stay.

Findings

Twenty-three studies involving 537 patients with SIADH were included, of which 462 were treated with urea. The pooled mean baseline serum sodium was 125.0 mmol/L (95% CI, 122.6–127.5 mmol/L). The median treatment duration with oral urea was 5 days. Urea increased serum sodium concentration by a mean of 9.6 mmol/L (95% CI, 7.5–11.7 mmol/L). The mean increase in serum sodium after 24 hours was 4.9 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.5–9.3 mmol/L). Adverse events were few, mainly consisting of distaste or dysgeusia, and no case of ODS was reported. Resource use was too infrequently reported to be synthesized.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review of the use of urea in SIADH and despite the lack of randomized clinical trials, lower-quality evidence was identified that suggests that urea may be an effective, safe, and inexpensive treatment modality that warrants further exploration.

### Where vaptans do and do not fit in the treatment of hyponatremia [^113bUjpN]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The treatment of hyponatremia, an exceedingly common electrolyte disorder, has been a subject of controversy for many years. The advent of vasopressin antagonists (vaptans) has added to the treatment arsenal. This review focuses on why hyponatremia should be treated and the role of these antagonists in the treatment. Upon analysis of the available literature, we conclude that there is presently no role for vaptans in acute symptomatic hyponatremia. Although numerous therapeutic approaches are available for chronic symptomatic hyponatremia, vasopressin antagonists provide a simpler treatment option. Vaptans are efficacious in raising serum sodium in long-standing 'asymptomatic' hyponatremia. However, the cost of the only Food and Drug Administration-approved oral agent (tolvaptan) makes its use prohibitive for most patients in this setting.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of mildly symptomatic patients (acute setting), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider administering a single infusion of 3% hypertonic saline (150 mL IV, over 20 minutes) if the acute decrease in serum sodium concentration is > 10 mmol/L.

### Treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in the intensive care unit by urea [^1158JaYd]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

In this series of severe hyponatremic patients, only four were frankly comatose but the majority were symptomatic and were treated by isotonic saline combined with urea given orally (by gastric tube if needed). In our hospital severe euvolemic hyponatremia is usually treated with a combination of urea and isotonic saline which is an alternative to hypertonic saline. At the present time, severe symptomatic hyponatremia particularly if epileptic seizures are present should be treated with hypertonic saline (consensus conference). Hypertonic saline will increase SNa theoretically more rapidly than urea.

Establishment of a depletional origin of hyponatremia is not always easy particularly in the medical ward. The combined treatment of isotonic saline and urea has some advantages. If there is some salt depletion, isotonic saline will be useful while if excess water is the main factor of hyponatremia, urea will be useful (by subtracting water).

Although we discourage an increase of SNa of more than 10 mmol/L/day, many patients presented a too large increase. We know that urea has a protective effect against osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) in animals. SNa was decreased again only in two patients by giving DDAVP and water. No clinically cases of ODS were observed in our patients, this could reflect the protective effect of urea.

In all the studies published with the vaptans, no patients with SNa less than 115 mEq/L where included. Despite the attractiveness of using a pure aquaretic agent to correct life-threatening hyponatremia, insufficient data are available from clinical trials to know if sufficiently rapid correction can be achieved in patients with acute, severe hyponatremia without the use of hypertonic saline. Indeed, present studies show that V2RA diuresis does not begin to increase before one to two hours.

Fluid Therapy

Dehydration can be assumed to be 5%–10% (50–100 mL/kg). As noted above, the degree of dehydration is usually overestimated. The severity of extracellular fluid (ECF) contraction may be indicated by serum urea and hematocrit concentrations. Serum Na concentration is not reliable for determining ECF deficit because of the osmotic effect of hyperglycemia-induced dilutional hyponatremia, and the low Na content of the elevated lipid fraction of the serum in DKA. Corrected Na, ie for normal glucose levels, can be estimated by adding 1.6 mEq to the measured value for each 100 mg/dL blood glucose above normal.
During the first 1–2 hours, 10–20mL/kg 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) should be provided to restore peripheral perfusion.
Maintenance can be calculated as 1000 mL for the first 10 kg body weight + 500 mL for the next 10 kg + 20 mL/kg over 20 kg or 1500 mL/m 2 body surface area.
The remainder of replacement after the loading dose, based on 5%–10% dehydration, and maintenance, can be distributed over the subsequent 22–23 hours. While many guidelines call for calculating replacement over 48 hours, there is no evidence basis for this being safer or more efficacious. Fluids that have recently been administered orally at home (if not vomited) and parenteral fluids provided in the emergency room or referring institution need to be incorporated into the calculation.
Except for severely ill and very young individuals, oral intake should begin before 24 hours.
While urinary output should be carefully documented, urinary losses should not be added to fluid requirements, except in the presence of HHS.
After initial 0.9% NaCl bolus, rehydration/maintenance should be continued with 0.45% NaCl. The measured Na can increase to the level of the corrected Na during rehydration as glycemia declines and then decline to normal levels if the corrected level was elevated.
Continued use of 0.9% saline after the initial resuscitation may result in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
To prevent unduly rapid decline in plasma glucose concentration and hypoglycemia, 5% glucose should be added to the IV fluid when the plasma glucose falls to 300 mg/dL (17 mmol/L). An efficient method of providing glucose as needed without long delays entailed by the changing of IV solutions is to have two IV fluid bags connected, one containing 10% dextrose and the appropriate Na and K concentrations and the other with the same salt concentrations but no dextrose, the so-called "two bag system".
K (40 mEq/L or up to 80 mEq/L as needed) can be provided as half potassium chloride (KCl), half potassium phosphate (KPO 4; to replenish low phosphate levels and to decrease the risk of hyperchloremia) or as half KPO 4 and half K acetate (which, like lactate, is converted to bicarbonate to help correct acidosis) after serum K is < 6 mmol/L or urine flow is established. Serum K concentration increases by approximately 0.6 mEq/L for every 0.1 decrease in pH, so that the serum K level does not reflect the large deficit from diuresis and vomiting, ∼5 mEq/kg body weight. Both K and phosphate shift markedly from intracellular to extracellular compartments with acidosis and re-enter cells rapidly with insulin-induced glucose uptake and rehydration.
Bicarbonate administration is not indicated in pediatric DKA. There is no evidence that bicarbonate facilitates metabolic recovery. Restoring circulatory volume will improve tissue perfusion and renal function, increasing organic acid excretion and reversing lactic acidosis. The administration of insulin stops further synthesis of ketoacids and reactivates the Krebs cycle, permitting metabolism of ketoacids, and regeneration of bicarbonate. Bicarbonate therapy may cause paradoxical central nervous system (CNS) acidosis, rapid correction of acidosis can cause hypokalemia, the additional Na can add to hyperosmolality, and alkali therapy can increase hepatic ketone production, potentially slowing recovery.

Urea

Oral urea has been used to treat hyponatraemia in SIAD since 1980. It is an osmotically active agent that increases urinary free water excretion and decreases urinary sodium excretion. In an 1981 study by Decaux & Genette, seven patients with confirmed SIAD with a mean pNa of 115 ± 6 mmol/l and mean urine osmolality of 514 ± 79 mOsm/kg H 2 O were administered between 30 and 60 g of urea once daily. After treatment, a significant rise in serum Na to 136 ± 3.5 mmol/l (p < 0.001) was demonstrated, with a concomitant rise in urine osmolality to 652 ± 95 mOsm/kg H 2 O (p < 0.001). Retrospective studies have shown urea to be effective in SIAD induced by SAH and in critical care patients, as well as in twelve patients who transitioned to urea therapy following 12 months of vaptan therapy in a clinical trial. A more recent retrospective non-controlled study from the US (n = 58) compared outcomes in patients treated with an oral commercially available formulation of urea and those treated by other means, over a one year period. Treatment with urea resulted in a statistically significant rise in pNa following 24 hours (2.8 mmol/L versus –0.5 mmol/L in the non-urea group; p < 0.05), and a median rise in pNa of 6 mmol/L over 4 days, without overcorrection or other adverse events. Contraindications to the use of urea in the treatment of hyponatraemic include liver cirrhosis, adrenal insufficiency and states of hypovolemia.

### Urea in cancer patients with chronic SIAD-induced hyponatremia: old drug, new evidence [^1167DUX8]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) is the main cause of hyponatremia in cancer patients. International guidelines indicate urea as an interesting option for chronic SIAD. Nevertheless, strong data to support its use are lacking, and its role in oncologic patients has not been described so far.

Material and Methods

We retrospectively analysed 36 cancer patients affected by moderate or profound SIAD-induced chronic hyponatremia, who started oral urea (initial daily dose 15 g or 30 g) without fluid restriction between July 2013 and July 2018. We analysed mean serum sodium (sNa) increase after 24 hours and percentages of patients who reached eunatremia within 14, 30 and 60 days of treatment, stratifying according to the degree of hyponatremia at diagnosis. Clinical evaluation and biochemical assessment were periodically performed.

Results

Mean sNa was 123 [± 4] mmol/L at baseline; after 24 hours of treatment, a mean increase of 5 [± 3] mmol/L was observed. Eunatremia was reached by 55.6%, 86.1% and 91.7% patients within 14, 30 and 60 days of treatment, respectively. Trends in sNa normalization were similar in patients with moderate and profound hyponatremia at diagnosis. Rapid sNa overcorrection was avoided in all cases. Urea was interrupted within the first 2 months of treatment in 10 patients, in half cases for rapid neoplastic progression and in the remaining patients for the drug taste.

Conclusions

In our study, urea was effective in correcting chronic hyponatremia among cancer patients with SIAD. Almost all patients reached eunatremia within the first month of therapy, and urea was globally well tolerated.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^112T1rhr]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Change in plasma sodium during urea treatment

Plasma sodium rose from 127 mmol/L (IQR 123–130) to 134 mmol/L (IQR 131–136) by the end of treatment (change in plasma sodium 7 mmol/L, IQR 3–11). Normalization of plasma sodium was reached in 74 (47%) of treatment episodes. The steepest rise in plasma sodium was observed during the first three treatment days with an increase of 2.1 mmol/L per day (95% CI 1.9–2.4), followed by an increase of 0.9 mmol/L per day (95% CI 0.5–1.3) (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, plasma urea rose most rapidly during the first two treatment days with an increase of 2.8 mmol/L per day (95% CI 2.3–3.3), followed by stabilization (Fig. 3 B). The change in plasma sodium was significantly related to the change in plasma urea (0.53 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.45–0.6, i.e. for every 1 mmol/L increase in plasma urea, plasma sodium increased 0.53 mmol/L). The plasma uric acid trajectory showed a similar pattern as plasma urea (Fig. 3 C). Body weight decreased most during the first three treatment days with a change of –0.5 kg per day (95% CI –0.7 to –0.4, Fig. 3 D). The rise in plasma urea and plasma sodium as a function of the cumulative urea dose is shown in Fig. 4. As the cumulative dose increased, the plasma urea concentration reached a plateau at a concentration of 14.1 mmol/L (95% CI 11.8–16.5). In the patients with available repeated urine data, urine urea and urine osmolality increased (urine urea from 191 to 406 mmol/L, n = 5; urine osmolality from 577 to 637 mOsm/kg, n = 25), whereas the fractional excretion of sodium decreased (0.59 to 0.28%, n = 12). The overall change in plasma sodium in the subgroup (n = 63) that was treated with oral urea and a concurrent fluid restriction was 6 mmol/L (IQR 3–10), while it was 5 mmol/L (IQR 2–8) in the subgroup (n = 27) treated with oral urea only (P = 0.30).

### Urea for treatment of SIAD induced hyponatremia: experience of an oncology center [^111oP978]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inappropriate antidiuresis syndrome (SIAD) induced hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance found in cancer patients. Available treatment options are limited by their poor efficacy, tolerability, or cost. Urea is a promising alternative, but its use in the oncology setting remains insufficiently characterized. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of urea in the management of chronic SIAD-induced hyponatremia in patients with cancer.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients diagnosed with SIAD and treated with oral urea at our Oncology Center between August 2021 and June 2023. Sodium levels were recorded before urea initiation, at the first reevaluation and at the last available follow-up.

Results

The cohort included 28 patients, mostly men (71%), with a mean age of 63.9 ± 10.0 years; 86% had metastatic disease. Lung cancer was the most frequent diagnosis, mostly small cell lung carcinoma. Urea treatment resulted in a statistically significant increase in serum sodium both in inpatients (mean increase of 2.4 ± 3.5mmol/L after 12 (23) hours, p = 0.016) and outpatients (mean increase of 8.6 ± 6.6mmol/L after 8 (11) days, p = 0.003). No cases of sodium overcorrection or clinically significant adverse events were reported. One patient complained of urea taste, with no impact on treatment adherence. Sodium normalization following cancer treatment allowed for urea discontinuation in 21% of cases. Median follow-up was 84 days (range 3 days-20.9 months).

Conclusion

Our study suggests that urea may be a safe, effective, and well-tolerated option for the long-term management of SIAD-related hyponatremia in oncology patients, but further studies are necessary to confirm these observations.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review… [^1169CfKA]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality. Observations Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific to severe and life-threatening. Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures.

Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects. Severely symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L within the first 24 hours. Conclusions and Relevance Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized.

Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients, adequate response to initial management, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to limit the increase in serum sodium concentration to a total of 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours and an additional 8 mmol/L during every 24 hours thereafter until the serum sodium concentration reaches 130 mmol/L.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^114BfmKN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study plasma sodium rose by 7 mmol/L over a median duration of 4 days. This rise in plasma sodium is similar to most previous inpatient studies with oral urea using similar dose ranges. Of the five patients with overcorrection, all had one or more concurrent treatments for hyponatremia, three patients had transient causes for AVP release and one patient developed AVP deficiency after neurosurgery. Overcorrection during oral urea has been reported in some, but not all previous case series. Overcorrection rates for oral urea were 8%–10% in previous studies and 3% in this study, while overcorrection rates for hypertonic saline and vaptans were 16%–45% and ∼13%, respectively. However, one should be careful to directly compare these overcorrection rates as patient characteristics differed between studies. In addition, the risk of overcorrection due to hypertonic saline or tolvaptan can be reduced by giving respectively desmopressin or a very low dose of tolvaptan, whereas countermeasures still need to be defined for overcorrection during treatment with oral urea. Additionally, oral urea has never been reported to have caused ODS. The absence of ODS is not unexpected in our study, because ODS is typically observed in patients with more profound hyponatremia (e.g. plasma sodium < 115 mmol/L) who are overcorrected. We do acknowledge that ODS could theoretically have been missed because patients were not followed up after discharge and ODS can have a delayed onset of symptoms. An additional relevant point is that experimentally induced overcorrection in rats using urea, lixivaptan or hypertonic saline demonstrated lower rates of neurological complications and mortality in the urea-treated rats, suggesting a protective role of urea against ODS. One case of mild uremic encephalopathy due to oral urea intake has been reported in a patient with hyponatremia due to heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Another aspect with regard to side effects is the palatability of oral urea, which previously limited its use. In our study the palatability of oral urea was improved by using it as part of a pre-formulated liquid or dissolving it in a flavored beverage. A recent study suggests that the palatability of oral urea can be further improved by using a commercially available urea formulation.

Statistical analysis

Normally distributed continuous variables are reported as means ± standard deviation, while not normally distributed variables are reported as medians with interquartile range (IQR). To visualize the trajectories of plasma sodium, urea, uric acid and body weight during treatment with oral urea, repeated measurements were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model with patient as random effect and treatment day as fixed effect. Natural cubic splines were fitted into the model to account for possible non-linearity. To identify factors independently associated with the rise in plasma sodium during treatment with oral urea, we fitted a linear mixed-effects model with plasma sodium change as outcome, patient as random effect and the following fixed effects: age, sex, baseline values for body weight, plasma sodium, plasma urea, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine osmolality, cumulative urea dose, repeated daily urea dose (yes/no) and concurrent fluid restriction (yes/no). These variables were selected because they were considered important in the correction rate of hyponatremia based on previous literature. A subanalysis was performed focusing on the first 48 h of treatment with oral urea, because we observed that fluid restriction was frequently loosened during treatment. Multicollinearity was ruled out by determining the variation inflation factors. Missingness for all baseline covariates was < 5%, except for plasma uric acid (48%), plasma osmolality (17%), plasma urea (17%), body weight (12%) and urine biochemical values (7%). Missing values are reported but were not imputed because our main analyses were based on linear mixed-effects models, which are suitable for handling incomplete datasets as well as repeated measurements obtained at varying time points. All tests were two-tailed, and a P -value < .05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed with R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, version 4.1.2).

### Hyponatraemia-treatment standard 2024 [^111Fe3u4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospital patients associated with increased morbidity, mortality, hospital stay and financial burden. The speed of a correction with 3% sodium chloride as a 100- to 150-ml intravenous bolus or continuous infusion depends on the severity and persistence of the symptoms and needs frequent biochemical monitoring. The rapid intermittent administration of hypertonic saline is preferred for treatment of symptomatic hyponatraemia. In asymptomatic mild hyponatraemia, an adequate solute intake with an initial fluid restriction (FR) of 500 ml/day adjusted according to the serum sodium (sNa) levels is preferred. Almost half of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) patients do not respond to FR as first-line therapy. At present, urea and tolvaptan are considered the most effective second-line therapies in SIADH. However, the evidence for guidance on the choice of second-line therapy of hypotonic hyponatraemia is lacking. Oral urea is considered to be a very effective and safe treatment. Mild and asymptomatic hyponatraemia is treated with adequate solute intake (salt and protein) and initial FR with adjustments based on sNa levels. Specific treatment with vaptans may be considered in either euvolaemic or hypervolaemic patients with high ADH activity. In order to ensure optimal patient outcome, close monitoring and readiness for administration of either hypotonic fluids or desmopressin may be crucial in the decision-making process for specific treatment and eventual overcorrection consequences. According to the guidelines, gradual correction and clinical evaluation is preferable over rapid normalization of sNa towards the laboratory reference ranges.

Efficacy and Safety Results

Abbreviations: ICU, intensive care unit; NR, not reported; ODS, osmotic demyelination syndrome; SAH, subarachnoid hemorrhage; SIADH, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.

Urea was well tolerated with only a few studies reporting adverse events, mainly consisting of distaste and or dysgeusia. Additionally, nausea, gastroesophageal reflux, and hypernatremia were reported in few cases. In a small subset of patients, gustative intolerance led to refusal to take urea or to interruption of drug intake. There were no cases of ODS in SIADH patients with urea treatment. Only 1 study reported overcorrection of serum sodium (an increase of more than 12 mmol/L in 24 hours) with urea treatment without clinical deterioration. In this study patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage with mild hyponatremia (mean [SD], 127 [2] mmol/L) were treated with a mean dose of 50 g urea, mainly via nasogastric tube.

The sample size for a noninferiority trial comparing urea and VRAs could be quite small, maybe under 10 patients depending on the safety margin. A trial between urea and fluid restriction with a superiority design would require at least 106 patients if patients were equally distributed between the 2 groups.

RESULTS

Patient and treatment characteristics

We included 140 hospitalized patients who received oral urea for hyponatremia (Fig. 1). Median baseline plasma sodium was 127 mmol/L (IQR 123–130, Table 1) and ranged between 108 and 134 mmol/L (Fig. 2). The baseline urine osmolality and urine sodium concentration were 525 mOsm/kg (IQR 392–635) and 77 mmol/L (IQR 49–124), respectively (Table 1). In 55 patients with available urine sodium and potassium, the (urine sodium + potassium)/plasma sodium ratio was > 1 in 30 (55%), indicating that they are unlikely to respond to fluid restriction alone. The most common cause of hyponatremia was SIAD (n = 130, 93%), which was most frequently associated with cancer (n = 49, 35%, Table 1). Other causes of hyponatremia were heart failure, thiazide diuretics, primary polydipsia and low solute intake. Among the 140 included patients, oral urea was used on 161 separate occasions (Table 2). Oral urea was prescribed at a start dose of 30 g/day (IQR 22–30) for a median duration of 4 days (IQR 2–7) reaching a cumulative dose of 120 g (IQR 60–210). In 58 (36%) of the treatment episodes, the oral urea dose was modified 116 times (53% increased, 47% decreased). Fluid restriction was started prior to oral urea in 117 treatment episodes (73%) and concurrent fluid restriction with oral urea occurred in 104 treatment episodes (65%). Fluid restriction was modified 88 times during 58 treatment episodes (36%) and usually loosened or discontinued (in 61% and 18% of treatment episodes, respectively). Other less common concurrent treatments included isotonic fluids, sodium chloride tablets and hypertonic saline (Table 2). Hypertonic saline was usually given because plasma sodium decreased during treatment with oral urea (likely because fluid restriction was not adhered to). Finally, we recorded "co-medication" — drugs that may have influenced the correction of hyponatremia, but were not specifically prescribed for hyponatremia (Table 2). This included glucocorticoids, which were prescribed for malignancy (n = 9), hypopituitarism (n = 4), suspicion of adrenal insufficiency (n = 3, not confirmed) and autoimmune disease (n = 2).

### Therapy for SIAD: what does the future hold? [^113rohyY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia, the most frequent electrolyte abnormality, is defined as serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/l and is associated with significant morbidity and excess mortality, with its commonest cause being SIAD (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis). Except for patients with severe symptoms requiring treatment with hypertonic saline, the vast majority of patients with SIAD experience mild to moderate symptoms and receive fluid restriction as first-line therapy. The last major international guidelines, published in 2014, agreed on the limited evidence base of therapeutic approach, while they led to diverging recommendations with regard to the suggested second-line therapies. A US consensus statement suggests the use of tolvaptan as second-line agentin contrast to the European guidelines which do not recommend its use, suggesting oral urea instead. In the era of evidence-based medicine, there has been surprising sparsity of high-quality data for the treatment of SIAD until 2020, with the exception for placebo-controlled trials of vasopressin receptor antagonists.

Fluid restriction, the mainstay treatment for SIAD in the last decades, had not been prospectively evaluated until recently. Real-world data have recorded its limited efficacy, with a response rate estimated at around 50%. Fluid restriction is also unlikely to achieve significant sodium correction in cases of limited free water excretion, such as when urine osmolality exceeds 500 mOsm/kg or the serum to urine electrolyte ratio is greater than 1. In 2020, the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) of fluid restriction for SIAD was published, showing significant, but modest, efficacy, as evidenced by a median sodium rise of 3 mmol/l over a 72-h period, with one third of patients being non-responders. These data highlight the need for additional therapies in a substantial proportion of patients. The choice of second-line therapy has been a subject to great debate with options including tolvaptan, urea, combination of furosemide and sodium chloride, demeclocycline, and, recently, empagliflozin.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^111VoLwe]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety and tolerability of oral urea

In five patients (3%), hyponatremia was overcorrected, including three patients in whom plasma sodium rose by 14 ± 1 mmol/L in 24 h and two patients in whom plasma sodium rose 24 ± 6 mmol/L in 48 h (Table 5). One patient had another cause for the rise in plasma sodium, namely the development of AVP deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) after neurosurgery. Baseline plasma sodium in patients who experienced overcorrection was significantly lower than in those who did not (123 vs 127 mmol/L, P = 0.04). The daily oral urea dose in patients who experienced overcorrection was similar to that in those who did not (30 g/day, IQR 30–35 vs 30 g/day, IQR 21–30, P = 0.19). In response to overcorrection, oral urea and fluid restriction were discontinued in four and three patients, respectively. Three patients also received plasma sodium relowering therapy (hypotonic fluids n = 3, desmopressin n = 1). No cases of suspected ODS were identified. Regarding tolerability, 20 patients (12%) reported poor palatability, 10 patients (6%) reported gastro-intestinal complaints and 1 patient (1%) reported headache. Side effects led to discontinuation of oral urea in 17 patients (11%). The incidence of side effects was similar between the two oral urea formulations (P = 0.52).

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115evmgn]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Use of urea for the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone: a systematic review [^114y9CXs]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatremia, a common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients, is associated with increased mortality. Depending on the serum sodium level and the acuity, clinical presentations may include gait disturbance or various degrees of neurocognitive impairments. A common etiology for hyponatremia is the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). The therapy for patients with hyponatremia due to SIADH depends on the severity of the hyponatremia and the clinical condition of the patient.

Although urea is not commonly used for SIADH treatment worldwide, it was recommended for this purpose in a 2014 joint guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia by the European Renal Association–European Dialysis and Transplant Association, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, and the European Society of Endocrinology. However, this recommendation was classified as weak and was based on the lowest level of evidence (ie, grade D).

We therefore aimed to systematically review the currently available evidence for or against urea for hyponatremia from SIADH. Specifically, our objectives were to systematically review the effectiveness of urea vs vaptan receptor antagonists (VRAs) in terms of increasing the plasma sodium concentration of patients with SIADH, the safety of urea vs all other treatment regarding the incidence of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), the cost of illness of SIADH and specifically the in-hospital resource utilization including length of stay, intensive care unit usage, specialist consultations, number or frequency of blood draws, and cost of prescription drugs. Additionally, we sought to compare the effectiveness of urea against treatments other than VRAs, including supportive measures such as treating the underlying disease, fluid restriction, sodium administration with or without a loop diuretic, and the use of demeclocycline or lithium.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^114EsrDx]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for selection of studies

We included evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia. We defined clinical practice guidelines as statements that included recommendations intended to optimize patient care informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. We defined consensus statements as documents containing clinically relevant suggestions or recommendations based on the collective opinion of an expert panel. We included all publications independent of language. We excluded guidelines related to the prevention of hyponatremia as well as guidelines relevant to conditions associated with hyponatremia if they were not specifically designed to address hyponatremia. Hence, we excluded guidelines targeting treatment of heart failure, cirrhosis, and cancer unless they were developed with a focus on hyponatremia as a complication. Finally, we also excluded draft unpublished guidelines, conference or discussion papers, personal opinions, and obsolete guidelines replaced by updated recommendations from the same organization.

Search methods for guidelines and consensus statements

We searched MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2014), combining vocabulary terms and text words for hyponatremia with terms related to clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements. We also searched guideline databases and websites of organizations as well as of selected professional specialist societies in nephrology, endocrinology, and intensive care medicine. A list of the databases and websites along with the full search strategies are outlined in Additional file 1. EN and JV independently screened the titles and abstracts and discarded those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Full texts for potentially relevant guidelines or consensus statements were retrieved and examined for eligibility. Both the initial screening and subsequent full-paper assessment stage were completed using Early Review Organizing Software.

Data collection process and data items

We developed a draft data extraction form which was piloted and modified as necessary. The extracted data included document characteristics (e.g. year of publication, country/region, development team, funding organization), recommendations related to the diagnosis and assessment of hyponatremia, and recommendations related to the treatment of hyponatremia. EN and JV extracted all data using the standardized data extraction form (Additional file 2) and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

### Hyponatremia: current treatment strategies and the role of vasopressin antagonists [^114dCs4r]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Hyponatremia is a complex electrolyte disorder that results mainly from dysregulation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) by osmotic and nonosmotic mechanisms. Several populations, including the elderly, are at risk for the development of hyponatremia, and awareness of such risk factors can lead to an overall improvement in patient care. AVP receptor antagonists are promising new therapeutic options whose safety and efficacy have been clinically established for some forms of hyponatremia.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE (1967-March 2007) was conducted, using the search terms aquaporins, AVP, AVP receptor antagonists, conivaptan, hyponatremia, lixivaptan, and tolvaptan. Additionally, data were obtained from manufacturers' prescribing information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles identified from the reference search and data sources were evaluated. Material was included in this review if it was relevant to the pathophysiology and management of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients.

Data Synthesis

A large percentage of hospitalized patients are found to have symptomatic or asymptomatic hyponatremia. One study reported that 24.5% of intensive care patients admitted over a 3 month period experienced hyponatremia at some time during their hospitalization. Conventional management techniques include water restriction, demeclocycline, lithium, and urea, which have demonstrated variable efficacy and toxicity. AVP receptor antagonists, whose safety and efficacy have been established in clinical trials, are providing new therapeutic options.

Conclusions

AVP receptor antagonists appear to be safe and effective for the treatment of patients with hyponatremia. With conivaptan recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in treating euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients and lixivaptan and tolvaptan in the late stages of development, prudent use of these agents requires a thorough understanding of the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia to optimize therapeutic outcomes.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^113fEaVG]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) is a common cause of hyponatremia in hospitalized children. SIAD refers to euvolemic hyponatremia due to nonphysiologic stimuli for arginine vasopressin production in the absence of renal or endocrine dysfunction. SIAD can be broadly classified as a result of tumors, pulmonary or central nervous system disorders, medications, or other causes such as infection, inflammation, and the postoperative state. The presence of hypouricemia with an elevated fractional excretion of urate can aid in the diagnosis. Treatment options include fluid restriction, intravenous saline solutions, oral sodium supplements, loop diuretics, oral urea, and vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans).
