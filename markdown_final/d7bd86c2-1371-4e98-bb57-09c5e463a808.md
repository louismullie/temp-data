## Question

blood test for chagas

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which blood tests are used to diagnose Trypanosoma cruzi infection (Chagas disease) and how to apply them in acute and chronic scenarios, including considerations for special populations and handling discordant results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the phase of infection and why we are testing. Then, I should verify the correct first-line tests for acute versus chronic disease. Next, I need to confirm the dual-test serologic algorithm and how to resolve discordant results. After that, I should review special situations such as pregnancy, infants, and immunocompromised hosts. Finally, I need to check limitations of assays, geographic variability, and outline follow-up, staging, and treatment monitoring considerations [^112uAjCQ] [^112Sfp7v] [^112Cu9vL].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and phase, because the diagnostic strategy hinges on whether this is acute infection with circulating parasites or chronic infection where diagnosis is antibody-based; screening asymptomatic people with epidemiologic risk, evaluating symptomatic patients with possible cardiac or GI disease, and managing special populations (pregnant women, infants of seropositive mothers, and immunocompromised patients) are the main scenarios that change the initial test choice and urgency of confirmatory steps [^112uAjCQ] [^113x7DeG] [^112Sfp7v].

> For suspected acute infection within roughly the first 8–12 weeks after exposure, I should prioritize direct parasitologic detection and molecular testing because parasitemia is typically present; that means microscopy of fresh anticoagulated blood or buffy coat (including Giemsa-stained smears) and PCR/qPCR for T. cruzi DNA, as antibodies may not yet be detectable in early acute disease [^113x7DeG] [^112Sfp7v] [^114Yy453].

> Hold on, I should verify the chronic-phase approach, since most diagnoses occur there; in chronic infection, parasitemia is low or intermittent, so diagnosis relies on serology for IgG antibodies and must use at least two distinct assays based on different antigens or methods because no single test has adequate sensitivity and specificity to stand alone [^112uAjCQ] [^112Cu9vL] [^112Sfp7v].

> Next, I will examine test selection for the two-assay strategy; I need to ensure different techniques (for example, ELISA plus IFA) and different antigen preparations (such as whole parasite lysate versus recombinant antigens) are used, recognizing that several commercial ELISAs and chemiluminescent assays are available, and although some platforms show excellent performance, guidelines still require two distinct tests to confirm chronic infection [^112uAjCQ] [^116rtH4f] [^114BmZ6v].

> Wait, let me verify how to interpret results; if both serologic tests are positive, I can confirm chronic T. cruzi infection and proceed to staging and management, whereas if both are negative, chronic infection is unlikely but I must reassess timing and consider acute-phase testing or repeat serology if exposure was recent, and if results are discordant (one positive, one negative), I should obtain a third distinct test as a tie-breaker, consistent with CDC's algorithmic approach in low-prevalence settings [^112Cu9vL] [^114HNFKo] [^115er1jM].

> I should double-check considerations in low-prevalence settings because false positives are more common; using a high-sensitivity screening assay followed by confirmatory testing and a third assay for discordance improves positive predictive value, and I need to counsel patients about the possibility of discordant or indeterminate results pending resolution [^112Cu9vL] [^115er1jM] [^114HNFKo].

> Let me think about pregnancy specifically; I almost said universal prenatal screening in the United States is recommended, but hold on, I should verify the nuance: CDC advises targeted screening before or during pregnancy for those with epidemiologic risk while not recommending universal routine screening in all U.S. pregnancies absent exposure risk, and infants of seropositive mothers require specific evaluation for congenital infection [^116FvGGX] [^112mSe8R] [^112uAjCQ].

> For infants born to seropositive mothers, I need to ensure I do not rely on serology alone early because maternal IgG persists up to 9–12 months; instead, I should use direct parasitology and/or PCR at birth with follow-up, and if early tests are negative but suspicion remains, repeat assessments with definitive serology at 9–12 months can establish or exclude congenital infection as transferred antibodies wane [^116s6NLb] [^116FU6ze] [^114eL7cs].

> I should confirm detailed infant follow-up: if PCR is initially negative, serial monitoring is appropriate and a persistent or rising antibody titer after 9 months warrants confirmatory testing at CDC; conversely, seronegativity by 9–12 months indicates absence of infection, aligning with the standard evaluation algorithms for congenital Chagas disease [^116ZiyqC] [^114eL7cs] [^116FU6ze].

> Next, I should review immunocompromised hosts; people with HIV or transplant recipients who have epidemiologic risk should undergo baseline serology using at least two tests, and for those with donor-derived infection or risk of reactivation, serial qPCR monitoring (weekly in months 1–2, every 2 weeks in months 3–4, then monthly in months 5–6) is recommended, recognizing that a positive PCR alone does not equal reactivation; falling Ct values indicating rising parasite load should prompt intervention [^116rtH4f] [^115vKgpZ] [^112Cu9vL].

> I will now examine key limitations and geographic variability, because I need to ensure interpretation accounts for assay performance; there is no gold standard, serologic tests vary by antigen source and platform, cross-reactivity can occur (notably with Leishmania), and reactivity can differ substantially by region due to parasite strain and host factors, leading to higher false positives/negatives and underscoring the requirement for two distinct assays [^114BmZ6v] [^113tdPpF] [^112Cu9vL].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should reconcile PCR's role outside the acute phase; while qPCR methods are analytically robust, PCR sensitivity in chronic infection is limited and intermittent, so PCR is not a standalone diagnostic for chronic disease but is valuable for detecting parasitemia in acute disease and for treatment monitoring, where persistent or recurrent positivity may indicate failure or reactivation [^114Yy453] [^116vAMCt] [^111set1p].

> Let me reconsider how to stage and manage once infection is confirmed; I should obtain cardiac and gastrointestinal assessments as indicated (for example, ECG, echocardiogram, ambulatory monitoring, and GI imaging where symptomatic), and I should discuss antitrypanosomal therapy, which is recommended in acute and congenital infection and generally considered in chronic infection without established organ damage, while acknowledging that serologic cure in adults may take years and cannot be used for short-term decision-making [^1158nLPf] [^117MdZV9] [^116Ht96U].

> I need to ensure treatment response monitoring uses feasible biomarkers; because conventional seroreversion can take years to decades in adults, PCR and emerging serologic approaches can complement follow-up, with PCR helping reveal early parasitologic failure and advanced multiplex serology offering earlier signals of antibody decline in research and trial contexts [^111set1p] [^115L4s3m] [^116CvTzt].

> But wait, what if initial results are negative and recent exposure is suspected; I should advise repeat testing after a suitable window or use acute-phase diagnostics if clinically indicated, and I should also consider screening family members with similar exposure histories and all children of infected mothers to close the loop on secondary case finding in at-risk networks [^112uAjCQ] [^111fcMBQ] [^112nUykA].

> In summary, I should confirm the following practical algorithm: identify risk and phase of infection; for acute suspicion, use microscopy and PCR; for chronic suspicion, obtain two distinct serologic assays and add a third if discordant; adapt testing for pregnancy, infants, and immunocompromised hosts; account for assay limitations and geographic variability; and after confirmation, stage organ involvement, consider antitrypanosomal therapy, and monitor with PCR and clinical follow-up while recognizing the slow kinetics of seroreversion in adults [^113x7DeG] [^112uAjCQ] [^112Cu9vL].

Blood testing for Chagas disease depends on disease phase: **acute infection** is diagnosed by direct parasite detection (microscopy or PCR) [^113x7DeG] [^112Sfp7v], whereas **chronic infection** requires two distinct serologic assays (ELISA, IFA, or rapid tests) [^112uAjCQ], with a third test if results are discordant [^112zVTaL] [^115er1jM]. PCR is useful for early detection, monitoring treatment response [^114Yy453], and detecting reactivation in immunosuppressed patients [^115vKgpZ], but it is not a standalone diagnostic for chronic disease [^111o1paU]. Testing is recommended for **individuals from endemic areas** [^113EKwnd] [^1128FBcE], at-risk pregnant women [^116FvGGX], and immunosuppressed patients with epidemiologic risk factors [^116rtH4f].

## Blood tests for Chagas disease

Blood tests for Chagas disease fall into **two main groups**:

- **Serological tests**, which detect antibodies against T. cruzi and are used primarily to diagnose chronic infection.
- **Molecular tests**, which detect parasite DNA and are used primarily for acute infection diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and detecting reactivation in immunosuppressed patients [^112Sfp7v].

---

## Serological tests

Serological tests are the **primary method for diagnosing chronic Chagas disease** [^112Sfp7v]. The CDC and WHO recommend using at least two distinct serological assays to confirm chronic infection [^112uAjCQ], as no single test is sufficiently sensitive and specific [^112zVTaL]. Commonly used serological tests include:

| **Test type** | **Description** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) | Detects antibodies against T. cruzi antigens | High (95–100%) | High (98–100%) |
| IFA (indirect immunofluorescence assay) | Detects antibodies using fluorescent-labeled antigens | High (95–100%) | High (98–100%) |
| Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) | Immunochromatographic assays for point-of-care testing | Variable (70–99%) | Variable (85–100%) [^116XdCPt] [^112QJDZG] |

---

Serological tests are **not recommended for diagnosing acute infection**, as antibodies may not be detectable early in infection [^113x7DeG] [^112Sfp7v].

---

## Molecular tests

Molecular tests, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), detect T. cruzi DNA in blood samples [^114Yy453]. PCR is **highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing acute infection**, for monitoring treatment response [^114Yy453], and for detecting reactivation in immunosuppressed patients [^115vKgpZ]. However, PCR is not recommended as a standalone diagnostic method for chronic infection due to intermittent parasitemia and potential false negatives [^111o1paU] [^116vAMCt].

---

## Diagnostic algorithms

The CDC and WHO **outline diagnostic algorithms** for Chagas disease:

- **Acute infection**: Direct parasitological tests (microscopy) or PCR [^113x7DeG] [^112Sfp7v].

- **Chronic infection**: Two distinct serological assays (ELISA, IFA, or RDTs) [^112uAjCQ]. If results are discordant, a third test is required [^112zVTaL] [^115er1jM].

- **Congenital infection**: PCR or microscopic examination of blood smears after birth [^116s6NLb]. Serological testing is not recommended for infants due to maternal antibody persistence [^116FU6ze].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Blood testing for Chagas disease faces several **limitations and challenges**:

- **Geographic variability**: Test performance varies by geographic region due to genetic diversity of T. cruzi strains [^113tdPpF] [^112QJDZG].

- **Cross-reactivity**: Serological tests may cross-react with other parasitic infections, such as leishmaniasis [^115PUVNJ], leading to false positives.

- **Lack of gold standard**: No single test is considered a gold standard, necessitating multiple tests for accurate diagnosis [^112zVTaL] [^114ddhZP].

- **Limited access**: Diagnostic tests may not be readily available in non-endemic regions, leading to underdiagnosis [^111qDvWR] [^112Cu9vL].

---

## Clinical implications

Accurate diagnosis of Chagas disease through blood testing has **significant clinical implications**:

- **Early detection**: Enables timely treatment [^113EKwnd], reducing the risk of chronic complications such as cardiomyopathy and gastrointestinal disease [^117MdZV9] [^116CvTzt].

- **Treatment monitoring**: PCR [^114Yy453] and serological tests [^115L4s3m] are used to monitor treatment response and detect reactivation in immunosuppressed patients.

- **Public health**: Screening of blood donors [^114HNFKo], pregnant women [^116FvGGX], and at-risk populations [^1128FBcE] helps prevent transmission and control the spread of the disease [^113EKwnd].

---

Blood testing for Chagas disease uses serological and molecular methods: serology is the primary approach for chronic infection, and PCR is used for acute infection. Accurate diagnosis requires **multiple tests** due to geographic variability, cross-reactivity, and the lack of a gold standard [^112Sfp7v].

### Evaluation of adult chronic Chagas' heart disease diagnosis by molecular and serological methods [^111o1paU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Chagas' disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in Latin America. T. cruzi presents heterogeneous populations and comprises two main genetic lineages, named T. cruzi I and T. cruzi II. Diagnosis in the chronic phase is based on conventional serological tests, including indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and diagnosis in the acute phase is based on parasitological methods, including hemoculture.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic procedures of Chagas' disease in adult patients in the chronic phase by using a PCR assay and conventional serological tests, including TESA-blot as the gold standard. Samples were obtained from 240 clinical chronic chagasic patients. The sensitivities, compared to that of TESA-blot, were 70% for PCR using the kinetoplast region, 75% for PCR using the nuclear repetitive region, 99% for IIF, and 95% for ELISA.

According to the serological tests results, we recommend that researchers assess the reliability and sensitivity of the commercial kit Chagatest ELISA recombinant, version 3.0 (Chagatest Rec v3.0; Wiener Lab, Rosario, Argentina), due to the lack of sensitivity. Based on our analysis, we concluded that PCR cannot be validated as a conventional diagnostic technique for Chagas' disease. These data have been corroborated by low levels of concordance with serology test results.

It is recommended that PCR be used only for alternative diagnostic support. Using the nuclear repetitive region of T. cruzi, PCR could also be applicable for monitoring patients receiving etiologic treatment.

### Analytical validation of quantitative real-time PCR methods for quantification of Trypanosoma cruzi DNA in blood samples from Chagas disease patients [^114Yy453]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2015). Low credibility.

An international study was performed by 26 experienced PCR laboratories from 14 countries to assess the performance of duplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) strategies on the basis of TaqMan probes for detection and quantification of parasitic loads in peripheral blood samples from Chagas disease patients. Two methods were studied: satellite DNA (SatDNA) qPCR and kinetoplastid DNA (kDNA) qPCR. Both methods included an internal amplification control. Reportable range, analytical sensitivity, limits of detection and quantification, and precision were estimated according to international guidelines. In addition, inclusivity and exclusivity were estimated with DNA from stocks representing the different Trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units and Trypanosoma rangeli and Leishmania spp.

Both methods were challenged against 156 blood samples provided by the participant laboratories, including samples from acute and chronic patients with varied clinical findings, infected by oral route or vectorial transmission. kDNA qPCR showed better analytical sensitivity than SatDNA qPCR with limits of detection of 0.23 and 0.70 parasite equivalents/mL, respectively. Analyses of clinical samples revealed a high concordance in terms of sensitivity and parasitic loads determined by both SatDNA and kDNA qPCRs. This effort is a major step toward the international validation of qPCR methods for the quantification of T. cruzi DNA in human blood samples, aiming to provide an accurate surrogate biomarker for diagnosis and treatment monitoring for patients with Chagas disease.

### Serodiscordance in chronic Chagas disease diagnosis: a real problem in non-endemic countries [^112zVTaL]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

According to the WHO, chronic Chagas disease (CD) diagnosis is based on two serological techniques. To establish a definitive diagnosis, the results must be concordant. In cases of discordance, the WHO proposes repeating serology in a new sample, and if results remain inconclusive, a confirmatory test should be performed. This study, conducted at two Tropical Medicine Units in Europe over four years, aims to assess the diagnostic yield of TESA- (trypomastigote excreted-secreted antigens) blot as a confirmatory technique in patients with inconclusive and discordant results.

Of 4,939 individuals screened, 1,124 (22.7%) obtained positive results and 165 (3.3%) had discordant results. Serology was repeated in 88 of the 165 sera, and discrepancies were resolved in 25 of 88 (28.4%) cases. Patients without a definitive diagnosis were classified into two different groups: Group 1 includes patients with inconclusive results despite retesting (n = 63), while Group 2 includes patients with discordant results not retested (n = 77).

TESA-blot was performed on all of Group 1 and 39 of the 77 in Group 2 and was positive for 33 of 63 (52.4%) and 21 of 39 (53.8%), respectively. Analysis of Group 1 results showed a moderate agreement between the results of the ELISA based on native antigen and TESA-blot (κ = 0.53). In contrast, a clear disagreement was observed between the ELISA based on recombinant antigens and TESA-blot (κ < 0). A sizeable proportion of patients are suspected to have CD with inconclusive results, or retesting is not feasible. TESA-blot was positive in half of these patients, highlighting the need for a confirmatory approach in these cases.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^113EKwnd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

- **Abstract**: Chagas disease affects an estimated 326,000–347,000 people in the United States and is severely underdiagnosed. Lack of awareness and clarity regarding screening and diagnosis is a key barrier. This article provides straightforward recommendations, with the goal of simplifying identification and testing of people at risk for US healthcare providers.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary working group of clinicians and researchers with expertise in Chagas disease agreed on six main questions and developed recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, after reviewing the relevant literature on Chagas disease in the United States.

- **Results**: Individuals who were born or resided for prolonged time periods in endemic countries of Mexico and Central and South America should be tested for Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and family members of people who test positive should be screened. Women of childbearing age with risk factors and infants born to seropositive mothers deserve special consideration due to the risk of vertical transmission. Diagnostic testing for chronic T. cruzi infection should be conducted using two distinct assays.

- **Conclusions**: Increasing provider-directed screening for T. cruzi infection is key to addressing this neglected public health challenge in the United States.

For specific circumstances related to Chagas disease in patients with HIV, the DHHS 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining testing for antibodies to *Trypanosoma cruzi*. This should be done using at least two serological tests based on different antigens, such as whole parasite lysate and recombinant antigens, and/or techniques such as ELISA and IFA, in all patients with HIV infection who have epidemiologic risk factors for Chagas disease.

### Parasites - American trypanosomiasis (also known as chagas disease) [^116FvGGX]. CDC (2021). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for Chagas disease, specifically with respect to indications for screening in pregnancy, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining screening for Trypanosoma cruzi infection before or during pregnancy in females at risk for Chagas disease. Females who have lived in Mexico, Central America, and South America are at the greatest risk for Chagas disease.

### Parasites - American trypanosomiasis (also known as Chagas disease) [^112uAjCQ]. CDC (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chagas disease, specifically with respect to serology, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining serologic tests for antibodies to the parasite for the diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease. It is advised to obtain two or more tests using different techniques, such as ELISA and IFA, which detect antibodies to different antigens, as a single test is not sufficiently sensitive and specific to make the diagnosis.

### Evaluation of the Elecsys Chagas assay for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in a multicenter study in Europe and Latin America [^1175J6ZF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Serology is the preferred method to confirm a Chagas disease diagnosis and to screen blood donors. A battery of assays is often required due to the limited accuracy of single assays. The Elecsys Chagas assay is a newly developed, double-antigen sandwich assay for use on the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers, intended to identify individuals infected with Trypanosoma cruzi for diagnosis and screening.

The performance of the Elecsys Chagas assay was evaluated in comparison with other widely used T. cruzi antibody assays at multiple sites across Europe and Latin America. Relative sensitivity and specificity were assessed using samples from blood donors, pregnant women, and hospitalized patients in both endemic and non-endemic regions for Chagas disease. The Elecsys Chagas assay demonstrated an overall relative sensitivity of 100% (n = 674).

- **Relative specificities**:
	- 99.90% (n = 14,681) for blood donors
	- 100% (n = 313) for pregnant women
	- 100% (n = 517) for hospitalized patients

- **Analytical specificity**: 99.83% (n = 594)

The Elecsys Chagas assay detected T. cruzi antibodies in two World Health Organization (WHO) standard T. cruzi reference panels (panels 09/188 and 09/186) at a 1:512 dilution, corresponding to a cutoff sensitivity of approximately 1 mIU/ml. The assay demonstrated robust performance under routine conditions at multiple sites in Europe and Latin America. In contrast to other available Chagas assays, the Elecsys assay uses a reduced number of recombinant T. cruzi antigens.

### Cord blood sample screening for evidence of maternal Chagas disease [^117PRzeW]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The authors' use of the term "incidence" does not align with its epidemiologic definition. They state, "The incidence of confirmed Chagas disease among mothers who donated their neonate's cord blood varied over time", "The incidence of Chagas disease varied over time", and "A strength of this study is its large sample size, particularly because the incidence of this disease is low". However, no incident T. cruzi infections were identified by their study, nor was evidence of acute infection presented. All mothers who donated cord blood were chronically infected; testing revealed the prevalence of positive results among the samples tested over a given period (had the numbers used been accurate, which they were not). This distinction is critical because acute infections are more likely to be transmitted through blood transfusion, and patients' infections are more likely to be successfully cured by antitrypanosomal treatment during the acute phase, before the development of cardiac manifestations.

Preventing and controlling congenital Chagas disease is a significant public health issue; screening of mothers at risk for transmitting T. cruzi infection to their babies is considered key to this effort. The evidence base to support screening recommendations must be high-quality and accurate. Other studies have highlighted this risk in the US population, particularly among Latin American immigrant mothers, but further evidence is needed to guide policy recommendations. The report of Edwards et al. could contribute to this need.

### Trypanosoma cruzi recombinant complement regulatory protein: a novel antigen for use in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of Chagas' disease [^1155zz1q]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

Currently, the diagnosis of Chagas' disease is based on serological methods, but due to the high occurrence of inconclusive results, more reliable methods are needed. The use of recombinant antigens for the serodiagnosis of Chagas' disease is recommended to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the serological tests. The Trypanosoma cruzi complement regulatory protein (CRP) is a surface glycoprotein present on the trypomastigote forms of the parasite. The recombinant CRP (rCRP) was cloned in a mammalian expression system and purified by affinity chromatography.

The purified recombinant protein was used as an antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (rCRP ELISA) to verify its sensitivity and specificity compared with other established methods. In this evaluation, a panel of 184 serum samples, distributed among chronic chagasic patients (n = 65), blood bank donors (n = 100), and patients infected with Leishmania spp. (n = 19), was used. The sensitivity and specificity of the rCRP ELISA were 100% when compared to conventional serology and complement-mediated lysis tests from these groups.

When hemoculture and PCR tests were evaluated for the diagnosis of chronic chagasic patients, using the rCRP ELISA as a reference test, the positivities were found to be 64.62% and 81.54%, respectively, showing a higher degree of sensitivity of the test. The data demonstrate that rCRP ELISA was able to discriminate between chronic chagasic patients and nonchagasic individuals, such as blood donors and patients with leishmaniasis. Thus, the rCRP is an excellent antigen for this purpose.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^115vKgpZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Immunosuppressed patients with acute T. cruzi infection, such as those with donor-derived infection, are at risk for severe manifestations like meningoencephalitis or acute myocarditis. Recipients of blood components, organs, or tissues from an infected donor should be monitored using serial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the blood weekly during months 1–2, every 2 weeks during months 3–4, and monthly during months 5–6 posttransfusion or transplant. Monitoring frequency should then be adjusted based on the clinical scenario.

Immunosuppression in individuals with chronic T. cruzi infection may lead to reactivation, characterized by a return to high levels of parasitemia. In transplant recipients, the manifestations of reactivation vary depending on host characteristics and the immunosuppressive regimen; reactivation myocarditis can be life-threatening. A positive PCR result does not constitute a diagnosis of reactivation, as this can occur in patients with chronic infection in the absence of reactivation. Serial monitoring by quantitative PCR, following a schedule similar to that outlined above, provides early detection of reactivation indicated by falling cycle threshold (Ct) values, which reflect rising parasite loads. The US CDC offers consultation on patient management and serves as a reference laboratory to monitor for reactivation using serial PCR. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-T. cruzi coinfected patients, the most common manifestations of reactivation include central nervous system (CNS) mass lesions, with or without meningoencephalitis, and myocarditis.

### Nationwide exposure of U.S. working dogs to the Chagas disease parasite [^1169cJTi]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Serologic and molecular testing was performed after aliquots of anticoagulated whole blood were collected. The blood was spun and separated into serum, clot, plasma, and buffy coat, then frozen at −20°C until analysis. Serum samples were screened for anti–T. cruzi antibodies using Chagas Stat-Pak® (ChemBio Diagnostic Systems Inc, Medford, NY), a rapid immunochromatographic test designed for human use. This method had been previously described.

Tests were considered negative when no color developed and positive when a clear line developed. Very faint bands that were not perceptible enough to be considered a clear positive, yet showed some low level of color development to differentiate them from negative, were tracked as "inconclusive" and subjected to additional testing.

- **Further testing**:
	- All positive and inconclusive samples as determined by Stat-Pak®, plus 10% of the negatives, were tested using the following methods:
		1. The indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test, performed by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL, College Station, TX). Titer values of 20 or higher were considered positive according to the TVMDL standard protocol.
		2. Trypanosoma Detect™ (InBios, International, Inc, Seattle, WA), another rapid immunochromatographic test designed for human use.

- **Detection sensitivity and specificity**:
	- Both immunochromatographic tests have been used for antibody detection in dogs and have shown high sensitivity and specificity when compared with IFA. If two or more of the three tests were positive, an individual was classified as seropositive. In cases where inconclusive results (faint bands) were present, they were counted as negative.

### Geographic variations in test reactivity for the serological diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection [^112QJDZG]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Understanding the performance of serological tests is critical for the optimal identification of infected patients and for Chagas disease surveillance. However, it is hindered by a lack of a gold standard for serological diagnostics. To overcome this limitation, we used a cohort of 481 true-infected samples, as determined by PCR for the parasite. These samples were derived from a multicountry study, and we measured the reactivity of two rapid diagnostic tests and one ELISA, all based on different sets of recombinant antigens or fusion proteins covering several antigens.

The overall reactivity of the three tests was rather low, ranging from 70.5% to 90.4%. Most remarkably, there were important differences in test reactivity among countries; tests performed best in Argentina and poorly in Mexico. It is also interesting that both rapid tests had better reactivity than the ELISA, but this may be an overestimation due to the enrollment of women based on a reactive rapid test in cord blood samples from their newborns.

When considering combinations of serological tests, as currently required to establish seropositivity of a patient, the highest reactivity was obtained when considering any one of the two rapid tests plus ELISA, reaching 70.5%. Strikingly, even in Argentina, where tests performed the best, over 12% of infection cases from this cohort were missed by serological tests. Even more concerning, over 21% of infections were missed in Honduras and an alarming 72% of infections in Mexico. Considering that these commercial tests are among the most widely used in Mexico, further investigation is warranted.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^114eL7cs]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Infants in whom congenital Chagas disease (CD) is suspected should undergo evaluation using existing CDC-based recommendations (strong, moderate). Edwards et al. (2019) provides a comprehensive review of diagnosis and treatment of congenital CD, which is summarized here. Infants born to women with suspected or confirmed CD and infants with clinical features of congenital infection born to women at risk for CD should undergo evaluation as soon as possible after birth. This aims to detect hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia, and, as indicated, pneumonitis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or meningoencephalitis. The cure rate for treatment in the first year of infection exceeds 90%, and treatment is well tolerated.

If the mother's infection status is unknown, serologic testing for T. cruzi immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies should be performed to determine infant risk. Diagnosis of congenital infection relies on the detection of motile trypomastigotes through microscopic examination of a wet mount of fresh anticoagulated blood or buffy coat specimen (collected in a microhematocrit tube), detection of parasites on Giemsa-stained blood smears, and/or PCR testing.

### Architect Chagas® as a single test candidate for Chagas disease diagnosis: Evaluation of two algorithms implemented in a non-endemic setting (Barcelona, Spain) [^113Y2CkN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). High credibility.

To evaluate two algorithms for the diagnosis of chronic and congenital Chagas disease (CD), both include the chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay Architect Chagas® (CMIA) as a single test, but with an amended signal-to-cut-off ratio (S/CO) of ≥ 6, instead of an S/CO of ≥ 1 as indicated by the manufacturer.

- **Methods**: The study encompassed two panels of retrospective samples: 831 sera from 786 adolescents and adults (panel A), and 96 sera from 35 newborn infants with CD-infected mothers (panel B). A CMIA-negative result was deemed conclusive, whereas samples with an S/CO ≥ 0.8 were confirmed by a second test (BioELISA Chagas, ELISAr).

- **Results**: In panel A, seropositivity was 13% (102/786); 10 samples gave discordant results for CMIA and ELISAr, all of which were CMIA positive and had CD confirmed through a previous diagnosis by two positive serological tests. In panel B, all newborns were considered non-infected based on both a progressive decrease in antibody titres over time and negative real-time PCR results. CMIA still gave positive results in two infants aged 10 months, but no S/CO values ≥ 6 were observed from 4 months on.

- **Conclusions**: CMIA is a firm candidate for use as a single CD diagnostic test in non-endemic countries. The algorithm with the ≥ 6 S/CO is an efficient method for chronic CD diagnosis. CMIA could also be used as a single test to screen infants for congenital infection at the age of 10 months or even earlier if applying the corrected cut-off ratio, although further studies are required.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for Trypanosoma cruzi infection: Field evaluation of two registered kits in a region of endemicity and a region of nonendemicity in Argentina [^114ynCbs]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Low credibility.

In the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of ChD by PAHO, the parameters considered to indicate acceptable performance of RDTs were a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 97%. These guidelines strongly recommend their use for screening or population-based studies and conditionally for diagnosis. Both RDTs evaluated in this study, using whole-blood samples from people living in an area of endemicity, demonstrated better parameters than those recommended in the PAHO guidelines.

RDTs for other infections are widely used for screening, point-of-care diagnosis, detection campaigns, population-based screening, and by laboratories for prelabor and presurgery in emergency services. RDTs for HIV, which are the most widely used, have shown variable performance depending on the manufacturer and the population to which they are applied, with a sensitivity close to 100% (96.2% to 100.0%) and a specificity between 85.3% and 100%. Hepatitis B and syphilis RDTs are also implemented, often as a joint strategy with HIV for the detection of vertical transmission during pregnancy. In the case of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, RDTs are similarly being implemented. Besides the HIV RDTs, the sensitivity and specificity of SD and WL for ChD are similar to or even higher than those of other RDTs used to diagnose infections.

### PCR assay for monitoring Trypanosoma cruzi parasitemia in childhood after specific chemotherapy [^111set1p]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

Assessment of cure of Trypanosoma cruzi infection by antibody seroconversion usually involves several years of follow-up. Parasitological negativity is useless for cure assessment, since even untreated patients mostly show negative results; conversely, positive tests are of great value because they indicate treatment failure. Here, PCR was used to assess the rate of specific chemotherapy failure in a well-characterized Brazilian cohort of T. cruzi-seropositive children, who were enrolled in a field trial of benznidazole (Bz) efficacy. Paired blood samples from 111 children were taken at baseline and 36 months after treatment with either Bz (n = 58) or a placebo (n = 53). DNA extraction and PCR amplification were carried out as previously described, and hybridization was performed with all PCR products. At the end of follow-up, PCR was positive for 39.6% of the patients in the Bz group versus 64.2% in the placebo group (P = 0.01). Untreated patients had a 1.6-fold-higher chance of remaining positive by PCR than those in the Bz group (P < 0.05). We conclude that PCR is a useful tool for revealing therapeutic failure of T. cruzi infection on a short-term basis.

### Evaluation of the performance of the Loopamp Trypanosoma cruzi detection kit for the diagnosis of Chagas disease in an area where it is not endemic, Spain [^113PmzeT]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

In Spain, infection, or Chagas disease (CD), is one of the major imported parasitic diseases. Although vector transmission does not occur in Spain, there are autochthonous cases due to blood transfusion, organ transplant, and congenital transmission (from mothers to children during pregnancy or delivery). Additionally, there are carriers of chronic CD, and it has been estimated that between 47,984 and 86,618 infected people could be residing in Spain. However, the number of cases diagnosed is unknown, as CD is not included in the category of notifiable diseases except in the region of Catalonia. Records from the National Centre for Microbiology (CNM, Spanish acronym) from 1997 to the present show more than 6,000 infected individuals, of which 51 were congenital cases, 5 were transfusion-associated cases, and 2 were due to transmission through organ transplant [CNM data, unpublished].

The serological screening of at-risk blood donors has been mandatory since 2005. Furthermore, half of the Spanish regional health authorities recommend serological screening in pregnant women and their newborns, with the regions of Catalonia, Galicia, and Valencia pioneering the inclusion of a diagnostic algorithm for congenital CD in their official guidelines. In the rest of Spain, serological screening in pregnant women and at-risk migrants is also conducted in the main public hospitals at the discretion of their health professionals.

Most of the CD cases in settings of nonendemicity are in the chronic phase, when the parasite burden is usually low and intermittent.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^1128FBcE]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Chagas disease affects an estimated 326,000–347,000 people in the United States and is severely underdiagnosed. Lack of awareness and clarity regarding screening and diagnosis is a key barrier. This article provides straightforward recommendations, with the goal of simplifying identification and testing of people at risk for US healthcare providers.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary working group of clinicians and researchers with expertise in Chagas disease agreed on six main questions, and developed recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, after reviewing the relevant literature on Chagas disease in the United States.

- **Results**: Individuals who were born or resided for prolonged time periods in endemic countries of Mexico and Central and South America should be tested for Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and family members of people who test positive should be screened. Women of childbearing age with risk factors and infants born to seropositive mothers deserve special consideration due to the risk of vertical transmission. Diagnostic testing for chronic T. cruzi infection should be conducted using two distinct assays.

- **Conclusions**: Increasing provider-directed screening for T. cruzi infection is key to addressing this neglected public health challenge in the United States.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^115er1jM]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

The lack of a gold standard Chagas disease (CD) test necessitates multistep serological testing to confirm chronic T. cruzi infection. Discordant test results can be expected due to imperfect test performance and will be a large proportion of total results, given CD's overall low prevalence in the United States. When the results of the first two assays are discordant, a third test is required to assign a consensus positive or negative status for the presence of IgG antibodies to T. cruzi in the individual.

Diagnostic serologic testing in the United States is primarily available at commercial reference laboratories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Currently, the CDC performs an ELISA (Chagatest Recombinante v0.3.0; Wiener Laboratories) and an immunoblot using trypomastigote excreted-secreted antigens (TESA) when CD serology is requested. If results are discordant, a second sample is requested; if results are again discordant, a third serologic test is run, specifically an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) based on slide-fixed epimastigotes. At the CDC, the TESA and IFA assays are laboratory-developed tests, and all tests are run under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).

Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not clear or approve laboratory-developed tests, but their validation and performance is reviewed during laboratory inspections to maintain CLIA certification. There are no published diagnostic evaluations for the CDC TESA and IFA tests in infected populations of the United States, but these test formats have been widely used.

### Diagnosis of infection status using saliva of infected subjects [^112TMRzZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Chagas disease has the highest prevalence of any parasitic disease in the Americas, affecting 6–7 million people. Conventional diagnosis requires a well-equipped laboratory with experienced personnel. The development of new diagnostic tools that are easy to use and adapted to the reality of affected populations and health systems is still a significant challenge. The main objective of this study was to measure Trypanosoma cruzi infection status using saliva samples of infected subjects. Blood and saliva samples from 20 T. cruzi-seropositive individuals and 10 controls were tested for T. cruzi infection using two different commercial serological tests. We have shown that detection of T. cruzi infection is possible using saliva samples, supporting the potential use of saliva to diagnose Chagas disease in humans. This method could provide a simple, low-cost, but effective tool for the diagnosis of T. cruzi infection. Its noninvasive nature makes it particularly well-suited for endemic areas.

### Geographic variations in test reactivity for the serological diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection [^117S8Syn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Because recommendations require two reactive serological tests to confirm seropositivity, we further examined the proportion of true infections that were detected by serology based on different combinations of serological tests. Considering different combinations of rapid tests plus ELISA, the best performance was obtained with a combination of both rapid tests and ELISA, which allowed identifying 70.5% of true infections (95% CI, 66.2 to 74.4). However, performance was significantly different among countries. In Argentina, up to 87.9% (95% CI, 81.7 to 92.2) of infections and 78.5% (95% CI, 72.7 to 83.3) in Honduras were diagnosed. Strikingly, only 27.9% of infections were detected by serology in Mexico (95% CI, 20.2 to 37.2). Thus, many cases of maternal infection were missed by serology.

- **Serodiagnosis of infection with multiple tests**: Interestingly, the combination of two rapid tests performed similarly to combinations of rapid tests plus ELISA and allowed the identification of 70.8% of all infections (95% CI, 66.7 to 74.8). There was, however, a difference among countries (χ² = 82.8; df = 2; P < 0.0001). In Argentina, 83.9% (95% CI, 77.1 to 88.9) of infections were diagnosed with only two rapid tests, 79.0% (95% CI, 73.2 to 83.7) in Honduras, and only up to 33.7% (95% CI, 25.3 to 43.2) in Mexico.

### Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serological diagnosis of Chagas' disease employing a Trypanosoma cruzi recombinant antigen that consists of four different peptides [^115Lhoqd]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

Serological tests to detect Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies have been used for screening blood donors, for epidemic studies, and for the diagnosis of probably infected persons. Among different tests, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with total, semipurified, or synthetic antigens has been widely used due to its easy automation. To improve serological studies concerning Chagas' disease, we have developed and evaluated a new test, the TcF-ELISA, using an artificially engineered recombinant antigen that contains tandem sequences of different T. cruzi-specific peptides.

The sensibility of the TcF-ELISA was determined with 101 serum samples from chagasic patients well-defined by clinical and epidemiological criteria. The specificity was determined with 39 serum samples from leishmaniasis or kala-azar patients and 150 nonchagasic blood donors from Sao Paulo, Brazil. The TcF-ELISA demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 98.94% specificity. Compared to the conventional ELISA (with semipurified T. cruzi epimastigote antigens), the TcF-ELISA showed advantages, such as better distinction between reagent and nonreagent serum, improved precision, and a lower occurrence of leishmaniasis cross-reactions. Our studies demonstrate high reproducibility between two different lots of the TcF-ELISA and its applicability for the serological diagnosis of Chagas' disease.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Chagas disease [^112Sfp7v]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chagas disease, and specifically concerning blood smear, the PAHO/WHO 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining direct parasitological tests, such as microhematocrit and direct observation. Additionally, any subsequent serological follow-up should be conducted. This includes acute congenital infection starting at 8 months of age and seroconversion for other transmission modes in patients with suspected acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection.

### Early assessment of antibodies decline in Chagas patients following treatment using a serological multiplex immunoassay [^115L4s3m]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Chagas disease, following infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major public health issue, with the disease spreading beyond endemic regions and becoming more global due to the migration of infected individuals. The currently available anti-parasitic drugs, nifurtimox and benznidazole, remain insufficiently evaluated for their efficacy in adult patients. A key challenge is the lack of markers for parasitological cure, which also precludes the development of new treatments. Consequently, there is a critical need for a practical method to assess drug performance within a short timeframe.

In this retrospective analysis of the phase 2 randomized controlled BENDITA trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03378661), we report the potential of a serological multiplex method (MultiCruzi), combined with advanced statistical analytical methods, to measure the response to anti-parasitic treatment of adult Chagas patients. Applying this approach to serum samples from adult patients in the indeterminate chronic stage of Chagas disease, treated with different benznidazole regimens and combinations, we predict treatment efficacy after just six months of follow-up. This is in sharp contrast to the time obtained with conventional and recombinant T. cruzi ELISA tests. The obtained results are also compared with the PCR data. We propose integrating MultiCruzi as a serological method endpoint in proof-of-concept clinical trials for Chagas disease.

### Modelling historical changes in the force-of-infection of Chagas disease to inform control and elimination programmes: application in Colombia [^114XhKXg]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

Serology, as a diagnostic technique for Chagas disease, has several limitations, particularly for detecting the acute phase. These include problems of interpretation as a direct marker of infection, an unknown relationship with disease progression and cure, and not well-understood rates of seroreversion. Although the diagnosis of T. cruzi infection has improved in recent years, especially with the development of PCR-based molecular techniques, their limited sensitivity in the chronic phase (57%–64%) and high cost have confined their use to specialized laboratories, preventing their field testing to replace traditional serology. Therefore, despite its limitations, seroprevalence surveys remain relevant, affordable, and relatively easy to implement in endemic settings, permitting the assessment of transmission patterns and trends, as demonstrated in other studies. However, since different serodiagnostic assays differ in their sensitivity and specificity, it will be crucial to adjust estimates according to the diagnostic performance of the tests used in the various serosurveys, as implemented in this study.

### Evaluation of the performance of Ortho T. cruzi ELISA test system for the detection of antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi [^114BmZ6v]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

The serologic diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease, caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is challenging and lacks a gold-standard assay. To address this issue, the CDC employs an algorithm that uses two tests on different platforms and applies a third test as a tiebreaker. The Ortho T. cruzi ELISA Test System, developed by Ortho Diagnostics, was cleared by the FDA for clinical diagnostic use. This study evaluated the Ortho T. cruzi ELISA Test System against the CDC algorithm for chronic Chagas disease.

We tested various sets of serum specimens: 104 specimens tested positive for T. cruzi specific antibodies, and 283 specimens (including 30 specimens positive for antibodies to Leishmania spp.) tested negative based on the CDC chronic T. cruzi infection diagnostic testing algorithm. The concordance of the Ortho T. cruzi ELISA Test System with the CDC algorithm was 90% (95% CI 87 to 93%) overall and 92% (95% CI 89 to 95%) when excluding Leishmania spp. antibody-positive specimens. The cross-reactivity of the Ortho T. cruzi ELISA Test System was observed to be 37% with Leishmania spp. serologically positive specimens, 1% with specimens from patients diagnosed with other parasitic infections, and 0% against specimens from a noninfected US population.

In conclusion, the Ortho T. cruzi ELISA Test System performs comparably with the CDC diagnostic algorithm for chronic Chagas disease. The availability of this FDA-cleared assay is expected to enhance the diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease.

### Autochthonous Chagas disease - Missouri, 2018 [^114HNFKo]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Low credibility.

Blood donor screening for T. cruzi antibodies in the U.S. blood supply was first implemented in 2007. Positive results from blood donor screening for T. cruzi antibodies should be followed by diagnostic testing. Diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease is based on positive results from at least two serologic tests that use different techniques and different antigen preparations because no single test is sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosis. Commonly used techniques include ELISA using recombinant antigens, TESA, and IFA. This patient's results were positive with EIA and negative with TESA. The CDC's testing algorithm employs a third test when results of the first two tests are discordant. In the Missouri patient, the IFA result was positive for T. cruzi antibody. Based on the patient's testing results, history, and presentation, this patient likely represents the first documented autochthonous case of Chagas disease in Missouri.

Most persons with Chagas disease acquired their infection in parts of Latin America where Chagas disease is endemic. Currently, more than a century after its discovery in Latin America, Chagas disease has a global distribution, including the United States, because of migration from areas with endemic disease. Few cases of locally acquired vector-borne infection have been reported in the United States. The likely autochthonous case described in this report underscores the importance of healthcare provider awareness of possible Chagas disease even in states considered at low risk for this infection and the need for careful consideration of the patient's history and presentation.

### Updated estimates and mapping for prevalence of Chagas disease among adults, United States [^116CvTzt]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Six million persons are estimated to have Chagas disease in the Americas; 20%–30% of these cases will progress to cardiac or gastrointestinal disease. Early treatment of infection with the causative parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, provides the best chance to decrease the risk of progression; cure rates are over 60% in those treated as children. Cure rates among adults, however, are unclear; the accepted test of cure is reversion to negative serologic test results, which can take years to decades. The time to negative serologic results is inversely proportional to the duration of infection. Because the date of T. cruzi infection is nearly always unknown, age is commonly used as a proxy for duration.

Infected persons are typically asymptomatic for decades. In those with established Chagas cardiomyopathy, antiparasitic treatment is unlikely to alter the progression of heart disease. Thus, early, active screening during the asymptomatic period is essential to achieve timely diagnosis and effective treatment. Since the establishment of regional control programs in the 1990s, many Latin American countries have mounted community- and facility-based programs, most commonly focusing on screening of children and pregnant women. No such large-scale programs exist in the United States.

### Geographic variations in test reactivity for the serological diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection [^114ddhZP]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

A key issue in assessing test performance is the lack of a gold standard for the serological diagnosis of infection, so that sensitivity of tests is usually determined using samples that are strongly reactive in multiple serological tests. Discordant samples are considered false positives and often discarded from analyses. To overcome this limitation, we aimed to measure the reactivity of commercial serological tests using a unique cohort of samples with at least one positive PCR and, thus, can be considered true infection cases.

### Comparative evaluation of 11 commercialized rapid diagnostic tests for detecting Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in serum banks in areas of endemicity and nonendemicity [^116XdCPt]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Chagas disease is one of the main public health issues in Latin America. Increasingly, during the past few decades, Trypanosoma cruzi infection has been detected in North America, Europe, and the Western Pacific, mainly as a result of population movement. The limited availability of rapid serological diagnostic tests hinders rapid diagnosis and early treatment in areas of endemicity and nonendemicity.

In collaboration with 11 national reference laboratories (NRLs) from different geographical areas, we evaluated the performances of commercialized serological rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for T. cruzi infection. Eleven commercialized T. cruzi infection RDTs were evaluated on a total of 474 samples extensively tested with at least three different techniques for Chagas disease, maintained at controlled low temperatures, and stored in the serum banks of the 11 NRLs. We measured the sensitivity, specificity, and concordance of each RDT and provided an additional questionnaire to evaluate its ease of use.

The selected RDTs in this study were performed under controlled laboratory conditions. Out of the 11 RDTs, we found 8 of them to be useful, with the cassette format favored over the strip. We did not observe significant differences in RDT performances in the different regions. Overall, the performance results were lower than those disclosed by the manufacturers. The results of this evaluation validate the possibility of using RDTs to diagnose Chagas disease, thereby decreasing the time to treatment at a primary health care facility for patients who are willing to be treated.

### Evaluation of the Elecsys Chagas assay for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in a multicenter study in Europe and Latin America [^1157Ph4k]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

The WHO seeks to promote the identification of novel diagnostic tests for Chagas disease. Although there are a variety of methods available to confirm the presence of infection (ELISA-based methods, immunofluorescence-based methods, immunoblotting, PCR, and microscopy), there is currently no gold standard, and testing of samples with multiple assays is often necessary, creating a combined gold standard as a surrogate. This leaves manufacturers of new, highly sensitive tests with a dilemma.

In the present study, the surrogate gold standard against which the Elecsys assay was compared included at least three serological assays or PCR for the evaluation of relative sensitivity and resolution testing at two independent reference centers using several commercial CE-labeled tests and well-evaluated in-house assays representing state-of-the-art methods for the evaluation of relative specificity.

Our study results support the notion that existing methods worldwide may not be adequate to confirm the results for samples with low-level antibody concentrations, which may be best confirmed according to the epidemiological and clinical background. Equally, the results for samples with higher concentrations in this study could potentially be confirmed with any test. Moreover, our findings add to the evidence suggesting that single assays with improved sensitivity and specificity may be sufficient for screening and diagnosis purposes, respectively.

Since the Elecsys Chagas assay was developed without a gray zone, a clear separation of reactive versus nonreactive samples was valid.

### Acute Chagas disease outbreak among military personnel, Colombia, 2021 [^115oxox6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

We obtained blood and serum samples from the 7 admitted patients. Diagnosis of acute Chagas disease was confirmed using ELISA serology, the Strout concentration method, and molecular tests. In blood samples, quantitative PCR was used to target T. cruzi satellite DNA, and conventional PCR targeted the mini-exon gene. Direct examination of pericardial fluid subsequently revealed parasites.

After confirming Chagas disease, we initiated benznidazole treatment at a dosage of 5–7 mg/kg/d for 60 days for all 7 patients, resulting in favorable outcomes. Informed consent was obtained from all included patients, and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the Hospital Militar Central.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^115EhDEj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

- **Who should be screened for Chagas disease in the United States**: Screening individuals who were born or lived for more than six months in areas of Mexico, Central, or South America where Chagas disease (CD) is endemic can effectively identify new cases.

Within the US population, individuals who have such exposure are at the greatest risk of Trypanosoma cruzi infection. A community-based study of over 4,000 Latin-American born immigrants in Los Angeles showed a seroprevalence of 1.24%. Among those with prolonged exposure in Latin America, seroprevalence is even higher in individuals with characteristic findings on electrocardiogram (ECG) such as bundle-branch blocks, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, or pacemaker placement. This supports the strategy of screening individuals with prolonged exposure in endemic areas of Mexico and Central and South America as a viable approach to identifying new cases. It is essential to screen even those who do not exhibit visible signs or symptoms of CD.

- **Screening recommendations**: Screening first-degree relatives of individuals previously diagnosed with CD can also effectively identify new cases.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for Trypanosoma cruzi infection: Field evaluation of two registered kits in a region of endemicity and a region of nonendemicity in Argentina [^115yqno8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Low credibility.

We conducted a prospective study in 2018 with residents from various Argentine localities. The study locations included Alto La Sierra, Cafayate, San Carlos, and Orán — all in Salta province, a region of endemicity. In contrast, the city of Buenos Aires and its surroundings were selected for their status as a nonendemic area. Endemicity was defined by the natural presence of the vector and vector-borne infections. Although Salta is an endemic region, the localities of interest are subject to vectorial control. The vector is not naturally present in Buenos Aires and its surroundings.

Considering the results obtained in the pilot study from the Alto La Sierra community, where a prevalence of 10% and a sensitivity of the method of 97% was noted (95% confidence interval), the sample size was calculated to be between 440 and 500. Potential participants were randomly invited at health institutions including the National Institute of Parasitology Dr. Mario Fatala Chaben (INP) in Buenos Aires, Nuestra Señora del Rosario Hospital in Cafayate, San Carlos Hospital in San Carlos, Tropical Disease Laboratory in Orán, and Alto La Sierra Hospital. Additionally, surrounding attention centers in the department of Rivadavia, Salta province, were involved. In Salta, communities received study invitations and information through local radio and other health professionals.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chagas disease, specifically concerning work-up, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend considering additional investigations at the clinician's discretion, as indicated by the patient's symptoms or signs, such as:

- **Echocardiography**: This test can help assess heart function and detect potential cardiac issues.

- **24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring**: Useful for identifying arrhythmias or other heart-related abnormalities.

- **Barium studies of the esophagus or colon**: These can aid in the assessment of gastrointestinal involvement in Chagas disease.

### The burden of congenital Chagas disease and implementation of molecular diagnostic tools in Latin America [^112gCFRX]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Low credibility.

Implementation of molecular tools to test for congenital Chagas disease remains a critical priority. Development of point-of-care (PoC) tests to diagnose congenital Chagas disease (CCD) is ongoing, and some biomarkers have shown promising results. Until these PoC tests are fully developed, molecular tools for detection of parasite DNA provide the best alternative to complement existing methods. Several reasons explain the limited implementation of molecular tools in diagnosing CCD in endemic countries, and we review the most relevant here.

- **Lack of clinical evidence**: PCR has demonstrated higher sensitivity for parasite detection compared to conventional methods such as microscopy, hemoculture, or xenodiagnosis. It surpasses conventional methods in both the diagnosis and follow-up of infected newborns. Up to 100% sensitivity has been reported for detecting T. cruzi in neonates within the first 3 months of age, qualifying PCR for early-stage diagnosis of CCD. However, in cases of CCD without persistent parasitaemia, PCR may not be ideal. Consequently, sampling at different time points from birth might be necessary. A cohort study in an endemic setting in Bolivia, which incorporated PCR into the algorithm for detecting vertical transmission of Chagas disease, demonstrated its superiority over serology and microscopy.

- **Lack of standardisation**: Several factors impact the diagnostic performance of PCR and could hinder standardisation across various settings where home-brewed PCR methods are commonly used. These factors range from source, volume, and timing of clinical sampling to more technical issues.

### Geographic variations in test reactivity for the serological diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection [^113tdPpF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Chagas disease is a neglected disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites. Most diagnoses are based on serological tests, but the lack of a gold standard test complicates the measurement of test performance. To overcome this limitation, we used samples from a cohort of well-characterized T. cruzi-infected women to evaluate the reactivity of two rapid diagnostic tests and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our cohort was derived from a previous study on the congenital transmission of T. cruzi and consisted of 481 blood/plasma samples from Argentina (n = 149), Honduras (n = 228), and Mexico (n = 104), with at least one positive T. cruzi PCR.

Reactivity of the three tests ranged from 70.5% for the Wiener ELISA to 81.0% for the T-Detect and 90.4% for the Stat-Pak rapid tests. Test reactivity varied significantly among countries and was highest in Argentina and lowest in Mexico. When considering at least two reactive serological tests to confirm seropositivity, over 12% of T. cruzi infection cases from Argentina were missed by serological tests, over 21% in Honduras, and an alarming 72% in Mexico. Differences in test performance among countries were not due to differences in parasitemia, but differences in antibody levels against ELISA antigens were observed.

Geographic differences in T. cruzi parasite strains, as well as genetic differences among human populations, may both contribute to the discrepancies in serological testing. Improvements in serological diagnostics for T. cruzi infections are critically needed to ensure optimum identification of cases.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^115bj8Gn]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Uncertainties and complexities around Chagas disease (CD) testing processes in the United States pose a major barrier to increasing screening coverage, perpetuating a situation where less than 1% of the estimated population with the disease has been tested. This document provides clear, straightforward guidance to healthcare personnel to facilitate screening and diagnosis of people at risk, ensuring they can receive timely and appropriate care. While more research is needed on the epidemiology of CD in the United States — covering congenital and vector-borne transmission and the burden of disease in specific populations — and on the performance of diagnostic tools in the heterogeneous US patient population, this document presents practical recommendations based on the best information currently available. Ensuring proactive screening of patients will require concerted efforts to increase provider awareness, convey accurate information to the public about CD and its risks, and improve access to and performance of diagnostic technology and tools.

### Geographic Variations in Test Reactivity for the Serological Diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi Infection [^115dxqT9]. Journal of clinical microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite. It is transmitted principally by hematophagous triatomine bugs, although congenital and oral transmissions are gaining importance. Infection leads to chronic cardiac disease in 30 to 40% of patients, eventually causing cardiac failure. Digestive forms of the disease may also develop. The disease affects 6 to 10 million persons, mostly in the Americas, where vectorial transmission is endemic, and is associated with health care costs of over $24 billion.

The identification of infected patients is critical to ensure early treatment and care, as the efficacy of available drugs decreases when the infection becomes more chronic. It is also critical for the screening of blood donors, to avoid transfusion-associated transmission, and for the screening of pregnant women, to identify those at risk of congenital transmission. Finally, it is essential for global disease surveillance to evaluate disease burden. Since most infected persons are chronically infected, diagnosis is mostly based on serological tests that detect circulating antibodies against the parasite. Multiple tests have been developed over the years, often based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platforms and multiple antigens, ranging from crude parasite lysates/extracts to purified antigens or selected recombinant proteins. Several rapid tests based on recombinant proteins and immunochromatographic platforms have also been developed. While most tests are thought to have high sensitivity and specificity, their actu

### Evaluation of the Elecsys Chagas assay for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in a multicenter study in Europe and Latin America [^114RdntX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) is caused by the flagellate protozoan and affects 6 million to 7 million people worldwide, mainly in Latin America. Vector-borne transmission via insects of the subfamily occurs in the Americas; however, infection can also be transmitted congenitally and via blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and the ingestion of food/beverages contaminated with parasites. Although it mainly affects individuals living in regions of endemicity, the disease has now spread to other regions and continents.

The infection is characterized by an acute, often asymptomatic stage lasting 8 to 12 weeks, when active parasitemia is evident. During this stage, diagnosis can be performed by direct microscopy of blood for circulating parasites or via PCR. The infection subsequently enters a chronic phase, and the majority of individuals remain asymptomatic. However, up to 30% of individuals will develop Chagas cardiomyopathy over decades, and up to 10% will develop gastrointestinal, neurological, or oligosymptomatic alterations that require treatment; these pathologies typically develop over years to decades. Generally, in the chronic phase of infection, the management of specific symptoms/conditions is necessary. The availability of curative treatment is a controversial topic; the WHO recommends treatment of adults with antiparasitic drugs to prevent disease progression and congenital transmission in pregnant women.

### Evaluation of the Elecsys Chagas assay for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in a multicenter study in Europe and Latin America [^1122hL3n]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

This study's strengths include the significant inclusion of samples from Latin America to evaluate the Elecsys Chagas assay under routine laboratory conditions for blood screening and diagnosis in countries where the disease is endemic. Geographical differences in the sensitivities of recombinant antigen-based rapid tests have been demonstrated, likely due to strain differences. Commercially available performance panels covering samples from nine additional countries were found reactive with the Elecsys assay, underlining its sensitivity for Chagas samples from South and Central America.

The study also analyzed reactive samples stored frozen for several years, demonstrating the general stability of the analyte (IgG). In samples showing a loss of reactivity with competitor assays during long-term storage, the Elecsys assay's COI values ranged from 1.8 to 70.9, supporting its high sensitivity. The Elecsys Chagas assay was compared with several existing assays to ensure relevance to local protocols and benchmarks for performance. Evaluation with a commercially available seroconversion panel revealed a seroconversion sensitivity identical to those of competitors, reconfirming sensitivity for samples derived from the early phase of infection.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for Trypanosoma cruzi infection: Field evaluation of two registered kits in a region of endemicity and a region of nonendemicity in Argentina [^115tGoYF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Low credibility.

Between April and October 2018, a total of 607 samples were obtained from the enrolled participants. Most of the participants were female (388/607 [63.9%]), and the average age was 41.9 years (range, 18.2 to 87.5). A total of 17.8% (108/607) of the participants were diagnosed as infected through conventional serology (CS) testing.

Results for six of the cases were invalid with the WL test and were repeated, with the last result considered valid. No case had invalid results per the SD test. For the analysis of sensitivity and specificity, a total of 62 cases were excluded for the following reasons: (i) one for having a previous treatment, (ii) 35 for not having results from both rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and (iii) 26 for having discordant CS test results. Therefore, a total of 545 cases were considered, 106 of which corresponded to confirmed infections. For the analysis, the WP and SP cases were considered a single category of positive tests.

The SD test had high sensitivity and a greater capacity for identification of seropositive cases (97.2%) than the WL test.

### Trypanosoma cruzi in persons without serologic evidence of disease, Argentina [^111bFhKm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

American trypanosomiasis, or Chagas disease, is usually asymptomatic; therefore, its diagnosis is primarily based on laboratory tests. During the indeterminate and chronic clinical periods, detection of immunoglobulin (Ig) G against Trypanosoma cruzi using more than two different serologic tests is the standard for diagnosis. Moreover, serodiagnosis is employed for epidemiologic surveillance, to evaluate the efficacy of therapy, and for routine testing in blood banks.

Conversely, direct identification of T. cruzi is the main diagnostic tool during the acute phase of Chagas disease. In other phases, the detection of parasites is rare due to the low levels of parasitemia. However, the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has allowed detection of T. cruzi in a higher number of patients with chronic disease. In this stage, the prevalence of circulating parasites varies from 21% to 100% using PCR, and this variability may be associated with episodes of reinfection. Previous reports have focused on the high sensitivity of the PCR test when compared to serologic findings, xenodiagnosis, or blood culture. Nonetheless, in some investigations, discordant findings have been observed; parasitemias have been detected by PCR from serum samples of seronegative persons. Although the parasite has been directly observed in the blood of seronegative patients, this issue has been largely ignored in clinical settings. Parasitemias in patients with negative serologic findings could represent a sanitary problem, as most diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations are based on serologic evidence.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chagas disease, specifically concerning blood smears, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining parasitologic tests, including the identification of trypomastigotes in blood by microscopy, for the diagnosis of acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection. It is important to recognize that circulating parasite levels decrease rapidly within a few months and are undetectable by most methods during the chronic phase.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^112Cu9vL]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease of substantial public health importance. In the United States, more than 300,000 people are estimated to be infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan that causes the disease. The vast majority were infected while living in endemic areas of Latin America and are in a chronic phase of the disease. While most remain asymptomatic for life, 20%–30% eventually develop Chagas cardiomyopathy, and up to 10% may suffer damage to the gastrointestinal or nervous systems. CD causes a heavy burden of morbidity and mortality, resulting in an estimated global annual loss of more than 800,000 disability-adjusted life-years, including more than 27,000 annually in the United States. Only about 1% of estimated US cases have been identified, usually through blood donor screening. Most people are unaware they are infected with T. cruzi. Provider-directed screening is essential because early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes and limit mother-to-child transmission. Screening programs for CD are highly cost-effective, but with the paradigm of limited testing, estimated total annual healthcare costs from CD in the United States exceed $130,000,000. However, not all US providers are aware of CD, and testing poses certain challenges.

The Pan American Health Organization has provided overall guidelines on the diagnosis and management of CD. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website also provides specific recommendations for healthcare providers. Here we examine considerations for screening and diagnosis of CD in the United States.

### Development and comparison of enzyme immunoassays for diagnosis of Chagas' disease using fixed forms of Trypanosoma cruzi (epimastigotes, amastigotes, and trypomastigotes) and assessment of antigen stability for the three assays [^1164xdyx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Three enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for the diagnosis of Chagas' disease were developed using fixed forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. These were tested with a panel of 435 sera from the following groups: Venezuelan subjects positive by immunofluorescence (n = 70), Venezuelan healthy controls (n = 85), healthy Canadians (n = 166), and subjects with other parasitic diseases (n = 114).

All assays achieved 100% sensitivity and demonstrated reasonable specificity for amastigotes (97.6%), epimastigotes (98.3%), and trypomastigotes (99.3%). The fixed-trypomastigote assay maintained stability over 4 months at 4 degrees C and room temperature. These data suggest that a fixed-trypomastigote EIA may be a suitable candidate for blood bank screening.

### Evaluation of the Elecsys Chagas assay for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in a multicenter study in Europe and Latin America [^116ZB6Y4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Results**: A total of 674 precharacterized positive frozen samples were tested. Precharacterization was performed via serology and PCR (n = 158) or via serology alone (n = 516), with and without clinical staging (n = 135 and n = 381, respectively).

All Chagas disease-positive samples were correctly identified by the Elecsys Chagas assay, demonstrating a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 99.45 to 100%). The Abbott Architect assay also correctly identified all Chagas disease-positive samples, achieving a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 97.90 to 100%; n = 174), while the Orthoassay detected positive samples with a sensitivity of 96% (95% CI, 93.89 to 97.54%; n = 500).

### Evaluation of the Elecsys Chagas assay for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in a multicenter study in Europe and Latin America [^116vAMCt]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronically infected individuals represent a substantial population capable of transmitting the infection, particularly through blood or organ donation or from mother to child. During the chronic phase, individuals exhibit low-level or no parasitemia; thus, direct microscopy is inappropriate. PCR detects the parasite in 40 to 65% of patients with chronic disease; consequently, diagnosis relies upon the detection of antibodies by serological methods.

The most commonly used serological methods are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence indirect test (IFI). A few automated systems based on chemiluminescence have been introduced. The diagnostic approach to Chagas disease is heterogeneous, with guidelines varying according to location (i.e. laboratory, region, or country) and purpose (i.e. screening of blood/organ donors versus diagnosis of patients with symptomatic disease). Conventional tests based on total antigens show cross-reactivity between species; therefore, confirmation of the presence of antibodies commonly requires the use of at least two tests that are based on different methods/antigens. Furthermore, the resolution algorithms (i.e. sequence, type, and number of tests used) also vary by region. However, with the availability of assays with improved sensitivity and specificity, it has been suggested that a single assay may now be adequate for screening and diagnosis.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the relative sensitivity and specificity of the fully automated Elecsys Chagas assay.

### Validation of a rapid and reliable test for diagnosis of Chagas' disease by detection of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in blood of donors and patients in Central America [^114rzeKK]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

In this study, we compared the performance of the Chagas Stat-Pak rapid immunochromatographic test with a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the serodiagnosis of Chagas' disease in Central America. Out of 3,400 blood donor samples, 156 (4.6%) were positive in both assays. Three sera out of 2,084 samples from reference laboratories were negative with the rapid test but positive with the ELISA, resulting in a 99.8% agreement. A 100% agreement between the two tests was observed with 339 additional sera from patients with cardiopathies and 175 sera from potential blood donors in emergency surgical cases occurring on weekends or at night. In conclusion, Chagas Stat-Pak showed 99.6% and 99.9% sensitivity and specificity, respectively, when assayed with 5,998 serum samples. It is a sensitive and specific alternative to the ELISA, as required in medical emergencies and blood screenings in Central America.

### Chagas disease screening using point-of-care testing in an at-risk obstetric population [^111HN8rD]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Congenital transmission is the most important mode of transmission of Chagas disease (CD) in non-endemic countries. Identifying CD in reproductive-aged women is essential to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease to their children and offer treatment to women and their children, which could cure the disease. We evaluated the use of point-of-care (POC) testing for CD in postpartum patients. In our patient population, 16.7% (23/138) tested positive by POC testing, but confirmatory testing was negative for all patients. Among those considered high risk, 30% declined participation. Our results suggest limited utility of the point-of-care test used in our study and identify an opportunity for improvement to broaden diagnostic testing options. Our study also highlights the need to develop strategies to increase subject participation in future research.

### Field evaluation of a rapid immunochromatographic assay for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi infection by use of whole blood [^112vA3ma]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Laboratory and clinical diagnostic classification of seropositive individuals, followed by treatment and supportive therapy, is an established component of Chagas' disease control in areas where this disease is endemic. However, most Chagas' disease patients live in remote areas where neither equipped laboratories nor skilled human resources are widely available. Employing a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), when using whole blood samples, is the best option for Chagas' disease control. A high sensitivity and specificity for the Chagas Stat-Pak RDT (Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc, Medford, NY) has been reported for assays using serum and plasma, but its validity for the detection of antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi infection in whole blood is unknown. This cross-sectional study measured the sensitivity and specificity of the Chagas Stat-Pak with whole blood, using conventional serological assays for comparison.

- **Interobserver reliability**: The interobserver reliability in the interpretation of the Chagas Stat-Pak results and "ease-of-use" criterion needed to perform the Chagas Stat-Pak and conventional assays were also measured. The Chagas Stat-Pak yielded a high specificity (99.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 98.4 to 99.4%) but a relatively low sensitivity (93.4%, 95% CI = 87.4 to 97.1%). The interobserver reliability was excellent (kappa [n = 1,913] = 0.999, P < 0.0001), and the quantified ease-of-use criterion suggested that the RDT is simple to perform.

Despite the attributes of the Chagas Stat-Pak, it is not an ideal diagnostic test for the population investigated in the present study.

### Evaluation of the Elecsys Chagas assay for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in a multicenter study in Europe and Latin America [^1141a7Xm]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Serology is the preferred method to confirm a Chagas disease diagnosis and to screen blood donors. A battery of assays is often required due to the limited accuracy of single assays. The Elecsys Chagas assay is a newly developed, double-antigen sandwich assay for use on the Elecsys and Cobas e immunoassay analyzers. It is intended to identify individuals infected with Trypanosoma cruzi for diagnosis and screening. The performance of the Elecsys Chagas assay was evaluated in comparison with other widely used antibody assays at multiple sites in Europe and Latin America. Relative sensitivity and specificity were assessed using samples from blood donors, pregnant women, and hospitalized patients from regions where Chagas disease is endemic and from regions of non-endemicity.

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: The Elecsys Chagas assay had an overall relative sensitivity of 100% (n = 674). Overall relative specificities were 99.90% (n = 14,681) for blood donors, 100% (n = 313) for pregnant women, and 100% (n = 517) for hospitalized patients. The analytical specificity was 99.83% (n = 594).

- **Detection capabilities**: The Elecsys Chagas assay detected antibodies in two World Health Organization (WHO) standard reference panels (panels 09/188 and 09/186) at a 1:512 dilution, corresponding to a cutoff sensitivity of approximately 1 mIU/ml.

The Elecsys Chagas assay demonstrated robust performance under routine conditions at multiple sites in Europe and Latin America. In contrast to other available Chagas assays, the Elecsys assay uses a reduced number of recombinant antigens, resulting in a significantly smaller number of cross-reactions.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^116ZiyqC]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Because parasitemia levels can fluctuate, the serologic status of infants born to mothers with chronic Chagas disease (CD) should be monitored even if the infant has negative PCR results early in life. Transferred maternal IgG antibodies persist in infants for up to 12 months. If an infant first evaluated at 3 months of age or older has a positive CD screening T. cruzi IgG test, performed through a commercial laboratory, repeat screening should be performed when the infant reaches 9 to 12 months of age. If the antibody remains detectable, confirmatory serologic testing through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is appropriate to establish or exclude congenital infection. An increase in antibody titer over time after 9 months of age, documented at CDC, indicates congenital infection.

Figure 2. Algorithm for evaluation of congenital Chagas disease (CCD) for infants ≥ 3 months of age. Source: CDC.

- **What is the recommended algorithm for diagnosing Chagas disease in the United States?**

	- Diagnostic testing for chronic T. cruzi infection should be conducted using two distinct assays, based on different antigens or in different formats, following Pan American Health Organization and CDC guidelines. If the results are discordant, a third distinct test should be performed. Confirmed diagnosis requires positive results by at least two tests.

	- **Recommendations**:

		Screening by clinical and public health laboratories in populations with low T. cruzi infection prevalence should be conducted using a high-sensitivity test, bearing in mind the anticipated false-positive rate.

### Chronic Chagas Disease Diagnosis: A Comparative Performance of Commercial Enzyme Immunoassay Tests [^115PUVNJ]. The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

There is a significant heterogeneity in reported performance of serological assays for Chagas disease diagnosis. The conventional serology testing in laboratory diagnosis and in blood banks is unsatisfactory because of a high number of inconclusive and misclassified results. We aimed to assess the quality of four commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests for their ability to detect Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in 685 sera samples. Cross-reactivity was assessed by using 748 sera from patients with unrelated diseases. Initially, we found that the reactivity index against T. cruzi antigen was statistically higher in sera from Chagas disease patients compared with those from non-chagasic patients, supporting the notion that all evaluated tests have a good discriminatory ability toward the diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in patients in the chronic phase of the disease. Although all tests were similarly sensitive for diagnosing T. cruzi infection, there were significant variations in terms of specificity and cross-reactivity among them. Indeed, we obtained divergent results when testing sera from patient with unrelated diseases, particularly leishmaniasis, with the levels of cross-reactivity being higher in tests using whole T. cruzi extracts compared with those using recombinant proteins. Our data suggest that all four tests may be used for the laboratory diagnosis and routine blood screening diagnose for Chagas disease. We also emphasize that, despite their general good performance, caution is needed when analyzing the results when these tests are performed

### Parasites - American trypanosomiasis (also known as Chagas disease) [^116FU6ze]. CDC (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for Chagas disease, particularly concerning patients with congenital Chagas disease, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend not obtaining serologic testing for the diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease because the infected mother's antibody to Trypanosoma cruzi can persist in her infant for up to 9–12 months. It is important to recognize that the mother's antibody will disappear over time, and uninfected children will become antibody negative by 9–12 months of age.
