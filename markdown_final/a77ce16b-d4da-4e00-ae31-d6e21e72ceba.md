## Question

cause o the llq flank pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what could cause left lower quadrant (LLQ) flank pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise anatomic localization and whether this could represent an acute surgical abdomen. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis by urgency and prevalence. Next, I will identify key historical features and targeted physical exam findings that narrow the differential. After that, I need to define red flags, select initial labs and imaging based on ACR criteria, interpret imaging patterns to final diagnoses, outline management and disposition, and finally consider special populations and common pitfalls that can mislead the evaluation.

> Let me first confirm the anatomic framework so I do not anchor prematurely. LLQ pain typically implicates the sigmoid colon, distal ureter, and in females the left adnexa, while true flank pain lateral to the paraspinals raises renal and proximal ureter pathology; "LLQ flank pain" often means overlapping lower abdominal and flank discomfort, which should immediately cue me to colonic versus ureteral etiologies and the possibility of an acute abdomen that could require emergent intervention [^1147mvFJ] [^113Y3yaq] [^114Hh4Ji].

> I will now examine the differential in tiers by likelihood and danger, but hold on, I should verify I am not underweighting life threats. The leading urgent considerations include acute sigmoid diverticulitis, ureteral colic from a left ureteral calculus, and in older or high-risk patients a leaking or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm; each can present with LLQ or flank-dominant pain and can deteriorate quickly if missed [^1147mvFJ] [^112vwgDG] [^1177iMjD]. Next, I should review important yet typically less emergent mimics such as epiploic appendagitis, acute pyelonephritis, and symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease, which often lack systemic toxicity and may be self-limited or chronic, but can confound clinical diagnosis without imaging support [^112pgiSH] [^112BidjC] [^111VRRWn].

> But wait, what if the patient is a woman of reproductive age or has thromboembolic risk factors. I need to ensure I include must-not-miss gynecologic and vascular entities such as ovarian torsion and ectopic pregnancy in reproductive-age females, and renal infarction or mesenteric ischemia in the appropriate clinical context, as delays in these diagnoses carry high morbidity and demand rapid imaging and specialty consultation [^112b81r8] [^114Hh4Ji] [^114YoNX8] [^112j39SF].

> Next, I should review the historical features that most efficiently narrow the list. Sudden, colicky, flank-to-groin radiation favors ureteral stones, whereas progressive constant LLQ pain with fever and bowel habit change suggests diverticulitis; dysuria or urinary frequency push toward urinary sources, and pregnancy status immediately reframes priorities; I initially wrote "Gynecologic causes excluded in females", but wait, let me correct that mistake — gynecologic causes are excluded in males and must be carefully considered in females, with pregnancy testing as a default in those of childbearing potential [^112BidjC] [^1147mvFJ] [^114Hh4Ji]. I should double-check for vascular risk factors, atrial fibrillation, connective tissue disease, or smoking history, which raise concern for renal or mesenteric ischemia and aneurysmal disease even when the abdominal exam is deceptively benign [^112BidjC] [^1177iMjD].

> I will now examine the physical findings and vital signs, because missing instability changes the whole pathway. Tachycardia, hypotension, or toxic appearance mandate expedited imaging and surgical or vascular consultation; focal LLQ tenderness with guarding or rebound implies peritonitis and potential complicated diverticulitis, whereas focal LLQ pain without guarding and normal vitals and labs makes epiploic appendagitis more likely; costovertebral angle tenderness nudges me toward pyelonephritis, and a pulsatile mass is an AAA until proven otherwise [^1111Jzaz] [^115CmY7q] [^112pgiSH].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that mandate immediate escalation rather than outpatient workup. Hemodynamic instability, peritoneal signs, high fever with toxicity, positive pregnancy test with pain or bleeding, known aneurysm with new pain, refractory escalating pain, bowel obstruction features, or severe pain in immunocompromised patients all warrant emergent CT-based imaging and early specialty involvement to prevent deterioration and missed time-sensitive therapies [^1111Jzaz] [^115CmY7q] [^114Hh4Ji].

> Let me think about the initial tests, being careful to align with ACR guidance. After stabilization, basic labs include CBC for leukocytosis, CMP for renal function and electrolytes, CRP to support inflammatory etiologies, urinalysis for hematuria or pyuria, and a pregnancy test in those with reproductive potential; these guide pretest probabilities and contrast decisions but rarely obviate imaging when serious pathology remains on the table [^112BidjC]. I should confirm imaging selection: for undifferentiated LLQ pain, CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is generally preferred because it characterizes diverticulitis and complications while revealing alternative diagnoses; for suspected nephrolithiasis, noncontrast CT is highly accurate, although in pregnancy ultrasound is first-line with MRI as a problem-solver; when vascular catastrophe is suspected, CTA is indicated without delay [^1147mvFJ] [^113Y3yaq] [^112vwgDG] [^1133mYfn]. If unenhanced CT is inconclusive for stones, I should consider MR urography or contrast-enhanced studies according to ACR stone guidance rather than prematurely discharging a patient with ongoing severe pain [^113KcCn9] [^1133mYfn].

> I will now interpret canonical imaging patterns to converge on specific diagnoses, but I should double-check that I am not overcalling subtle signs. Colonic wall thickening with pericolic fat stranding localizes diverticulitis and stratifies severity by detecting abscess, free air, or fistula; a small, oval fat-density lesion abutting colon with a hyperattenuating central dot signals epiploic appendagitis and supports conservative care; an obstructing ureteral calculus with upstream hydronephrosis confirms urolithiasis and frames size-based management; an enlarged aorta with retroperitoneal hemorrhage demands emergent vascular surgery; and an enlarged ovary with absent Doppler flow compels immediate gynecologic detorsion efforts to salvage function [^1147mvFJ] [^112pgiSH] [^112vwgDG] [^1177iMjD] [^112b81r8].

> Next, I should review the management and disposition with a bias toward safety-netting and timely follow-up. Uncomplicated diverticulitis in stable patients can often be managed as an outpatient with analgesia and selective antibiotics according to evolving practice patterns, whereas complicated disease with abscess, perforation, or sepsis requires admission, IV antibiotics, percutaneous drainage when indicated, and surgical consultation; urolithiasis management depends on size and location, with small distal stones managed conservatively and larger or obstructing stones needing urology; epiploic appendagitis is self-limited and treated with NSAIDs while avoiding unnecessary antibiotics; any surgical or vascular emergency requires immediate specialty involvement and operative readiness [^112BidjC] [^1137Md8C] [^1147mvFJ].

> I need to ensure I address special populations explicitly. In pregnancy, ultrasound is first line for suspected stone disease and pelvic pathology, with MRI as the radiation-sparing second-line when ultrasound is nondiagnostic; CT may be considered only when benefits clearly outweigh risks, and the evaluation must "double rule-out" both surgical and obstetric emergencies; in older adults or heavy smokers, I should maintain a low threshold to evaluate for aneurysmal disease because presentations are often atypical and rapidly progressive [^112vwgDG] [^1147mvFJ] [^1177iMjD].

> Hold on, let me reconsider key diagnostic pitfalls that can derail care. Epiploic appendagitis frequently mimics diverticulitis but lacks systemic toxicity and resolves with conservative therapy; left-sided appendicitis from malrotation, situs inversus, or a long appendix can present as LLQ or flank pain; pancreatitis centered in the tail can rarely present as isolated left flank pain and be mistaken for pyelonephritis; pulmonary embolism can masquerade as flank pain with basal pulmonary infarcts incidentally visible on abdominal CT; and although renal colic classically requires obstruction to cause pain, emerging data suggest nonobstructing stones can contribute to flank pain in selected patients, so symptom-imaging discordance should prompt thoughtful reassessment rather than reflex discharge [^112pgiSH] [^111i2amD] [^1146ihfd] [^113WTJTm] [^116RsY8r] [^115TV4Jx] [^115ZRV7b].

> In summary, I should confirm hemodynamic stability first, then proceed with a structured, risk-stratified history and exam, apply ACR-guided imaging to high-consequence differentials, interpret hallmark imaging patterns carefully, and align management with disease severity while providing explicit return precautions; if any piece of the story does not fit, I should double-check for atypical or vascular etiologies and avoid premature closure to prevent missed time-sensitive emergencies [^112BidjC] [^1147mvFJ] [^114Hh4Ji].

Left lower quadrant (LLQ) flank pain most commonly arises from **diverticulitis** and **nephrolithiasis** [^1147mvFJ], but the differential is broad and includes gastrointestinal, genitourinary, gynecologic, vascular, and musculoskeletal causes [^112BidjC]. A focused history, exam, and labs guide initial evaluation, but **CT is the preferred imaging** for most adults [^1147mvFJ], with ultrasound for pregnant patients or when radiation is a concern [^112vwgDG]. Prompt imaging is essential to identify complications or alternative diagnoses and to direct timely management [^117PDmzo].

---

## Gastrointestinal causes

- **Diverticulitis**: Most common LLQ pain [^113Y3yaq]; presents with LLQ pain, fever, leukocytosis, and may complicate with abscess, perforation, or fistula [^1137Md8C].

- **Colitis**: Infectious or inflammatory colitis (e.g. IBD) [^112BidjC] can cause LLQ pain with diarrhea, fever, and systemic symptoms [^114Hh4Ji].

- **Epiploic appendagitis**: Benign, self-limited inflammation of epiploic appendages [^111i2amD]; mimics diverticulitis but typically lacks systemic symptoms [^112pgiSH].

- **Left-sided appendicitis**: Rare, usually due to anatomical variants (e.g. situs inversus, malrotation) [^1146ihfd] [^113WTJTm].

---

## Genitourinary causes

- **Nephrolithiasis**: Common cause of flank pain; may radiate to groin with hematuria and dysuria [^114Hh4Ji] [^112vwgDG].

- **Pyelonephritis**: Flank pain [^114Hh4Ji] with fever, chills, dysuria, and systemic infection signs [^112BidjC].

- **Ureteral obstruction**: From strictures, tumors, or external compression [^112Ge6Uv]; causes flank pain and hydronephrosis [^114Hh4Ji].

---

## Gynecological causes (in females)

Gynecological causes include **ovarian cysts or torsion**, which present with acute LLQ pain and adnexal tenderness; torsion is a surgical emergency [^112b81r8]. Ectopic pregnancy is **life-threatening** and should be considered in reproductive-age women with LLQ pain and a positive pregnancy test [^112BidjC]. Endometriosis causes **chronic, often cyclical LLQ pain** associated with menstruation [^114Hh4Ji].

---

## Vascular causes

Vascular causes include **abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)** — rare but life-threatening — and should be considered in older patients with risk factors [^1177iMjD]. Renal artery or vein thrombosis is also rare [^114Hh4Ji] and presents with **acute flank pain** and possible hematuria [^114YoNX8].

---

## Musculoskeletal causes

Musculoskeletal causes include **muscle strain or spasm**, which are common, especially after recent physical activity or trauma [^114yQZUV], and **hernias** (inguinal or femoral), which can cause localized LLQ pain [^114Hh4Ji].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic approach** is essential, beginning with the history and physical examination to characterize the pain, associated symptoms, and risk factors [^112BidjC]. Initial laboratory tests include CBC, urinalysis, a pregnancy test (in females), and renal function tests [^112BidjC]. CT abdomen/pelvis is the **preferred imaging modality**; ultrasound is used for pregnant patients or when radiation is a concern [^1147mvFJ] [^112vwgDG].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate evaluation

- **Severe**, sudden-onset pain
- **Hemodynamic instability** (hypotension, tachycardia)
- **Signs of peritonitis** (rebound tenderness, guarding)
- Gross **hematuria**
- **Positive pregnancy test** with acute pain [^112BidjC]

---

LLQ flank pain has a broad differential, but **diverticulitis and nephrolithiasis** are most common [^112BidjC]. A focused history, exam, and labs guide evaluation, with **CT as the primary imaging** to identify complications or alternative diagnoses and enable timely management [^1147mvFJ] [^112vwgDG].

### Left lower-quadrant pain: Guidelines from the American College of Radiology appropriateness criteria [^113Y3yaq]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of left lower-quadrant pain includes gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and renal/ureteric pathology. Imaging is helpful in evaluating left lower-quadrant pain and is generally guided by the clinical presentation. Acute sigmoid diverticulitis should be suspected when the clinical triad of left lower-quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis is present.

The severity of the disease varies from mild pericolonic and peridiverticular inflammation to severe inflammatory changes with complications such as perforation, peritonitis, or abscess or fistula formation. Computed tomography is the preferred test in evaluating clinically suspected diverticulitis. It is used to evaluate the severity and extent of disease and to identify complications. It may also diagnose other causes of left lower-quadrant pain that can mimic diverticulitis.

Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess left lower-quadrant pain. It has superior resolution of soft tissues and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation, but it is expensive and requires more time to perform. Transabdominal ultrasonography with graded compression is another effective technique but is limited by its high operator dependency and technical difficulties in scanning patients who are obese. Pelvic ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality in women of childbearing age. Radiography with contrast enema is less sensitive than computed tomography in diagnosing diverticulitis and is seldom used.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute onset flank pain-suspicion of stone disease (urolithiasis) [^112vwgDG]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining an ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder retroperitoneal as the initial or follow-up imaging for pregnant patients with acute-onset flank pain and suspicion of stone disease. Consider obtaining color Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance urography, or unenhanced CT in these patients.

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: Evaluation and diagnosis [^112BidjC]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes include gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes, such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain, should also be considered.

Pain location, history, and examination findings are crucial for guiding the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability. Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing. Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. However, conditions like urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases.

- **Imaging studies**: These are chosen based on the location of pain and the index of suspicion for specific etiologies.
	- **Computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast media** is often selected for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain.
	- **Ultrasonography** is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can help in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis.

For patients who have female reproductive organs, considerations should include diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion.

### CT imaging findings of epiploic appendagitis: An unusual cause of abdominal pain [^112pgiSH]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of epiploic appendagitis is challenging due to the lack of pathognomonic clinical signs or laboratory markers. Clinical presentation may vary among patients. This condition is often an underestimated and overlooked mimicker, easily misdiagnosed with other causes of abdominal pain requiring urgent care or surgical evaluation in the emergency department, particularly acute diverticulitis (left iliac pain) or acute appendicitis (right iliac pain). On physical examination, patients complain of focal non-migratory abdominal pain in the lower abdominal quadrants (left more commonly than right), not exacerbated by physical movement, without significant guarding or rigidity, and in the absence of a palpable mass. The pain is typically circumscribed, and the patient may often point to the location of the lesion. Patients may also report postprandial fullness, swelling, vomiting, early satiety, diarrhea, and rarely mild fever. White blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein levels are within normal range in the majority of patients, while mild leukocytosis may occasionally be observed due to inflammatory response.

Epiploic appendagitis is a benign, self-limiting condition that spontaneously resolves within 2 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Surgery is not indicated, as the treatment is conservative with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, according to the patient's symptoms. The risk of recurrence is low, and complications are even rarer.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The study shows that patients presenting with abdominal pain without vomiting, guarding, or elevated white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra-abdominal pathology and, therefore, can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function tests help indicate the possibility of biliary colic, as does microscopic hematuria, which may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common in emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illnesses with no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However, high white blood cell (WBC) counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years. Indeed, for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain, acute appendicitis is the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness, pain migration, and vomiting may help differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease. In such cases, patients tend to have elevated white cell counts and demonstrate signs of peritonism, making differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically, and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging, such as ultrasound, is helpful in such diagnostic circumstances.

### Prospective multicenter evaluation of pain before and after removal of nonobstructing renal calculi: A CoRE initiative [^115ZRV7b]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Flank pain associated with stone disease is typically caused by a stone that obstructs urine flow. However, it is plausible that nonobstructing kidney stones may still cause pain. We performed a multicenter observational trial to evaluate whether treatment of small nonobstructing calyceal stones improves pain and kidney stone-specific health-related quality of life.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients aged 18 years or older with nonobstructing renal stones up to 10 mm in longest diameter and moderate to severe pain were recruited. All participants completed three questionnaires: the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System pain interference form 6a, and the Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life questionnaire. Thereafter, all participants underwent ureteroscopy for renal stone treatment. All three questionnaires were repeated at 2, 6 to 8, and 12 weeks postprocedure. The primary outcomes were the change in preoperative to 12-week postoperative mean BPI score and worst BPI pain score.

- **Results**: A total of 43 patients with nonobstructing kidney stones and associated flank pain were recruited. All stones were removed. Preoperatively, BPI scores for mean pain and worst pain were 5.5 and 7.2, respectively, which decreased to 1.8 and 2.8, respectively, at 12 weeks postoperatively. The Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life questionnaire mean score increased from 70.4 to 115.3 at 12 weeks postoperatively. A total of 86% and 69% of patients had at least a 20% and 50% reduction in their mean pain scores, respectively.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^117JGrYW]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Emergency department providers have become skilled at triaging patients with abdominal pain that require surgical interventions. However, abdominal pain mimics, which are medical conditions that cause the sensation of abdominal pain without any abdominal abnormality, continue to puzzle even the best physicians.

### Right flank pain: a case report of an interesting sonographic finding [^113Wn8sZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Focused bedside ultrasound is a screening tool frequently used by emergency physicians to evaluate hepatobiliary and renal pathology in patients presenting with abdominal complaints in the emergency department (ED).

- **Objective**: This case report describes a sonographic finding that was interpreted as free fluid in the right upper quadrant. Computed tomography (CT) was used to confirm the diagnosis.

- **Case report**: A 44-year-old man presented to the ED with the sudden onset of right-sided abdominal pain and exhibited right costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination. Focused bedside ultrasound of the right upper quadrant revealed severe hydronephrosis of the right kidney and free fluid of either subcapsular, perinephric, or peritoneal location represented by an anechoic stripe in Morison's pouch. On CT evaluation, this patient was found to have perinephric fluid accumulation from a presumed ruptured renal calyx in the setting of chronic ureteropelvic junction obstruction with severe hydronephrosis.

- **Conclusion**: The exact location of anechoic fluid in the abdomen is not always apparent on bedside ultrasound. To minimize misinterpreting focused bedside ultrasound examination findings, we recommend a number of sonographic techniques to identify possible mimics of free fluid. Suspected free fluid findings on bedside ultrasound should always be evaluated within the clinical context of the patient's presentation.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra-abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^115CmY7q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a very common presentation to the emergency department. It is vital for physicians to understand and be familiar with the presentations of common diseases that cause abdominal pain. Patients with acute abdominal pain are a heterogeneous group, consuming a considerable amount of a surgical department's resources. To streamline efficiency and maximize cost-effectiveness, it would be beneficial to identify clinical and laboratory parameters in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain that indicate no significant intra-abdominal pathology, thereby encouraging early discharge back to the community.

Women of childbearing age commonly present with right iliac fossa pain, and most do not have appendicitis. Those who do not exhibit the classical features of appendicitis and have no evidence of peritonism on examination can be safely managed by active observation or diagnostic laparoscopy. This study was designed to identify the clinical and laboratory red flags. Recognizing these red flags in the history, physical examination, initial imaging, and laboratory findings helps determine which patients may have a serious underlying disease process and therefore warrant more expedited evaluation and treatment.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain, and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated.

The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain. Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain.

The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

### A mysterious cause of a surgical abdomen [^1157nYop]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Epiploic appendagitis is a rare cause of acute-onset abdominal pain. The severity of pain at presentation and the infrequency with which it is encountered make it a diagnostic challenge.

- **Objectives**: To present a case report exemplifying a diagnostic challenge posed by acute-onset abdominal pain that eventually led to the diagnosis of epiploic appendagitis.

- **Case report**: A 50-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department complaining of excruciating, sudden-onset lower abdominal pain. All routine laboratory investigations were within normal limits, as were an acute abdominal X-ray series. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed a focal fatty infiltration in the left lower quadrant with fat-stranding towards the colon, representing the classical radiological presentation of epiploic appendagitis. The patient was admitted and successfully managed conservatively with intravenous fluids and ibuprofen. She made a full recovery and was discharged three days after admission.

- **Conclusions**: Due to its benign, self-limited course, it is important to recognize this disease process to avoid unnecessary surgical and medical interventions. Epiploic appendagitis should be suspected in patients presenting with acute onset abdominal pain localized to the left lower quadrant or right lower quadrant with no associated systemic manifestations. Improvements in imaging technology have enabled confirmation of the diagnosis with non-invasive methods.

### Unenhanced helical CT in the investigation of acute flank pain [^116tBF7J]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Unenhanced helical CT has emerged as the imaging technique of choice for investigating patients presenting with acute flank pain and suspected nephroureteric stone disease. There are several signs identifiable on unenhanced CT that support a diagnosis of stone disease. However, numerous pitfalls may confound a correct diagnosis.

- **Common pitfalls**: These pitfalls, along with methods to avoid them, will be discussed.

- **Alternative diagnoses**: A review of some of the common alternative diagnoses that may mimic the symptoms of nephroureteric stone disease is illustrated.

### Association of pain location with computed tomography abnormalities in emergency department patients with abdominal pain [^112FZXaV]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, the usage of computed tomography (CT) imaging has risen dramatically in emergency department (ED) patients with abdominal pain. Recognizing the potential disadvantages of overuse of CT imaging, efforts are being made to reduce imaging.

- **Objective**: We determined the operating characteristics for the location of abdominal pain for the entities of acute appendicitis, diverticulitis, and intestinal obstruction. We hypothesized that patients with pain localized to the upper abdomen would be less likely to have CT abnormalities than those with lower abdominal pain.

- **Methods**: This is a prospective, observational registry of ED patients with abdominal pain, performed in an academic, suburban ED with an annual census of 110,000. The presence of clinically significant CT abnormalities (e.g. appendicitis, diverticulitis, bowel obstruction) was recorded along with clinical variables including laboratory values, vital signs, reported location of pain, location of tenderness on examination, and physician pretest probability.

- **Results**: A convenience sample of 1154 patients was enrolled. Of all patients, 273 cases (24%) had abnormal CT results, including appendicitis (n = 95), diverticulitis (n = 133), and bowel obstruction (n = 49). Right upper quadrant pain was negatively associated with abnormal CT (p = 0.02). Clinician gestalt was highly specific, but lacked sensitivity for the diagnosis of appendicitis, diverticulitis, and obstruction. Twenty-four percent of patients diagnosed with appendicitis had no right lower quadrant pain or tenderness, and 7% of patients…

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^113voqZd]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

A potential explanation for the observed increase in imaging is that ED clinicians utilize their expertise to sort patients into a continuum of risk of clinically significant, intervenable intra-abdominal diagnoses. They respond to the increasing availability of CT over this period by lowering the testing threshold to include patients at a lower but still clinically meaningful risk of making such a diagnosis on CT. For example, in the case of renal colic, consensus recommendations from multiple specialty experts favor imaging as presentations become higher risk and as symptoms become less typical, increasing the likelihood of diagnoses other than kidney stones.

If this were the case for other high-risk conditions, we would anticipate that the proportion of patients diagnosed with an EGS condition at the end of an ED visit during which a CT was performed (test positivity) would decline as the rate of imaging increased. Instead, we found that increases in test positivity occurred for every age group, suggesting increased EGS diagnosis in the population or improved funneling of patients experiencing symptoms of EGS to the ED. This increased test positivity with CT scans also provides a partial explanation for the increasing proportion of abdominal pain ED visits diagnosed with EGS conditions overall: greater CT utilization means more EGS conditions are being found, resulting in fewer missed diagnoses. This may be particularly important for older adults, who are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality for a given diagnosis.

### Acute abdominal pain as a result of a ruptured hematosalpinx: A rare complication of an unusual müllerian anomaly [^113ndLGU]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

A 15-year-old virgin Caucasian female presented to the emergency room with a 40-hour history of acute left lower quadrant abdominal pain and nausea. Evaluation suggested a left pelvic kidney with obstructed ureter being the etiology. Her pain continued to escalate, so further workup with laparoscopy was performed. This demonstrated a left pelvic sidewall hemi uterus with ruptured hematosalpinx. This is an unusual clinical presentation of a müllerian anomaly not previously documented.

- **Discussion**: The differential diagnosis of acute unilateral abdominal pain in adolescent females should include müllerian anomalies. The incidence of this diagnosis is low, but the evaluation and treatment can be performed in an expeditious manner if the diagnosis is considered. The laparoscopic excision of a unilateral noncommunicating uterine horn is a valid and recommended treatment approach for this rare malformation.

The most common extraintestinal manifestation of the disease is a liver abscess. Symptoms of liver abscess include fever, right upper quadrant pain, and tenderness. Amebic abscesses are predominantly solitary, oval or round-shaped, and located near the liver capsule in the right lobe of the liver. Sonographic features of amebic abscesses consist of a hypoechoic lesion with low-level internal echoes and the absence of significant wall echoes. On a CT scan, it appears as a low-density lesion with a peripheral enhancing rim and a thickened wall. A mild contrast enhancement around the abscess in the adjacent liver parenchyma occurs due to the peripheral zone of edema. Amebic liver abscess is frequently associated with right-sided pleural effusion and perihepatic fluid.

### Midgut malrotation presenting with left-sided acute appendicitis and CT inversion SIGN [^1146ihfd]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

In patients presenting with abdominal pain, appendicitis is the most common surgical disorder. Appendicitis causing pain in the left lower quadrant is extremely rare and can occur with congenital abnormalities that include a true left-sided appendix or as an atypical presentation of a right-sided long appendix, which projects into the left lower quadrant. We report a case of a 69-year-old man showing midgut malrotation with acute appendicitis presenting as left lower quadrant abdominal pain.

### Abdominal pain caused by a potentially fatal attraction [^116TGm64]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a challenging presentation in children. Examination findings and etiology vary greatly, spanning a vast spectrum from flatulence to frank peritonitis with septic shock. Here, we discuss a 10-year-old boy with 24 hours of progressively worsening lower abdominal pain, nausea, and subjective fevers. History and physical examination findings were consistent with appendicitis. However, physicians were surprised when the single-view abdominal radiograph showed an unanticipated, somewhat perplexing discovery.

### Epiploic appendagitis: a non-surgical cause of acute abdomen [^111i2amD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans of the patient with right lower quadrant abdominal pain (A: coronal reformat, B: axial) and the patient with left lower quadrant abdominal pain (C: coronal reformat, D: axial). CT demonstrated the presence of oval-shaped, fat density paracolonic lesions (white circles) with a high-attenuation central "dot" (white arrow), located at the antimesenteric edge of the ascending colon for the first patient (A, B) and the descending colon for the second patient (C, D), respectively. Inflammatory changes of the adjacent pericolonic fat were also detected, more prominent in the second patient.

Primary epiploic appendagitis (EA) is a benign, localized, sterile inflammation of the epiploic appendages, resulting from torsion or spontaneous venous thrombosis of a draining vein, usually involving the sigmoid colon or cecum. Secondary EA is associated with inflammation of adjacent organs, such as diverticulitis, appendicitis, and cholecystitis. Patients present with acute abdominal pain mostly localized in the affected area with local tenderness on physical examination. Rebound tenderness may also exist, mimicking the clinical picture of acute abdomen, frequently leading to misdiagnoses such as acute appendicitis or diverticulitis. Notably, primary EA has been reported in 2–7% of patients in whom a clinical suspicion of diverticulitis was entertained and in 0.3–1% of patients suspected of having appendicitis. However, in EA, fever, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and altered bowel function are usually absent, whilst inflammatory markers are.

### Left-sided acute appendicitis: a pitfall in the emergency department [^113WTJTm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis continues to be a condition at high risk for missed and delayed diagnosis. It characteristically presents with right lower quadrant pain after vague epigastric or periumbilical discomfort. Left-sided appendicitis is an atypical presentation and has been reported rarely. The majority of these cases have been associated with congenital midgut malrotation, situs inversus, or an extremely long appendix. We report a case of left-sided acute appendicitis occurring in a patient with a redundant and hypermobile ascending colon.

- **Objectives**: To alert emergency physicians to an anatomical anomaly that could delay the diagnosis of appendicitis.

- **Case report**: A 50-year-old man presented with fever and left lower abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed local tenderness over the left lower quadrant. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a redundant, floating, ascending colon and an inflammatory appendix adhering to the descending colon over the left lower abdomen. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, and perforated appendicitis with turbid ascites was found during the surgery. Appendectomy was performed, and the patient recovered uneventfully.

- **Conclusion**: This case is presented to increase awareness among emergency physicians of this anatomical variant and atypical presentation of appendicitis.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^116r4nEm]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

After clinical assessment at the ED, all consenting patients underwent ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) within a few hours of presentation to the ED. Ultrasound and CT were independently evaluated by two different blinded observers. Between 5 pm and 11 pm, when often only one attending radiologist or radiological resident was present, both ultrasound and CT were evaluated by the same observer. The ultrasound examination was performed and evaluated by the observers: the attending radiologist or radiological resident, not by a sonographer. To guarantee a blinded evaluation for study purposes, ultrasound was performed first and documented in the case record form. CT was only evaluated after finalizing the ultrasound part of the case record form.

The CT findings with immediate treatment consequences were communicated to the treating physician. In cases presenting after hours, CT examinations were re-evaluated by an abdominal radiologist the next morning, and these findings were documented in the case record form. This radiologist was blinded to the ultrasound evaluation and had access to the same details on clinical findings as the person evaluating the ultrasound examination. This second reading was used for this comparative study, so all CT examinations were read or supervised by a radiologist. Contrary to ultrasound examinations, which were performed by radiological residents alone after hours.

To evaluate the effects of experience, all observers were asked to record the number of abdominal ultrasounds they had performed: less than 100, 100–500, 500–1,000, or more than 1,000.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

- **Risks and potential risks with Ryzneuta**: Rupture or enlargement of the spleen may occur. Symptoms include left upper quadrant abdominal pain or left shoulder pain. Advise patients to report pain in these areas to their healthcare provider immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Dyspnea risks**: Dyspnea, with or without fever, progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome, may occur. Advise patients to report dyspnea to their healthcare provider immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Serious allergic reactions**: Such reactions may occur, which may be signaled by rash, facial edema, wheezing, dyspnea, hypotension, or tachycardia. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Sickle cell disease concerns**: In patients with sickle cell disease, sickle cell crisis and death have occurred with the use of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. Discuss potential risks and benefits for patients with sickle cell disease prior to the administration of Ryzneuta [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Glomerulonephritis risks**: Glomerulonephritis may occur. Symptoms include swelling of the face or ankles, dark-colored urine or blood in the urine, or a decrease in urine production. Advise patients to report signs or symptoms of glomerulonephritis to their healthcare provider immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Capillary leak syndrome**: This may occur, and symptoms include hypotension and edema.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^116PVW9q]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Left upper quadrant pain commonly results from conditions such as gastritis, colitis (splenic flexure), pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, splenic enlargement or infarction, or left lower lobe pneumonia. Intermittent headaches frequently accompany systemic illnesses, thus posing a challenge in determining if the associated fever signals an intracranial infectious process such as meningitis, encephalitis, or a brain abscess. The severity and duration of headache, lack of previous headache history, and presence of meningeal signs and neurological deficits are common indications for imaging the central nervous system and analyzing the CSF.

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^111Ttnh6]. Emergency Radiology (2012). High credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause for acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations with which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### Postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis with left renal venous infarction after vaginal delivery [^112g8wDz]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A primipara in her late 20s presented with abdominal pain and pain in the left flank 14 days following a ventouse delivery. She was treated with antibiotics, antiemetics, and analgesics with the initial differential diagnosis of cystitis, pyelonephritis, or nephrolithiasis. Despite the treatment, the patient experienced increased colic pain and nausea. An ultrasound showed an enlarged left kidney, suggesting pyelonephritis, and thereby, the antibiotic treatment was adjusted accordingly. Despite additional pain medication, pain relief could not be achieved. The diagnosis of ovarian venous thrombosis was considered, and an abdominal CT scan confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was treated with anticoagulant therapy. A hypercoagulability work-up revealed a heterozygous mutation of the Factor V Leiden. Our patient awaits a hematologic follow-up.

### Epiploic appendagitis: An overlooked entity by clinicians [^113wMoXA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

A 41-year-old woman was referred to our department for persistent lower left-sided abdominal pain. Two weeks prior, she complained of diarrhea lasting two days. Immediately afterward, she began experiencing increasingly sharp and severe abdominal pain in the left lower quadrant, leading her to visit the emergency department twice; however, no definite diagnosis was established, and irritable bowel syndrome was suspected. Physical examination showed localized pain with tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Laboratory testing revealed an increased C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 9.4 mg/L, indicating inflammation.

Primary epiploic appendagitis (PEA) is the inflammatory process of the epiploic appendage, composed of fat and blood vessels, protruding from the serosal surface of the colon. The clinical picture of PEA includes the acute onset of abdominal pain with left or right lower quadrant tenderness. Some patients report fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or nausea.

### A surprising cause of acute right upper quadrant pain [^116uf6Ki]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A 42-year-old African-American woman was admitted for severe acute right upper quadrant pain. Her liver function tests exhibited a cholestatic pattern of hepatitis. She had no known history of liver disease or sarcoidosis. Imaging of her liver and biliary tree did not reveal any apparent cause for her right upper quadrant pain. A liver biopsy was performed, which showed granulomatous disease. This prompted a CT chest scan that showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the mediastinal lymph node revealed non-caseating granulomas. Despite not having pulmonary symptoms or a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, she was diagnosed with systemic pulmonary sarcoidosis. She was treated with corticosteroids and experienced complete resolution of symptoms over the next several weeks.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions from benign and self-limited diseases to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires a methodical approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

The location of the pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis. Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful (e.g. constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction), whereas others are of little value (e.g. anorexia has little predictive value for appendicitis).

The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, and computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain. It is also important to consider special populations such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease, which may cause abdominal pain; and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^114TeDKQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Typical of complex, ambiguous cases in the early stage, the clinician appropriately considers a very broad differential diagnosis. Three categories — infection, autoimmune conditions, and malignancy — provide structure for thinking through this case. The clinician uses the patient's age, gender, and significant travel history to help focus the extensive differential diagnosis in each category. The problem representation is now: a 43-year-old woman with acute, unremitting left upper quadrant (LUQ) pain and a subacute history of night sweats, weight loss, and recent travel to Mexico.

She was in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Her temperature was 38.1°C, blood pressure 96/43 mmHg, heart rate 125 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. She had scleral icterus. Lung and heart exams were normal except for tachycardia. The abdomen was nondistended with normal bowel sounds but diffusely tender, particularly in the LUQ. Liver span was 15 cm to percussion, and the spleen was not palpable. She had no peritoneal signs or costovertebral angle tenderness, and a pelvic examination was normal. Her neurological and skin examinations were normal.

Her appearance and vital signs suggest the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which requires prompt evaluation, stabilization and usually empiric antibiotic treatment. Jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain prioritize acute bacterial cholangitis as an immediate concern, despite the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the subacute underlying illness. Hepatomegaly is typically explained by liver inflammation, infiltration, or congestion.

### Do all patients with left costal margin injuries require radiographic evaluation for intraabdominal injury [^116GJj2G]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine whether all patients with pain or tenderness in the left lower ribs following a blunt traumatic injury require abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning for the detection of splenic injury.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, observational cohort study conducted on all blunt-trauma patients who presented with pain or tenderness in the left lower ribs at a Level I trauma center's emergency department (ED). Patients were included if they had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score greater than 13 and exhibited pain or tenderness to the left lower ribs (ribs 7 to 12). The pain was considered pleuritic if it increased with inspiration or cough. All hemodynamically stable patients underwent abdominal CT scanning to detect intraabdominal injuries. Prior to radiographic imaging, data forms were completed to collect information on the medical history and physical examination of the patients. Those with left lower rib pain or tenderness were classified as having an "isolated" left lower rib injury if they did not have any of the following: systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg either in the ED or out-of-hospital, abdominal or flank tenderness, pelvic or femur fractures, or gross hematuria.

- **Results**: Out of 875 patients with left lower rib pain or tenderness, 63 (7.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6% to 9.1%) were found to have splenic injuries, and 20 (2.3%; 95% CI 1.4% to 3.5%) had left renal injuries. Five hundred seventy-four of these patients had additional indications for abdominal imaging, leaving 301 patients in the subgroup without additional indications.

### A rare diaphragmatic ureteral herniation case report: endoscopic and open reconstructive management [^117QVVDW]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

In general, ureteral hernias are an incidental finding. If symptomatic, they can present with flank pain, gross hematuria, renal dysfunction, nephrolithiasis, and urosepsis. While these symptoms are non-specific, and the likelihood of diagnosing a herniated ureter is low, the consequences of misdiagnosis can result in permanent ureteral injury, loss of renal function, and/or urosepsis. Diagnostic studies such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and intravenous and retrograde pyelography can be helpful in diagnosing this entity.

Ureteral hernias are managed conservatively unless there is an urgency to treat, such as obstruction, urosepsis, or intractable flank pain. These patients can generally be followed in the clinic with both lab tests and imaging to monitor for progression. Isolated lab tests may be inadequate in detecting obstruction in the setting of a normally functioning contralateral kidney, as they may not reflect true kidney function, as our patient demonstrated. If intervention is warranted, endoscopic stent placement is the routine management therapy. However, if endoscopy is unsuccessful in reducing the herniation, then open-reduction surgery may be a viable option for renal preservation, as we demonstrated. Care should be taken to avoid injuring the ureter with the end-goal of relieving the ureteric obstruction and ensuring that impairment of renal function is minimized. Each case should be evaluated on its own merit, and follow-up imaging and diagnostic studies should be obtained to ensure successful reduction.

### Spleen injury following left extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) [^113Zw6SU]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

A 54-year-old anxious male presented to the emergency room after experiencing 12 hours of severe, medically recalcitrant left flank pain. A CT scan and KUB demonstrated a 15 mm by 8 mm left mid polar renal calculus, and the patient underwent left ESWL under regional anesthetic. This procedure was performed with 1–7 KV power at 120 shocks per minute for a total of 2500 shocks. Although the patient's pain was controlled, he was very nervous and had to be repositioned eight individual times.

Approximately 6 hours after the ESWL, the patient phoned the urologist complaining of severe left flank pain, unlike any previous episode of renal colic. An emergency room evaluation noted a hypotensive patient with left upper and lower quadrant pain and peritoneal signs. A CT scan demonstrated a stage 3 splenic injury with hemoperitoneum (Figure 1), while the left kidney showed no extravasation or parenchymal injury but a fractured calculus, illustrating that the stone was effectively treated (Figure 2). A general surgery consultation was obtained, and the general surgeon performed an emergent splenectomy and drained 2.0 liters of hemoperitoneum while transfusing the patient with six units of packed red blood cells. The patient experienced an uneventful recovery.

- **Figure 1**: CT scan shows a stage 3 splenic injury with hemoperitoneum.
- **Figure 2**: CT scan indicates no extravasation or parenchymal injury in the left kidney, but a fractured calculus is present.

### Renal vein thrombosis mimicking urinary calculus: a dilemma of diagnosis [^115qgcxk]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old woman presented to the emergency room in a regional hospital with nausea and left flank pain that had suddenly started 12 hours earlier. She had a history of left flank trauma, having fallen from a 2-meter height 5 years earlier. Physical examination revealed no tenderness over the abdomen or flank and normal chest auscultation. Blood analysis was within normal limits, except for leukocytosis (12.7 × 10^9/L). Routine urine analysis showed microscopic hematuria without white blood cells or proteins. Abdominal ultrasonography showed an enlarged kidney and a 16-mm hyperechoic focus in the left renal pelvis, suggesting a diagnosis of renal calculus. The patient was, therefore, administered extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy at the regional hospital. A follow-up ultrasound examination 2 weeks later showed that the shape and size of the hyperechoic focus had not changed.

Due to left lower back pain and the persistent left hyperechoic focus in the renal area, the patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Urine analysis and ultrasound examination showed the same results as in the regional hospital. An abdominal plain film showed a left-sided renal calcification, but there was no evidence of a palpable tender mass or an audible abdominal bruit. Laboratory data, except for urinalysis results, were within normal limits. Because of the failure of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous lithotomy was recommended.

### Helical CT scanning: The primary imaging modality for acute flank pain [^1112eiYs]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

We set out to evaluate the accuracy of nonenhanced helical computed tomography (CT) scanning in stone detection for patients with acute flank pain, and as a means of detecting noncalculus causes of acute flank pain. Between April 1995 and April 1997, 412 consecutive patients with acute flank pain underwent noncontrast-enhanced helical CT. Two hundred eighty-one patients had confirmation of their CT diagnosis by other radiographic studies, urologic intervention, or spontaneous stone passage of calculi. We determined the presence or absence of urinary calculi, as well as the presence of other noncalculus pathology.

CT scanning revealed a stone in 92 of 281 patients (32.7%) and no stone in 189 of 281 patients (67.3%). Of the 189 patients, 60 of 189 patients (32%) had another positive finding as a cause for flank pain. Eighty-one of 92 patients with a stone on CT (88%) had confirmation of stone disease by radiologic or surgical intervention. Eleven of 92 patients (12%) did not have confirmation of their diagnosis due to resolution of symptoms or refusal of further intervention. On helical CT scans, 129 of 189 patients demonstrated no abnormalities. Two of 189 (1.5%), thought to be stone-free by CT, passed a stone.

Helical CT had a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 92%, a positive predictive value of 88%, and a negative predictive value of 98% for stone detection. Noncontrast-enhanced helical CT is accurate and rapid in detecting calculus disease in patients with acute flank pain. Perhaps more importantly, it provides the added benefit of detecting noncalculus causes of flank pain.

### Parasitic diseases as a cause of acute abdominal pain: Imaging findings [^114K5BK6]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by Leishmania species. There are three main forms of leishmaniasis: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral. Persistent irregular fever and splenomegaly are characteristic findings for visceral leishmaniasis. In addition, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, pallor, night sweats, weakness, anorexia, asthenia, cutaneous pigmentation, and weight loss may be observed. Left upper quadrant pain may result from massive splenomegaly. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage may occur in leishmaniasis due to bowel involvement, with the duodenum being the most frequently affected segment.

In terms of ultrasound findings in patients, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly are common. Less common sonographic findings include ascites, pleural effusion, portal vein dilatation, and inferior vena cava dilatation. Increased echogenicity of the kidneys and decreased echogenicity of the pancreas may be seen very rarely. On contrast-enhanced CT, hepatosplenomegaly, hypodense nodular lesions in the liver, spleen, and lymphadenopathy may be detected. CT angiography may reveal intraluminal contrast extravasation in cases with gastrointestinal hemorrhage. In the differential diagnosis, lymphoma should be considered due to its mimicking findings. Rarely, splenic infarction and splenic rupture may occur.

A 21-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with a 2-week history of left upper quadrant abdominal pain and fever. Physical examination revealed splenomegaly and inguinal lymphadenopathy.

### Acute abdominal pain in a 15-year-old male patient [^111p4GSv]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The case concerns a 15-year-old male presenting with acute abdominal pain. The patient's symptoms, history, and the results of diagnostic tests were documented comprehensively. The initial assessment included a thorough physical examination and a review of the patient's medical history.

- **Diagnostic findings**: The diagnostic approach incorporated various imaging techniques and laboratory tests, which were critical in determining the underlying cause of the abdominal pain. These methods yielded significant insights into potential diagnoses, directing the subsequent treatment strategy.

- **Treatment implications**: Based on the diagnostic findings, a tailored treatment plan was devised. The patient's response to the chosen therapeutic interventions was closely monitored to ensure efficacy and to adjust the treatment as necessary.

The paper emphasizes the importance of an integrated approach in evaluating pediatric patients with similar presentations, highlighting the need for comprehensive assessments to prevent misdiagnosis and ensure effective management.

The COVID-19 disease is spreading rapidly worldwide, and no vaccine or very effective drug has been found yet. However, the transmission rate of the disease can be reduced by taking precautions. Therefore, it is essential to detect patients early to prevent the spread of the disease. We report a case of a 26-year-old male patient who was admitted to our urology outpatient clinic with the complaint of flank pain and had incidental findings of COVID-19 in the lung bases on abdominal CT.

### Right lower quadrant abdominal pain: Do not forget about ovarian torsion on the computed tomography scan [^112b81r8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints of patients presenting to emergency departments, and emergency physicians (EPs) often evaluate patients with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Ovarian torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain, but early diagnosis is essential for the salvage of the affected ovary. The diagnostic study of choice for ovarian torsion is a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler, but it is important for EPs and radiologists to be aware of findings of ovarian torsion that might appear on computed tomography (CT).

- **Case report**: We present a case of a young female with right lower quadrant abdominal pain with CT evidence of ovarian torsion that was not recognized. The patient was discharged and then called back when the study was over-read as concerning for ovarian torsion.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this**: The presence of radiographic findings associated with ovarian torsion on a CT scan should encourage an EP to order a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler, if available, and obtain an obstetrics/gynecology consult.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® left lower quadrant pain: 2023 update [^1147mvFJ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

The differential diagnosis for left lower quadrant pain is broad, with conditions spanning from benign and self-limited to life-threatening surgical emergencies. Alongside patient history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, imaging often plays a critical role in narrowing the differential diagnosis and identifying life-threatening abnormalities. This document discusses the guidelines for the appropriate use of imaging in the initial workup for patients presenting with left lower quadrant pain, suspected diverticulitis, and suspected complications from diverticulitis.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodological principles, such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology for determining the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may serve as the primary evidentiary source to formulate a recommendation.

### A rare case of right lower quadrant abdominal pain [^1164WR4w]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Isolated fallopian tube torsion without involvement of the ovary is a rare condition most frequently presenting during reproductive years. Imaging, vitals, physical exam, and laboratory findings all fail to help establish a definitive diagnosis. The majority of the diagnoses are made on the operating table. Physical exam most often reveals unilateral and localized abdominal pain, often with nausea and vomiting, but few other reliably common findings.

Diagnosis becomes even more challenging due to the fact that isolated tubal torsion occurs often in pregnancy and preferentially on the right, further complicating the clinical picture. We describe a case of isolated tubal torsion, unique in that localized necrosis and inflammation from the torsion triggered a secondary appendicitis. The patient required surgical intervention with an appendectomy and salpingectomy emergently.

Given its elusive and rare nature, awareness and early intervention are required by the emergency physician to recognize tubal torsion, as operative intervention is crucial and can lead to preservation of fertility and improved fetal survival.

### An unusual manifestation of acute appendicitis with left flank pain [^112Sz2gM]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2008). Low credibility.

The author presents a case with an unusual presentation of early appendicitis. The patient initially presented with left-sided flank pain. A workup for nephrolithiasis, including a non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis, was negative for renal stones or hydronephrosis. After discharge, the patient presented one week later in the ED with right lower quadrant pain. A contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed perforated appendicitis.

### Considerations in the diagnosis and therapy for acute loin pain [^114YoNX8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of acute onset of nausea, vomiting, and flank pain in combination with an acute elevation of blood pressure should raise high suspicion of renal infarction. However, due to its nonspecific presentation, diagnosis may be delayed. We report the case of a 63-year-old man who presented with a 2-day history of right flank pain, initially treated as a renal stone. He had a background history of atrial fibrillation. Further investigations confirmed this as a case of renal infarction.

Renal infarction is underdiagnosed due to the similarity of its presentation with other renal pathologies. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of loin pain, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Pulmonary embolism presenting as flank pain: a case series [^115TV4Jx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal disease that can be effectively treated once diagnosed. Due to its insidious and often cryptogenic presentations, the diagnosis of this disease can easily elude clinicians. Over the last several years, the use of computed tomography (CT) scanning has improved the clinician's ability to diagnose PE. Additionally, the widespread use of CT to investigate other complaints such as flank and abdominal pain could theoretically result in radiographic findings not previously identified that could point to the diagnosis of PE. This case series reveals the unexpected and initially unrecognized CT finding of a pulmonary infarct in two patients presenting with flank pain; a third patient presented with flank pain and was also found to have a PE.

- **Objective**: We describe three cases of patients who presented to the Emergency Department with flank pain and were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism.

- **Case reports**: The cases reported here discuss patients who presented with flank pain and were ultimately diagnosed with PE. In the first two cases, the patients had incidental findings of pulmonary infiltrates on abdominal CT scans, which prompted further diagnostic investigation. In the third case, the patient had risk factors for PE, presented with flank pain, and the diagnosis was quickly made through CT imaging.

- **Conclusion**: Physicians should consider pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis of patients with isolated flank pain. Additionally, unexpected pulmonary findings on abdominal CT scans may help suggest the diagnosis of PE.

### Complicated diverticulitis [^1137Md8C]. Diseases of the colon and rectum (2020). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old previously healthy man presented with left lower quadrant pain and fever. Physical examination showed left lower quadrant peritonitis. Computed tomography scan revealed a pelvic abscess with extraluminal air. Intravenous antibiotics were initiated, and CT-guided percutaneous drainage was performed. The drain was removed one week after discharge. One week later, the patient presented with dysuria and pneumaturia and was started on antibiotics. Colonoscopy confirmed diverticulosis with no other mucosal abnormalities. He subsequently underwent a successful laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with colovesical fistula takedown.

### Moderate to severe and prolonged left lower-abdominal pain is the best symptom characterizing symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease of the colon: a comparison with fecal calprotectin in clinical setting [^111VRRWn]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Left lower-abdominal pain is considered the best symptom to differentiate between symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, this statement has not yet been validated.

- **Goals**: The aim of this study was to assess whether prolonged left lower-quadrant pain is the best symptom characterizing SUDD, differentiating it from IBS-like symptoms in diverticulosis, and to compare the location of abdominal pain with fecal calprotectin (FC) expression.

- **Study**: Seventy-two patients suffering from abdominal pain and having diverticula at colonoscopy were enrolled. Patients were classified according to the SUDD definition (abdominal pain for at least 24 consecutive hours in the left lower abdomen). There were 42 patients with SUDD and 30 patients with IBS-like symptoms fulfilling Rome III criteria. Abdominal pain was assessed using a 10-point visual scale, assigning numerical values from 0 (absence of pain) to 10 (severe pain). FC expression was assessed by a rapid test in all patients enrolled.

- **Results**: The FC test was positive in 27 (64.3%) patients in the SUDD group and in no patients in the IBS-like group (P < 0.0001). In patients with SUDD, there was a significant correlation between the severity of abdominal pain and the FC score (P = 0.0015). The extension of diverticulosis correlated with the FC score (P = 0.022) and the severity of diverticulosis (P = 0.005).

- **Conclusions**: Severe and prolonged left lower-abdominal pain seems to be the best symptom characterizing SUDD, and it can differentiate these patients from those harboring diverticula.

### Modern approach of diagnosis and management of acute flank pain: Review of all imaging modalities [^112Ge6Uv]. European Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Acute flank pain is a common and complex clinical problem, often caused by various urinary and extraurinary abnormalities, with ureterolithiasis being the most frequent cause. Plain abdominal radiographs combined with intravenous urography (IVU) have been the standard imaging procedures of choice for the evaluation of acute flank pain over the last decades. Direct detection of even small ureteral calculi is achieved in 40–60% of cases. However, using indirect signs, such as ureteral and renal pelvic dilatation, stone detection is possible in up to 80–90% of cases.

However, IVU might be hindered by poor quality due to the lack of bowel preparation, nephrotoxicity of contrast agents, serious allergic reactions in 10% of patients, anaphylactic reactions in 1% of patients, and significant radiation exposure. The use of ultrasonography (US) in the management of acute flank pain has been growing. When findings of pyeloureteral dilatation, direct visualization of stones, and absence of ureteral ejaculation are combined, the sensitivity to detect ureteral dilatation can be as high as 96%.

Recently, unenhanced helical CT (UHCT) has been introduced as an imaging modality with high sensitivity and specificity for the evaluation of acute flank pain. UHCT has demonstrated superiority for several reasons: it detects ureteral stones with sensitivity and specificity from 98% to 100% regardless of size, location, and chemical composition; it identifies extraurinary causes of flank pain in about one-third of all patients presenting with acute flank pain.

### Left flank pain as the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis: A report of a case with an initial misdiagnosis [^116RsY8r]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is not uncommon in an emergency department (ED) and typically manifests as upper abdominal pain, sometimes with pain radiating to the back and flank region. However, isolated left flank pain as the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis is very rare and has not been previously identified in the literature. In this report, we present a case of acute pancreatitis that presented solely with left flank pain. Initially, she was misdiagnosed due to negative findings on an ultrasound, which suggested possible "acute pyelonephritis or other renal diseases". A subsequent radiographic evaluation with computed tomography revealed pancreatitis in the tail of the pancreas, with abnormal fluid collection extending to the left perirenal space. We performed a literature review and discussed this rare occurrence of acute pancreatitis, including the clinical pitfalls observed in this case.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute onset flank pain-suspicion of stone disease (urolithiasis) [^1133mYfn]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend considering obtaining magnetic resonance urography, contrast-enhanced CT, or contrast-enhanced CT urography as the next imaging step in patients with acute-onset flank pain and suspicion of stone disease if unenhanced CT is inconclusive for the presence of stones.

### Left lower quadrant pain of unusual cause [^112kNK7i]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of left lower quadrant abdominal pain in an adult man includes, among others, sigmoid diverticulitis; leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm; renal colic; epididymitis; incarcerated hernia; bowel obstruction; regional enteritis; psoas abscess; and, in this rare instance, situs inversus with acute appendicitis. We report a case of situs inversus totalis with left-sided appendicitis and provide a brief review of the literature. Several subtle indicators of total situs inversus were present but were missed by the physicians and surgeons who initially evaluated the patient prior to surgery. However, a computed tomography scan with contrast revealed the diagnosis immediately, and treatment was successfully initiated.

### Imaging right lower quadrant pain: Not always appendicitis [^116G2i4R]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Although acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain (RLQP), numerous other conditions in the abdomen and pelvis can mimic the clinical presentation of AA, for which imaging is essential in detection. We discuss the approach to evaluating patients presenting with the acute onset of RLQP and the choice of various imaging modalities that can be utilized. Although CT remains the workhorse in evaluation, ultrasound (US) and MRI, given the lack of radiation, play an important ancillary role, particularly in pediatric and pregnant patients. We present a spectrum of conditions presenting with RLQP, which we have systematically classified, ranging from conditions affecting the bowel, mesentery/omentum/peritoneum, vasculature, and urinary and reproductive systems, to provide the reader with a checklist of conditions to consider when evaluating a case of RLQP.

### Acute renal artery infarction secondary to dysfibrinogenemia [^112j39SF]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The patient's initial presentation of flank pain has a broad differential diagnosis. Early in the case, nephrolithiasis was the leading diagnosis due to the exquisite flank pain that did not resolve with position changes. However, urinalysis did not reveal microscopic hematuria, and a recent non-contrast CT was negative for calculi or hydronephrosis. Given the patient's medical history of rhabdomyolysis and recent intense exercise, acute rhabdomyolysis was also considered. This was excluded based on a normal creatine kinase level. With no acute urinary complaints of hesitancy, frequency, or dysuria, and no objective evidence of infection, such as fever, leucocytosis, benign urinalysis, or fluid collections on radiography, acute urinary tract infection or occult abscess was low on the differential diagnosis. Prior to the contrast CT, musculoskeletal exacerbation of a previous injury, such as an insult to the psoas or quadratus lumborum muscles, was also considered.

On follow-up imaging, radiology suggested a possible aneurysm, which expanded the differential diagnosis. It included infarction due to dissection in addition to the diagnosis of renal artery infarction due to thrombus formation or embolism. Spontaneous renal artery dissection and/or aneurysm is quite rare, with an incidence of less than 0.05%, and approximately only 180 cases have been reported. In a longitudinal study of 438 patients with renal infarction, 21 patients had renal artery dissection or aneurysm, and 29 patients had hypercoagulable states. Given the rarity of the spontaneous dissection and…

### Linzess [^116aAz3q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The term "abdominal pain" includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain. The safety of a 72 mcg dose was evaluated in an additional placebo-controlled trial in which 1223 patients were randomized to Linzess 72 mcg, 145 mcg, or placebo once daily for 12 weeks (Trial 5).

- **Adverse reactions**:
	- In Trial 5, adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of ≥ 2% in Linzess-treated patients (N = 411 in each Linzess 72 mcg and 145 mcg group) and at a higher rate than placebo (N = 401) were:
	- **Diarrhea**: Linzess 72 mcg 19%; Linzess 145 mcg 22%; placebo 7%
	- **Abdominal distension**: Linzess 72 mcg 2%; Linzess 145 mcg 1%; placebo < 1%

- **Diarrhea**:
	- In Trials 3 and 4 (pooled) and Trial 5, diarrhea was the most commonly reported adverse reaction in Linzess-treated patients in the CIC placebo-controlled studies. In all trials, the majority of reported cases of diarrhea started within the first 2 weeks of Linzess treatment. Severe diarrhea was reported in less than 1% of the 72 mcg Linzess-treated patients (Trial 5), in 2% of the 145 mcg Linzess-treated patients (Trials 3, 4, and 5), and less than 1% of the placebo-treated patients (Trials 3, 4, and 5) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Subsequently occurring bilateral iliopsoas hematoma: a case report [^116dumDq]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

A 65-year-old man presented with escalating dull pain in the left flank and lower back for 2 days. In addition, he experienced abdominal pain just before admission. His surgical history included a mechanical aortic valve replacement 6 months ago, and he was taking a vitamin K antagonist. He reported no history of trauma for several months prior to admission, and there was no familial tendency toward bleeding. On admission, his heart rate was 110 beats per minute with sinus rhythm, and his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg.

An ecchymotic lesion was noted on his left flank, and he experienced tenderness in the left flank and left lower quadrant of the abdomen. There was no rebound tenderness, though the patient expressed that the pain worsened when bending over. Laboratory tests revealed a decreased hematocrit level at 23.8% and a prolonged international normalized ratio of prothrombin time at 5.25. The platelet count was within the normal range.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed to evaluate the abdominal and left flank pain. It revealed a large hematoma of the left iliopsoas muscle and extravasation of contrast material. Hemoperitoneum was also revealed, although the amount was minimal. The patient continued to have abdominal pain, and a follow-up hematocrit level dropped to 21.5%. Fresh frozen plasma was infused, and an emergent lumbar arterial angiogram was performed for hemostasis. There was active bleeding on the left 5th lumbar arterial branch. Transarterial embolization (TAE) was successfully performed.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed or treated symptomatically, or if this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide, and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology.

This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit. We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can provide insight into the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered, along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

### Peripheral neuropathic mimics of visceral abdominal pain: Can physical examination limit diagnostic testing [^114yQZUV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The emergency department evaluation of patients with abdominal pain is most appropriately directed at identifying acute inflammation, infection, obstruction, or surgical disease. This process commonly involves "routine" (and often extensive) diagnostic imaging and laboratory testing. Benign mimics of serious visceral abdominal pain that can be diagnosed by physical exam and confirmed with local anesthetic injections have been identified over the last century. These syndromes derive from painful irritation of the intercostal nerves by a mobile rib below, or from impingement of the cutaneous branches of those same intercostal nerves as they penetrate the abdominal wall. These peripheral neuropathic mimics of visceral abdominal pain continue to go unrecognized and underdiagnosed.

- **Methods**: Our purpose is to review the affirmative diagnosis of non-visceral abdominal pain by physical examination.

- **Results**: The consequences of failure to identify these conditions are considerable. In the search for a diagnosis that is literally at the provider's fingertips, patients frequently undergo months to years of fruitless and often invasive diagnostic tests, not uncommonly including unsuccessful surgeries.

- **Conclusions**: With proper consideration of and appropriate testing for visceral etiologies, a carefully directed physical examination may yield an affirmative diagnosis in a percentage of these common emergency department patients.

### Nonhemolytic, nonmotile gram-positive rods indicative of bacillus anthracis [^117Bao4o]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

A 40-year-old woman with no significant medical history was seen at the emergency room due to worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain. The pain, which had started a few days previously, was constant and localized, described as dull and moderately to severely intense. It was not related to meals or bowel movements and was neither accentuated nor relieved by any specific position. The patient noted constipation but had no nausea, vomiting, rectal bleed, or melena, and she reported no urinary symptoms or vaginal discharge. Her last normal menstrual period was 8 days before. She felt warm but did not check her temperature and did not experience chills. Her primary medical physician prescribed ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day for a presumptive diagnosis of colitis. She took the antibiotic for 2 days without improvement.

In the emergency room, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. The physical examination showed tenderness on palpation of the left lower quadrant of the abdomen with minimal rebound tenderness. The pelvic examination revealed left adnexal tenderness with a possible mass. Results of urinalysis and a urine pregnancy test were negative. No leukocytosis was noted. A pelvic ultrasonograph showed a left ovarian complex mass measuring 14 cm x 9 cm x 6 cm and a moderate amount of free fluid in the cul-de-sac, suggesting left ovarian mass torsion. A laparoscopic resection was performed successfully, and the patient received intravenous cefazolin perioperatively.

### Flank pain and hematuria is not always a kidney stone [^116kWkn6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with flank pain and hematuria commonly present to the emergency department as potential cases of nephrolithiasis. However, reliance on this diagnosis can lead to overlooking less common differentials. A case is presented involving a patient with symptoms typical of nephrolithiasis, who was ultimately diagnosed with a Page kidney causing secondary hypertension.

A 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history arrived at the emergency department with severe left-sided flank pain, vomiting, and blood-tinged urine. Initially suspected to have nephrolithiasis, a non-contrast CT scan revealed a left renal subcapsular hematoma. A subsequent CTA showed no active hemorrhage. The patient, with no history of recent trauma, was found to be hypertensive. Urology was consulted, and management for the patient's hypertension was initiated. He was diagnosed with Page Kidney and admitted for observation and hypertension management with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

Page Kidney is a condition where the compression of renal parenchyma by a hematoma or mass causes secondary hypertension through the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Causes may include traumatic subcapsular hematoma, renal cyst rupture, tumor, hemorrhage, and arteriovenous malformation. Treatment options can vary from conservative measures, such as hypertension management, to more invasive procedures like evacuation or nephrectomy. This case underscores the importance of considering alternate diagnoses when faced with patients presenting with typical nephrolithiasis symptoms, culminating in a diagnosis of Page Kidney.

### Derivation and identification of questions that act as predictors of abdominal pain of musculoskeletal origin [^1126sLNk]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

This study investigates questions that could aid in the diagnosis of abdominal pain of musculoskeletal origin, often overlooked when the cause is not apparent.

- **Design**: The research involved assessing consecutive patients with abdominal pain recruited from gastroenterological outpatient clinics. The goal was to develop diagnostic pointers for identifying abdominal pain originating from musculoskeletal disorders.

- **Participants**: The study included subjects with benign abdominal pain, with or without a change in bowel habits, from gastroenterological clinics. Patients with inflammatory or neoplastic disease were excluded from the study.

- **Setting**: Conducted at the Physiotherapy Department, Addenbrooke's NHS Trust Hospital, Cambridge.

- **Main outcome measures**: A set of questions was developed to point towards a musculoskeletal cause for a patient's abdominal symptoms. The questions, "Does taking a deep breath aggravate your symptoms?" and "Does twisting your back aggravate your symptoms?" showed a significant positive indication of abdominal symptoms due to musculoskeletal origin. Conversely, the questions, "Has there been any change in bowel habits since the onset of your symptoms?", "Does eating food aggravate your symptoms?", and "Has there been any weight change since the onset of symptoms?" had a significant negative indication for musculoskeletal origin. Combining these questions resulted in 96% specificity and 67% sensitivity.

These diagnostic questions may facilitate early identification of the musculoskeletal origin of abdominal pain.

### Parasitic diseases as a cause of acute abdominal pain: Imaging findings [^114JypQc]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

A 24-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with an acute onset of right flank pain and fever. Increased serum levels of acute-phase reactants, leukocytosis, and elevated serum creatinine levels were evident from blood analysis. The axial and coronal contrast-enhanced CT images reveal a large renal subcapsular Gharbi type 3 hydatid cyst rupturing into the pelvicalyceal system. Loss of integrity of the renal parenchyma, as seen on the CT image, indicates the site of rupture. Daughter cysts are present within the cyst and also in the pelvicalyceal system. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination following surgery.
