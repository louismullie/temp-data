## Question

Asking the “miracle question” is an initial intervention in which type of therapy?

Answer Choices:
A. transtheoretical
B. family systems
C. solution-focused
D. psychodynamic
E. REBT
F. interpersonal
G. gestalt
H. cognitive-behavioral
I. humanistic
J. dialectical behavior

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which type of therapy uses the "miracle question" as an initial intervention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the "miracle question" actually is and why therapists use it. Then, I should verify which therapeutic modality it belongs to and whether it is indeed an initial intervention there. Next, I will review the other answer choices to ensure none of them are more appropriate. Finally, I will confirm the correct choice and briefly justify it with core principles of that therapy.

> Let me first confirm the construct: the "miracle question" is a classic solution-focused technique that invites clients to imagine a future in which their problem is suddenly resolved, helping elicit concrete goals, exceptions, and preferred realities. It is typically used early in therapy to orient toward solutions rather than problems, which aligns with solution-focused brief therapy's stance and methods [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the modality match. The miracle question is a hallmark of solution-focused brief therapy and is commonly introduced in the first session to shift focus from problem talk to solution talk, making option C the most direct fit based on core descriptions of SFBT practice and its foundational techniques [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the alternatives. Transtheoretical models deal with stages of change and processes of change, not a specific questioning technique like the miracle question, so A is not correct. Family systems therapy emphasizes relational patterns and systemic interventions, not this particular future-oriented question, so B is not correct. Psychodynamic therapy prioritizes insight into unconscious processes and past experiences, which is a different therapeutic frame, so D is not correct. REBT focuses on disputing irrational beliefs, interpersonal therapy on relational contexts, gestalt on present-moment awareness, CBT on cognitions and behaviors, humanistic on self-actualization, and DBT on emotion regulation and acceptance; none of these position the miracle question as a core initial technique, which supports excluding E through J [^notfound].

> I should double-check that the question is indeed used as an initial intervention in SFBT. Yes, the miracle question is typically introduced early to help clients articulate a preferred future and to identify small, observable steps toward that future, reinforcing SFBT's emphasis on rapid, goal-directed change and exception-finding, which confirms C as the best answer [^notfound].

> Final answer: C. Solution-focused therapy.

---

The "miracle question" is a foundational initial intervention in **solution-focused therapy** [^notfound]. It helps clients envision a future without the problem, clarifying goals and identifying practical steps toward change. This technique is not a core element of transtheoretical, family systems, psychodynamic, REBT, interpersonal, gestalt, CBT, humanistic, or dialectical behavior therapies, though some may use similar future-oriented questions secondarily.

---

## Origin and definition of the miracle question

The miracle question was developed by **Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg**, founders of solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT) [^notfound]. It is typically posed early in therapy to shift focus from problems to solutions. The classic phrasing is: "Suppose that one night, while you were asleep, there was a miracle and this problem was solved. How would you know? What would be different? What would you do differently?" This question invites clients to describe a preferred future in concrete, observable terms, making goals tangible and actionable.

---

## Purpose and therapeutic utility

The miracle question serves several key purposes in SFBT:

- **Goal clarification**: It helps clients articulate specific, achievable goals by envisioning a future without the problem [^notfound].
- **Resource identification**: It surfaces client strengths, resources, and exceptions to the problem, which can be leveraged in therapy.
- **Hope and motivation**: It fosters hope and motivation by making change seem possible and within reach.
- **Shift in perspective**: It moves the focus from problem-saturated narratives to solution-oriented thinking.

---

## Process of using the miracle question

Therapists typically introduce the miracle question early in therapy, often in the first session. The process involves:

- **Setting the scene**: The therapist asks the client to imagine a miracle occurring overnight that resolves their problem.
- **Exploring the aftermath**: The therapist guides the client to describe how they would know the miracle happened, what would be different in their life, and how they would behave differently.
- **Identifying small steps**: The therapist helps the client identify small, manageable steps toward the envisioned future, building on existing strengths and exceptions.

---

## Effectiveness and empirical support

Research supports the effectiveness of the miracle question in SFBT. Studies show that SFBT, including the miracle question, is effective for a range of issues, including anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and relationship problems [^notfound]. The miracle question is particularly useful in brief therapy settings, where rapid goal clarification and solution-building are essential.

---

## Comparison with other therapeutic approaches

While other therapies may use future-oriented questions, the miracle question is unique to SFBT in its structure and emphasis:

| **Therapy approach** | **Use of future-oriented questions** | **Emphasis on miracle question** |
|-|-|-|
| Solution-focused therapy | Central and foundational | High |
| Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) | Occasional use for goal setting | Low |
| Psychodynamic therapy | Rarely used | Low |
| Family systems therapy | Occasional use for systemic change | Low |
| Gestalt therapy | Rarely used | Low |
| Humanistic therapy | Occasional use for self-actualization | Low |
| Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) | Rarely used | Low |

---

## Limitations and considerations

While the miracle question is powerful, therapists must consider client readiness and cultural context. Some clients may find the hypothetical framing implausible or uncomfortable, requiring therapist sensitivity and adaptation. Additionally, the miracle question should be followed by concrete, achievable steps to prevent the exercise from remaining purely hypothetical.

---

The miracle question is a **core initial intervention in solution-focused therapy**, designed to elicit client goals, strengths, and actionable steps toward change. It is not a central technique in other major therapies, though future-oriented questions may appear secondarily.

### An optimization framework to guide the choice of thresholds for risk-based cancer screening [^d35bc780]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Optimization

The conditional model of advanced cancer risk may be used to estimate the best screening regimen j = 1, …, m for individual i = 1, …, n given constraints on resources through the following optimization model.

Denote the binary decision variable x i j, where x i j = 1 if screening regimen j is chosen for individual i, and x i j = 0 if not. Our objective is to minimize the expected advanced cancer detection ratefor the strategy defined by the n × m matrix X.

The constraints are:
The decision variable is binary: x i j ∈ (0, 1) for all i = 1, …, n ; j = 1, …, m.
One screening regimen per person: ∑ j x i j = 1 for i = 1, …, n.
Resources are constrained: ∑ i ∑ j h i j x i j ≤ H where h i j is the cost associated with screening strategy j for individual i, and H is the total cost. For instance, h i j might be the number of screens done, and this is constrained to a fixed total number H.

Technically, this form of optimization problem is called an integer programme, and may be solved using standard algorithms.

Methods

Derivation of FLR1

We assume that J is a full-rank matrix and elements of J is random variables satisfying that [J i j] = 0 and, where O is Landau symbol indicating the order of 1/ N. Here, [.] is average over elements. First, we introduce FLR1 for the case of (B J) i j = (B J) j i or of the random symmetric network with B = β I, and then show the relaxed form of FLR1 for the random asymmetric network. Here, I is the unit matrix. We start by evaluating the state change Δ x caused by the connectivity change Δ J and rewrite Eq. (1) by using J + Δ J instead of J asNow, we consider the initial stage of the learning so that Δ J and Δ x are small. After substituting Eq. (2) into Eq. (15) and linearizing it with respect to Δ J and Δ x around x = J x r + γ η, we obtain the following equation,where B is a diagonal matrix represented by d i a g (β 1, β 2, ⋯, β N) with. The fixed point of the dynamics of Eq. (3), termed Δ x *, satisfies

Thus, the change in the neural state through the change in the connectivity is formally written as

Next, we estimate (1− B J) −1 by the neural activities because we cannot know J explicitly in the biological neural system. To this purpose, we consider the neural dynamics given by(here we use x instead of Δ x for simplicity) and show that (1− B J) −1 is evaluated by the covariance of the neural activities.

By solving this Langevin equation, we obtainAfter a transient time (namely, a sufficiently long time passed),and thenwhere we use. Hence, if B J = (B J) T i.e. B J is symmetric, D (1− B J) −1 = C o v (x) inp.

By substituting this estimation of (1− B J) −1 into Eq. (4), we obtainThis is a general relationship to relate the learning speed to the covariance of the activity before learning.

### Evolutionary conservation and emerging functional diversity of the cytosolic hsp70: J protein chaperone network of... [^700844e3]. G3 (2017). Low credibility.

Compared to other cellular compartments, the cytoplasm is the hub for most diverse cellular processes requiring many different chaperones. Consistent with this, the Hsp70:J protein network is most complex in the cytosol. For instance, in the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, out of a total of 22 J proteins, 13 are cytosolic, and most of these work with the same class of Hsp70, Ssa, generating a complex chaperone network that oversees different processes in the yeast cytosol. The number of J proteins has dramatically increased in plants (;;;), which underlines the requirement of highly complex and possibly combinatorial Hsp70:J protein networks in plants. Although some plant J proteins have been shown to be associated with signaling, ion transport, photosynthesis (;), β-carotene synthesis, Fe–S cluster biogenesis, and male sterility, the molecular mechanisms underlying their function as a J protein is largely elusive. We attempted to dissect the J protein network in Arabidopsis thaliana by implementing the phylogenetic computational amendments supplemented with functional assessment using S. cerevisiae as a genetic tool. We report that even though the functional specificities of most cytosolic J proteins are evolutionarily maintained, the Hsp70:J protein network in the A. thaliana cytosol is incredibly complex. Our work shows that this increased complexity cannot be accounted for alone by the higher number of J proteins in plants. Based on the data presented we propose that, besides the emergence of novel J proteins, regulatory differences and neofunctionalizations are together contributing to the functional diversity and emerging complexity of the Hsp70:J protein network in higher plants.

### Paradoxes in longevity: sequence analysis of mtDNA haplogroup J in centenarians [^7efd37ef]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2001). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup J is significantly over-represented in healthy centenarians with respect to younger controls, thus suggesting that this haplogroup predisposes to successful aging and longevity. On the other hand, the same haplogroup is reported to have elevated frequency in some complex diseases. To verify if centenarians clustered in a particular lineage within J we have sequenced the D-loop region from 18 centenarians and 18 younger controls, previously characterized to be J. Then the entire mtDNA molecule was sequenced in a sub-sample of nine centenarians to find possible functional mutations associated with haplogroup J in successful aging. No clustering of the J haplogroup mtDNA from centenarians was observed. In addition, most of the mutations found are known as disease-associated mutations. The general picture that emerges from the study is that the J haplogroup of centenarians is surprisingly similar to that found in complex diseases, as well as in Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy. This finding implies that the same mutations could predispose to disease or longevity, probably according to individual-specific genetic backgrounds and stochastic events. This data reveals another paradox of centenarians and confirms the complexity of the longevity trait.

### Apo J and apo D: complementary or antagonistic roles in Alzheimer's disease? [^6a23531e]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Apolipoprotein D (Apo D) and Apolipoprotein J (Apo J) are among the only nine apolipoproteins synthesized in the nervous system. Apart from development, these apolipoproteins are implicated in the normal aging process as well as in different neuropathologies as Alzheimer's disease (AD), where a neuroprotective role has been postulated. Different authors have proposed that Apo D and Apo J could be biomarkers for AD but as far as we know, there are no studies about the relationship between them as well as their expression pattern along the progression of the disease. In this paper, using double immunohistochemistry techniques, we have demonstrated that Apo D is mainly located in glial cells while Apo J expression preferentially occurs in neurons; both proteins are also present in AD diffuse and mature senile plaques but without signal overlap. In addition, we have observed that Apo J and Apo D immunostaining shows a positive correlation with the progression of the disease and the Braak's stages. These results suggest complementary and cell-dependent neuroprotective roles for each apolipoprotein during AD progress.

### Strategies for measuring the quality of psychotherapy (...) [^7e72d55d]. aspe.hhs.gov (2014). Low credibility.

Structure and process measures would not replace outcome measures, but they may offer guidance on best practices and aid in quality improvement. I. Introduction A. Policy Context Several types of psychotherapy can benefit individuals with the most prevalent mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. These psychotherapies include cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and several others. Although the strength of the evidence supporting each varies, these therapies have generally demonstrated positive outcomes for adults and children therapy in which the provider and consumer work together to identify and address problematic thoughts and beliefs and their relationship with behaviors.

The provider uses a range of techniques to alter these thoughts and behaviors, such as asking open-ended questions to help the individual recognize and challenge these thoughts and assigning homework that requires the individual to identify thoughts associated with particular events and the consequences of those thoughts. B. Interpersonal Therapy IPT is newer than CBT and has been used predominantly in the treatment of depression. It is provided over the course of 12-16 weeks and focuses on the connection between an individual's mood and interpersonal stress. IPT providers address the context in which the presenting problem arose and help the individual to develop coping and communication skills, and to improve his or her relationships with others. C.

Psychodynamic Therapy Psychodynamic therapy is intended to help the individual build awareness and understanding of his or her behaviors, thoughts, and feelings, and on how past experience relates to current functioning. Psychodynamic therapy is traditionally delivered over a relatively long period of time, sometimes years; recently, however, there has been greater interest in short-term psychodynamic therapy, which is generally a maximum of 40 sessions.

### The epidemicity index of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infections [^c698c980]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The cornerstone of model (Eq. (3)) is the force of infection, λ i, which in a spatially explicit setting must account not only for locally acquired infections but also for the role played by human mobility. We assume that, at the spatiotemporal scales of interest for our problem, human mobility mostly depicts daily commuting flows (also coherently with the data available for parameterization; see above) and does not actually entail a permanent relocation of individuals. We thus describe human mobility (and the associated social contacts possibly conducive to disease transmission) by means of instantaneous spatial-mixing matrices(with X ∈ { S, E, P, I, A, R }), i.e.where p i (0 ≤ p i ≤ 1 for all i ’s) is the fraction of mobile people in community i, q i j (0 ≤ q i j ≤ 1 for all i ’s and j ’s) represents the fraction of people moving between i and j (including j = i,for all i ’s), r X (0 ≤ r X ≤ 1 for all X ’s) quantifies the fraction of contacts occurring while individuals in epidemiological compartment X are traveling, and ξ i j (0 ≤ ξ i j ≤ 1 for all i ’s and j ’s) represents the effects of travel restrictions that may be imposed between any two communities i and j as a part of the containment response. Therefore, the probability that residents from i have social contacts while being in j (independently of with whom) is assumed to be proportional to the fraction r X of the mobility-related contacts of the individuals in epidemiological compartment X, multiplied by the probability p i that people from i travel (independently of the destination) and the probability q i j that the travel occurs between i and j, possibly reduced by a factor 1 − ξ i j accounting for travel restrictions. All other contacts contribute to mixing within the local community (i in this case). Note also that if ξ i j = 0 for all i ’s and j ’s, thenreduces to, i.e. to the mixing matrix in the absence of disease-containment measures. In this case,for all i ’s and X ’s. It is important to remark, though, that the epidemiologically relevant contacts between the residents of two different communities, say i and j, may not necessarily occur in either i or j ; in fact, they could happen anywhere else, say in community k, between residents of i and j simultaneously traveling to k. On this basis, we define the force of infection aswhere the parameters(X ∈ { P, I, A }) are the community-dependent rates of disease transmission from the three infectious classes, ϵ j (0 ≤ ϵ j ≤ 1 for all j ’s) represents the reduction of transmission induced by social distancing, the use of personal protective equipment, and local mobility restrictions if such containment measures are in fact in place, and the terms(with X ∈ { S, E, P, I, A, R }) describe the epidemiological effects of mobility between i and j in the presence of disease-containment measures. Note that transmission has been assumed to be frequency-dependent.

### A probabilistic model of biological ageing of the lungs for analysing the effects of smoking, asthma and COPD [^22a64fc7]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Inference

In order to make deductions about the effects of smoking, asthma and COPD, we need to infer the posterior distributions of the group parameters given all N measurements, p (u j, v j | l 1,…, l N) (j =1,…,8), and the posterior distributions describing the biological age of each group at chronological age a, p (u j a + v j | l 1,…, l N). An analysis of p (u j, v j | l 1,…, l N) enables us to make general (summarized over all ages) statements about the groups: lack of or small overlap of some of these distributions indicates fundamentally different biological ageing of the corresponding groups. An analysis of p (u j a + v j | l 1,…, l N) enables us to make statements which are specific to age a.

As explained above, we treat u j and v j as a priori independent random variables with Gaussian distributions. The joint posterior distribution factorizes as

where { l n | c n = j } denotes the subset of measurements belonging to group j. The factors p (u j, v j |{ l n | c n = j }) have unknown analytical form, as the transformation from the biological age to the measurements (3) is nonlinear. We estimated them numerically and found that they are all indistinguishable from Gaussian density functions. As a consequence, we also found that p (u j a + v j |{ l n | c n = j }) are Gaussian. A detailed explanation of how to estimate these posterior distributions is given in the Appendix

### Ontogenetic shifts from social to experiential learning drive avian migration timing [^8f20b511]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The generic model with each of the variables was as follows, where “ i ” is individual, “ j ” is year, and “ k “ is location (see Supplementary Tables 2 – 4 for all candidate models including interaction terms):

Since the reintroduction program began in 2001, the mean latitude of overwintering sites has shifted northward, a behavior termed “shortstopping”. Beginning in 2012, the majority of individuals within the population had adopted shortstopping behavior and the mean latitude of overwintering sites had stabilized (Supplementary Fig. 4). We checked for any confounding factors in our analysis related to shortstopping behavior by re-running our analyses using only data from 2012 onwards, such that any confounding factors due to variability in shortstopping behavior were removed. Results remained consistent for this reduced dataset (Supplementary Fig. 5). Given data deficiency in conspecific-trained birds aged 4–6 years, we also re-ran our analysis for birds only aged 1–3 years; this did not affect results as the effects of sparse data are reflected in the width of the confidence intervals.

### No ownership of common factors [^311414dc]. The American Psychologist (2011). Low credibility.

Comments on the original article, "The efficacy of psychodynamic psychotherapy," by J. Shedler (see record 2010-02208-012). Shedler's informative article raised several issues worthy of comment. His choice of the word distinctive (p. 98) in describing aspects of psychodynamic technique is open to at least two interpretations. On the one hand, distinctive can have a qualitative meaning and indicate the presence of a characteristic that is not shared. For example, a sign in the Bronx Zoo distinguishes birds from all other creatures as follows: "If it has feathers it's a bird, if it doesn't, it isn't." On the other hand, distinctive can have a quantitative meaning and indicate that one practice has more of a common element than another practice. Careful reading of Shedler's article and the article by Blagys and Hilsenroth (2000) that forms the basis of the "seven features [that] reliably distinguished psychodynamic therapies from other therapies" (Shedler, 2010, p. 98) shows that Shedler subscribes to the latter, quantitative, definition of distinctive. In other words, the seven features he presented are present in both psychodynamic therapies and the cognitive-behavioral therapies to which he compares them. For example, although Shedler did not mention it, dialectical behavior therapy explicitly focuses on six of the seven features, namely, "focus on affect and expression of emotion," "exploration of attempts to avoid distressing thoughts and feelings," "identification of recurring themes and patterns," "discussion of past experience," "focus on interpersonal relations," and "focus on the therapy relationship" (Shedler, 2010, p. 99). However, in the articles that Blagys and Hilsenroth reviewed, psychodyamic therapists engaged in more of these behaviors than did cognitive-behavioral therapists.

### When' sanctity of life' and' self-determination' clash: briggs versus briggs [ 2016 ] EWCOP 53-implications for policy and practice [^b97ab998]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

Best interests decision-making after Briggs

According to Charles J, the decision that patients would have made regarding life-prolonging treatment when they had capacity should prevail over the presumption in favour of preserving their lives. This places a very strong requirement on those delivering treatments to determine, as best they can, what the patient’s decision would have been. As should be obvious, the absence of a formal written advance decision cannot be used to claim that the patient has no ascertainable views, or (worse) that since the patient has not formally refused treatment consent can be presumed. Our broader research shows little evidence of much enquiry into patients' wishes for the vast majority of those in prolonged disorders of consciousness. Following Briggs such enquiry would require the following:
Developing a ‘holistic’ understanding of who the patient was before he lost capacity by listening to family and friends/colleagues with the same compassion and attentiveness that Charles J displayed in Briggs (or employing an independent patient advocate to do so). The judge evaluated the evidence the family had presented by asking ‘whether the man described to me, and so a man with his beliefs and values and approach to life would consent to his CANH treatment if he had heard the evidence and argument before me’ and detailed his understanding of PB as a Gulf War veteran and police officer, ‘a risk taker and a man of courage’ (para 120), and a committed family man. He engaged with the best interests decision as it relates to this particular person in this particular situation and considered what PB in particular would decide for himself if he were able so to do.
Giving the family as clear a sense as possible of the patient’s current condition and realistic ‘best case scenario’ in the future, if CANH is continued and any further rehabilitation provided. Families are rarely provided with this information at present: they have sometimes simply been told that ‘anything is possible’ or ‘we just don’t know’, and some are still hoping, years later, for ‘miracle recoveries’ of the type regularly featured in the media. The person’s likely future needs to be explained in ordinary language and in specific detail (ie, not simply ‘very disabled’). In Briggs, the realistic ‘best case scenario’ was established via a report agreed between the treating clinician and the expert rehabilitation consultant: PB would not regain mental capacity to make complex decisions (eg, about his own medical treatment, or even about whether to wear a jumper or a t-shirt based on an assessment of the weather), but he could be happy, make simple choices (eg, choose between a blue t-shirt and a red t-shirt) and would have some pleasurable — and some painful — experiences: he would be severely physically impaired needing 24-hour care and dependent on others for all activities of daily living (para 51).Recovery beyond this state was ‘not impossible only in the sense that one should never say never’ (para 47).
Attending to family and friends’/colleagues’ views as to what the patient would have wanted, based on an understanding of his current state and ‘best case scenario’ future (and taking into account attitudes to risk and uncertainty). Elicitation of these views should avoid ‘pedantic’ and ‘unsympathetic’ cross-examination (para 97)and acknowledge that different family/friends may see things from slightly different perspectives. Despite differences between the way family members expressed themselves and the varying times at which they had arrived at their conclusion, the Briggs family was ‘convinced that if he was able to express it his view would be ‘enough is enough’ because … for him this [i.e. even the best case scenario] was not a life that was worth living’ (para 112).Family members also pointed out that ‘Mr Briggs would factor in the point that the hoped for improvement to the best case scenario is only a possibility’ (para 116).

### Prognostic assessment of early repolarization / J wave electrocardiographic pattern in patients with stable ischemic heart disease [^5318ad81]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent studies suggested that early repolarization (ER)/J wave at the electrocardiogram (ECG) is associated with increased risk of sudden death and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with acute myocardial infarction. In this study, we prospectively assessed whether ER/J wave has any long-term prognostic implications in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (IHD). We enrolled consecutive clinically stable patients with documented IHD, referred to undergo a routine ECG. ER (typical concave ST-segment elevation) and J wave were diagnosed according to prospectively defined criteria. The final population included 617 patients with documented IHD (455 men; age 68.1 ± 11 years). ER/J wave was found in 138 patients (22.4%), 13 of whom (2.1%) showed ER and 133 (21.6%) a J wave. At a follow-up of 8.1±2.9 years, 160 deaths occurred (25.9%), 60 (9.7%) attributed to cardiovascular causes. Total mortality was lower in patients with versus those without ER/J wave (18.8% vs 28.0%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 to 0.93, p = 0.02). The difference, however, was not significant after adjustment for confounding clinical variables (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.19, p = 0.25). No significant difference was found in cardiovascular death between patients with (7.2%) and those without (10.4%) ER/J wave (adjusted HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.55, p = 0.48). Similar results were obtained for ER and J wave separately, and for ECG location of ER/J wave (inferior or lateral/precordial) and type of J wave (notched or slurred). The ER/J wave pattern at the ECG is not associated with increased risk of long-term mortality in clinically stable patients with a documented history of IHD.

### Conduction delay-induced J-wave augmentation in patients with coronary heart disease [^43d52147]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Electrocardiogram records were surveyed for the presence of an atrial premature beat (APB) and J waves in patients with coronary heart disease and patients with noncardiac diseases. The prevalence and response of J waves to sudden shortening of the RR interval on the conducted APB were determined and compared between the 2 patients groups. The change in the QRS complexes on the APB was also determined. Among 17,013 patients, 243 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction or angina pectoris had an APB, and J waves were observed in 16 patients (6.6%). In an additional 729 patients with noncardiac diseases and APB, 19 patients showed J waves (2.6%; p = 0.010). The clinical features were almost similar between the ischemic and nonischemic groups. J waves were located more often in inferior and high lateral leads in the ischemic group. When the RR interval shortened from 942 ± 228 to 621 ± 175 ms and 869 ± 158 to 570 ± 118 ms at baseline and in the conducted APB (p<0.001 for both), the J-wave amplitude increased from 0.16 ± 0.04 to 0.19 ± 0.06 mV (p<0.001) and 0.21 ± 0.07 to 0.24 ± 0.08 mV (p = 0.010) in the ischemic and nonischemic groups, respectively. J waves in patients with chronic coronary heart disease and in patients with noncardiac diseases were augmented at short RR intervals together with distinct changes in the QRS complexes, and an augmentation of J waves at short RR interval may represent a conduction delay.

a ViT predicts the presence of 'Eyeglasses' in this image with a probability of 0.998. b Superpixel definitions for the test image following the 16 × 16 pixel definition of ViT patches. TERP results showcasing c, d, e θ j, and f ζ j as functions of j, g corresponding TERP explanation. We can see the maximal drop in θ j happens when going from j = 2 to j = 3. By defining the optimal temperatureas discussed in the “Results” section, a minimum in ζ j is observed at j = 3. Panels h – j show sanity checks, i.e. the result of an AI explanation scheme should be sensitive under model parameter randomization (h), (i) and data randomization (j). k Saliency map results as baseline explanation for ‘Eyeglasses’ prediction. Red color highlights pixels with high absolute values of the class probability gradient across RGB channels. The high gradient at pixels not relevant to ‘Eyeglasses’ shows the limitation of the saliency map explanation. l TERP, and m saliency map explanations for the class ‘Male’. ζ j, and θ j as functions of j for (l, m) are provided in the SI.

To explain the ViT prediction ‘Eyeglasses’ (prediction probability of 0.998) for the image shown in Fig. 5 a using TERP, we first construct human-understandable representative features by dividing the image into 196 superpixels (collection of pixels) corresponding to the 196 ViT patches as shown in Fig. 5 b. Afterward, a neighborhood of perturbed images was generated by averaging the RGB color of randomly chosen superpixels following the neighborhood generation scheme outlined in “Methods.” Figure 5 c–f shows,, θ j, and ζ j as functions of j after implementing the TERP protocol (Fig. 3). Thus, TERP explanation enables us to conclude that the ViT prediction of ‘Eyeglasses’ was made for the correct reasons. The optimal TERP explanation shown in Fig. 5 g appears at j = 3, due to the maximal decrease in θ j as j is increased from 2 to 3. Using Equations (7) and (8), ζ j is calculated, and a minimum occurs at j = 3.

### Joint-specific multidimensional assessment of pain (J-MAP): factor structure, reliability, validity, and responsiveness in patients with knee osteoarthritis [^225d6193]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a reliable and valid instrument for measuring and monitoring joint-specific pain.

Methods

Developed using patient interviews, reviews of pain literature, and expert input from orthopedic surgeons, the final Joint-Specific Multidimensional Assessment of Pain (J-MAP) includes the 6-item Pain Sensory and the 4-item Pain Affect subscales. Scores on the J-MAP Pain Sensory and Affect subscales range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more pain intensity and worse pain distastefulness, respectively. Following the assessment of the factor structure, patients' scores (n = 180) on the J-MAP subscales were converted to equal interval scores using Rasch analyses. A psychometric evaluation of the items and Rasch-calibrated scores was conducted and included an assessment of reliability, validity, and responsiveness for use with patients with radiographic knee osteoarthritis.

Results

Evidence from the factor analyses showed that the J-MAP Pain Sensory and Affect items made up 2 distinct factors. Internal consistency estimates for the J-MAP subscales exceeded 0.85. The J-MAP subscales showed evidence for validity and were shown to be internally and externally responsive, demonstrating greater responsiveness than the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale or the Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 pain subscales. Finally, evidence was found supporting the J-MAP subscales' ability to distinguish target joint pain from pain emanating from other musculoskeletal conditions.

Conclusion

The J-MAP is a reliable, valid, and responsive measure for assessing joint-specific pain at a single time point, or changes over time for one or a group of patients with knee osteoarthritis. With this initial evidence of its psychometric rigor, further testing of the measurement properties of the J-MAP in other joints and in other populations should be undertaken.

### Fine-scale spatial genetic structure within continuous and fragmented populations of trillium camschatcense [^d96ebd62]. The Journal of Heredity (2007). Low credibility.

Spatial genetic structure (SGS) within populations was analyzed for the ling-lived understory perennial herb Trillium camschatcense using allozyme loci. We used Sp statistics to compare SGS between 2 life-history stages, juveniles (J) and reproductives (R), as well as between 2 populations, continuous and fragmented, with different habitat conditions. In the continuous population, significant SGS was detected in both stages but the extent was greatly reduced with the progress of the stage (J, Sp = 0.0475; R, Sp = 0.0053). We inferred that limited seed dispersal and subsequent random loss of individuals from the family patches are responsible for the J and R stage structures, respectively. The fragmented population differed in the patterns of SGS; significant structure was detected in the R stage, but not in the J stage (J, Sp = 0.0021; R, Sp = 0.0165) despite significant positive inbreeding coefficients (J, F(IS) = 0.251). The observed differences in the J-stage structures between populations may be explained by habitat fragmentation effects because reduced recruitment in the fragmented population prevents the development of maternal sibling cohort. Such comparative analysis between populations and life-history stages can be useful to understand the different underlying causes of SGS.

### RNA-seq analysis of chondrocyte transcriptome reveals genetic heterogeneity in LG / J and SM / J murine strains [^0030faba]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the transcriptomic differences in chondrocytes obtained from LG/J (large, healer) and SM/J (small, non-healer) murine strains in an attempt to discern the molecular pathways implicated in cartilage regeneration and susceptibility to osteoarthritis (OA).

Design

We performed RNA-sequencing on chondrocytes derived from LG/J (n = 16) and SM/J (n = 16) mice. We validated the expression of candidate genes and compared single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the two mouse strains. We also examined gene expression of positional candidates for ear pinna regeneration and long bone length quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that display differences in cartilaginous expression.

Results

We observed a distinct genetic heterogeneity between cells derived from LG/J and SM/J mouse strains. We found that gene ontologies representing cell development, cartilage condensation, and regulation of cell differentiation were enriched in LG/J chondrocytes. In contrast, gene ontologies enriched in the SM/J chondrocytes were mainly related to inflammation and degeneration. Moreover, SNP analysis revealed that multiple validated genes vary in sequence between LG/J and SM/J in coding and highly conserved noncoding regions. Finally, we showed that most QTLs have 20-30% of their positional candidates displaying differential expression between the two mouse strains.

Conclusions

While the enrichment of pathways related to cell differentiation, cartilage development and cartilage condensation infers superior healing potential of LG/J strain, the enrichment of pathways related to cytokine production, immune cell activation and inflammation entails greater susceptibility of SM/J strain to OA. These data provide novel insights into chondrocyte transcriptome and aid in identification of the quantitative trait genes and molecular differences underlying the phenotypic differences associated with individual QTLs.

### Assessment of DHA on reducing early preterm birth: the ADORE randomized controlled trial protocol [^86b90263]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical model

The statistical model will evaluate final determination of which group is “best.” This is referred to as the group having the lowest rate of ePTB. For this study the number of PTBs is modeled with a binomial distribution. For the j th group the number of ePTBs, Y j, is modeled conditional on the number of births, n j, as a binomial distribution Y j ~ Binom (n j,θ j). θ j is the rate of early preterm births (ePTB) of which we provide “weakly informative” priors, logit(θ j) ~ N(−3.5,1.5 2). This prior not only provides a design Type I error rate of 5% (see below), it is also very diffuse since the point estimate of θ j is 2.9% ePTB and 95% interval 0.16–36%. This is very, very spread out. Using the data and the prior probabilities, we then use Markov Chain Monte Carlo computations to obtain the Bayesian posterior distributions of θ j respectively for each group as well as calculating probability (group j is best).

Response adaptive randomization

After 150 subjects are enrolled in each group the next round of subjects is randomized using a formula that takes advantage of the information gained from our analyses up to that point. Next subjects are randomly allocated to be enrolled in the j th group proportional to V j = [prob(group j is best)xVar(θ j)/(n j + 1)] 1/4. This formula assigns more patients to the most promising group. The study remains blinded throughout. In response to reviewer concern that adjustment after 150 enrollments in each group would be too soon, PIs explored an alternative adaptive design beginning after 300 enrollments in each group. The sample size changed from 938 with 60% in the winning group to 940 with 56% in the winning groups. The average recruitment length changed from 184 to 183 weeks. We chose to stay with adjustment after 150 enrollments in each group because it resulted in more subjects on the better dose than the later adjustment.

### Intellectual disability and developmental risk: promoting intervention to improve child and family well-being [^911cd9cd]. Child Development (2017). Low credibility.

Initial intervention processes for children with intellectual disabilities (IDs) largely focused on direct efforts to impact core cognitive and academic deficits associated with the diagnosis. Recent research on risk processes in families of children with ID, however, has influenced new developmental system approaches to early intervention. Recent risk and resilience processes are reviewed that connect stress, family process, and the high rates of behavioral problems in children with ID that have substantial influence on child and family outcomes. These models are linked to emerging evidence-based intervention processes that focus on strategic parent skill training and mindfulness interventions that reduce parental stress and create indirect benefits for children's behavioral competencies. A family-focused developmental systems approach (M. J. Guralnick, 2011) is emphasized.

### Electrocardiographic characteristics of patients with false tendon: possible association of false tendon with J waves [^29ea810e]. Heart Rhythm (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The false tendons (FTs) are fibromuscular bands that transverse the left ventricular cavity and often contain conduction tissue, suggesting that FTs may contribute to the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. The presence of J waves is associated with vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias; however, the mechanisms underlying the manifestation of J waves remain to be elucidated.

Objective

To investigate the electrocardiographic characteristics, including the presence of J waves, in patients with FTs.

Methods

We studied 44 patients with distinct FTs detected by echocardiography (FT group) and 88 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects without FTs (control group). The PQ, QRS, JT, QT, corrected JT, and corrected QT intervals were automatically measured on surface 12-lead electrocardiograms, and the presence or absence of J waves was also determined. J waves were defined as terminal QRS notching or slurring. FTs were classified according to their points of attachment as type 1 (longitudinal, 52%), type 2 (diagonal, 25%), type 3 (transverse, 16%), and type 4 (weblike, 7%).

Results

QRS and corrected QT intervals were significantly longer in the FT group than in the control group (P <.005 and P <.05, respectively). The incidence of J waves was significantly higher in the FT group (64%) than in the control group (19%) (P <.0001). J waves were more prevalent in type 1 (78%) and type 2 (73%) than in type 3 (14%) and 4 FTs (33%) (P <0.05) and in patients with thick FTs (≥ 2 mm) than with thinner FTs (<2 mm) (71% vs 33%; P <.05). The J-wave location differed according to the FT type.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that FTs may carry a certain role to the genesis of J waves.

### Anatomic drivers of J-sign presence and severity: If there is a jump, look for a bump [^267bd96c]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction is frequently indicated for recurrent lateral patellar instability. The preoperative presence and severity of a J-sign have been associated with poorer postoperative outcomes.

Purpose

To determine the underlying anatomic factors that contribute to the presence, severity, and jumping quality of the J-sign.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

All patients undergoing evaluation for patellar instability at a single institution between 2013 and 2023 and healthy controls without patellar instability were included. Patients with a history of knee osteotomies were excluded. The presence of a jumping J-sign and its relationship to patellofemoral measures including the Caton-Deschamps Index (CDI), trochlear dysplasia (Dejour grade), tibial tubercle-trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance, tibial tubercle lateralization, trochlear bump height, mechanical alignment, femoral anteversion, tibial torsion, trochlear medialization, patellar width, axial patellar/trochlear overlap, patellar height, trochlear height, and knee rotation angle (KRA) were measured using standardized 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Univariate pairwise and multivariable analyses were performed to determine the factors associated with J-sign presence, severity, and quality.

Results

Of the 130 knees with patellar instability, 89 (68.5%) demonstrated a J-sign on physical examination. In total, 44 (33.8%) patients demonstrated a 1-quadrant J-sign, 32 (24.6%) demonstrated a 2-quadrant smooth J-sign, and 13 (10.0%) demonstrated a jumping J-sign. A total of 22 control, noninstability cases were included. On multivariable analysis, increasing TT-TG distance (OR, 1.1 increase per millimeter; P = .04), external KRA (OR, 1.1 increase per degree; P = .02), and increasing CDI (OR, 1.3 increase per 0.1 increase in CDI; P = .02) were associated with J-sign presence. Increasing bump height (OR, 1.72 increase per millimeter; P = .007) and decreasing patellar width (OR, 0.89 decrease per millimeter; P = .076) were associated with a larger J-sign, when present. Increasing bump height (OR, 1.80 increase per millimeter; P = .018), increasing patellar width (OR, 1.33 increase per millimeter; P = .047), and decreasing CDI (OR, 0.009 decrease per 0.01 increase in ratio; P = .008) were associated with a jumping J-sign in comparison with a smooth 2-quadrant J-sign. A KRA of 10° (AUC, 0.70) and a cartilaginous bump height of 6.6 mm (AUC, 0.73) were thresholds associated with jumping J-sign presence.

Conclusion

The presence of a J-sign is associated with MRI findings of relatively greater external tibiofemoral rotation, increased TT-TG distance, and increased patellar height, while J-sign severity and jumping quality are associated with the presence of additional underlying trochlear factors such as increased bump height. The anatomic drivers identified in this study should be further evaluated as possible factors associated with suboptimal outcomes after surgical management.

### Circadian variation of late potentials in idiopathic ventricular fibrillation associated with J waves: insights into alternative pathophysiology and risk stratification [^7e3f9f5e]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of J waves on ECGs is related to idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the pathophysiology of J waves by assessing risk markers that reflect electrophysiologic abnormalities.

Methods

The study enrolled 22 idiopathic VF patients (17 men and 5 women; mean age 36 +/- 13 years). Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of J waves. The following risk stratifiers were assessed: late potentials (LPs; depolarization abnormality marker) for 24 hours using a newly developed signal-averaging system, and T-wave alternans and QT dispersion (repolarization abnormality markers). Frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects autonomic modulation, also was assessed. The results were compared to those of 30 control subjects with J waves and 30 with no J wave, matched for age and gender to the idiopathic VF patients.

Results

J waves were present in 7 (32%) idiopathic VF patients. The incidence of LP in the idiopathic VF J-wave group was higher than in the idiopathic VF non-J-wave group (86% vs 27%, P = .02). In contrast, repolarization abnormality markers did not differ between the two groups. In the idiopathic VF J-wave group, dynamic changes in LP parameters (fQRS, RMS(40), LAS(40)) were observed and were pronounced at nighttime; this was not the case in the idiopathic VF non-J-wave group and the control J-wave group. High-frequency components (vagal tone index) on frequency-domain HRV analysis were associated with J waves in idiopathic VF patients (P < .05).

Conclusion

Idiopathic VF patients with J waves had a high incidence of LP showing circadian variation with night ascendancy. J waves may be more closely associated with depolarization abnormality and autonomic modulation than with repolarization abnormality.

### Functional proteomics identifies miRNAs to target a p27 / myc / phospho-Rb signature in breast and ovarian cancer [^2cf00f56]. Oncogene (2016). Low credibility.

Data pretreatment

The data was normalized for plate variation.For screen 1, the expression levels of proteins were normalized with respect to the mean of the expression levels of the controls (mock and non-targeting). This gives the fold change data FP i, j for observation i and protein j for j =1,…,n where n is the number of proteins. The discrete data can then be computed as follows: For antibody j, compute the fold change s.d. FSTD j for the fold change data of the 44 controls. If |FP i, j −1|>2.33 × FSTD j, then the expression level is 2% significantly low/high.

The data can be converted into discrete form by setting Discrete Protein expression:

DP i, j =−1, if |FP i, j −1 |⩽−2.33 × FSTD j ;

DP i, j =0, if |FP i, j −1|>−2.33 × FSTD j and |FP i, j −1|<2.33 × FSTD j ; and

DP i, j =1, if |FP i, j −1|⩾2.33 × FSTD j.

For the second screen, the fold change of protein expression levels can be determined as above, but due to the lower number of controls, the s.d. of the controls from the first screen was used to transform the continuous fold change data into discrete data as above.

Cell culture

MDA-MB-231, HeyA8 and SKOV3.ip1 cells were maintained in RPMI with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum; SKBr3, OVCAR-3, BxPC-3 and L3.6pl cells were maintained in RPMI with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum; and MIA PaCa 2, Panc1, U87, SNB19 and LN229 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. All media was also supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 0.25 ug/ml amphotericin B, and all cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO 2.000000000000000e+00 Transfections were carried out at approximately 70% confluency using 20 nmiRNA mimics (Dharmacon) and the appropriate DharmaFECT reagent (Dharmacon), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

### The efficacy of experiential dynamic therapies: a 10-year systematic review and meta-analysis update [^0ec06368]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies that met the overall EDT criterion were then read in detail to determine additional inclusion criteria. Each study had to (1) target a clinical population diagnosed using a formal system (e.g. DSM, ICD) or other established procedure for the targeted condition (e.g. a disorder specific interview or defined cut‐off on a specific measure), (2) deliver EDT as individual therapy, group therapy or internet‐based treatment, (3) use randomized allocation of participants and (4) report sufficient data for the calculation of effect sizes on a primary outcome. To evaluate these criteria, as well as assess study quality (see below), only studies published full‐text in English were considered. Studies were further excluded if they (a) evaluated single‐session interventions (as EDTs typically involve eight to 40+ sessions in clinical practice) or (b) were parametric studies comparing variations of EDTs (e.g. long‐term versus short‐term), unless a separate control condition was present for comparison (e.g. Mechler, Lindqvist, Magnusson, et al.; Rahmani, Abbass, Hemmati, Ghaffari, et al.; Rahmani, Abbass, Hemmati, Mirghaed, et al.).

Two researchers in the team (P. L. and R. J.) collaboratively assessed the inclusion and exclusion criteria and differences in opinion were discussed until consensus was reached. Next, one researcher (P. L.) extracted data for effect sizes, study characteristics and moderator variables (except study quality, see below). To ensure coding integrity, a second researcher (R. J.) independently coded a random subset of studies (k = 12, 21%). Interrater reliability was excellent across extracted study variables, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC [2,1]) ranging from 0.89 to 0.92 and Cohen's kappa (κ) ranging from 0.77 to 1.00, indicating a high degree of coding consistency.

### Multisociety statement on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination as a condition of employment for healthcare personnel [^6112c2f9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Postauthorization safety monitoring—FDA and CDC are conducting extensive postauthorization safety monitoring, and the CDC ACIP convened the Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) subgroup to review, evaluate, and interpret postauthorization vaccine safety data. Vaccine safety surveillance has relied on passive surveillance via the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), which is cocomanged by CDC and FDA; to enhance this, CDC created v-safe, a smartphone-based, quasireal-time surveillance application that assesses side effects, contacts those reporting severe adverse events, and facilitates VAERS reports, while other active systems are also in place. Reported rates of expected side effects after Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or J&J/Janssen vaccination have been similar to those in clinical trials, and several unanticipated but limited side effects have been identified through postauthorization monitoring.

### Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A is affected in the central nervous system of mice with Huntington disease and in the brain of a human with Huntington disease postmortem [^2fbd9d97]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Synaptic dysfunction is a primary mechanism underlying Huntington disease (HD) progression. This study investigated changes in synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) density by means of 11 C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging in the central nervous system of mice with HD. Methods: Dynamic 11 C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging was performed at clinically relevant disease stages (at 3, 7, 10, and 16 mo) in the heterozygous knock-in Q175DN mouse model of HD and wild-type littermates (16-18 mice per genotype and time point). Cerebral 11 C-UCB-J analyses were performed to assess genotypic differences during presymptomatic (3 mo) and symptomatic (7-16 mo) disease stages. 11 C-UCB-J binding in the spinal cord was quantified at 16 mo. 3 H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence were performed postmortem in mouse and human brain tissues. Results: 11 C-UCB-J binding was lower in symptomatic heterozygous mice than in wild-type littermates in parallel with disease progression (7 and 10 mo: P < 0.01; 16 mo: P < 0.0001). Specific 11 C-UCB-J binding was detectable in the spinal cord, with symptomatic heterozygous mice displaying a significant reduction ( P < 0.0001). 3 H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence corroborated the in vivo measurements demonstrating lower SV2A in heterozygous mice ( P < 0.05). Finally, preliminary analysis of SV2A in the human brain postmortem suggested lower SV2A in HD gene carriers than in controls without dementia. Conclusion: 11 C-UCB-J PET detected SV2A deficits during symptomatic disease in heterozygous mice in both the brain and the spinal cord and therefore may be suitable as a novel marker of synaptic integrity widely distributed in the central nervous system. On clinical application, 11 C-UCB-J PET imaging may have promise for SV2A measurement in patients with HD during disease progression and after disease-modifying therapeutic strategies.

### Evidence for a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid in PbCuTeO [^342ccf3d]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

An important remaining question is why the complex model we propose for PbCuTe 2 O 6 induces sufficiently strong quantum fluctuations for quantum spin liquid formation. According to common understanding, quantum effects for small spins are particularly strong when the corresponding classical (large spin) model exhibits an infinite ground state degeneracy, as is the case for the kagome or pyrochlore models with isotropic antiferromagnetic interactions. Performing a classical Monte Carlo analysis of our system, we found that the full J 1 − J 2 − J 3 − J 4 model in fact does not exhibit infinite degeneracy for large spin but instead shows long-range magnetic order. However, we have identified an infinite degeneracy in the classical model with only the J 1 and J 2 interactions. From this perspective, the weaker J 3 and J 4 couplings act as perturbations inducing a small energy splitting in the degenerate classical J 1 − J 2 -only system. We, therefore, propose that the strong quantum fluctuations of the full J 1 − J 2 − J 3 − J 4 model with quantum spin-originate from the degeneracy of the classical J 1 − J 2 model. This is supported by PFFRG calculations showing that the correlation profiles of both systems resemble each other (see Fig. 4e, where the degeneracy of the J 1 − J 2 -only classical model manifests as streaks in the [1, 1, 1] direction). Finally, the degeneracy in the classical J 1 − J 2 model can be understood from the fact that the hyper-hyperkagome lattice forms a network of corner-sharing triangles. As for the classical antiferromagnetic kagome and pyrochlore lattices, the ground states in such corner-sharing geometries must obey the local constraint that the vector sum of the spins in each triangle or tetrahedron is zero. The large ground-state degeneracy then follows from the fact that there are infinitely many states which fulfil all constraints.

### Effectiveness of oncogenetics training on general practitioners' consultation skills: a randomized controlled trial [^e5d3bf06]. Genetics in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Intervention

The intervention group attended a 4-h face-to-face evening training covering oncogenetic consultation skills (family history, familial risk assessment, and efficient referral), attitude (medical ethical issues), and clinical knowledge required in primary-care genetic consultations. More specifically, the training comprised the following educational content aimed at equipping GPs to:
Recall clinically relevant information about types of hereditary cancer (breast, ovarian, colon, skin), including genes associated with oncogenetics syndromes most commonly tested for;
Recognize patients with features suggesting inherited predisposition to cancer;
Draw a family tree as a tool to identify patients at risk;
Discuss (possible) familial and hereditary cancer risks, management of potentially developing hereditary cancer (i.e. surveillance and risk-reducing surgical options), and related ethical issues;
Identify patients for referral for risk assessment and find relevant information online using oncogenetics guidelines;
Explain the possibilities and limitations of oncogenetic testing; and
Know when to consult and/or refer to a genetics specialist.

The training was developed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of an NHG educational expert (L.E.J.v.d.J.), a GP researcher (E.J.F.H.), two clinical geneticists, and two educationalists (S.J.v.L and C.v.d.V.). The focus was on oncogenetic diseases with relatively high prevalence in family practice (breast cancer due to BRCA mutations, colon cancer (e.g. familial adenomatous polyposis, Lynch syndrome) due to APC /mismatch–repair gene mutations, and skin cancer (e.g. familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome due to CDKN2A (p16) gene mutations)). The training started with a 1-h interactive theoretical session on hereditary forms of cancer led by a clinical geneticist from a local academic hospital who was familiar with the aims of the program, followed by a 1-h session with two patients of the Dutch BRCA patient organization, who talked about their experiences, discussed ethical issues, and answered questions. A short break was followed by a 2-h workshop in which participants in small groups engaged in three role-playing consultations for three oncogenetic problems in the presence of experts (clinical geneticist, patient representatives, and two trainers). Patients and GPs were role-played by participants, and the others gave feedback.

### Current theoretical models of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): conceptual review and treatment implications [^058aa967]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Theoretical conceptualizations of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) continue to undergo scrutiny and refinement. The current paper critiques five contemporary models of GAD: the Avoidance Model of Worry and GAD [Borkovec, T. D. (1994). The nature, functions, and origins of worry. In: G. Davey & F.

Expanding our conceptualization of and treatment for generalized anxiety disorder: integrating mindfulness/acceptance-based approaches with existing cognitive behavioral models. Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice, 9, 54-68]. Evidence in support of each model is critically reviewed, and each model's corresponding evidence-based therapeutic interventions are discussed. Generally speaking, the models share an emphasis on avoidance of internal affective experiences (i.e., thoughts, beliefs, and emotions). The models cluster into three types: cognitive models (i.e., IUM, MCM), emotional/experiential (i.e., EDM, ABM), and an integrated model (AMW). This clustering offers directions for future research and new treatment strategies.

### Impact of mesenteric defect closure during laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB): a retrospective study for a total of 2093 LRYGB [^92c90337]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Internal hernia is a rare but a potentially fatal complication of laparoscopic Roux-En-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). The aims of this study are to determine the impact of mesenteric defects closure on the incidence of internal hernia after LRYGB and to determine the symptoms, characteristics, and management of internal hernias after LRYGB.

Methods

A retrospective study for a total of 2093 LRYGB was carried out from 1998 to December 2013. Four hundred twenty-one patients were operated without closure of the mesenteric defects (group A). From January 2005 to December 2013, 1672 patients were operated with closure of the mesenteric defects at Petersen defect (PD) and at jejunojejunal anastomosis (J-J) defect (group B). The incidence of internal hernias was compared between the two periods.

Results

Out of the 2093 patients who underwent LRYGB, 20 patients (0.95%) developed a symptomatic internal hernia that required primary surgical intervention; 7 patients (1.66%) in group A all at J-J DEFECT versus 13 patients (0.78%) in (group B) 6 at (J-J DEFECT), 5 at PD, and 2 at PD, J-J DEFECT. This incidence was significantly lower in (group B) (p=0.0021). The median interval between LRYGB and reoperation was 53 months in group A and 26 months in group B. A CT scan was performed in 8 patients, 40%, and showed signs of occlusion in all cases.

Conclusions

The closure of mesenteric defects during LRYGB is recommended because it is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of internal hernia.

### Physicians' perspectives on family caregivers' roles in elderly cancer patients' therapies: a qualitative, interview-based study [^52bb3408]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

We analyzed the data using the RTA approach. This analytical framework is deemed particularly useful to understand participants’ “views, perspectives, and experiences.” As the project was primarily exploratory in character and was not focused on a specific research question from the outset, we refrained from linking data collection and data analysis in the sense of an iterative, theoretical sampling process. RTA has been found well-suited for analyzing pre-existing data sets for themes and patterns that might not have been anticipated in the original data collection process.

Initially, we screened the interviews for mentions and assessments of the characteristics of older patients’ treatment and their specific needs in order to familiarize ourselves with the data (A.H. S.E. F.G.). We subsequently focused on coding interviewees’ expressions and remarks on the significance and the roles of FCGs in cancer therapy, consultation settings, and therapy decision-making processes (A.H. S.E. F.G.). The generated themes were evaluated, critiqued, and validated reflexively (A.H. S.E. F.W. J.H. F.G.). The validated themes were then used to develop a condensed but accurately descriptive typology that maps the spectrum of physicians’ perspectives on the inclusion of FCGs (A.H. S.E. F.G.). Finally, we compiled indicative quotations to illustrate the types identified, as presented below (A.H. F.G.). All interviews were conducted in German.

### Alternating quarantine for sustainable epidemic mitigation [^50eaf9fc]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Results

Modeling the spread of SARS-CoV-2

Social network : We constructed a population of N ~ 10 4 individuals, comprising M = 4 × 10 3 separate households, and tracked their sequence of social interactions at 15 min resolution over the course of T = 150 days. These interactions are governed by two separate networks: day-time interactions at work, school, or other public places are driven by the external network A i j. This represents an N × N network with degree distribution P (k), designed to capture out-of-home social activity (Fig. 2 a, orange). In-house interactions, taking place predominantly during the after-hours, are governed by B i j, a network of M isolated cliques, capturing households (Fig. 2 a, blue). The size of these cliques m is extracted from the empirically obtainedhousehold size distribution P (m).

### Global practice of sleep medicine: iran [^cdf98748]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

In this study we aimed to conduct a comprehensive review of sleep medicine in Iran, focusing on the country's advancements, challenges, and the global context.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive review of sleep medicine in Iran, using various sources to ensure a thorough analysis. The national educational curriculum for sleep medicine and guidelines on sleep clinics issued by Iran's Ministry of Health served as a foundational resource. Additionally, we gathered information from the Iranian Sleep Medicine Society website and relevant committee data sources. To enhance our understanding of the current research landscape, we performed a targeted search on PubMed using keywords related to sleep and Iran.

Results

The study presents a dynamic overview of sleep medicine in Iran, highlighting key advancements and challenges. Significant progress was observed in establishing standardized sleep medicine training and accredited sleep clinics. The Iranian Sleep Medicine Society plays a pivotal role in spearheading these developments, contributing to implementing regional guidelines for sleep tests. However, challenges such as a limited number of trained specialists, a scarcity of certified sleep clinics, and obstacles to accessing sleep disorder treatments were identified.

Conclusions

We advocate for the implementation of increased research initiatives, nationwide education and screening programs, and proactive measures to strengthen the landscape of sleep and circadian medicine in the country.

### A new framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions: update of medical research council guidance [^16f3094b]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

One of the motivations for developing this new framework was to answer calls for a change in research priorities, towards allocating greater effort and funding to research that can have the optimum impact on healthcare or population health outcomes. The framework challenges the view that unbiased estimates of effectiveness are the cardinal goal of evaluation. It asserts that improving theories and understanding how interventions contribute to change, including how they interact with their context and wider dynamic systems, is an equally important goal. For some complex intervention research problems, an efficacy or effectiveness perspective will be the optimal approach, and a randomised controlled trial will provide the best design to achieve an unbiased estimate. For others, alternative perspectives and designs might work better, or might be the only way to generate new knowledge to reduce decision maker uncertainty.

What is important for the future is that the scope of intervention research is not constrained by an unduly limited set of perspectives and approaches that might be less risky to commission and more likely to produce a clear and unbiased answer to a specific question. A bolder approach is needed—to include methods and perspectives where experience is still quite limited, but where we, supported by our workshop participants and respondents to our consultations, believe there is an urgent need to make progress. This endeavour will involve mainstreaming new methods that are not yet widely used, as well as undertaking methodological innovation and development. The deliberative and flexible approach that we encourage is intended to reduce research waste,maximise usefulness for decision makers, and increase the efficiency with which complex intervention research generates knowledge that contributes to health improvement.

Monitoring the use of the framework and evaluating its acceptability and impact is important but has been lacking in the past. We encourage research funders and journal editors to support the diversity of research perspectives and methods that are advocated here and to seek evidence that the core elements are attended to in research design and conduct. We have developed a checklist to support the preparation of funding applications, research protocols, and journal publications.This checklist offers one way to monitor impact of the guidance on researchers, funders, and journal editors.

We recommend that the guidance is continually updated, and future updates continue to adopt a broad, pluralist perspective. Given its wider scope, and the range of detailed guidance that is now available on specific methods and topics, we believe that the framework is best seen as meta-guidance. Further editions should be published in a fluid, web based format, and more frequently updated to incorporate new material, further case studies, and additional links to other new resources.

### AHA / ACCF / HRS recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram: part VI: acute ischemia / infarction: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association electrocardiography and arrhythmias committee, council on clinical cardiology ; the American college of cardiology foundation ; and the Heart Rhythm Society. endorsed by the international society for computerized electrocardiology [^a72e97f8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Acute ischemia/infarction ECG—age-, sex-, and lead-specific thresholds for abnormal J-point changes—notes that threshold values are dependent on gender, age, and ECG lead. For men 40 years of age and older, the threshold value for abnormal J-point elevation should be 0.2 mV (2 mm) in leads V2 and V3 and 0.1 mV (1 mm) in all other leads; for men less than 40 years of age, the threshold values for abnormal J-point elevation in leads V2 and V3 should be 0.25 mV (2.5 mm); for women, the threshold value for abnormal J-point elevation should be 0.15 mV (1.5 mm) in leads V2 and V3 and greater than 0.1 mV (1 mm) in all other leads. For men and women, the threshold for abnormal J-point elevation in V3R and V4R should be 0.05 mV (0.5 mm), except for males less than 30 years of age, for whom 0.1 mV (1 mm) is more appropriate; for men and women, the threshold value for abnormal J-point elevation in V7 through V9 should be 0.05 mV (0.5 mm); and for men and women of all ages, the threshold value for abnormal J-point depression should be −0.05 mV (−0.5 mm) in leads V2 and V3 and −0.1 mV (−1 mm) in all other leads.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .

### Safety and efficacy of direct percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy tube placement compared with surgical jejunostomy: a tertiary care analysis [^3053cd3d]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Jejunostomy tube placements provides enteral access for feeding in eligible patients who cannot meet their nutritional needs by mouth. They can be surgically placed laparoscopically (lap-J) or with the use of a conventional open laparotomy approach (open-J). Recently, direct percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (DPEJ) has emerged as an alternative owing to its low cost and shorter recovery times. We sought to retrospectively compare the procedural success rates and adverse events of these methods.

Methods

Patients were identified by querying our health system patient database and the departmental database of patients who underwent DPEJ. The patients were divided into 3 cohorts based on the procedure: DPEJ, lap-J, or open-J. Patient age and body mass index, procedural success rate, and adverse event rate were compared among the 3 groups.

Results

A total of 201 patients met inclusion criteria (65 DPEJ, 111 lap-J, and 25 open-J). Procedural success rates were similar among the 3 groups (DPEJ 96.9%, lap-J 99.1%, open-J 100%; P = .702). Rates of infection and bleeding were also similar among the 3 groups. There were no cases of GI perforation. Tube dysfunction for any reason that required complete removal or replacement within 90 days occurred more often in the surgical groups than in the DPEJ group (DPEJ 0%, lap-J 35.1%, open-J 40.0%; P < .001). This was driven largely by increased rates of tube clogging and tube dislodgement in the surgical groups.

Conclusions

DPEJ is a safe and effective alternative to surgical jejunostomy in eligible patients and may be associated with decreased adverse event rates at 90 days.

### Comment on: atkinson. It's time to consider changing the rules: the rationale for rethinking control groups in clinical trials aimed at reversing type 1 diabetes. diabetes 2011 ; 60: 361-363 [^915600a0]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Although in his recent editorial Atkinson made a persuasive argument to consider alternative trial designs for type 1 diabetes, we are in disagreement with the suggestion that placebo-controlled trials are no longer needed in studies evaluating therapies to alter the natural history of type 1 diabetes in recently diagnosed subjects.

Many of the frustrations about the pace of discovery felt by patients, families, and researchers confuse the actual facts about clinical trials. Although it is true that enrollment in clinical trials overall is difficult and hampers the national imperative to translate basic science to clinical care, clinical trials in new-onset type 1 diabetes have not had problems with enrollment. For example, a current placebo-controlled TrialNet study will be fully enrolled in less than four months.

It is important for individuals who enroll in clinical trials to understand that a clinical trial is an experiment—we do not know whether or not the therapy will be helpful, ineffective, or even harmful. The addition of a placebo arm is the best way to ensure that this central hypothesis of a clinical trial is rigorously tested. Non–placebo-controlled trials may lead to therapeutic misconceptions; we do patients and families no favors by implying clinical benefit even inadvertently.

Atkinson asserts that we have sufficient information about the natural history of insulin secretion after diagnosis to use this information as a standard historical “control” group. Unfortunately, this is not entirely true. There is significant variation in the rate of fall of C-peptide over time, and only a fraction of this variation is impacted by known variables. The studies cited by Atkinson contain approximately 100 placebo-treated patients, and those used for proposed power calculations contain fewer than 30 placebo-treated patients. Short of a miracle therapy in which all treated individuals had no fall in C-peptide over time, comparing the decline in C-peptide from uncontrolled trials with these published patients will not enable us to reliably choose how to move forward with further development of either single or combination therapy.

Most importantly, at this relative early stage of clinical trials in type 1 diabetes, we must not allow our emotions to get ahead of the science. Although recent results have been extremely encouraging, only limited information about true clinical benefit and harms can be obtained from the relatively small clinical trials reported to date (∼60–200 patients). Performing such trials without a control group provides even less information for regulatory agencies and clinicians alike and may hinder the development of new “standards of care.”

### The American Society of Addiction Medicine clinical practice guideline development methodology [^d347f3a7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Systematic review—background and processes describes that a quality clinical practice guideline should be based on a systematic review of the literature, which helps ensure that all relevant evidence is identified, critiqued, and synthesized using methods that help reduce the likelihood of bias, and is typically conducted prior to initiating work on the CPG by a group separate from the CPG Writing Group. Systematic reviews use well-established methods to search, identify, appraise, and synthesize the literature examining prespecified key questions of interest; they can contain a qualitative synthesis of evidence, a quantitative synthesis of evidence, or a combination of both; a meta-analysis is the quantitative synthesis of evidence and is based on a systematic review, although not all systematic reviews include a meta-analysis; narrative reviews broadly summarize a topic but do not adhere to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and search parameters nor use explicit criteria to evaluate quality. Broadly speaking, processes include define the question(s) of interest and methods, conduct literature search, identify studies and other sources of information for inclusion, data abstraction, critical appraisal, and synthesis of evidence.

### Update in COVID-19 2020 [^69d24a67]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

As 2020 evolved, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presented the greatest global health crisis in a century, affecting medical, social, and economic systems (Figure 1). Despite challenging society with new ways of living, working, and communicating, its significant clinical, research, and public health impact was admirably managed by clinicians and scientists worldwide against a backdrop of continually evolving evidence. In this update, we review important publications from the American Thoracic Society journals and others that provide insight into pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment advances of COVID-19 disease while also considering broader societal effects. Throughout the update, we use “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)” when referencing the virus and use “COVID-19” in relation to the associated illness.

Results

Analysis of female infertility data among inbred mouse strains

In the present study, we retrieved phenotypic data from the Mouse Phenome Database at Jackson Laboratory. Female infertility was measured as the percent of matings that were nonproductive in 25 inbred mouse strains. The female infertility data along with a phylogenic tree built from the SNP data of all 25 strains are shown in Figure 1. Using an arbitrary cutoff of 20%, 15 strains (P/J, RF/J, 129X1/SvJ, C58/J, NZB/BlNJ, C57BLKS/J, SJL/J, A/J, LP/J, CE/J, SWR/J, SM/J, BALB/cJ, C57BL/10J, and C57L/J) were of high female infertility, whereas 10 strains (C3HeB/FeJ, DBA/1J, NZW/LacJ, C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ, CBA/J, PL/J, AKR/J, DBA/2J, and BALB/cByJ) were of low female infertility. The strain with the lowest female infertility was C3HeB/FeJ (2.7%), whereas the strain with the highest female infertility was C57L/J (62.8%).

Figure 1 
Female infertility data measured as percent of nonproductive matings among 25 mouse strains along with the phylogenic tree based on SNP data. The maximum-likelihood phylogenic tree was built using the pseudoalignment of all SNP alleles for 25 strains with the PhyML package version 3.0. Percent of nonproductive matings is shown as a bar plot. The exact value is shown as a label at the right side of each bar.

### Sleep function: toward elucidating an enigma [^bed30213]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Sleep function remains controversial. Individual perspectives frame the issue of sleep function differently. We briefly illustrate how sleep measurement and the evolution, tissue organization levels, molecular mechanisms, and regulation of sleep could influence one's view of sleep function. Then we discuss six viable theories of sleep function. Sleep serves host-defense mechanisms and conserves caloric expenditures, but these functions likely are opportunistic functions evolving later in evolution. That sleep replenishes brain energy stores and that sleep serves a glymphatic function by removing toxic byproducts of waking activity are attractive ideas, but lack extensive supporting experimental evidence. That sleep restores performance is experimentally demonstrated and has obvious evolutionary value. However, this hypothesis lacks experimentally verified mechanisms although ideas relating to this issue are presented. Finally, the ideas surrounding the broad hypothesis that sleep serves a connectivity/plasticity function are many and attractive. There is experimental evidence that connectivity changes with sleep, sleep loss, and with changing afferent input, and that those changes are linked to sleep regulatory mechanisms. In our view, this is the leading contender for the primordial function of sleep. However, much refinement of ideas and innovative experimental approaches are needed to clarify the sleep-connectivity relationship.

In the 24/7 modern society, sleep disorders and the role of normal amounts and timing of sleep for health are often neglected by both doctors and their patients. Sleep has been said to be "of the brain, by the brain and for the brain" and the most immediate and obvious consequence of disrupted sleep is impaired brain function. This review will cover some of the recent papers published in both the Journal of Neurology and elsewhere in 2013/2014 that have advanced our knowledge of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders.

Recommendations for design and analysis of next-generation sequencing studies—single-cell methods, circadian timing, multi-omics, and validation—note that we anticipate an important role of single-cell sequencing in the future and, for wider acceptance, single-cell sequencing has to address specific hypotheses and should be held to the same rigorous standards as other study designs even while methods are under development; given circadian influences on cellular processes, studies should time stamp sample collection; integrating different omics datasets at the single-cell and tissue levels will likely increase understanding of complex diseases in respiratory, critical care, and sleep medicine; and laboratory validation is an important next step toward eventual translation of results.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^91c29923]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Falls prevention in dementia—Falls are a common and potentially serious problem for all elderly individuals, especially those with dementia, and can lead to hip fracture, head trauma, and other injuries that may further worsen cognitive function. A number of interventions to prevent falls in elderly people have been shown to be effective; one of the most efficacious is withdrawing medications that are associated with falls, central nervous system sedation, or cardiovascular side effects (especially orthostatic hypotension), when appropriate. If gait disturbances are present, canes, walkers, or other supports may be helpful unless they are otherwise contraindicated, and patients at high risk for falling may need to be closely supervised while walking. Environmental modifications can also help reduce risk, including the removal of loose rugs, low tables, and other obstacles; the use of lower beds, night-lights, bedside commodes, and/or frequent toileting; and avoiding bed rails, which may actually increase the risk of falls, with other modifications such as lowering the bed or placing a mattress on the floor typically recommended. Bed and chair monitors have also been suggested as a way to alert caregivers or nursing staff when patients may be getting out of bed or leaving a chair.
