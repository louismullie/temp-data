## Question

"The guidelines also recommend selecting low-dose colchicine in patients with gout when colchicine is the chosen agent " what does this mean please elaborate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what it means to select low-dose colchicine in patients with gout when colchicine is the chosen agent, and how to apply this recommendation in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which guideline this phrase comes from and whether it refers to treating an acute flare or to prophylaxis. Then, I should verify the exact dosing that constitutes "low-dose" for each indication. Next, I will review the evidence comparing low- versus high-dose regimens to justify the recommendation. After that, I need to check special populations and drug–drug interactions that require dose adjustments. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused approach and confirm any nuances that could change management decisions.

> Let me first confirm the source and context. The phrase "select low-dose colchicine when colchicine is the chosen agent" is a direct recommendation from the 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for acute gout flare management, which strongly recommends low-dose colchicine over high-dose colchicine when colchicine is selected as the anti-inflammatory therapy for a flare, citing similar efficacy with fewer adverse effects [^112kpWS7] [^111zAZ1i].

> Now, I should define what "low-dose" means for an acute flare. The ACR specifies the FDA-approved regimen: 1.2 mg at flare onset, followed by 0.6 mg one hour later, for a total of 1.8 mg in the first day; higher doses are not recommended because they do not improve efficacy and increase toxicity, so the total acute dose should not exceed 1.8 mg in that 24-hour window [^112kpWS7] [^113UUqju] [^113vsByn].

> Wait, let me verify the prophylaxis context so I don't conflate indications. For flare prevention — especially when starting or uptitrating urate-lowering therapy — the recommended prophylactic dose is 0.6 mg once or twice daily, with a maximum of 1.2 mg/day, typically continued for at least 3–6 months and longer if flares persist. This is a different use-case than treating an acute flare, though both rely on low-dose strategies for safety [^112LRBAQ] [^116Tdtmx] [^111RqG5r].

> Next, I should review why guidelines prefer low-dose over high-dose for acute treatment. The pivotal AGREE trial and subsequent analyses showed that low-dose colchicine achieved pain relief comparable to high-dose regimens but with dramatically fewer gastrointestinal adverse events; high-dose strategies had roughly threefold more adverse events without added benefit, establishing the modern low-dose standard for flares [^116BbkLZ] [^1132ms2q] [^1135R2x9].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and interactions before finalizing dosing. In chronic kidney disease, colchicine clearance is reduced and toxicity risk rises; for severe impairment or dialysis, prophylactic dosing should start at 0.3 mg/day or even 0.3 mg twice weekly with close monitoring, and acute flare treatment should be limited to 0.6 mg as a single dose not repeated within two weeks; strong CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors (for example, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors) can markedly increase colchicine exposure and may necessitate dose reduction or avoidance, so I need to check the medication list carefully [^117BrKuh] [^notfound] [^114WSd67] [^1139NhAJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute — earlier I almost said "do not adjust dose for mild to moderate CKD", but I should double-check that nuance. The FDA labeling indicates that for mild to moderate renal impairment, dose adjustment for a single acute flare course may not be required, yet patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects; for prophylaxis, starting at 0.3 mg/day is advised in severe impairment, so I need to individualize by CKD stage and tolerance rather than assume no change [^117BrKuh] [^112GK77u].

> I will now examine how this translates into practice. If colchicine is chosen for an acute flare, I should prescribe 1.2 mg immediately, then 0.6 mg one hour later, and stop; I should not escalate beyond 1.8 mg in 24 hours, and I should avoid repeating the course within three days unless clinically justified and interactions have been reassessed; if the patient is already on prophylactic colchicine, I should treat the flare with the 1.2 mg then 0.6 mg regimen, wait 12 hours, and then resume the prophylactic schedule; if colchicine is chosen for prophylaxis during ULT initiation, I should use 0.6 mg once or twice daily, reassessing after 3–6 months and continuing if flares persist [^113UUqju] [^112kpWS7] [^116Tdtmx].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot take colchicine due to contraindications or interactions? I need to ensure alternatives are considered: NSAIDs or glucocorticoids are equally acceptable first-line therapies for flares, and the choice should be tailored to comorbidities such as CKD, cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal risk, and drug–drug interactions; in CKD, expert consensus favors low-dose colchicine or corticosteroids over NSAIDs when feasible, reinforcing the need to match the agent to the patient's risk profile [^1137Cqjh] [^114PZgQd].

> In summary, "select low-dose colchicine when colchicine is the chosen agent" means using the minimal effective regimen: 1.2 mg followed by 0.6 mg one hour later for an acute flare, or 0.6 mg once or twice daily for prophylaxis, with careful attention to renal and hepatic function, drug interactions, and patient-specific risks. This approach maximizes efficacy while minimizing gastrointestinal toxicity and other adverse effects, aligning with contemporary ACR guidance and FDA labeling [^112kpWS7] [^113UUqju] [^112LRBAQ].

---

The phrase means that when colchicine is selected for gout management, clinicians should use the **lowest effective dose** to balance efficacy and safety. For acute flares, use **1.2 mg then 0.6 mg one hour later** (total 1.8 mg) [^113UUqju] [^112kpWS7]; for prophylaxis, use **0.6 mg once or twice daily** (max 1.2 mg/day) [^112LRBAQ] [^113UUqju]. This approach reduces gastrointestinal adverse effects [^1132ms2q] and serious toxicity, and dose should be reduced in renal or hepatic impairment or with interacting drugs [^117BrKuh] [^114WSd67].

---

## Rationale for low-dose colchicine

Low-dose colchicine is recommended because it provides **comparable efficacy** with fewer adverse effects than higher-dose regimens [^1132ms2q]. The AGREE trial showed that low-dose colchicine (1.8 mg total) was as effective as high-dose (4.8 mg) for acute flares but had significantly fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects [^116hFqYY] [^1135R2x9]. This favorable risk–benefit profile underpins the guideline preference for low-dose regimens [^116D1smR].

---

## Specific dosing recommendations

### Acute gout flares

For acute gout flares, the **recommended regimen** is 1.2 mg at onset, followed by 0.6 mg one hour later (total 1.8 mg) [^113UUqju] [^112kpWS7]. The **maximum dose** is 1.8 mg per flare; higher doses are not recommended due to increased toxicity without added benefit [^116BbkLZ].

---

### Prophylaxis of gout flares

For prophylaxis of gout flares, the **recommended regimen** is 0.6 mg once or twice daily (max 1.2 mg/day) [^112LRBAQ]. The **duration** is at least 3–6 months when initiating urate-lowering therapy, with ongoing evaluation and continuation if flares persist [^111RqG5r].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting low-dose colchicine

- **AGREE trial**: Low-dose colchicine (1.8 mg) was as effective as high-dose (4.8 mg) for acute flares but had fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects [^1135R2x9] [^1132ms2q].
- **Cochrane review**: Low-dose colchicine is effective for acute gout with fewer adverse effects than high-dose regimens [^1132ms2q] [^1135R2x9].
- **ACR guidelines**: Strongly recommend low-dose colchicine over high-dose due to similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects [^112kpWS7] [^115ALujz].

---

## Patient populations requiring dose adjustments

Certain populations require **dose adjustments** to minimize toxicity:

| **Patient population** | **Dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| Renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) | Reduce dose to 0.3 mg/day; monitor closely [^117BrKuh] [^112GK77u] |
| Hepatic impairment | Reduce dose; monitor closely [^117RzNTL] [^112GK77u] |
| Elderly patients | Use caution; consider dose reduction [^116y4Xxi] |
| Concomitant CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, cyclosporine) | Reduce dose or avoid use [^114WSd67] [^113vsByn] |

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Low-dose colchicine is generally well tolerated, but clinicians should remain vigilant for:

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain [^1132ms2q].
- **Myopathy**: Risk increases with renal impairment or interacting drugs [^112D3qBA].
- **Bone marrow suppression**: Rare but serious; monitor CBC in high-risk patients [^111RCkTS].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors increase toxicity risk [^114WSd67] [^113vsByn].

---

## Clinical scenarios for low-dose colchicine use

Low-dose colchicine is appropriate in several scenarios, including **acute gout flares** as first-line therapy alongside NSAIDs and corticosteroids [^1137Cqjh] [^112kpWS7], and **prophylaxis during urate-lowering therapy** to prevent flares during initiation or dose escalation of ULT [^116Tdtmx] [^111RqG5r]. It is also suitable for patients with contraindications to NSAIDs or corticosteroids, such as those with renal impairment, gastrointestinal bleeding risk, or cardiovascular disease [^114PZgQd] [^112iwfhS].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Acute flares**: 1.2 mg then 0.6 mg one hour later (max 1.8 mg) [^113UUqju] [^112kpWS7].
- **Prophylaxis**: 0.6 mg once or twice daily (max 1.2 mg/day) for ≥ 3–6 months [^112LRBAQ] [^116Tdtmx].
- **Dose adjustments**: Required in renal/hepatic impairment or with interacting drugs [^117BrKuh] [^113vsByn].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for gastrointestinal, hematologic, and neuromuscular adverse effects [^1132ms2q] [^111RCkTS].

---

Selecting low-dose colchicine means using the **lowest effective dose** to manage gout flares or prevent them during ULT, balancing efficacy with safety and tolerability [^112kpWS7].

### How would you manage this patient with gout? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^114HRgjZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In 2012, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued a guideline, which was followed in 2017 by one from the American College of Physicians (ACP). The guidelines agree on treating acute gout with a corticosteroid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or colchicine and on not initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for most patients after a first gout attack and in those whose attacks are infrequent (< 2 per year). However, they differ on treatment of both recurrent gout and problematic gout. The ACR advocates a "treat-to-target" approach, and the ACP did not find enough evidence to support this approach and offered an alternative strategy that bases intensity of ULT on the goal of avoiding recurrent gout attacks ("treat-to-avoid-symptoms") with no monitoring of urate levels. They also disagree on the role of a gout-specific diet. Here, a general internist and a rheumatologist discuss these guidelines; they debate how they would manage an acute attack of gout, if and when to initiate ULT, and the goals for ULT. Lastly, they offer specific advice for a patient who is uncertain about whether to begin this therapy.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^111RCkTS]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Low‐dose oral colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice daily) is one of the first‐line recommended therapies for prevention of gout flares when commencing urate‐lowering therapy. Although colchicine may be effective, it has a number of potential adverse events, of which the most common are gastrointestinal, including nausea and diarrhea. In people with gout, gastrointestinal adverse events are dose dependent, with more gastrointestinal adverse events observed in those who received a higher dose (4.8 mg over four hours) versus a low dose (1.8 mg over one hour) in a study of gout flares, albeit with no difference in circulating maximum concentration (C max) between the two colchicine doses in healthy volunteers. Other less common adverse events include bone marrow suppression and neuromyotoxicity, which may occur with more prolonged use.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Colchicine concentrations increase with concomitant statin use; this does not result in muscle‐related adverse events.
Regular monitoring of creatine kinase (CK) may not be required; rather, targeted measurement of CK in individuals with muscle symptoms may be more appropriate.
Colchicine therapeutic drug monitoring is of limited value in clinical practice.

Impaired kidney function, which is common in people with gout, is reported to be a predictor of colchicine adverse events. Because of the risk, it has been suggested that a complete blood count and a creatine kinase (CK) measurement should be performed every six months in patients who are receiving long‐term prophylactic colchicine, defined as 0.5 mg daily for six or more months. The prolonged period suggested for anti‐inflammatory prophylaxis and the risk of adverse events have led to a general reluctance to use prophylaxis by many clinicians and people with gout. A study of a nurse‐led educational intervention for people with gout with recurrent flares reported that only 4% of participants opted for anti‐inflammatory prophylaxis when urate‐lowering therapy was increased. Thus, the ability to accurately predict who may obtain the most clinical benefit with the least adverse events based on clinical factors would be of clinical use.

Chronic colchicine — mechanistic effects and safety signals: Colchicine reduces neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells and platelets and has been shown to reduce high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration and low-attenuation plaque volume in patients already on aspirin and statin therapy, and is associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with gout and in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), including those with prior MI, although gastrointestinal events historically reported at a higher rate do not differ from placebo at the lower once daily dosing. A meta-analysis of studies examining colchicine in CAD reported no difference in all-cause death versus placebo, but a nonsignificant trend was observed toward an increased risk of noncardiovascular death that requires further study.

### Gout: state of the art after a decade of developments [^117SUop2]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review article summarizes the relevant English literature on gout from 2010 through April 2017. It emphasizes that the current epidemiology of gout indicates a rising prevalence worldwide, not only in Western countries but also in Southeast Asia, in close relationship with the obesity and metabolic syndrome epidemics. New pathogenic mechanisms of chronic hyperuricaemia focus on the gut (microbiota, ABCG2 expression) after the kidney. Cardiovascular and renal comorbidities are the key points to consider in terms of management. New imaging tools are available, including US with key features and dual-energy CT rendering it able to reveal deposits of urate crystals. These deposits are now included in new diagnostic and classification criteria. Overall, half of the patients with gout are readily treated with allopurinol, the recommended xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI), with prophylaxis for flares with low-dose daily colchicine. The main management issues are related to patient adherence, because gout patients have the lowest rate of medication possession ratio at 1 year, but they also include clinical inertia by physicians, meaning XOI dosage is not titrated according to regular serum uric acid level measurements for targeting serum uric acid levels for uncomplicated (6.0 mg/dl) and complicated gout, or the British Society for Rheumatology recommended target (5.0 mg/dl). Difficult-to-treat gout encompasses polyarticular flares, and mostly patients with comorbidities, renal or heart failure, leading to contraindications or side effects of standard-of-care drugs (colchicine, NSAIDs, oral steroids) for flares; and tophaceous and/or destructive arthropathies, leading to switching between XOIs (febuxostat) or to combining XOI and uricosurics.

Management

Treatment of a gout flare should be commenced as soon as possible, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine or glucocorticoids being first-line options for treatment. An open-label randomised trial comparing low-dose colchicine 500 mg three times per day for 4 days with naproxen 750 mg immediately, then 250 mg every 8 hours for 7 days found that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of pain intensity over 7 days although side effects were more common in the colchicine group, mainly diarrhoea and headache. Another randomised trial comparing oral prednisone and naproxen for monoarticular gout found that either prednisolone 35 mg once a day or naproxen 500 mg two times a day for 5 days were equally effective, and adverse effects were similar between groups. Symptomatic treatment for a gout flare includes immobilisation of the joint and use of cold packs. Anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibodies have also been found to be effective for relief of gout flaresand are generally recommended for patients experiencing gout flares where other drugs have caused side effects or were ineffective.

Long-term use of urate-lowering therapy leads to crystal dissolution, resulting in suppression of gout flares, regression of tophiand prevention of progressive joint damage. Rheumatology societies strongly recommend urate-lowering therapy for patients with tophi, evidence of radiographic damage attributable to gout or frequent gout flares. Urate-lowering therapy may also have benefit earlier in the disease course. Allopurinol is the preferred and most commonly prescribed first-line urate-lowering therapy. Second-line treatments include febuxostat, another xanthine oxidase inhibitor, probenecid, a uricosuric agent and pegloticase, a recombinant uricase administered intravenously.

A treat-to-target serum urate approach is recommended by the ACR guidelinesand EULAR recommendations. Serum urate monitoring allows the dose of medication to be titrated to a target serum urate of below 6 mg/dL (360 µmol/L) in those with symptomatic gout and often below 5 mg/dL (300 µmol/L) in those with features of severe gout such as tophi.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^1142NHAX]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study design

Post hoc analyses of the 12‐month "Is colchicine prophylaxis required with start‐low go‐slow allopurinol dose escalation in gout?" noninferiority randomized controlled trial were undertaken (ACTRN 12618001179224). The methods and results of the full trial have been reported. Briefly, this was a one‐year double‐blind placebo‐controlled noninferiority trial with participants randomized 1:1 to colchicine at 0.5 mg daily or placebo for the first six months. All participants commenced allopurinol, increasing monthly to achieve a target urate level of < 0.36 mmol/L. Starting doses of allopurinol were 50 mg daily in those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and 100 mg daily in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m². The allopurinol doses were increased monthly by 50 mg daily in those with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and by 100 mg daily in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² until the serum urate level was < 0.36 mmol/L (6 mg/dL) for three consecutive visits. Ethical approval was obtained from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee, New Zealand (18/STH/156), and all participants provided written informed consent.

Participants were seen in person every three months by study coordinators, with intervening monthly telephone assessments. Gout flares, defined as self‐reported gout flares requiring treatment, were recorded at each monthly assessment. Adverse events and serious adverse events were collected monthly and coded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0). Participants were asked about the occurrence of any adverse events as well as colchicine‐specific adverse events (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle weakness, and myalgia). Blood samples were obtained monthly for serum urate and creatinine; every three months for complete bloodcount, alanine transaminase, alkaline phophatase, and gamma glutamyl transferase; and at baseline, month three, and month six for CK. Nonfasting plasma samples were collected for trough colchicine plasma concentrations (just before the next colchicine dose) and the assumed peak (30–60 minutes post dose) colchicine concentrations at month three.

2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment

The recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

No dosage modification is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 Serum Uric Acid Level Monitoring

Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat therapy.

2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares

Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Colchicine and the heart [^112V5Xih]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Colchicine is a sophisticated anti-inflammatory agent that has been used for centuries for the treatment and prevention of gout, and for over 50 years for the prevention of acute inflammatory flares in patients with FMF. Almost 35 years ago, the observed benefits of colchicine in the prevention and treatment of polyserositis in patients with FMF led to its introduction into CV medicine for the treatment and prevention of pericarditis. Subsequent randomized trials in over 1600 patients confirming its safety and efficacy have resulted in it being adopted in the European guidelinesand registered in some countries (e.g. Italy, Austria) as first-line therapy for this indication. Over the last 15 years, clinical trials in > 11 000 patients with coronary disease have shown that long-term low-dose colchicine can be safely used on top of lipid-lowering and antiplatelet therapy in the absence of advanced renal or liver disease to improve disease-free survival. Over the next 3–5 years, ongoing trials will add information about the benefits of colchicine in CV disease in a further 9000 patients.

### Management of gout: a systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1135h9gE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis in patients seen by primary care physicians.

Purpose

To review evidence about treatment of acute gout attacks, management of hyperuricemia to prevent attacks, and discontinuation of medications for chronic gout in adults.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases from January 2010 to March 2016, reference mining, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Study Selection

Studies of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and commonly prescribed by primary care physicians, randomized trials for effectiveness, and trials and observational studies for adverse events.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Study quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. Strength-of-evidence assessment was done by group discussion.

Data Synthesis

High-strength evidence from 28 trials (only 3 of which were placebo-controlled) shows that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids reduce pain in patients with acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose colchicine and causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) reduces long-term risk for acute gout attacks after 1 year or more. High-strength evidence shows that prophylaxis with daily colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks by at least half in patients starting urate-lowering therapy, and moderate-strength evidence indicates that duration of prophylaxis should be longer than 8 weeks. Although lower urate levels reduce risk for recurrent acute attacks, treatment to a specific target level has not been tested.

Limitation

Few studies of acute gout treatments, no placebo-controlled trials of management of hyperuricemia lasting longer than 6 months, and few studies in primary care populations.

Conclusion

Colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout. Urate-lowering therapy decreases serum urate levels and reduces risk for acute gout attacks.

### Colchicine (Colcrys) [^117DydLi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Gout Flares

Prophylaxis of Gout Flares

For prophylaxis of gout flares in patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance [Clcr] 50 to 80 mL/min) to moderate (Clcr30 to 50 mL/min) renal function impairment, adjustment of the recommended dose is not required, but patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects of colchicine. However, in patients with severe impairment, the starting dose should be 0.3 mg/day and any increase in dose should be done with close monitoring. For the prophylaxis of gout flares in patients undergoing dialysis, the starting doses should be 0.3 mg given twice a week with close monitoring [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Treatment of Gout Flares

For treatment of gout flares in patients with mild (Clcr50 to 80 mL/min) to moderate (Clcr30 to 50 mL/min) renal function impairment, adjustment of the recommended dose is not required, but patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects of colchicine. However, in patients with severe impairment, while the dose does not need to be adjusted for the treatment of gout flares, a treatment course should be repeated no more than once every two weeks. For patients with gout flares requiring repeated courses, consideration should be given to alternate therapy. For patients undergoing dialysis, the total recommended dose for the treatment of gout flares should be reduced to a single dose of 0.6 mg (one tablet). For these patients, the treatment course should not be repeated more than once every two weeks [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Treatment of gout flares with COLCRYS is not recommended in patients with renal impairment who are receiving COLCRYS for prophylaxis.

### Use of intravenous colchicine in patients with acute gout… [^116y4Xxi]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

to the editor: I read the article 1 on the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia. I would like to comment that, in my experience of using colchicine to treat patients with gout, I have found nothing more effective than giving 2 mg of intravenous colchicine in a single dose. The toxicity from a single dose is very low, and it is now my treatment of choice for a patient with an acute gouty attack. I have quite a bit of experience using intravenous colchicine, and I have encountered some problems with extravasation causing some irritation; however, this is the only problem I have experienced. I reviewed the article 2 to which the authors referred to regarding the toxicity associated with the intravenous administration of colchicine. All of the patients described in the article who had toxic effects from intravenous colchicine administration had received large dosages over a short period.

In fact, the recommendations at the end of the article indicate that "The IV administration of colchicine is an effective way of using the drug and, with appropriate precautions, should lead to little serious toxicity. " 2. Guidelines provided in the article 2 for the intravenous administration of colchicine include the following: Single intravenous dosages should not exceed 2 to 3 mg, and cumulative total dosages for an attack should not be more than 4 to 5 mg; Patients should not receive colchicine by any route of administration for.

seven days; Colchicine dosages must be reduced in patients who have renal or hepatic disease and in older patients with apparently normal renal function; Intravenous colchicine dosages should be half the size of oral dosages; Absolute contraindications to intravenous colchicine therapy for patients with acute gout include combined renal and hepatic disease, creatinine clearance times below 10 mL per minute and extrahepatic biliary obstruction. I wrote this letter because I am concerned that, after reading this article, physicians who do not have experience with intravenous colchicine therapy might be frightened away from what I believe is a highly effective treatment for patients with acute gout. in reply: We appreciate the comments offered by Dr. Stephan concerning the use of intravenous colchicine, and we agree that it is often highly effective therapy for the treatment of patients with acute gouty arthritis.

Colchicine is one of the great veteran drugs in medicine, with a long venerable history in the treatment of patients with gout. However, the potential toxicity of the intravenous route of administration is often under-appreciated, and we argue against its routine use. Colchicine was available well before the 1969 U. S. Food and Drug Administration act that required phase III toxicity trials. Data on toxicity and adverse reactions are based solely on passive surveillance; therefore, the true incidence of adverse reactions, especially with infrequently used medicine, is unknown. Toxicity includes tissue necrosis, bone marrow suppression, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure, seizure, sepsis and death. Over the past 50 years, more than 20 deaths have been attributed to the use of intravenous colchicine. In fact, it is no longer licensed for clinical use in Great Britain. We agree with Dr.

### Colchicine and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with gout and type 2 diabetes: a nationwide cohort study [^117DHm9b]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

According to treatment guidelines for gout, colchicine, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and their combinations are both recommended for gout flares. For gout prophylaxis, urate‐lowering therapy with xanthine oxidase inhibitors is recommended, followed by the use of colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids. Although the guidelines specify that the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is high in gout population and lifestyle modifications are needed, they do not recommend specific choices of drugs for high cardiovascular risk patients. Our findings also corroborate current guidelines for gout treatment by showing non‐differential risk of cardiovascular outcomes between the two treatment options.

There are several strengths of this study. First, using a nationwide claims data that covers the entire population of South Korea, we were able to form a large T2DM patient cohort for study with sufficient representativity. Second, by using validated algorithms to define study outcomes, we were able to minimize outcome misclassification. Third, we employed an active‐comparator, new‐user design, which minimizes bias from including prevalent users and enhances comparability between treatment groups, as both colchicine and NSAIDs are used as first‐line therapies for gout. Fourth, various sensitivity analyses were conducted to show that the possibility of exposure misclassification and informative censoring are marginal.

### Medications for gout and its comorbidities: mutual benefits? [^116sV6wp]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent literature with relevance to the management of multimorbid patients with gout, i.e., gout medication repurposed for comorbidities and vice versa.

Recent Findings

Adding to the previous success of interleukin-1 inhibition, two trials on low-dose colchicine's role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) demonstrated potential benefits in patients with or without gout. In Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial, a composite CVD endpoint was reduced by 23% among patients who had experienced a recent myocardial infarction. In Low-Dose Colchicine 2, the composite CVD endpoint was reduced 31% among those with stable coronary artery disease. Use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for renal protection in patients without gout produced null results. Allopurinol did not benefit the glomerular filtration rate in two trials (Controlled trial of slowing of Kidney Disease progression From the Inhibition of Xanthine oxidase and Preventing Early Renal Function Loss) among patients with chronic kidney disease (with or without hyperuricemia, but not gout). SGLT-2 inhibitors, a medication recommended for patients with diabetes and CVD, diabetic kidney disease, or heart failure, demonstrated a protective effect against gout flares in a secondary trial analysis and a large observational study.

Summary

The role of colchicine may expand beyond gout flare prevention to patients with existing CVD. The renal benefit of ULT among patients with gout remains unclear. SGLT-2 inhibitors may benefit diabetic patients who have gout as a comorbidity.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116D1smR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Evaluating appropriate use of prophylactic colchicine for gout flare prevention [^116KLR43]. Arthritis Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism guidelines recommend colchicine to prevent gout flares in patients initiating and increasing uric acid–lowering therapy until serum uric acid is maintained at ≤ 6 mg/dl. We aimed to evaluate how well colchicine prescribing practices adhere to these guidelines and to examine factors associated with improved prescribing.

Methods

Electronic medical records were reviewed for 126 patients with active colchicine prescriptions for prophylaxis of gout flares. Colchicine prescribing was defined as inappropriate if 1) no concurrent urate-lowering therapy was prescribed, 2) uric acid was not at goal and urate-lowering therapy had not been increased in the past 3 months, or 3) uric acid goals were met for > 1 year and flares had resolved in the absence of tophi.

Results

Colchicine use was considered inappropriate in 93 patients (73.8%). Thirty-four were prescribed no urate-lowering therapy, 50 were above the uric acid goal without urate-lowering therapy increase in the prior 3 months, and 9 were at the uric acid goal for > 1 year without flares or tophi. Patients appropriately prescribed colchicine were younger and were more likely to have been seen by a rheumatologist. Allopurinol dose and allergy, uric acid level, and renal function were similar in the 2 groups.

Conclusion

We found a high prevalence of what we considered inappropriate prophylactic colchicine use, driven largely by failure to prescribe concurrent urate-lowering therapies or adequately increase these medications. Rheumatology consultation was associated with improved colchicine prescribing.

### Colchicine: the good, the bad, the ugly and how to minimize the risks [^117PsGAs]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical uses of colchicine and dosing

The indications and dosing of colchicine, both established and emerging, are outlined in Table 1. Lower doses are recommended for those with renal impairment and those receiving medications known to interact with colchicine (Table 2).

Table 1.
Established and emerging indications and doses of colchicine

Table 2.
Recommended dosing adjustment for colchicine

There is ample data that colchicine is effective in the management of gout. Colchicine is effective at preventing gout flares when commencing urate-lowering therapy as well as for the treatment of gout flares. It is essential to recognize that the older dosing regimen for treating gout flares, namely 1.2 mg stat followed by 0.6 mg hourly until the flare resolves or diarrhoea occurs, is no longer recommended due to the high rates of gastrointestinal toxicity and the evidence that lower doses of colchicine are effective without the associated gastrointestinal effects. In rheumatology practice, colchicine is also widely used in the treatment of CPP deposition disease, particularly to prevent and treat acute CPP crystal arthritis, as well as in the treatment of Behçet's syndrome, FMF and other systemic autoinflammatory syndromes. While colchicine has been used for some time in acute and recurrent pericarditis, more recently its beneficial effects have been observed in other cardiovascular diseases, including postoperative atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. The evidence for its use in cardiovascular disease has recently been reviewed by Deftereos et al.

The adverse effects of low-dose colchicine are also well known. The most common adverse effect is diarrhoea, which settles on cessation of colchicine. Small increases in alanine transaminase and creatine kinase are common with colchicine treatment over 2–4 years. Long-term colchicine therapy has also been associated with rare cases of neuromyotoxicity and rhabdomyolysis. There is no evidence that long-term colchicine increases the risk of kidney disease, cancer, sepsis or cytopaenias.

### EULAR evidence based recommendations for gout. part II: management. report of a task force of the EULAR standing committee for international clinical studies including therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^111yGxST]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.

### Colchicine (Colcrys) [^113UUqju]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The long-term use of colchicine is established for FMF and the prophylaxis of gout flares, but the safety and efficacy of repeat treatment for gout flares has not been evaluated. The dosing regimens for COLCRYS are different for each indication and must be individualized.

The recommended dosage of COLCRYS depends on the patient's age, renal function, hepatic function and use of coadministered drugs [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5, 2.6)].

COLCRYS tablets are administered orally without regard to meals.

COLCRYS is not an analgesic medication and should not be used to treat pain from other causes.

2.1 Gout Flares

Prophylaxis of Gout Flares

The recommended dosage of COLCRYS for prophylaxis of gout flares for adults and adolescents older than 16 years of age is 0.6 mg once or twice daily. The maximum recommended dose for prophylaxis of gout flares is 1.2 mg/day.

An increase in gout flares may occur after initiation of uric acid-lowering therapy, including pegloticase, febuxostat and allopurinol, due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. COLCRYS is recommended upon initiation of gout flare prophylaxis with uric acid-lowering therapy. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for at least the first six months of uric acid-lowering therapy.

Treatment of Gout Flares

The recommended dose of COLCRYS for treatment of a gout flare is 1.2 mg (two tablets) at the first sign of the flare followed by 0.6 mg (one tablet) one hour later. Higher doses have not been found to be more effective. The maximum recommended dose for treatment of gout flares is 1.8 mg over a 1-hour period. COLCRYS may be administered for treatment of a gout flare during prophylaxis at doses not to exceed 1.2 mg (two tablets) at the first sign of the flare followed by 0.6 mg (one tablet) one hour later. Wait 12 hours and then resume the prophylactic dose.

### Balancing the benefits and risks of colchicine use among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^11221Wrw]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) accounts for 32% of global mortality (17.9 million annual deaths) and affects 340 million individuals worldwide, with a $1.1 trillion economic burden in 2022. Despite standard therapies, 30% of patients experience major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) within 10 years. Beyond traditional risk factors, systemic low-grade inflammation is now well-established as a key driver of plaque progression and destabilisation. However, the clinical efficacy of conventional anti-inflammatory agents such as methotrexate remains debated, while persistent residual inflammation under statin therapy is associated with an elevated risk of recurrence, necessitating the exploration of alternative pharmacological agents with anti-inflammatory properties.

Colchicine, a low-cost anti-inflammatory agent traditionally used for Familial Mediterranean Fever, Behçet's disease, and gout, is now gaining traction in the cardiovascular (CV) domain. Growing evidence supports its efficacy in coronary heart disease (CHD) through ASCVD mechanisms. Mechanistically, its benefits are linked to NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3) inflammasome inhibition, macrophage polarisation (M1 suppression/M2 promotion), and reduced leukocyte-platelet aggregation.

Multiple RCT meta-analyses have assessed colchicine's effects on ASCVD outcomes and recurrent event risks. However, heterogeneity in dosing (0.5–1.0 mg/day), populations, and endpoints contributes to inconsistent findings — some studies report reduced CV mortality, others show no mortality benefit. Guideline discordance persists. The 2021 ESC Guidelinesconditionally recommend low-dose colchicine (IIb/B) for high-risk chronic coronary syndromes, supported by LoDoCo2/COLCOT. Conversely, the 2023 ACC/AHA Guidelinesadvise against routine use (III/B-R) due to safety concerns (COPS trial). The 2025 AHA/ACS Statementpermits short-term use (IIb/B-NR) in select post-ACS patients (CLEAR-SYNERGY). Discrepancies exist in target populations (chronic vs. acute) and safety monitoring, while consensus cautions against use in severe renal impairment or with CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors. Divergent recommendations highlight unmet needs for biomarker-stratified trials and long-term safety data.

### Safety and efficacy of colchicine in crystal-induced arthritis flare in 54 patients with severe chronic kidney disease [^111jieJy]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colchicine has been widely used since its first isolation in 1884. Therapeutic indications are constantly increasing, but its main indication remains the management of crystal-induced arthritis flare. Most of its therapeutic effects would be due to its ability to prevent the assembly of microtubules tubulin, thereby inhibiting their polymerisation and interfering with their cellular functions. In vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that a more important anti-inflammatory mechanism is colchicine's ability to hinder NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3) intracellular transportation and spatial arrangement, thereby inhibiting inflammasome activation within macrophages. Colchicine exhibits complex pharmacokinetics with extensive tissue uptake, especially within erythrocytes. Renal clearance accounts for 10% of total elimination, influenced by factors like cyclosporine, which inhibits tubular secretion through P-glycoprotein. Colchicine metabolism is influenced by hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450 3A4). In patients without comorbidities, the management of gouty arthritis is consensual. According to the 2016 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations for the management of gout, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) and parenteral/oral glucocorticoids are recommended as first-line treatment options for managing flares. In 2010, the Acute Gout Flare Receiving Colchicine Evaluation trial showed, after 24 hours of early management of gout flare, a better safety profile in the 'low-dose' colchicine group (1.8 mg) similar to that of the placebo group than in the 'high dose' colchicine group (4.8 mg), with no difference in efficacy between the two colchicine arms, superior to placebo. In calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition disease (CPPD), the efficacy of colchicine was recently evaluated in the COLCHICORT trial, which showed that colchicine and prednisone were equally effective in the short term.

### Prophylaxis for acute gout flares after initiation of urate-lowering therapy [^113UXfU7]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

This review summarizes evidence relating to prophylaxis for gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT). We searched MEDLINE via PubMed for articles published in English from 1963 to 2013 using MEsH terms covering all aspects of prophylaxis for flares. Dispersion of monosodium urate crystals during the initial phase of deposit dissolution with ULT exposes the patient to an increased rate of acute flares that could contribute to poor treatment adherence. Slow titration of ULT might decrease the risk of flares. According to the most recent international recommendation, the two first-line options for prophylaxis are low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice a day) or low-dose NSAIDs such as naproxen 250 mg orally twice a day. They can be given for up to 6 months. If these drugs are contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) might be used. Recently, reports for four trials described the efficacy of canakinumab and rilonacept, two IL-1 inhibitors, for preventing flares during the initiation of allopurinol therapy. Prophylaxis for flares induced by ULT is an important consideration in gout management. Low-dose colchicine and low-dose NSAIDs are the recommended first-line therapies. Although no IL-1 blockers are approved as prophylactic treatment, this class of drug could become an interesting option for patients with gout with intolerance or contraindication to colchicine, NSAIDs or corticosteroids.

Gout — starting dose and titration of ULT — starting treatment with low-dose allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day and lower in patients with CKD [stage ≥ 3]) and febuxostat (≤ 40 mg/day) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is strongly recommended; starting treatment with low-dose probenecid (500 mg once to twice daily) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is conditionally recommended. A lower starting dose of any ULT reduces the risk of flare associated with initiation, and lower initial allopurinol doses (e.g., ≤ 50 mg/day) are noted as examples.

### Evolution of management of gout: a comparison of recent guidelines [^114JoBPf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There have been several guidelines on the management of gout over the last decade; however, inconsistencies between them create confusion for practitioners. This review highlights areas of agreement between guidelines and discusses data where disagreements exist.

Recent Findings

For acute gout, the guidelines agree that anti-inflammatory treatment should start as soon as possible, preferably within 24hours. Older guidelines preferred NSAIDs or colchicine over steroids, but newer ones leave the choice of agent to the physician. For colchicine, all guidelines recommend using low dose. Intra-articular, oral or intramuscular steroids are all described as effective. For management of hyperuricemia, indications for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) have become more inclusive over the years by requiring lower burden of disease severity or including patient comorbidities. Probenecid has fallen out of favour with most guidelines favouring allopurinol over febuxostat. Although there is a disagreement about timing of initiation for ULT, guidelines recommend treating to target of serum urate (sUA) less than 6mg/dl, and less than 5mg/dl for patients with more severe disease. Concurrent anti-inflammatory prophylaxis has gained strong support over the years.

Summary

Most guidelines are in agreement with recommendations for management of gout and most changes have been directional and evolutionary.

### Low-dose colchicine effective for acute gout flare-ups… [^116hFqYY]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Background: Although colchicine is commonly used to treat gout, dosing regimens have not been well studied. One randomized placebo-controlled trial reported that a mean dose of 6. 7 mg improved pain within 48 hours, with diarrhea affecting all participants. Severe adverse events and death have occurred when colchicine is combined with P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors. Low-dose colchicine regimens have never been fully evaluated. Terkeltaub and colleagues compared low- and high-dose colchicine with placebo in the treatment of gout flare-ups. The Study: The AGREE trial randomized 575 men and postmenopausal women to receive one of three treatments: low-dose colchicine, high-dose colchicine, or placebo. Patients started the study medication within 12 hours of an acute gout flare-up and were monitored for adverse events. Simultaneous urate-lowering therapy was permitted. The primary end point was at least a 50 percent reduction in pain within 24 hours of the first dose without the need for a rescue medication. Results: Overall, 185 patients had a gout flare-up during the study: 52 in the high-dose group, 74 in the low-dose group, and 59 in the placebo group. Less than one-third of patients were receiving concurrent urate-lowering therapy. Both high- and low-dose colchicine regimens were significantly more effective than placebo at relieving pain.

Diarrhea was the most common adverse event, and was significantly more common in persons in the high-dose group compared with the other groups. Adverse event rates were similar between the low-dose colchicine and placebo groups. Conclusion: Low-dose colchicine is as effective as the more traditional high-dose regimen in alleviating acute gout flare-ups, with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. The authors recommend an immediate change in clinical practice to use the low-dose regimen, which is consistent with recent expert opinion–based recommendations by the European League Against Rheumatism.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1135R2x9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases from inception to April 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism (2010 until 2013) and reference lists of identified studies. We searched the clinical trials register clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials register.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (active or placebo) in acute gout. The primary benefit outcome of interest was pain, defined as a proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain, and the primary harm outcome was study participants withdrawal due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened search results for relevant studies, extracted data into a standardised form and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled data if deemed to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Two RCTs (124 participants) were included in this updated review, including one new RCT. We considered one trial to be at low risk of bias, while we considered the newly included trial to be at unclear risk of bias. Both trials included a placebo and a high-dose colchicine arm, although the colchicine regimens varied. In one trial 0.5 mg colchicine was given every two hours until there was either complete relief of symptoms or toxicity and the total doses were not specified. In the other trial a total of 4.8 mg colchicine was given over six hours. The newly identified trial also included a low-dose colchicine arm (total 1.8 mg over one hour). Based upon pooled data from two trials (124 participants), there is low-quality evidence that a greater proportion of people receiving high-dose colchicine experience a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours compared with placebo (35/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 12/50 in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.65), with a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 12). However, the total number of adverse events (diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea) is greater in those who receive high-dose colchicine versus placebo (62/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 11/50 in the placebo group (RR 3.81, 95% CI 2.28 to 6.38), with a number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) of 2 (95% CI 2 to 5). Only one trial included reduction of inflammation as part of a composite measure comprising pain, tenderness, swelling and erythema, each graded on a four-point scale (none 0 to severe 3) to derive a maximum score for any one joint of 12. They reported the proportion of people who achieved a 50% reduction in this composite score. Based upon one trial (43 participants), there was low-quality evidence that more people in the high-dose colchicine group had a 50% or greater decrease in composite score from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours than people in the placebo group (11/22 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 1/21 in the placebo group (RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38) and 45% absolute difference). Based upon data from one trial (103 participants), there was low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is more efficacious than placebo with respect to the proportion of people who achieve a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline to 32 to 36 hours (low-dose colchicine 31/74 versus placebo 5/29 (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.64)), with a NNTB of 5 (95% CI 2 to 20). There are no additional harms in terms of adverse events (diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting) with low-dose colchicine compared to placebo (19/74 and 6/29 respectively (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.79)). Based upon data from one trial (126 participants), there is low-quality evidence that there are no additional benefits in terms of the proportion of people achieving 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine compared to low-dose (19/52 and 31/74 respectively (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36). However, there were statistically significantly more adverse events in those who received high-dose colchicine (40/52 versus 19/74 in the low-dose group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.98 to 4.54)), with a NNTH of 2 (95% CI 2 to 3). No trials reported function of the target joint, patient-reported global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life or withdrawals due to adverse events. We identified no studies comparing colchicine to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other active treatments such as glucocorticoids (by any route).

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon only two published trials, there is low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is likely to be an effective treatment for acute gout. We downgraded the evidence because of a possible risk of selection and reporting biases and imprecision. Both high and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo. While there is some uncertainty around the effect estimates, compared with placebo, high-dose but not low-dose colchicine appears to result in a statistically significantly greater number of adverse events. Therefore low-dose colchicine may be the preferred treatment option. There are no trials about the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as NSAIDs and glucocorticoids.

The recommended dosage of COLCRYS for FMF in adults is 1.2 mg to 2.4 mg daily.

COLCRYS should be increased as needed to control disease and as tolerated in increments of 0.3 mg/day to a maximum recommended daily dose. If intolerable side effects develop, the dose should be decreased in increments of 0.3 mg/day. The total daily COLCRYS dose may be administered in one to two divided doses.

2.3	Recommended Pediatric Dosage

Prophylaxis and Treatment of Gout Flares

COLCRYS is not recommended for pediatric use in prophylaxis or treatment of gout flares.

FMF

The recommended dosage of COLCRYS for FMF in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older is based on age. The following daily doses may be given as a single or divided dose twice daily:

Children 4 to 6 years: 0.3 mg to 1.8 mg daily
Children 6 to 12 years: 0.9 mg to 1.8 mg daily

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^114XNW5a]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### Adherence to guidelines and the screening tool of older persons' potentially inappropriate prescriptions criteria for colchicine dosing for gout treatment in beneficiaries of the Nova Scotia seniors' pharmacare program [^116vRJRd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Colchicine is commonly used in the management of gout; however, older persons have higher risks of toxicity. Accordingly, the Screening Tool of Older Person's potentially inappropriate Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria for colchicine consider > 3 months of treatment as potentially inappropriate in older persons. Recent evidence also suggests lower dosing of colchicine is as effective and results in fewer toxicities than high-dose colchicine. The objectives of this study were to determine the dose, duration, and prescribers of colchicine and to evaluate adherence to the STOPP criteria and international guidelines for colchicine in older persons.

Methods

A retrospective, observational study was conducted from April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2011 to evaluate colchicine use. Nova Scotia Seniors' Pharmacare Program beneficiaries who met inclusion criteria for an incident case of gout and who filled at least 1 prescription for colchicine during the study period were included. Colchicine dose and duration were reported descriptively. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of the study population in making a claim for colchicine > 90 and > 180 days.

Findings

A total of 518 persons were dispensed 1327 courses of colchicine during the study period. The mean daily dose of colchicine ranged from 1.39 to 1.50 mg. Colchicine doses > 1.2 mg were prescribed in approximately one-third of the study population. Colchicine was prescribed for > 90 days in 14.2% of treatment courses and for > 180 days in 8.1% of treatment courses. Female sex was the only predictor of treatment duration > 90 days.

Implications

This study is the first to report on colchicine dose and duration using STOPP criteria in a specific cohort of older persons with incident gout. Strategies to improve colchicine prescribing in older persons are needed.

### Recommendations in clinical practice guidelines on gout: systematic review and consistency analysis [^116oDvcB]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare and analyse the recommendations from clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on gout worldwide, examine the consistency across CPGs, and provide suggestions to develop and update gout guidelines.

Methods

We conducted systematic searches in MEDLINE, CBM, GIN, NICE, NGC, WHO, SIGN, DynaMed, UpToDate, and Best Practice databases, from their inception to August 2019 to identify and select CPGs related to gout. We used the search terms "gout", "hyperuricaemia" and "guideline". After two rounds of screening, we included the eligible CPGs of gout according to the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Methodological quality of included guidelines was assessed with the AGREE-II instrument. The general characteristics of included guidelines and the recommendations were extracted, and the consistency of recommendations across guidelines was compared and analysed.

Results

A total of 15 gout guidelines including 359 recommendations were retrieved. The main topics covered by the recommendations were diagnosis, pharmacologic treatment of gout flares, pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy (ULT) of chronic gouty arthritis, lifestyle interventions, prophylaxis, and management of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia. The results of AGREE-II appraisal showed that only two guidelines achieved high scores (≥ 50%) in all six domains. There was substantial discrepancy between the guidelines in recommendations covering the value of computed tomography (CT) and x-rays for diagnosis, the use of corticosteroids as a first-line treatment for flare, the use of colchicine, indications for ULT, the use of febuxostat as first-line ULT, the administration of allopurinol, and the timing of ULT initiation.

Conlusions

A number of countries are devoting themselves to the development of gout guidelines, but the process of updating guidelines is slower than that suggested by the WHO. Methodological quality is not satisfactory in most guidelines, and recommendations between guidelines are not consistent.

Clinical Question Should colchicine be used to treat acute gout. Evidence-Based Answer Low-quality evidence shows that low-dose colchicine is an effective therapy for acute gout. However, it has not been compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids in clinical trials. Concerns include high cost, drug-drug interactions, and potential toxicity. Practice Pointers Colchicine is an alkaloid inhibitor of microtubule formation derived from the meadow saffron or autumn crocus in the Northern Hemisphere. It has been used since ancient times for medicinal purposes. In 2009, after sponsoring a small randomized controlled trial, URL Pharma received exclusive rights to produce colchicine for gout and the much rarer disease, familial Mediterranean fever. As a result, the price increased 50-fold from about $0. 10 to $5.

00 per pill. 1 This Cochrane review updates a 2006 meta-analysis of a single study of 43 people. A second industry-sponsored study of 185 people was added to the current review. Both were randomized controlled trials. In the more recent study, the authors compared a high-dose colchicine regimen to a low-dose regimen. The high-dose regimens in the two studies — which included a 1- to 1. 2-mg loading dose, followed by either
0. 6 mg every hour for six hours or 0. 5 mg every two hours until therapeutic response or intolerance — caused significantly more adverse effects. The shorter, low-dose regimen of 1. 2 mg, followed by
0. 6 mg in one hour was as effective as the higher dosages in the more recent study, but with adverse effects similar to those in the placebo group. Using an outcome of at least 50% pain reduction at 24 to 32 hours with low-dose colchicine vs.

placebo, the number needed to treat for the low-dose regimen was five. No trials compared colchicine with other interventions. Most participants in these two studies were men, and this Cochrane review does not address whether colchicine is beneficial after the first two days of an exacerbation. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for managing gout state that low-dose colchicine is equal to NSAIDs and corticosteroids for treating acute gout. 2 For severe acute gout, colchicine may be used with NSAIDs or corticosteroids. The guidelines call for at least six months of anti-inflammatory prophylaxis while starting urate-lowering therapy to prevent gout flare-ups, and slightly favor colchicine in a dosage of 0. 6 mg once to twice daily in this regard. The dose of colchicine should be reduced for patients with severe renal or hepatic disease.

There is a 1% risk of reversible axonal neuromyopathy in patients taking colchicine; colchicine can cause rhabdomyolysis when used with statins or clarithromycin; and colchicine has multiple drug-drug interactions with cytochrome P3A4 inhibitors, including certain antiviral agents, antifungal agents, calcium channel blockers, and grapefruit. 3, 4 Comparative studies among the different treatments for acute gout and for flare-up prophylaxis are needed.

### Colchicine (Colcrys) [^116BbkLZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The evidence for the efficacy of colchicine in patients with chronic gout is derived from the published literature. Two randomized clinical trials assessed the efficacy of colchicine 0.6 mg twice a day for the prophylaxis of gout flares in patients with gout initiating treatment with urate-lowering therapy. In both trials, treatment with colchicine decreased the frequency of gout flares.

The efficacy of a low-dosage regimen of oral colchicine (COLCRYS total dose 1.8 mg over one hour) for treatment of gout flares was assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, one week, dose-comparison study. Patients meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for gout were randomly assigned to three groups: high-dose colchicine (1.2 mg, then 0.6 mg hourly × 6 hours [4.8 mg total]); low-dose colchicine (1.2 mg, then 0.6 mg in one hour [1.8 mg total] followed by five placebo doses hourly); or placebo (two capsules, then one capsule hourly × six hours). Patients took the first dose within 12 hours of the onset of the flare and recorded pain intensity (11-point Likert scale) and adverse events over 72 hours. The efficacy of colchicine was measured based on response to treatment in the target joint, using patient self-assessment of pain at 24 hours following the time of first dose as recorded in the diary. A responder was one who achieved at least a 50% reduction in pain score at the 24-hour postdose assessment relative to the pretreatment score and did not use rescue medication prior to the actual time of 24-hour postdose assessment.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^112iwfhS]. Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to management of acute flares, BSR 2017 guidelines recommend to initiate an NSAID at maximum dose or colchicine in doses of 500 mcg 2–4 times daily as first-line therapy, with the drug choice depending on patient preference, renal function and comorbidities, if not contraindicated. Coprescribe a gastroprotective agent in patients on NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors.

### Prognostic factors for colchicine prophylaxis-related adverse events when initiating allopurinol for gout: retrospective cohort study [^114sEAtx]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Several large randomized controlled trials have shown cardiovascular benefits of colchicine in people with coronary heart disease or post-MI. In these studies, the dose of colchicine used was 0.5 mg daily, which is consistent with that recommended for prophylaxis in gout management guidelines and commonly used in clinical practice. In our study, the risk of MI when commencing colchicine was significantly higher in patients with a history of severe CKD (stage 4 or above), a greater burden of comorbidity, or concomitant prescription of macrolide antibiotics or diltiazem. The increased risk observed in patients with severe CKD is likely to be due to CKD being both a cardiovascular risk factor and associated with traditional cardiovascular risk factors. However, colchicine is relatively contraindicated in people with severe CKD and should be prescribed with caution and at lower doses in that patient group. Furthermore, it is reassuring that no statistically significant increase in MI was seen in those patients with CKD stage 3. It is likely that patients prescribed diltiazem receive it due to underlying hypertension or cardiovascular disease, likely explaining the association seen between its co-prescription with colchicine and risk of MI. However, the increased risk of MI in patients prescribed macrolide antibiotics cannot be explained by these mechanisms, and this has not been observed in previous studies.

### Colchicine: the good, the bad, the ugly and how to minimize the risks [^116BLmAr]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Colchicine has an important role in managing various conditions, including gout, familial Mediterranean fever, amyloidosis, Behçet's syndrome, recurrent pericarditis and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease. The adverse effect profile of colchicine is well understood. However, due to its narrow therapeutic index, colchicine has been associated with overdose and fatalities. When ingested in toxic amounts, the mainstay of management is supportive care. Strategies to minimize the risk of colchicine poisoning can focus on three broad causes: unauthorized access, intentional overdose and inappropriate dosing. Culturally safe and appropriate education about storage and appropriate use of colchicine is essential to minimize the risk of overdose.

### Updates in the management of gout [^115dzN3p]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with gout are cared for by primary care physicians. Although both the physician and patient may easily recognize the acute arthritis of gout, errors in selecting the most appropriate medication and proper dose are common. The clinical stages of gout include asymptomatic hyperuricemia, intermittent gouty arthritis, and chronic tophaceous gout. Treatment of gout is usually considered after the first attack of arthritis, typically podagra. The aims of treatment are to alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with acute attacks, prevent future attacks, and decrease uric acid levels. Confusion frequently arises because certain medications such as colchicine may have dual purposes: to treat an acute attack and to suppress future attacks. The purpose of this management update is to provide practical advice about prescribing the proper medication considering both treatment goals and patient comorbidities.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^117QS2TY]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction — gout epidemiology and care gaps are highlighted, noting that gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting ∼9.2 million adults (3.9%) in the US. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines and other international specialty society guidelines recommend treat-to-target strategies with use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), yet over the past 2 decades there has been no increase in ULT utilization and adherence to ULT remains poor and is the lowest adherence among treatments for 7 common chronic medical conditions. Prior 2012 ACR Guidelines have been criticized due to low quality of evidence supporting treat-to-target recommendations, and several clinical trials since then provided additional evidence leading the ACR Guidelines Subcommittee to determine that new guidelines with updated recommendations were warranted.

### Consensus statement regarding the efficacy and safety of long-term low-dose colchicine in gout and cardiovascular disease [^1124Yfcp]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the last decade, evidence has demonstrated that long-term, low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg daily) is effective for preventing gout flare and cardiovascular (CV) events in a wide range of patients. Given the potentially expanding use of colchicine in CV disease, we here review and update the biologic effects and safety of colchicine based on recent data gathered from bench and pharmacodynamic studies, clinical reports, controlled clinical trials, and meta-analyses, integrated with important studies over the last 50 years, to offer a consensus perspective by experts from multiple specialties familiar with colchicine's long-term use. We conclude that the clinical benefits of colchicine in gout and CV disease achieved at low dose do not sustain serum levels above the upper limit of safety when used in patients without advanced renal or liver disease or when used concomitantly with most medications. Further, data accrued over the last 50 years strongly suggest that the biologic effects of long-term colchicine do not increase the risk of cancer, sepsis, cytopenia, or myotoxicity.

### Febuxostat [^111CPgbU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

The recommended febuxostat tablets dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily.

The recommended starting dosage of febuxostat tablets are 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the recommended febuxostat tablets dosage is 80 mg once daily.

Febuxostat tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Concurrent prophylactic treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment

The recommended dosage of febuxostat tablets are limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. No dose modification is necessary when administering febuxostat tablets in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

No dosage modification is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 Serum Uric Acid Level Monitoring

Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat tablets therapy.

2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares

Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat tablets. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat tablets treatment, febuxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^115sedX8]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology gout guideline — strong recommendations included initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage ≥ 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (≤ 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended, and for management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

### Implementing Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^117H6y7n]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Of pre- and post-implementation cohorts, 93.3% and 98.1%, respectively, received a guideline-recommended flare treatment. After implementation, more patients were prescribed colchicine (62.2% vs 79.6%; aOR 2.30; 95% CI 1.23, 4.31; P = 0.009), corticosteroids (21.0% vs 37.0%; aOR 2.20; 95% CI 1.21, 4.02; P = 0.010) or multiple flare treatments (17.6% vs 45.4%; aOR 4.10; 95% CI 2.20, 7.67; P < 0.001). Use of intra-articular corticosteroids increased modestly from a low baseline (1.7% vs 8.3%; aOR 5.53; 95% CI 1.15, 26.7; P = 0.033). There was no significant difference in the use of NSAIDs (31.9% vs 31.5%; aOR 1.18; 95% CI 0.61, 2.28; P = 0.63).

The proportion of patients initiated and/or up-titrated on ULT prior to discharge increased markedly following implementation, from 17.6% to 62.0% (aOR 7.69; 95% CI 4.12, 14.4; P < 0.001). After implementation, more patients were provided with gout-specific management recommendations on discharge (58.8% vs 86.1%; aOR 4.33; 95% CI 2.21, 8.48; P < 0.001). Documented evidence of disease education provision prior to discharge was low in both cohorts (22.7% vs 22.2%; aOR 1.00; 95% CI 0.53, 1.90; P = 0.99).

### Allopurinol [^11417bTt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Testing Prior to Treatment Initiation

Prior to initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets in patients with gout, assess the following baseline tests: serum uric acid level, complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver function tests (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), kidney function tests (serum creatinine and eGFR).

2.2 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares

Gout flares may occur after initiation of allopurinol tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine or an anti- inflammatory agent according to practice guidelines is recommended upon initiation of allopurinol tablets. While adjusting the dosage of allopurinol tablets in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, continue flare prophylaxis drugs until serum uric acid has been normalized and the patient has been free of gout flares for several months. If a gout flare occurs during allopurinol tablets treatment, allopurinol tablets need not be discontinued. Manage the gout flare concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^116ZEH7Y]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of joint pain and swelling, which can necessitate hospital admission when severe. Highly effective, low-cost medications are available for the treatment of gout flares: colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Flares can be prevented by urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), of which allopurinol is the most widely used. British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidelines recommend offering ULT to all patients with gout, with up-titration to achieve serum urate (SU) levels of 300–360 micromol/l (5–6 mg/dl), to facilitate crystal dissolution. The ACR gout management guideline was recently updated to conditionally recommend initiation of ULT during flares, rather than delayed initiation of ULT after flare resolution.

Despite effective treatments, hospitalizations for gout flares have increased dramatically: doubling in the USA between 1993 and 2011, from 4.4 to 8.8 admissions per 100 000 adults, respectively; doubling in Canada between 2000 and 2011, from 3.8 to 7.6 admissions per 100 000 adults; and increasing by 58.4% in England between 2006 and 2017, from 7.9 to 12.5 admissions per 100 000 adults. This contrasts with the decline in hospitalizations from RA. There are multiple contributing factors to the epidemic of gout hospitalizations: the prevalence of gout has increased in Western countries in recent years on a background of an ageing population with rising prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome; the management of gout is frequently suboptimal in primary care, rheumatology clinics and inpatient settings, and only a minority of patients achieve the SU levels required to prevent flares.

Hospital admissions provide a unique opportunity to engage patients in shared decision-making and begin the process of establishing optimal ULT. What is not known is how best to implement evidence-based treatments during hospitalizations for gout. Such strategies are essential if the rising number of gout admissions is to be countered. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in patients hospitalized with gout.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1132ms2q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated Cochrane Review, first published in 2006 and updated in 2014. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To update the available evidence of the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We updated the search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICTRP registries to 28 August 2020. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (quasi-RCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (placebo or active) in acute gout; low-dose colchicine at clinically relevant doses compared with placebo was the primary comparison. The major outcomes were pain, participant global assessment of treatment success (proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours), reduction of inflammation, function of target joint, serious adverse events, total adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane in this review update.

Main Results

We included four trials (803 randomised participants), including two new trials, in this updated review. One three-arm trial compared high-dose colchicine (52 participants), low-dose colchicine (74 participants) and placebo (59 participants); one trial compared high-dose colchicine with placebo (43 participants); one trial compared low-dose colchicine with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (399 participants); and one trial compared low-dose colchicine with Chuanhu anti-gout mixture (traditional Chinese Medicine compound) (176 participants). We did not identify any trials comparing colchicine to glucocorticoids (by any route). The mean age of participants ranged from 51.2 to 70 years, and trial duration from 48 hours to 12 weeks. Two trials were at low risk of bias, one was possibly susceptible to selection bias (random sequence generation), reporting bias and other bias, and one open-label trial was at high risk of performance and detection bias. For the primary comparison, low-quality evidence from one trial (103 participants, downgraded for imprecision and bias) suggests low-dose colchicine may improve treatment outcome compared to placebo with little or no increased risk of adverse events. The number of people who reported treatment success (50% or greater pain reduction) at 32 to 36 hours was slightly larger with low-dose colchicine (418 per 1000) compared with placebo (172 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 5.64; absolute improvement 25% more reported success (7% more to 42% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important and unimportant benefit); relative change of 143% more people reported treatment success (5% more to 464% more). The incidence of total adverse events was 364 per 1000 with low-dose colchicine compared with 276 per 1000 with placebo: RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.56; absolute difference 9% more events with low-dose colchicine (9% fewer to 43% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important effect and no effect); relative change of 32% more events (32% fewer to 156% more). No participants withdrew due to adverse events or reported any serious adverse events. Pain, inflammation and function were not reported. Low-quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision and bias) from two trials (124 participants) suggests that high-dose colchicine compared to placebo may improve symptoms, but with increased risk of harms. More participants reported treatment success at 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine (518 per 1000) compared with placebo (240 per 1000): RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.65, absolute improvement 28% (8% more to 46% more); more also had reduced inflammation at this time point with high-dose colchicine (504 per 1000) compared with placebo (48 per 1000): RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38; absolute improvement 45% greater (22% greater to 68% greater); but more adverse events were reported with high-dose colchicine (829 per 1000 compared with 260 per 1000): RR 3.21, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.11, absolute difference 57% (26% more to 74% more). Pain and function were not reported. Low-quality evidence from a single trial comparing high-dose to low-dose colchicine indicates there may be little or no difference in benefit in terms of treatment success at 32 to 36 hours but more adverse events associated with the higher dose. Similarly, low-quality evidence from a single trial indicates there may also be little or no benefit of low-dose colchicine over NSAIDs in terms of treatment success and pain reduction at seven days, with a similar number of adverse events reported at four weeks follow-up. Reduction of inflammation, function of target joint and withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported in either of these trials, and pain was not reported in the high-dose versus low-dose colchicine trial. We were unable to estimate the risk of serious adverse events for most comparisons as there were few events reported in the trials. One trial (399 participants) reported three serious adverse (one in a participant receiving low-dose colchicine and two in participants receiving NSAIDs), due to reasons unrelated to the trial (low-quality evidence downgraded for bias and imprecision).

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine may be an effective treatment for acute gout when compared to placebo and low-quality evidence that its benefits may be similar to NSAIDs. We downgraded the evidence for bias and imprecision. While both high- and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo, low-quality evidence suggests that high-dose (but not low-dose) colchicine may increase the number of adverse events compared to placebo, while low-quality evidence indicates that the number of adverse events may be similar with low-dose colchicine and NSAIDs. Further trials comparing colchicine to placebo or other treatment will likely have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimates and may change the conclusions of this review. There are no trials reporting the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as glucocorticoids.

American College of Rheumatology gout guideline — other dietary recommendations states: The certainty of evidence drawn mainly from observational studies was low or very low, precluding specific recommendations on these topics. The Voting Panel reached consensus that data on vitamin C were insufficient to support continued recommendation for its use in patients with gout. Two small RCTs (n = 29 and n = 40) showed clinically insignificant changes in SU concentrations for patients with gout taking vitamin C.
