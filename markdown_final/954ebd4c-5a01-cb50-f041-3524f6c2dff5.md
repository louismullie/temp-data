## Question

Is it guideline to give Claritin 10mg x 7 days
For contact dermatitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is guideline-supported to give Claritin (loratadine) 10 mg daily for 7 days for contact dermatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications for loratadine. Then, I should verify what major contact dermatitis guidelines actually recommend. Next, I will examine the evidence base for oral antihistamines in contact dermatitis and whether any trials support loratadine for this indication. After that, I need to check dosing and duration considerations, including any 7-day rationale. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation and note any exceptions where antihistamines might still be used symptomatically despite limited evidence.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status, because if loratadine is not indicated for contact dermatitis, that already sets the baseline. The FDA labeling for loratadine lists treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic spontaneous urticaria, with off-label use for generalized pruritus; contact dermatitis is not included as an indication, which means any use for contact dermatitis would be off-label and evidence-dependent rather than label-supported [^2479bf49] [^30fb8ea1].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines to see if they endorse oral antihistamines for contact dermatitis. The AAAAI/ACAAI practice parameter emphasizes allergen/irritant avoidance as foundational and recommends appropriate adjunct medical treatment, but it does not specify oral antihistamines as standard therapy for contact dermatitis; instead, it highlights topical corticosteroids and, when needed, systemic steroids for severe cases, while cautioning against prolonged systemic steroid use [^e5ac56fb] [^e005d207]. The British Association of Dermatologists 2017 guideline similarly focuses on avoidance, skin care, and topical therapies, without recommending routine oral antihistamines for contact dermatitis management [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify whether any specialty scenarios differ; even in vulvar contact dermatitis, ACOG recommends topical corticosteroids and oral antipruritics as needed, but this is framed as symptom control rather than disease-modifying therapy, and it does not establish a 7-day loratadine regimen as standard [^6d28439d] [^8c298d45].

> I will now examine the evidence base for oral antihistamines in contact dermatitis. Wait, let me verify whether any randomized trials directly test loratadine for contact dermatitis. I do not find RCTs or robust clinical studies demonstrating efficacy of loratadine for contact dermatitis; instead, the available pharmacologic studies show loratadine suppresses histamine-induced wheal and flare in healthy volunteers, which supports antihistaminic activity but does not translate into proven clinical benefit for contact dermatitis pathology or itch control in real patients with dermatitis [^6637df9a] [^37eb00cc]. But wait, what if expert consensus suggests antihistamines for itch? The first aid guideline for Toxicodendron dermatitis notes that oral antihistamines are often recommended for local itching, yet cites limited evidence and questions efficacy, suggesting any benefit is modest at best and largely anecdotal [^ee514098].

> Now, I need to check dosing and duration specifics. The 10 mg daily dose aligns with standard adult dosing for loratadine's labeled indications, but I should confirm whether a 7-day course has any evidentiary basis for contact dermatitis. I do not find guideline-endorsed 7-day loratadine regimens for contact dermatitis; the 7-day figure appears in other contexts, such as holding loratadine before oral food challenges, which is unrelated to treating contact dermatitis and should not be extrapolated to a treatment duration [^3c771488] [^62fae713]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; absence of a guideline-endorsed 7-day regimen does not prove harm, but it does mean there is no evidence-based standard supporting that exact course for contact dermatitis.

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to ensure I'm not missing a mechanistic rationale. Contact dermatitis involves irritant or allergic inflammation driven by direct toxicity or delayed-type hypersensitivity, where histamine is not the primary mediator; thus, H1 antihistamines have limited mechanistic relevance compared with their role in urticaria or rhinitis, which explains why guidelines prioritize anti-inflammatory topicals and avoidance rather than antihistamines for disease control [^notfound]. I should double-check that this aligns with dermatology guidance; yes, contemporary guidelines emphasize topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors when appropriate, and they do not elevate oral antihistamines to first-line or disease-modifying status for contact dermatitis [^e005d207] [^4e59b18d].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is about symptomatic itch relief rather than treating the dermatitis itself? I need to ensure I address that nuance. In some settings, clinicians may use nonsedating antihistamines for pruritus as an adjunct, recognizing that evidence is limited and responses are variable; this is more defensible as individualized symptom control rather than guideline-directed disease therapy, and even then, benefits are modest and not guaranteed [^6d28439d] [^ee514098]. Hold on, I should verify safety; loratadine is generally well tolerated, but that does not substitute for evidence of efficacy in this specific condition, so any such use should be framed as off-label and optional, not standard of care.

> Synthesis and recommendation: I should confirm the bottom line clearly. No major guideline endorses loratadine 10 mg daily for 7 days as a standard treatment for contact dermatitis, and there is no robust evidence base supporting loratadine to treat contact dermatitis or its itch. Standard care remains identification and avoidance of the offending agent, appropriate skin care, and topical anti-inflammatory therapy, with systemic corticosteroids reserved for severe cases and only short term to avoid rebound and adverse effects [^e5ac56fb] [^e005d207]. If loratadine is used for pruritus, it should be presented as an off-label, optional adjunct with uncertain benefit, not as a guideline-recommended regimen, and there is no evidence-based mandate for a 7-day course in this context [^ee514098].

> Practical next steps: I need to ensure the plan addresses the fundamentals. Confirm the diagnosis and consider patch testing if allergic contact dermatitis is suspected or if the eruption fails to respond to appropriate therapy, because missing an allergen will perpetuate symptoms and undermine any symptomatic medication use [^e005d207] [^004c7427]. Tailor topical therapy to severity and anatomic site, favoring ointments on sensitive skin and using the lowest effective potency, and reinforce trigger avoidance and barrier strategies as the cornerstone of management [^e005d207] [^d794bd7a]. If pruritus remains distressing despite these measures, a cautious, time-limited trial of a nonsedating antihistamine may be reasonable, but expectations should be modest and the lack of disease-modifying benefit explicitly discussed with the patient [^ee514098].

Claritin (loratadine) 10 mg daily for 7 days is **not a guideline-recommended treatment** for contact dermatitis. Guidelines emphasize **topical corticosteroids** and **allergen avoidance** as first-line therapy, with antihistamines reserved for symptomatic pruritus relief only. Loratadine may be used off-label for itch, but evidence for efficacy in contact dermatitis is limited, and it does not treat the underlying inflammation. Use loratadine only if pruritus is significant, and prioritize topical steroids and allergen identification.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) provide clear recommendations for managing contact dermatitis:

- **Topical corticosteroids**: First-line therapy for acute and chronic contact dermatitis, with potency tailored to severity and location [^e005d207].

- **Allergen avoidance**: Identification and avoidance of the offending agent are essential to prevent recurrence [^c2a4905c].

- **Adjunctive therapies**: Antihistamines may be considered for symptomatic relief of pruritus, but they are not primary treatments for contact dermatitis [^6d28439d].

---

## Role of antihistamines in contact dermatitis

Antihistamines, including loratadine, are primarily indicated for allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria [^2479bf49]. Their role in contact dermatitis is limited because contact dermatitis involves complex inflammatory pathways beyond histamine-mediated responses. Loratadine may provide symptomatic relief from pruritus, but it **does not address the underlying inflammatory process** or accelerate healing.

---

## Evidence supporting loratadine use in contact dermatitis

There is **limited clinical evidence** supporting the use of loratadine specifically for contact dermatitis. Most studies evaluating antihistamines in dermatitis focus on atopic dermatitis rather than contact dermatitis. A study comparing ebastine, cetirizine, and loratadine demonstrated antihistaminic effects but did not specifically evaluate efficacy in contact dermatitis [^6637df9a]. Therefore, the evidence base for loratadine in contact dermatitis remains weak and inconclusive.

---

## Clinical considerations and limitations

When considering loratadine for contact dermatitis, several clinical factors should be taken into account:

- **Limited efficacy**: Loratadine may provide minimal relief from pruritus but does not significantly improve dermatitis severity or healing time.

- **Safety profile**: Loratadine is generally well-tolerated, with minimal sedation compared to first-generation antihistamines. However, it should be used cautiously in patients with liver impairment or those taking interacting medications [^1977a23a].

- **Alternative therapies**: Topical corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of treatment, and allergen avoidance is critical for long-term management [^e005d207].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, loratadine 10 mg daily for 7 days is **not a guideline-recommended treatment** for contact dermatitis. While it may offer symptomatic relief from pruritus, it does not address the underlying inflammatory process. Clinicians should prioritize topical corticosteroids, allergen avoidance, and patient education. Loratadine may be considered as an adjunctive therapy for pruritus relief only if deemed necessary, and its use should be individualized based on patient-specific factors.

Appendix B — recommendation rating scale defines the levels and their clinician implications as follows: A strong recommendation means benefits clearly exceed harms and evidence quality is excellent; Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A moderate recommendation means benefits exceed harms but evidence is not as strong; Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation indicates suspect evidence or little clear advantage among options; Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation reflects a lack of pertinent evidence and unclear benefit–harm balance; Clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit vs harm; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Efficacy of ebastine, cetirizine, and loratadine in histamine cutaneous challenges [^6637df9a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Few studies have compared the antihistaminic effect of ebastine at 20 mg/day (maximal recommended daily dose) with the effect found for other antihistamines in human pharmacologic models.

Objective

To compare the inhibition of the histamine-induced skin reaction produced by ebastine (20 mg/day) with that produced by cetirizine (10 mg/day), loratadine (10 mg/day), or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Methods

Twenty volunteers (10 men and 10 women) received the four treatments once daily for 7 days, with a mean 7-day washout period between treatments. Three intradermal histamine challenges (0.05 mL of a 100 microg/mL histamine solution at 4, 8, and 24 hours after drug administration) were performed at baseline, day 1 (single dose), and day 7 (multiple doses). Wheal and flare areas were measured after 15 minutes.

Results

All treatments yielded significant reductions of histamine-induced wheal in comparison to placebo (P < 0.001). Analysis of covariance revealed significant differences between treatments (P < 0.05). Ebastine had a significantly greater antihistaminic effect than did cetirizine or loratadine, except at 4 hours after a single dose versus cetirizine. Further, the effect of cetirizine was similar with single or multiple doses after both 4 and 24 hours, whereas the effect of ebastine showed significant increases in wheal reduction with multiple doses (P < 0.05). No serious adverse events or withdrawals occurred during the study.

Conclusion

This study shows that ebastine in a 20-mg dose is an effective once-daily antihistamine. Superior efficacy was found in comparison to cetirizine (10 mg) or loratadine (10 mg) on the overall skin wheal response after single and multiple doses.

EGFR inhibitor–associated pruritus — systemic agents and practical use: "Hence, nonsedating second-generation antihistamines are recommended as the first approach for systemic therapy for pruritus during daytime", and "Dosing of antihistamines also should be kept to the minimum to avoid adverse drug reactions, particularly in the elderly, as these medications may cause severe anticholinergic reactions". "For patients who suffer from pruritus during nighttime, first-generation antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine) are preferable given their sedative properties". Comparative tolerability shows "somnolence or sedation was recorded in 5% of loratadine patients and 40% of hydroxyzine patients after 1 week of drug usage [40]", and EGFRI data are limited: "two patients were given loratadine for 14 days; however, patients did not find it useful and discontinued treatment [22]". For refractory symptoms, "these antiepileptic agents should only be recommended as second-line treatment in patients who failed antihistamines and therapies against underlying rash and/or xerosis and continue to experience clinically significant pruritus". Regarding NK-1 antagonism, "aprepitant, an NK-1 antagonist was reported to reduce pruritus that is caused by erlotinib [38]", but "caution must be taken as aprepitant may cause drug–drug interactions and potentially affect the concentrations of erlotinib [45]".

Contact dermatitis — diagnosis and treatment: "Clinical features of contact dermatitis range from mild erythema, swelling, and scaling to marked erythema, excoriations, fissures, erosions, and ulcers", and "diagnosis of contact dermatitis can be made based on history and physical examination findings". "Recommended treatment of contact dermatitis includes patient counseling regarding vulvar care and removal of vulvar irritants and allergens… and symptom management with a topical corticosteroid ointment and an oral antipruritic medication as needed". "The severity and chronicity of contact dermatitis will determine the need for and the potency of the topical corticosteroid chosen for treatment", and "a topical corticosteroid ointment should initially be applied once or twice daily… until the lesions heal". "A topical corticosteroid ointment is preferable to other formulations (cream, gel, lotion), which often contain alcohol or preservatives that can cause or exacerbate irritation". For itch control, "pruritus and associated scratching and rubbing can be reduced by using a combination of nonsedating antihistamines (eg, cetirizine, loratadine) for daytime use and sedating antihistamines (eg, hydroxyzine) or a tricyclic antidepressant with antihistamine properties (eg, doxepin) at night if needed".

### Contact dermatitis: a practice parameter-update 2015 [^0c8b9eaf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic contact dermatitis — patch test (PT) reading schedule and factors affecting reactivity are specified: For delayed hypersensitivity, the initial reading "should be done approximately 48 hours" after application, with a possible check "30 minutes after removal" to allow pressure erythema to resolve; "A second reading must be done; this is often done at day 3 to 7 after the initial application". A collaborative study found "30% of relevant allergens were positive at 96 hours and were negative at the 48-hour reading", suggesting "96 hours may be optimal for a second reading", and "an additional late reading after 7 days may be needed" for certain contactants. Systemic and local immunosuppression can blunt responses: "Oral CS exceeding 20 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent have been shown to diminish skin test reactivity to 5% nickel sulfate at 48 hours", and "The test site where the PT are applied should have no topical potent CS or TCI applied for 5 to 7 days before testing". The guideline states, "When the clinical suspicion is high despite a negative PT in a patient receiving immunosuppressive medications, consider repeat testing when the immunosuppressant doses are lowered or discontinued", and warns that "UV irradiation of PT sites before testing can suppress PT responses". It also notes that "Doubtful (?+) or weakly positive (1+) questionable or irreproducible reactions on PT can be easily misinterpreted".

### Atopic dermatitis yardstick: practical recommendations for an evolving therapeutic landscape [^b549e6b8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

The implementation of treatment guidelines for atopic dermatitis is challenging, in part because of different guidance documents being used by different groups of specialists and in part because the language of guidelines often reflects the evidence base rather than the practical "how to". The Atopic Dermatitis Yardstick is part of a series developed in response to the need to proactively address the loss of disease control for atopic illnesses at all levels of severity. It presents a comprehensive update on how to conduct a sustained step-up in therapy for the patient with inadequately controlled or poorly controlled atopic dermatitis. Patient profiles, based on current guidelines and the authors' combined clinical experience, provide a practical and clinically meaningful guide to aid physicians in helping their patients achieve the goal of clear to almost clear. The intent is not to replace guidelines but to complement their recommendations incorporating the latest research and therapies.

Pharmacological therapies

Pharmacological therapies include traditional oral antihistaminic medications (see Box 10). Some patients prefer sedating formulations at bedtime (for example, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, chlorpheniramine) and others non-sedating preparations during the day (for example, cetirizine, loratadine and fexofenadine). Efficacy is variable and recommendations are based on anecdotal experience for lack of good evidence in EB and other dermatologic conditions. Centrally acting medications, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, have evidence for efficacy from the burn literature, and may have application in EB. Many of these medications have also been used successfully for neuropathic pain (see sub-section on adjunctive measures for neuropathic pain under End of Life Pain). Antidepressants with nortriptyline re-uptake inhibitory actions have been used for various pruritic conditions with some evidence for efficacy, with mirtazapine showing promise -. Low-dose cyclosporine has been used in a single case of dominant dystrophic EB to reduce generalized itching. Anecdotal success has been reported with ondansetron in EB; however, the same had been reported for pruritus from cholestatic jaundice, although controlled trials did not confirm efficacy. Similar suggestions were made related to the pruritus of uremia, leading to recommendations that ondansetron should be considered, although clinical trials are needed in EB.

Other medications that have shown sporadic clinical success in treating itch in EB include: cyproheptadine; selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs; fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine); tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin, amitriptyline, nortriptyline); opioid antagonists (naloxone, naltrexone); kappa receptor agonists (butorphanol, dextromethorphan, nalbuphine); other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (granisetron, dolasetron); antipsychotic agents (olanzapine, pimozide) and cannabinoids. These agents and the NK-1 receptor antagonist aprepitant may prove to be useful in certain subsets of patients, although evidence to guide therapy is lacking and practitioners are encouraged to pursue the aforementioned therapies based on patient response to prior medications, potential interactions within the patient's medication list and medication availability (see Box 10).

### Clinical pharmacology of H1-antihistamines in the skin [^37eb00cc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The extent of the distribution of H(1)- antihistamines into the skin and H(1)-antihistamine activity in the skin are clinically relevant in the treatment of allergic skin disorders.

Methods

In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multiple-dose study, we gave fexofenadine 180 mg, loratadine 10 mg, or chlorpheniramine 8 mg to 21 men (7 in each group). Before dosing and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 24 hours after the first antihistamine dose as well as at 168, 192, and 216 hours after the first dose (ie, 12, 36, and 60 hours after the seventh and last consecutive daily H(1)-antihistamine dose), we measured fexofenadine, loratadine, or chlorpheniramine concentrations in plasma and in skin tissue samples obtained through use of punch biopsies, along with suppression of histamine-induced skin wheals and flares. Loratadine metabolites, including desloratadine and its metabolites, were not measured, and chlorpheniramine metabolites were not measured.

Results

All 21 participants completed the study. Skin/plasma fexofenadine ratios ranged from 1.2 ± 0.5 at 1 hour to 110 ± 74 at 24 hours, and skin fexofenadine concentrations exceeded loratadine and chlorpheniramine skin concentrations at each test time. This was reflected in significant wheal and flare suppression by fexofenadine in comparison with loratadine at 3 hours and in comparison with chlorpheniramine at 6 and 9 hours (wheal) and from 3 to 24 hours and at 192 hours (flare). Compared with fexofenadine, loratadine significantly suppressed the wheal at 192 hours, and compared with chlorpheniramine, it significantly suppressed the wheal at 9 hours and the flare at 24 and 192 hours. At no time did chlorpheniramine suppress the wheal or flare significantly more than fexofenadine or loratadine.

Conclusions

In skin disorders for which H(1)-antihistamines are recommended, these results support the use of fexofenadine or loratadine, and they indicate the need for reexamination of the use of chlorpheniramine.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^41097bc4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa — adverse events, adherence, cost, and dosing — has an overall low incidence of adverse events, with pruritus (about 5% to 7%) and site reaction (4% to 5%), and other events less than 2%, and two meta-analyses comparing a quinolone drop versus neomycin–polymyxin B–hydrocortisone found no significant difference in adverse events; however, about 30% to 60% of patients with chronic or eczematous external otitis develop a contact dermatitis, most often to aminoglycoside drops, and it would appear prudent to avoid using aminoglycoside drops in these populations. Adherence and patient satisfaction are highest when drops are easy to administer, and drops administered 4 times daily may be less acceptable; costs range from a few dollars for antiseptics or generic products to more than $100 for quinolones. Available data suggest that, at least with quinolone drops, a twice-daily dosing regimen is as effective as more frequent dosing with the quinolones, and more recent trials recommend 7 to 10 days of topical therapy.

Itch control — Pruritus is a major, multifactorial burden in atopic dermatitis, and supportive measures alongside active disease control are emphasized; antihistamines may help some patients, with second-generation agents favored for safety. It can be difficult to eliminate itch, but supportive measures include avoiding irritants, minimizing triggers, and continuing skin-directed anti-inflammatory and barrier-restorative treatments; treatment of active AD most improves itch, oral antihistamines do not directly affect dermatitis yet may benefit some patients, and nonsedating second-generation antihistamines are not associated with the same side effect profile as first-generation agents and have been shown to be safe to use long-term.

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) evaluation in atopic dermatitis (AD) is outlined as follows: ACD is at least as common in AD as in the general population (6–60% of subjects, depending on the study), and common allergens include nickel, neomycin, fragrance, formaldehyde and other preservatives, lanolin, and rubber chemicals. A diagnosis of ACD is made by patch testing with suspected allergens placed for 48 hours, with reactions assessed at initial removal and again up to 7 days after application. Patch testing should be considered when history or examination is suggestive of ACD and may also be considered with atypical lesion distribution, later onset or worsening, no family history of atopy, or persistent/recalcitrant disease not responsive to standard therapies. The sensitivity of patch testing ranges from 60% to 80%; positive tests indicate contact sensitization and require clinical relevance, and avoidance of the suspected allergen with resolution of dermatitis confirms ACD. It is extremely rare to find 1 allergen responsible for AD.

TCS are widely accepted as the treatment of acute and chronic dermatitis, and TCS may be sufficient for localized lesions, but acute extensive and severe dermatitis such as extensive Toxicodendron dermatitis may need systemic therapy. The clinician should avoid the prolonged use of systemic steroids for management of chronic dermatitis. Ointments and potent fluorinated CS should be avoided on areas of thinner skin such as the intertriginous areas, eyelids and face, and in young children. The use of TCS over prolonged periods of time should be avoided and should not be a substitute for defining the etiology of the dermatitis, and if symptoms worsen, the possibility of contact sensitization to the CS itself, the vehicle, or other ingredients in the TCS should be considered.

Drug Interactions

In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in
healthy male (n = 12 in each study) and female (n = 12 in each study) volunteers,
desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered
with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for
10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology
studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with
azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n = 18) or with
fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with
fluoxetine (n = 18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n = 18)
under steady state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers.
Although increased plasma concentrations (Cmaxand AUC
0–24 hrs) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 1), there were no clinically relevant changes in the

and adverse events.

Pharmacodynamics

Wheal and Flare

Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated
5 mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic
effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was
no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the
desloratadine 5 mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical
relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Adults and Adolescents

Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients ages 12 years or older received CLARINEX Tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between CLARINEX and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the CLARINEX group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of CLARINEX Tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with CLARINEX Tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1.

The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in CLARINEX and placebo-treated patients.

There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of emedastine 0.05% ophthalmic solution with loratadine 10 mg and their combination in the human conjunctival allergen challenge model [^a23cc309]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

When selecting treatment for allergic conjunctivitis, a primary concern is whether to choose local or systemic therapy.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy of topical emedastine 0.05% ophthalmic solution with that of oral loratadine 10 mg and their combination in the conjunctival allergen challenge model of allergic conjunctivitis.

Methods

This was a single-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. At visit 1, eligible subjects underwent conjunctival allergen challenge to identify the dose required to elicit a positive allergic reaction. After 7 days, subjects returned for visit 2, at which the allergen dose was confirmed. At visit 3, which took place 2 weeks later, subjects were randomized to receive either emedastine plus placebo capsules, loratadine plus placebo eyedrops, or both emedastine and loratadine. One hour after receiving study drug, subjects were challenged with allergen in both eyes. Allergic signs and symptoms were graded using standardized 5-point scales. The primary efficacy variables were itching and conjunctival hyperemia. Secondary efficacy variables were ciliary and episcleral hyperemia, chemosis, lid swelling, and tearing. Itching was graded subjectively at 3, 5, and 10 minutes after challenge. All other variables were assessed at 5, 10, and 20 minutes after challenge.

Results

Eighty subjects (mean age, 43.68 years) were randomized to receive study treatment. Forty subjects (20 men, 20 women) received emedastine plus placebo capsules, 20 (7 men, 13 women) received loratadine plus placebo eyedrops, and 20 (12 men, 8 women) received both active treatments. In the between-group efficacy comparison at visit 3, the difference in itching and hyperemia scores between emedastine and loratadine was statistically significant at all time points (all, P < 0.05). Efficacy scores for the combination of emedastine and loratadine were significantly better than those for loratadine alone at 2 of 3 time points for itching and all time points for hyperemia (P < 0.05). The combination was significantly better than emedastine alone at I of 3 time points for itching and 6 of 9 time points for hyperemia (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

In this study, emedastine was more efficacious than loratadine for reducing the itching and redness associated with allergic conjunctivitis in the human conjunctival allergen challenge model.

Topical medicinal contact dermatitis (CD) and topical corticosteroid (TCS) allergy — evaluation and patch testing. Summary Statement 34: If an eruption worsens, rather than improves, after the topical application of certain medications, or fails to respond to TCS, patch testing should be performed to the suspected product and/or ingredients known to be contact sensitizers. [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; C Evidence]. Allergy to TCS affects 0.5% to 5.8% of patients suspected of ACD, and sensitization can occur by skin, airborne, oral, and IV routes; certain disorders predispose patients to increased risk, particularly those with a history of 2 or more positive PT results and multiple medicament sensitivities. Patch testing to corticosteroids can yield false-negative results if tested at too high concentration, and PT reading should also be done 7–10 days following application because approximately 30% of ACD to TCS could be missed by conventional readings. Coopman et al suggested that 4 major groups of corticosteroid preparations should suffice for screening, and Ninety percent of ACD to CS should be detected by using tixocortol pivalate, budesonide, triamcinolone, and the patient's commercial steroid.

Toxicodendron dermatitis — symptomatic care evidence notes limited benefit of some measures. One study found that the combination of systemic corticosteroids and high-potency topical corticosteroids reduced the duration of itching, while the use of low-potency corticosteroids was not associated with symptom improvement. Although supported by little evidence, cool compresses and oatmeal baths are frequently recommended for symptomatic relief of itching from Toxicodendron dermatitis. Although oral antihistamines have been recommended as a treatment for local itching, few data support their use; an expert consensus and 2 review articles suggested the use of oral antihistamines for help with sleep at night but questioned their efficacy for itching, and one observational study enrolling 89 participants did not find a statistically significant reduction in symptoms with the use of oral antihistamine.

Glossary — contact dermatitis entities and reactions — "Angry back" syndrome or "excited skin" syndrome is defined as false-positive patch test (PT) reactions usually adjacent to large true-positive reactions that induce contiguous skin inflammation and irritability. Ectopic allergic contact dermatitis consists of contact allergy lesions at locations distant from or indirectly in contact with the original allergen-exposed sites due to inadvertent transfer by the patient or others. Contact sensitization means that a positive PT reaction is not definitive of an "allergy" and must be confirmed as clinically relevant by history and clinical findings analysis. Contact urticaria is defined as the development of a wheal- and-flare reaction at a site where an external agent contacts the skin or mucosa. Photo-allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed contact hypersensitivity reaction to an allergen activated by exposure to UV radiation. Systemic allergic contact dermatitis is a generalized ACD rash from systemic administration of a drug, chemical, or food to which the patient previously experienced ACD.
