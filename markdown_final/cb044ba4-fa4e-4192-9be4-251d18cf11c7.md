## Question

What is the optimal cutoff for THC in urine drug screens to minimize false positive results from hemp products or CBD oil?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal urine THC immunoassay cutoff to minimize false positives from hemp or CBD oil use, and what confirmatory strategy should be used afterward. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory and testing framework, including SAMHSA cutoffs and the distinction between screening and confirmation. Then, I should verify how hemp/CBD exposure produces true positives at low levels and whether higher screening cutoffs mitigate them. Next, I will review clinical data on THC-COOH levels after hemp/CBD use and consider detection windows. After that, I should examine the trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity and the role of confirmatory testing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and note caveats and exceptions, including product variability and interfering substances.

> Let me first confirm the testing framework so I don't jump to conclusions. Workplace and many clinical programs use a two-step process: a presumptive immunoassay screen at 50 ng/mL for THC-COOH, followed by definitive GC-MS or LC-MS/MS confirmation at 15 ng/mL, which is the SAMHSA standard and widely adopted in U.S. testing programs [^114Nv9tv] [^117GyKXv]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical caveat: addiction medicine guidance emphasizes that federal cutoffs are not necessarily appropriate for clinical care, and clinicians should know the lab's cutoffs and plan for confirmatory testing when results are unexpected or consequential [^117Qjtp3] [^111YovYR].

> Now, I need to check whether hemp/CBD use produces true positives rather than immunoassay false positives. Full-spectrum hemp products legally contain up to 0.3% Δ9-THC, and chronic use can yield measurable THC-COOH in urine, meaning a positive screen reflects real exposure, not analytical error, even if the user did not intend intoxication [^1153PFZe] [^111ZHzok]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude: in a clinical trial using a product with 0.02% THC, about half of participants became THC-COOH positive after 4 weeks, and the authors explicitly noted that federally legal products can contain more than 10 times that THC content, increasing the likelihood of detection [^111ZHzok] [^1153PFZe].

> Next, I should review what levels of THC-COOH are typically seen after hemp/CBD exposure to gauge whether a higher screening cutoff would help. In the open-label trial, GC-MS confirmation showed low-level positives, and importantly, the screen was often more sensitive than its stated 50 ng/mL detection threshold, suggesting that even modest metabolite concentrations can trigger a positive at standard cutoffs [^111ZHzok]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "more sensitive than advertised" meant the assay was detecting below 50 ng/mL, but I should double-check: the report says the screen was more sensitive than its stated lower limit of detection (50 ng/mL), which implies detection below 50 ng/mL, reinforcing that low-level hemp exposure can register positive on some immunoassays [^111ZHzok].

> I will now examine the detection window to ensure I'm not underestimating persistence. For infrequent cannabis exposure, THC-COOH is generally detectable for several days, whereas chronic or heavy use can extend detection to weeks, and this prolonged window also applies to low-level, repeated hemp/CBD exposure that accumulates over time [^114Nv9tv] [^111ZHzok]. Hold on, I should verify adolescent data too: during one month of abstinence, many chronic users remained positive at 5 ng/mL, and a substantial fraction remained above 50 ng/mL on screening, underscoring that elimination can be slow and variable [^1141xJCU].

> Let me consider the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Raising the immunoassay cutoff reduces detection of low-level positives, which would decrease apparent "false positives" from hemp/CBD, but at the cost of missing some true cannabis use, especially occasional or low-dose use; this is precisely why federal programs standardized 50/15 ng/mL to balance performance across populations [^114Nv9tv] [^117GyKXv]. I should confirm the principle: higher cutoffs reduce false positives but increase false negatives, and the optimal cutoff depends on the clinical question and consequences of error, not just analytical performance [^117GyKXv] [^114DLjHQ].

> But wait, what if we shift the screening cutoff upward — would 100 or 200 ng/mL solve the hemp problem? It likely would reduce positives from trace THC exposure, yet it would also miss clinically meaningful cannabis use that falls between 50 and 100–200 ng/mL, which is unacceptable in many safety-sensitive or treatment contexts; moreover, definitive confirmation at 15 ng/mL would still catch low-level positives if ordered, so simply raising the screen may defer but not eliminate the issue [^114Nv9tv] [^111YovYR]. Hold on, I should verify that most programs still require confirmation of any presumptive positive before action; yes, best practice is confirmatory testing for consequential decisions, which preserves specificity while allowing screening to remain sensitive [^111YovYR].

> Next, I should review confirmatory strategies that help distinguish hemp/CBD exposure from marijuana use. Let me verify whether metabolite ratios can assist: an LC-MS/MS method measuring THC-COOH alongside CBD metabolites showed that a CBD metabolite excess of about 10-fold over THC metabolites strongly suggests CBD-dominant product exposure rather than marijuana, offering a path to adjudicate low-level THC positives in the right clinical context [^112AbbF9]. I need to ensure we also consider interfering medications; although some labels list PPIs as causing false-positive THC screens, controlled studies have not reproduced this with certain immunoassays, so unexpected positives should still be confirmed rather than attributed to interference without evidence [^111iYeLf] [^113Q1ZLi].

> I should confirm practical steps for clinicians facing low-level THC positives in hemp/CBD users. First, verify the test menu and cutoffs with the lab. Second, if the result is unexpected or consequential, order definitive LC-MS/MS quantification of THC-COOH and consider a metabolite ratio panel if available. Third, interpret results alongside product history, dosing, route, and timing, recognizing that oral and some topical products can deliver measurable THC exposure despite low labeled THC content. Finally, document the clinical rationale for any decision to treat a result as consistent with permitted hemp use versus ongoing cannabis use [^111YovYR] [^117SMaWB]. Hold on, I should verify that topical products can contribute too. Yes, a substantial fraction of topical hemp products contain THC, and although systemic exposure is typically low, repeated use may be detectable in urine in some cases [^115vY17T].

> Putting this together, I should state the bottom line clearly. There is no single immunoassay cutoff that eliminates hemp/CBD-related positives without compromising detection of true marijuana use. The most defensible approach is to retain the standard 50 ng/mL screening cutoff and reflex all presumptive positives to LC-MS/MS confirmation at 15 ng/mL, adding a CBD-to-THC metabolite ratio when available to help differentiate CBD-dominant exposure from marijuana use, especially when patients report exclusive hemp/CBD use and when consequences are high [^114Nv9tv] [^112AbbF9] [^111YovYR]. I should double-check that this aligns with addiction medicine guidance: yes, definitive testing is recommended when results inform major decisions or when presumptive findings contradict the clinical picture, which fits this scenario precisely [^111YovYR] [^1116uhNt].

> Finally, I need to ensure we communicate caveats. Product variability is substantial, with many hemp/CBD products mislabeled and some containing more THC than declared, so even careful users may test positive. Detection is also influenced by hydration, renal function, and individual metabolism, and chronic or heavy cannabis users may remain positive for weeks, complicating interpretation of any single result [^116hsfEb] [^117SMaWB] [^114Nv9tv]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "zero tolerance" policies. Given these realities, programs should pair testing with clear policies, confirmatory pathways, and clinical review to avoid unjust penalties for permissible hemp/CBD use while maintaining accountability for unauthorized cannabis use [^111YovYR] [^117GyKXv].

The best urine THC cutoff to minimize false positives from hemp/CBD is **50 ng/mL for initial screening** [^114Nv9tv] with **15 ng/mL for confirmatory testing** [^117GyKXv]. This two-tier approach balances sensitivity and specificity, reducing false positives from low-level THC in hemp/CBD while catching true cannabis use. Higher screening cutoffs (e.g. 100–200 ng/mL) increase false negatives and miss clinically meaningful use; lower cutoffs (e.g. 20 ng/mL) increase false positives from hemp/CBD. Always confirm positives with LC-MS/MS [^111YovYR] and interpret results in clinical context to account for product variability and patient factors [^1153PFZe].

---

## Current standard cutoff levels

Current standard cutoff levels include an **initial screening cutoff** of 50 ng/mL for immunoassay screening [^114Nv9tv], widely used in workplace and clinical settings, and a **confirmatory cutoff** of 15 ng/mL for GC-MS or LC-MS/MS confirmation [^114Nv9tv], the federal standard for confirming cannabis use.

---

## Evidence supporting current cutoffs

Evidence supporting current cutoffs includes **federal guidelines** from SAMHSA, which endorse 50/15 ng/mL to balance sensitivity and specificity for cannabis detection [^114Nv9tv]. Clinical data show that **hemp/CBD users** can test positive at 50 ng/mL but typically have low levels (< 15 ng/mL) on confirmation, supporting the two-tier approach [^1153PFZe] [^112AbbF9].

---

## Impact of different cutoff levels

| **Cutoff level (ng/ml)** | **False positives from hemp/cbd** | **False negatives for true cannabis use** |
|-|-|-|
| 20 | High | Low |
| 50 (standard) | Moderate | Moderate |
| 100 | Low | High |
| 200 | Very low | Very high |

---

Higher cutoffs (100–200 ng/mL) reduce hemp/CBD false positives but increase false negatives for true cannabis use; lower cutoffs (20 ng/mL) increase false positives from hemp/CBD [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing false positives

Several factors influence false positives from hemp/CBD:

- **Product variability**: Many hemp/CBD products contain trace THC, often mislabeled, leading to unexpected positives [^115vY17T] [^116hsfEb].
- **Individual metabolism**: Differences in metabolism and hydration affect THC-COOH levels and detection [^112ATx2J].
- **Testing methodology**: Immunoassays are prone to cross-reactivity; LC-MS/MS is more specific and should confirm positives [^111YovYR] [^117XnBQb].

---

## Clinical and legal implications

False positives can have **significant consequences**:

- **Employment**: Risk of job loss or disciplinary action despite legal hemp/CBD use [^1153PFZe].
- **Legal issues**: Potential legal ramifications, especially in strict jurisdictions [^1153PFZe].
- **Clinical decisions**: Misinterpretation can affect patient care and treatment decisions [^117JwDpL].

---

## Recommendations for clinicians and laboratories

Clinicians and laboratories should **confirm positives** using LC-MS/MS to distinguish true cannabis use from hemp/CBD exposure [^111YovYR] [^112AbbF9]. They should also **interpret results** in the clinical context, including product use, metabolism, and hydration [^114uDCUT] [^112t9WT6] [^112ATx2J]. Educate patients on product variability and the risk of positive tests with hemp/CBD [^116hsfEb].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The **optimal urine THC cutoff** to minimize false positives from hemp/CBD is **50 ng/mL for initial screening** [^114Nv9tv] with **15 ng/mL for confirmatory testing** [^117GyKXv]. This two-tier approach balances sensitivity and specificity, reducing false positives while detecting true cannabis use.

Immunoassay versus chromatography/mass-spectrometry — test technologies, readouts, and cutoff interpretation are described: For the most part, presumptive testing uses immunoassay technology and definitive testing uses a combination of chromatography/mass-spectrometry. Immunoassays use antibodies designed to bind with a specific drug, metabolite, or a class of compounds in a sample, and if no drug compounds are present the antibodies bind with a conjugate compound and register as a colored line in the test readout area. Immunoassays have varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity depending on the particular antibodies and the cutoff value used. A cutoff value is the amount of substance that needs to be detected in a sample for it to be considered positive, and test results are positive if enough drug or metabolite is present to react with a predetermined threshold of antibodies in the assay.

### Up in smoke: uncovering a lack of evidence for proton pump inhibitors as a source of tetrahydrocannabinol immunoassay false positives [^113Q1ZLi]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

It is recommended that positives in immunoassay drug screens be followed up with more specific confirmatory testing. The drug package insert for pantoprazole mentions reports of false-positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, but no method details or data are given, referenced, or found in literature searches. Thus, we investigated this using our laboratory's assay.

Methods

A spiked sample and samples from 32 patients taking a proton pump inhibitor were analyzed using the EMIT II Plus Cannabinoid assay with a 20ng/mL cutoff. Additionally, we examined urine samples from 50 patients with false-positive or low-positive screens for evidence of a proton pump inhibitor. To determine whether O-desmethyl pantoprazole sulfate, the major metabolite, shares any structural or electrostatic similarity to suggest a basis for cross-reactivity in the immunoassay, we used computational techniques for analyses. Molecular electrostatic potential energy (MEP) maps were calculated for the global minimum conformers, and the maximum common substructure Tanimoto similarity was calculated for the modeled compounds.

Results

Neither the spiked sample nor the patient samples were found to screen positive. None of the false-positive or low-positive screens were found to contain a proton pump inhibitor. Computational studies showed very little similarity in shape or electrostatics between the two molecules.

Conclusions

We find no supporting evidence of pantoprazole as the cause of false positives in the EMIT II Plus Cannabinoid assay and caution the use of proton pump inhibitors as an explanation for tetrahydrocannabinol immunoassay false positives.

Second, because all participants could choose a variety of cannabis products with input from licensed medical marijuana dispensaries or elsewhere, we conducted a modified per protocol sensitivity analysis that compared the primary outcomes in participants in the immediate card acquisition group whose urine samples at week 12 (end of the intervention) had detectable levels of THC, CBD, or metabolites with those of participants in the delayed card acquisition group without detectable levels of THC, CBD, or metabolites at week 12.

Urine toxicology screening federal workplace cut-off values — this table reports initial immunoassay and confirmatory GCMS thresholds (ng/mL), confirmatory test analytes, and typical detection periods after the last dose. Marijuana metabolites have initial and confirmatory cutoffs of 50 and 15 ng/mL (THCA) with detection 2–8 days for single use and 20–30 days for chronic use. Cocaine metabolites have 300 and 150 ng/mL (benzoylecgonine) with detection 1–3 days. Opioid metabolites list 2000 and 2000 ng/mL with confirmatory analytes Codeine, Morphine, 6-MAM and detection noted as 2–3 days (opiates), 3–5 minutes (heroin), and 12–24 hr (6-MAM). Amphetamines show 500 and 250 ng/mL with analytes Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, MDMA, MDA, MDEA and 1–3 day detection, while Methamphetamine has incomplete initial data, confirmatory 500 ng/mL, and 3–4 day detection. Benzodiazepines list 300 and 200 ng/mL with 3 days (short-acting) and 30 days (long-acting) detection, and Barbiturates list 300 and 200 ng/mL with 1 day (short-acting) and 21 days (long-acting) detection. Methadone lists 300 and 200 ng/mL with EDDP and 3–6 day detection, and Alcohol is listed with EtG, EtS and 12 hours detection. A footnote states 'Detection time for most drugs in urine is 1–3 days', and another notes that opiate testing levels were raised from 300 ng/mL to 2000 ng/mL to reduce detection from foods containing poppy seeds.

Biomarkers of exposure in EVALI — active ingredients and degradation products are highlighted, including that "Positive urine ELISA screening for Δ9-THC preceded the EVALI outbreak to cannabinoid e-cigarettes", while emerging cannabinoids such as "CBD, Δ8-THC" may evade routine screens so "more comprehensive drug screenings are warranted in patients who report any e-cigarette use". A urinary biomarker for acrylonitrile "was reported to be significantly higher in nicotine e-cigarette users than in nonsers but lower than in cigarette smokers", and e-cigarette aerosols include acetaldehyde and acrolein. Unique to nicotine e-cigarettes are "PG and VG formaldehyde hemiacetals" that are "present at concentrations of up to 350 μg per puff, and four to eight times as much formaldehyde is in the aerosol in this form as is in the gaseous state"; formaldehyde gas is rapidly absorbed in the upper respiratory tract, whereas hemiacetals likely partition to particles with potential alveolar deposition and bloodstream absorption.

### Cannabinoid content and label accuracy of hemp-derived topical products available online and at national retail stores [^112iBUZ1]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The market for hemp-derived topical cannabinoid products has seen substantial growth since 2018, but research on these products is lacking. This case series study tested topical cannabinoid products representative of those available throughout the US for CBD and THC content. Although there are few to no clinical data to inform whether commercial topical cannabinoid products such as those examined here can deliver THC and CBD to users, preclinical studies, and clinical research with a pharmaceutical-grade CBD gel, have shown that cannabinoids can penetrate the skin and enter systemic circulation when applied topically via some formulations. Thus, our findings may have important implications for consumers of topical cannabinoid products.

Most products were inaccurately labeled for CBD. Products with lower CBD than advertised may be less likely to elicit the desired medical benefits. Products with more CBD than advertised may be a health concern given the potential for adverse effects from CBD (eg, liver toxicity) and drug-drug interactions between CBD and common prescription medications. The labeled amount of CBD was usually expressed on the basis of the total contents of the product (eg, full lotion bottle) as opposed to the dose intended for each application. This labeling practice, in combination with vague or unclear application instructions, may contribute to inconsistent dosing and confusion among consumers.

THC was detected in 35% of products, most of which did not mention THC on the label or claimed to be THC free. Although THC concentrations were always under the legal limit for hemp (< 0.3%), many products contained amounts of THC (up to 100 mg) capable of producing substantial intoxication when administered through other routes (eg, oral, smoked, or vaporized). That said, we measured the total amount of THC in these products and it is unlikely that someone would use an entire container on a single occasion. Controlled research is needed to determine whether topical products similar to those examined here can deliver THC to humans at levels capable of producing intoxicating effects. Research is also needed to determine whether topical products with THC can produce positive drug tests for cannabis, particularly when used repeatedly, as has been observed for hemp-based oral CBD products with low amounts of THC. Such research can inform whether individuals should abstain from using these products if they are drug tested for their occupation or other reasons. Ideally, future clinical studies should investigate a variety of topical products to elucidate whether product formulation is associated with cannabinoid absorption or acute drug effects.

5.12 Interference with Urine Screen for THC

There have been reports of false-positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs, including pantoprazole [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.13 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate

Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Association of a positive drug screening for cannabis with mortality and hospital visits among veterans affairs enrollees prescribed opioids [^117JkvEs]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

The institutional review board of the University of California, San Francisco, approved this study and waived the need for patient consent because the research involved no more than minimal risk to participants. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Study Design, Setting, Participants, and Procedures

Using national VA and Medicare data, we designed a cohort study of adults who received their first urine drug screening in the VA outpatient setting between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019. Adults were eligible if they received any prescribed opioid analgesic in the 90 days prior to the drug screening. We excluded anyone potentially at the end of life (eg, residing in a VA community living center [nursing home], receiving palliative care, or receiving inpatient cancer chemotherapy) or with a Care Assessment Needs (CAN) score greater than 99. The CAN score is a validated measure, updated weekly, that estimates 90-day mortality among patients in VA primary care; the score is the patient's risk percentile (range, 0 [low risk] to 99 [highest risk]), so a CAN score of 99 suggests a very high likelihood of death within 90 days. In addition, we excluded individuals prescribed THC-containing medications (eg, dronabinol) and anyone treated in an opiate treatment program (eg, methadone maintenance clinic). We identified 312 164 veterans receiving opioids who met inclusion criteria (30 514 adults who used cannabis and 267 106 adults who did not use cannabis) (Figure). The index date for cohort entry was defined as the date of the first urine drug screening. We followed up veterans for 180 days after their index date. We limited follow-up to 180 days because the exposure was based on a single biologic measurement of cannabis use and we wanted to ensure that outcomes were temporally near the exposure assessment. All data on exposure, outcome, and covariate measurements were retrieved from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, VA community care files, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) data, and Mortality Data Repository.

False negative and false positive results in immunoassay screening are defined, with confirmation by GC-MS or LC-MS/MS used to resolve inaccuracies: a false negative is the analytical failure to detect a present drug or metabolite and can be discovered by confirmation testing using GC-MS or LC-MS/MS on screened-negative samples; a false positive is reporting a drug or metabolite not present and is often discovered by confirmation testing using GC-MS or LC-MS/MS.

Methods

This randomized clinical trial followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline. This study was approved by the institutional review board at Johns Hopkins Medicine, and all participants provided written informed consent prior to study procedures.

Participants

Study volunteers were recruited via media advertisements and word-of-mouth communication. Inclusion criteria for the study were: (1) being 18 to 50 years of age; (2) having a body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) between 18 and 34; (3) past experience with cannabis; (4) no use of cannabis within 30 days prior to the first session; (5) negative urine drug test results for common drugs of abuse at screening and beginning of all sessions; (6) not pregnant or nursing; (7) report no allergies to cannabinoids or study drugs; and (8) in good health as determined via clinical chemistry blood testing (hematology and serology), medical history, and physical examination.

Sensitivity and specificity definitions — diagnostic utility: Sensitivity is defined as the likelihood that a given test is able to detect the presence of a drug or metabolite that is actually in the specimen, and a negative result in a test with high sensitivity is useful for ruling out substance use, since positive samples are rarely missed. Specificity is defined as the likelihood that a given test is able to identify the specific drug or metabolite of interest in the specimen and not to erroneously label other drugs or metabolites, and a positive result in a test with high specificity is useful for ruling in substance use, since negative samples are rarely mislabeled.

Cocaine and cannabis urine testing — target analytes and sensitivity are outlined: Cocaine use can be detected in urine by targeting the metabolite benzoylecgonine (BZE) because cocaine has a very short half-life, and presumptive tests for cocaine are described as more sensitive and specific than those for opiate, benzodiazepine, and amphetamine because they target a specific analyte. Cannabis use can be detected in urine by targeting the THC metabolite THC-9-carboxylic acid (THC-COOH).

### Urinary tetrahydrocannabinol after 4 weeks of a full-spectrum, high-cannabidiol treatment in an open-label clinical trial [^117SRynC]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Despite the growing popularity of cannabidiol (CBD) products, specifically those derived from legal industrial hemp sources, few studies have directly assessed whether the use of high-CBD products could yield positive results on urinary drug tests assessing cannabis use through the detection of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) metabolites. A recent short-term administration study found that a single exposure to vaporized CBD-dominant cannabis flower (CBD, 10.5%; Δ9-THC, 0.39%), which the authors noted was similar to hemp, resulted in positive drug test results (> 15 ng/mL) for 2 of 6 participants within 4 to 8 hours of administration. However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined drug test results in those consistently using full-spectrum (ie, Δ9-THC–containing) CBD products. Accordingly, as part of an open-label clinical trial examining the use of a full-spectrum high-CBD product for anxiety (with unpublished results as yet), we monitored THC urinary drug status.

### Recommended protocols for the multiple sleep latency test and maintenance of wakefulness test in adults: guidance from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [^112oUKDG]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) drug screening and marijuana — Consideration should be given to drug screening as part of the MSLT protocol, and when concern exists about undisclosed substances, urine screening 1–2 days before the MSLT may be considered, with the task force concluding that drug screening may be indicated in adult patients depending on community and clinical circumstances. Regarding marijuana, recent discontinuation can result in REM sleep rebound, and when a washout period is not possible, a stable dose and consistent use of marijuana for at least 2 weeks before the MSLT is recommended; because tetrahydrocannabinol has a long half-life, a 2-week washout may not be sufficient for a negative drug screen.

ASIPP adherence monitoring emphasizes evidence, regulations, and responses to abnormal tests. As described, adherence monitoring is not only based on evidence, but also upon regulation(s) and recommendations and incorporates patient assessment, risk stratification, and urinary drug testing. Lack of adherence, aberrant behavior, and/or abnormal drug testing will necessitate that the patient may be tapered off the medication and ultimately discharged from the services, unless they are willing to go through a treatment program. Once an abnormality is identified, the patient is provided with a single chance for illicit drugs and two chances for THC prior to initiating tapering process with monthly drug testing.

### CBD retailers in NC promote CBD online to treat pain violating FDA rules about medical claims and offer low-CBD / high-price products [^111oDKtG]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, states across have varying regulations regarding cannabis products and their integration into the market for consumption. State laws range from excluding all marijuana access, legalization of high CBD and low delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the major intoxicating compound in cannabis) products, medical use of THC products, and recreational use of THC products. Interestingly, CBD products are available nearly nationwide in the US since only three states do not have any legal cannabis program as of February of 2022. In North Carolina (NC), delta-9-THC containing products or marijuana cultivation are illegal recreationally and medicinally but cultivation of hemp by licensed individuals was legalized in 2015. North Carolina serves as an example of a state with a program dedicated to the integration of hemp cultivation and medicinal CBD exclusively, containing a multitude of retailers selling it as a primary product. In fact, about half of growers in the state cultivate hemp for CBD production, demonstrating its increasing prominence and its role as a significant motivation for growing hemp.

### ASRA pain medicine consensus guidelines on the management of the perioperative patient on cannabis and cannabinoids [^111gk19s]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Preoperative screening for cannabinoids — The ASA statement encompasses any and all medically relevant substances, including cannabinoids, regardless of whether they are medicine, recreationally used, or illicitly obtained; therefore, physicians should screen during preoperative evaluation, and all patients should be questioned about cannabinoid use, dose and frequency, route of administration, and time of last use. Drug screening by laboratory analysis of urine, saliva, blood, or hair generally detects only THC or carboxy-THC and is not recommended unless clinically indicated, such as for acute intoxication; perioperative physicians should also evaluate patients for acute intoxication. It may be useful to use a standardized tool to screen preoperatively for cannabis use, and the Cannabis Use Disorder Test has been validated and used to identify cannabis use disorder (CUD). A review of 28 studies with 65,720 participants by the USPSTF in 2020 found no evidence for benefits or harms from screening for drug use.

### Cannabinoid content and label accuracy of hemp-derived topical products available online and at national retail stores [^117QGt4N]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Products containing cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) have proliferated since 2018, when the Agriculture Improvement Act removed hemp (ie, cannabis containing < 0.3% Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) from the US controlled substances list. Topical cannabinoid products can be purchased nationwide at retail stores and over the internet, yet research on these products is scarce.

Objective

To evaluate the cannabinoid content (ie, CBD and THC) and label accuracy of topical cannabinoid products and to quantify their therapeutic and nontherapeutic claims.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Product inclusion criteria included designation as hemp products, intended for topical or transdermal application, and purported to contain cannabinoids (eg, CBD). All unique products available at each retail store were purchased. Online products were identified via Google using relevant keywords (eg, hemp or CBD topical). Various products (eg, lotions and patches) were purchased from retail stores (eg, pharmacies, grocery stores, and cosmetic or beauty stores) in Baltimore, Maryland, and online. Data analysis was performed from March to June 2022.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Labeled and actual total amounts of CBD and THC, measured via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Therapeutic and nontherapeutic claims and references to the US Food and Drug Administration were quantified.

Results

A total of 105 products were purchased, 45 from retail locations and 60 online. Of the 89 products that listed a total amount of CBD on the label, 18% (16 products) were overlabeled (ie, contained > 10% less CBD than advertised), 58% (52 products) were underlabeled (ie, contained > 10% more CBD than advertised), and 24% (21 products) were accurately labeled. The median (range) percentage deviation between the actual total amount of CBD and the labeled amount was 21% (-75% to 93%) for in-store products and 10% (-96% to 121%) for online products, indicating that products contained more CBD than advertised overall. THC was detected in 37 of 105 products (35%), although all contained less than 0.3% THC. Among the 37 THC-containing products, 4 (11%) were labeled as THC free, 14 (38%) indicated they contained less than 0.3% THC, and 19 (51%) did not reference THC on the label. Overall, 28% of products (29 products) made therapeutic claims, 14% (15 products) made cosmetic claims, and only 47% (49 products) noted that they were not Food and Drug Administration approved.

Conclusions and Relevance

In a case series of topical cannabinoid products purchased online and at popular retail stores, products were often inaccurately labeled for CBD and many contained THC. These findings suggest that clinical studies are needed to determine whether topical cannabinoid products with THC can produce psychoactive effects or positive drug tests for cannabis.

### Urinary tetrahydrocannabinol after 4 weeks of a full-spectrum, high-cannabidiol treatment in an open-label clinical trial [^1153PFZe]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The results suggest that patients consistently using full-spectrum, hemp-derived products may have positive test results for THC-COOH on a urinary drug screen. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to more thoroughly assess which variables (product use, body mass index, age, sex, race, medication use, etc) contribute to positive findings in only some individuals, particularly those with higher creatinine levels. Importantly, the study product contained 0.02% of Δ9-THC by weight; in the US, hemp-derived products can legally contain 0.30% or less of Δ9-THC by weight, more than 10 times the amount of Δ9-THC as the current study product.

Despite limitations in sample size and diversity, these findings have important public health implications. It is often assumed individuals using hemp-derived products will test negative for THC. Current results indicate this may not be true, especially if assays are more sensitive than advertised, underscoring the potential for adverse consequences, including loss of employment and legal or treatment ramifications, despite the legality of hemp-derived products.

### The international cannabis toolkit (iCannToolkit): a multidisciplinary expert consensus on minimum standards for measuring cannabis use [^116JHKbG]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

More comprehensive assessments of cannabis exposure that require 30 + minutes for their administration can be used in settings where there is time for more extended testing. These include semi‐structured interviews that detailed lifetime cannabis use history, based on the TLFB. For example, the Cannabis Use History, Semi‐Structured Interview, provides comprehensive information on cannabis use history, such as: age of first use onset, age of regular use onset, periods of abstinence and their duration, variation over time in the level of cannabis dosage and how often cannabis has been used, thereby allowing to measure cumulative and/or average dosage and frequency over the lifetime and/or over selected periods of time (e.g. past year). These tools provide a comprehensive characterisation of the amount and frequency of cannabis use where there is sufficient time and resources for training and administration. Alternatively, shorter measures include estimates of frequency and potency of cannabis use from the Cannabis Experiences Questionnaire, which have demonstrated associations with mental health outcomes such as psychosis. Setting‐specific measures could differ considerably as a function of context‐related needs and therefore, hinder direct integration of their outcome measures.

Top layer: biological measures

Biological measures of cannabinoid consumption are at the top of the pyramid because they represent the objective gold standard by quantifying levels of distinct cannabinoids in biological matrices.

Expert‐recommended biological measures

The expert group recommends the use of biological measures of cannabinoids that are robustly associated with clinical outcomes relevant to problematic use (e.g. sustained abstinence, withdrawal and CUD severity), including the quantity of THC‐COOH in urine.

First, the presence of THC‐COOH in urine and of THC in saliva are relatively easy and inexpensive to measure using qualitative testing kits (e.g. testing strips). However, these tests typically report a binary outcome — cannabinoid present/absence — based on predefined cut‐offs (typically 50 ng/mL for THC‐COOH in urine). Qualitative tests cannot measure the level of THC or its metabolites. These measures are recommended for clinical treatment services and the judicial system as ways of confirming cannabis consumption (note that it may take a heavy user anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks for an initial negative test after quitting) in cannabis users trying to quit, or can identify individuals as having recently used cannabis. They can also be used in hospital emergency settings to assess whether symptoms may be related to THC intake.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^114DLjHQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ASAM drug testing — responding to test results states that "All physicians (and others involved in drug testing) should determine the questions the test is intended to answer before the testing is administered and should have a plan for what to do with the results"; drug testing should function as a therapeutic tool, so a provider's response to test results should not be confrontational, and providers should be aware that a positive drug test does not diagnose a SUD and a negative test result does not rule out a SUD, while all tests have some false-positive and false-negative outcomes. A false positive occurs when a negative sample is incorrectly labeled as positive, and the use of a detection threshold, or cutoff limit, is meant to reduce false-positive results; providers without formal toxicology training can participate in available courses and/or should collaborate with a medical toxicologist, a toxicologist from the testing laboratory, or a physician certified as an MRO, and providers could consider MRO training and/or certification. A false negative occurs when a positive sample is incorrectly labeled as negative; sometimes this is the result of the use of a cutoff limit, and in this case, a negative result does not exclude the presence of a drug or metabolite, but reflects it was not a sufficient amount to cross the cutoff limit.

Study Subject Selection

A total of 95 prospective subjects were recruited from the investigator's database (PRA Health Sciences, Salt Lake City, UT). Subjects accepted during the Screening Phase were men or nonpregnant, nonlactating women, aged 18 to 55 years, who were recreational opioid users, which was defined as use of opioids for nonmedical purposes (e.g. psychoactive effects) on at least 10 occasions during the past year and at least once in the 12 weeks prior to screening. Additionally, subjects were required to have a history of IN opioid use at least three times within the past year; however, they could not be physically dependent on or tolerant to opioids, alcohol, or other drugs (excepting caffeine and nicotine), based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision criteria. Physical dependence on opioids was assessed via a naloxone challenge test at the beginning of the Drug Discrimination Phase. Subjects were required to have a negative urine drug screen and alcohol breath test prior to dosing in the Drug Discrimination Phase and at each Treatment Phase visit; an exception was tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; e.g. cannabis), which could be negative or positive throughout the study, but could not change during the study (recent evidence suggests that THC does not affect subjects' ability to discriminate opioid from PBO). Prospective subjects testing positive for THC had to pass a targeted neurological exam to demonstrate that they were not cognitively impaired. Urine drug screens for all visits except the screening visit were completed using point-of-care, Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment (CLIA) waived, immunoassay drug screens (Alere iCup® Dx Drug Screen Cup, Alere Toxicology Services, Products Division, Portsmouth, VA, USA) without confirmation via mass spectrometry or quantification except in instances where THC tested positive via the urine drug screen.

### Cannabis use before and after metabolic and bariatric surgery: literature review [^115hEb93]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Legality and regulation of cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD) — As of April 2024, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I substance in the United States under the Controlled Substance Act and is considered illegal from a federal standpoint. State laws vary: currently, 24 states, two territories, and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational cannabis use, and 38 states have legalized cannabis for medical use. Depending on state laws, medical providers may not legally prescribe, but may recommend or certify medical cannabis use. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 legalized hemp (containing less than .3% THC) and its derivatives, including CBD, helping explain why CBD products can be purchased in commercial retail settings and online. Despite availability, CBD foods, beverages and supplements exist in a legal grey area and aren't held to safety or purity standards; a pharmacologic study tested a large sampling of commercially available CBD products and found one‑third mislabeled with a substantial fraction contaminated, with most mislabeling due to CBD potency exceeding label claims and one product containing over 500% of the labeled CBD content. By contrast, medical cannabis is prescribed or recommended for qualifying conditions and sold in state‑licensed dispensaries subject to state safety regulations, and some states set purchase limits such as Ohio's "whole day units" (e.g., 1/10 oz of dry plant material, or 110 mg of THC within edibles or tinctures).

### A urinary test procedure for identification of cannabidiol in patients undergoing medical therapy with marijuana [^113nQPS5]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Marijuana may have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties.

Unfortunately, properly conducted clinical trials are limited. The preponderance of reports are anecdotal or small studies. Patients have used, and will continue to use marijuana for relief of their medical problems. They will seek marijuana from legal dispensaries that predominantly provide psychotropic forms of marijuana. Perhaps 90% or more of these offerings are primarily for recreational use. Patients and physicians need facts to inform their choices among marijuana products. Formal study is needed in the clinical management of patients including evaluation of anti-inflammatory effectiveness, as well as pain alleviation. Use of opiates for chronic pain has led to increasing dosage over time; this may cause respiratory depression that can be fatal. In recognition of dangers associated with opiate treatment of chronic pain, the Medical Board of California offers physicians a coursein the use of opiates for severe persistent pain for what the Medical Board termed a serious public health crisis of addiction, overdose, and death. Is it feasible that the use of CBD or an optimal concentration of CBD and THC might have significant value in alleviating persistent, severe pain and therefore a diminished need for opiate use, either totally or in lower dosages? It is a responsibility that the medical community holds to provide such a benefit should studies determine marijuana can effectively relieve such pain with opioid sparing. The need for additional study is further indicated by reports of CBD competition for opiate receptor sites.

Limitations of this study include its small size and the lack of knowing the concentrations of the cannabinoids, THC, and CBD in the marijuana used.

### Ramelteon [^111iaV5N]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.2 Effect of Alcohol on Ramelteon

Alcohol by itself impairs performance and can cause sleepiness. Since the intended effect of ramelteon is to promote sleep, patients should be cautioned not to consume alcohol when using ramelteon [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. Use of the products in combination may have an additive effect.

7.3 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Ramelteon is not known to interfere with commonly used clinical laboratory tests. In addition, in vitro data indicate that ramelteon does not cause false-positive results for benzodiazepines, opiates, barbiturates, cocaine, cannabinoids, or amphetamines in two standard urine drug screening methods in vitro.

### A urinary test procedure for identification of cannabidiol in patients undergoing medical therapy with marijuana [^117Ue567]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Legalization has been heterogeneous. The uncertainties of both law and marijuana products inhibit physicians from recommending marijuana for medical care of patients and inhibit the systematic study of the use of marijuana in medical care. The physician's position is problematic in this conundrum, which has been called a "natural experiment".

However, as Leunghas depicted by two case scenarios, it is inevitable that marijuana has already entered into the practices of physicians, whether disclosed by patients or not. The number of patients entering into the practices of physicians may increase since it is likely "marijuana use will rise under legalization".

In the interests of supporting physicians and their patients in the use of medically effective forms of marijuana, as distinguished from recreational interests, we have adapted a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) procedure for the detection of CBD in urine. The intended use is as a tool for physicians to determine the major components of marijuana being used by a patient and whether that composition is primarily THC, CBD, or a combination of THC and CBD.

### The nephrologist's guide to cannabis and cannabinoids [^116hsfEb]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Dosing recommendations for cannabis and cannabinoid preparations have been previously published. Almost 90% of current adult cannabis use is in part or entirely for recreational reasons and slightly less than half is in part or entirely for medicinal purposes. CBD-infused oils, tinctures, creams, food items, and drinks, along with a host of other products, have exploded in popularity since the passage of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill), which removed hemp (Cannabis sativa with < 0.3% THC) from the Controlled Substances Act and legalized its domestic agricultural production as a commodity. CBD is sold in health food stores, retail shops, dispensaries, pharmacies, convenience stores, and on the internet. Already, 14% of Americans use CBD, primarily for pain, anxiety, insomnia, and arthritis. CBD is well tolerated, safe, and effective for a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions, although at high doses, CBD may increase liver enzymes and interact with some prescription medications. Consumers have easy access to a wide range of unregulated CBD products with inaccurate labeling and false health claims. A clinical guide on the therapeutic actions and safety of CBD and hemp oils has been recently published. In addition to CBD isolate, hemp extract may be marketed as 'full spectrum', which contains whole plant extract and a variety of compounds. Hemp seed oils are also sold but do not contain any phytocannabinoid compounds.

There is no evidence to suggest that CBD has any adverse effect on kidney function. In fact, CBD prevented cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in a mouse model by reducing oxidative stress. However, some products may contain toxic contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and solvents. A study of 84 CBD products sold online found that 42% of products contained more CBD than stated on the label, 26% were overlabeled, whereas only 31% contained the stated amount. Additionally, 20% of these products were contaminated with THC that could potentially be detected on a urine toxicology screen. Some products do not contain a sufficient quantity of CBD to achieve pharmacological activity.

Consumers should scrutinize labels, ensure that the product has been made with good manufacturing practice, ensure cannabinoid extraction using carbon dioxide, ensure organic certification by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and purchase from a certified medical dispensary or company that has a certificate of analysis. If CBD is regularly consumed, careful monitoring of clinical parameters and drug interactions is warranted.

### A urinary test procedure for identification of cannabidiol in patients undergoing medical therapy with marijuana [^112CUCBB]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

The assay adapted for use in our laboratory was reported by Bergamaschi et al. The sample is voided urine without preservative. The volume for testing is 2 mL. Samples are tested undiluted and diluted 10×. The method employs overnight (minimum 12 hours) hydrolysis by B-glucuronidase buffered with potassium phosphate at pH 6. This hydrolysis accounts for Phase II metabolism of CBD to CBD-glucuronide or CBD sulfate. The hydrolysis is followed by liquid–liquid extraction into hexane. The extract is concentrated, followed by derivatization by N, O-bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) to produce the trimethylsilyl derivatives.

The detection method is a GC/MS procedure performed on an Agilent 6890 GC (gas chromatography) coupled with an Agilent 5973 Mass Selective Detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The GC is equipped with a Zebron ZB-5 capillary column (5% phenyl–95% dimethylpolysiloxane liquid phase), 15 m, 0.25 mm internal diometer, 0.25 µm film thickness (Agilent Technologies). The GC uses a temperature ramp of 160°C–250°C at 25°C/min held for 1 minute. Quantitation occurs using the internal standard method.

5.13 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole Sodium with Methotrexate

Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Optimizing urine drug testing for monitoring medication compliance in pain management [^114zBTP9]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

It can be challenging to successfully monitor medication compliance in pain management. Clinicians and laboratorians need to collaborate to optimize patient care and maximize operational efficiency. The test menu, assay cutoffs, and testing algorithms utilized in the urine drug testing panels should be periodically reviewed and tailored to the patient population to effectively assess compliance and avoid unnecessary testing and cost to the patient.

Objective

Pain management and pathology collaborated on an important quality improvement initiative to optimize urine drug testing for monitoring medication compliance in pain management.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 18 months of data from our pain management center. We gathered data on test volumes, positivity rates, and the frequency of false positive results. We also reviewed the clinical utility of our testing algorithms, assay cutoffs, and adulterant panel. In addition, the cost of each component was calculated.

Results

The positivity rate for ethanol and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine were < 1% so we eliminated this testing from our panel. We also lowered the screening cutoff for cocaine to meet the clinical needs of the pain management center. In addition, we changed our testing algorithm for 6-acetylmorphine, benzodiazepines, and methadone. For example, due the high rate of false negative results using our immunoassay-based benzodiazepine screen, we removed the screening portion of the algorithm and now perform benzodiazepine confirmation up front in all specimens by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

Conclusion

Conducting an interdisciplinary quality improvement project allowed us to optimize our testing panel for monitoring medication compliance in pain management and reduce cost.

### Dose-dependent effects of oral cannabidiol and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol on serum anandamide and related N-acylethanolamines in healthy volunteers [^117H9KKy]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

CBD's poor oral bioavailability (estimated at 4%–6%) could explain why benefits and induced effects on AEA/NAEs require the high dosage, as 800 mg CBD exhibits a faster accrual, over 600 mg (figure 2A). This same rationale may also account for comparable effects towards AEA following Δ 9 -THC at different doses, where their accumulation rates and subsequent impact on AEA were similar (figure 2B). Analogous declines in AEA concentrations of the CSF have been reported in studies comparing heavy (> 10 times/month) to light (< 10 times/month) cannabis consumers without any diagnosis of psychopathology according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version IV (DSM-IV) criteria, as well as in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and higher consumption of cannabis in their lifetime (> 20 times/life) compared with those with no or sporadic use (< 5 occasions in their lifetime). However, it should be noted that in the latter study, a subgroup of high-frequency cannabis users with schizophrenia tested positive for urinary Δ 9 -THC still displayed elevated AEA in the CSF, though statistical significance was not reached. Therefore, the overall lower AEA levels in high-frequency cannabis users diagnosed with schizophrenia may not be attributed to recent cannabis use.

### Cannabinoid content and label accuracy of hemp-derived topical products available online and at national retail stores [^115vY17T]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are hemp-derived topical cannabinoid products available online and at national retailers accurately labeled for cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content?

Findings

In a case series of 105 topical cannabinoid products, 18% were overlabeled (> 10% less CBD than advertised), 58% were underlabeled (> 10% more CBD than advertised), and 24% were accurately labeled for CBD; THC was detected in 35% of products (all contained less than 0.3% THC, the legal limit for hemp). Products often made therapeutic or cosmetic claims.

Meaning

These findings suggest that improved regulatory oversight of cannabis and hemp products is needed to ensure quality assurance, deter misleading health claims, and potentially prevent unwanted drug effects among consumers.

### A urinary test procedure for identification of cannabidiol in patients undergoing medical therapy with marijuana [^115PJigC]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Marijuana is classified by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) as Schedule I, drugs having no accepted medical value. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana. This conflict inhibits physicians from prescribing marijuana and the systematic study of marijuana in medical care. This study concerns the use of the clinical laboratory as a resource for physicians recommending cannabidiol (CBD) to patients, or for patients using medical marijuana. Marijuana containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is psychoactive. CBD is not psychoactive. CBD is reported to have medical benefit for seizure control, neurologic disorders including multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain and pain associated with cancer. Use of opiates leads to increasing dosage over time that may cause respiratory depression. The Medical Board of California has termed this a serious public health crisis of addiction, overdose, and death. Is it feasible that CBD might alleviate persistent, severe pain and therefore diminished opiate use? Further study is needed to determine medical effectiveness of CBD including the effect on concurrent opiate therapy due to competition for receptor sites. This study is the application of a gas chromatography mass spectrometry procedure adapted for use in our laboratory, to detect CBD in urine. The intended use is as a tool for physicians to assess that marijuana being used by a patient is of a composition likely to be medically effective. A law ensuring physicians freedom from federal prosecution would provide confidence essential to formal study of medical uses of marijuana and treatment of clinical problems. Detection of CBD in a urine sample would be a convenient test for such confirmation.

### Bridging THC knowledge gaps for safer roads: a call for action [^116kM9Vc]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Per se limits

Several states (Illinois, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington) employ per se limits that set blood THC thresholds at 1, 2, or 5 ng/mL to define impairment. While this mirrors the approach used for alcohol, this method is not fully validated and has faced criticism for its inaccuracy. Our recently published work evaluating these limits in oral cannabis users found that the 1 ng/mL threshold was particularly ineffective, while the effectiveness of the 2 and 5 ng/mL thresholds remains unclear due to insufficient data linking blood levels to actual impairment.

Also, as previously discussed, THC blood concentrations correlate poorly with impairment for several PK/PD factors. First, consumption methods affect THC PK: oral users produce higher levels of the psychoactive metabolite 11‐OH‐THC while showing lower THC levels compared to smokers, potentially causing false negatives for oral users under per se limits. Second, frequent users maintain detectable THC blood levels for up to 30 days, creating a high risk of false positives. Third, the disconnect between blood concentrations and cognitive effects makes it challenging to establish appropriate per se thresholds to accurately capture acute impairment. Therefore, using blood THC levels alone as evidence for cannabis DUI may not provide a fair basis for conviction.

Sampling and testing limitations

While alcohol can be reliably measured through roadside breath testing, the current gold standard for THC assessment is a blood test. The time delay between a traffic stop and blood collection could affect THC blood concentration. Depending on the route of administration and formulation type, THC's rapid distribution and disconnect between PK and PD mean that the blood concentrations at testing might not accurately reflect the degree of impairment at the time of the traffic stop.

### Rational urine drug monitoring in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain: consensus recommendations [^1161517b]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and Recommendations

Question 1: Which UDM Test(s) Should Be Used and in Which Patients Prescribed Opioids for Chronic Pain Should the Tests Be Used According to a Medical Literature Review, Clinical Experience, Clinical Chemistry of Drug Testing, and Practical Considerations?

Expert Panel Recommendations

Use definitive UDM testing (e.g. with GC-MS, LC-MS, or LC-MS/MS) as the most accurate method for assessing baseline opioid use and opioid misuse in almost all patients with chronic pain being considered for opioids as well as for ongoing monitoring of patients receiving opioids for chronic pain, unless presumptive testing is required by institutional or payer policies. A rational approach to choosing the most relevant analytes (i.e. substances to be tested) for UDM testing is proposed (in the Expert Panel Discussion section for question 1) and should be documented by the clinician.

Existing Guidelines

In contrast to this expert panel's recommendation, previously published guidelines suggest that patients undergo presumptive testing with immunoassay when they are prescribed opioids for chronic pain; some guidelines specify that the test should be POC. Confirmatory definitive tests are generally reserved for resolving unexpected results from immunoassays or for detecting specific opioids that cannot be identified with standard immunoassays. According to the CDC, CMS, and other payer policies, definitive testing is appropriate only when it affects clinical decision-making and patient management. The Washington State guidelines suggest considering the following drugs for a UDM panel in addition to medications prescribed: alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, fentanyl, methadone, opiates, and oxycodone.

### How high can patients get on CBD? [^115ETG37]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

The treatment phase should consist of at least 1 dose of a positive control used in the qualification phase with at least 3 doses of the drug being tested. As such, the treatment phase in this study included the same drugs from the qualification phase with 2 different doses of dronabinol (10 and 30 mg) and 3 dose of CBD (750, 1500, and 4500 mg). Cannabidiol tested similar to placebo or lower than positive controls on pharmacodynamics tests. Earlier studies compared THC and CBD products in known marijuana users. Results are consistent in that a combination product (nabiximol: 4, 8, and 16 consecutive sprays or 10.8, 21.6, and 43.2 mg THC with 10, 20, and 40 mg CBD, respectively) performed similarly to positive controls most likely reflecting the THC content in the tested product, and purified CBD products were similar to placebo. A comparison in marijuana users is logical; however, the highest dose of CBD tested was 800 mg and comparisons were not made to other commonly abused classes of drugs. Where the Bababuis study does include potential doses used in the clinic, it did not fulfill the guidance recommendation for the testing of supratherapeutic doses (2–3 times the highest dose considered therapeutic). The design used in the Schoedel 2018 paper includes 3 doses of purified CBD that cover doses considered to be in the therapeutic range (750 mg), a high therapeutic dose (1500 mg), and a supratherapeutic dose (4500 mg). The 4500 mg dose represents a dose that was tolerated as a single dose in a prior study. It is thought that the higher doses represent the likelihood of CBD to be overused or misused by patients or help determine if the drug may become a target for drug diversion in general. The study also included some pharmacokinetic assessments of CBD and THC and their respective metabolites in approximately 39 patients. There is some evidence of potential saturation in absorption in CBD at higher CBD concentrations based on mean Cmax and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) values; however, the variation in concentrations was relatively high. Several factors such as formulation (liquid vs capsule) and how the drug is administered (with or without food) can contribute to concentration variability. In this study, drug administration was standardized and given under fasting conditions. Although fasting conditions may decrease exposure, the observed saturation at the higher CBD doses suggests that patients achieved maximum exposure of CBD. There was also confirmation of very low concentrations of THC and metabolites (< 0.6 ng/mL for THC and 11-OH-THC, < 5 mg/mL for 11-COOH-THC) in the purified CBD product. The safety profile was relatively good overall.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^112ATx2J]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Urine detection window and sample integrity — It takes approximately 2 hours after use for a substance to be detected in urine, and the window of detection for most substances of interest is 1–3 days and up to 4 days in some cases, with duration dependent on factors such as fluid intake and urinary pH. Urine is the specimen most prone to sample tampering, and UDT can be circumvented through sample substitution, dilution and adulteration. A substituted sample replaces the patient's urine with another sample, either urine or some other liquid; diluting a urine sample makes it less likely that a drug or its metabolite(s) can be detected above the cutoff threshold of an immunoassay test; and adulteration uses a masking agent that destroys the presence of drugs in urine or interferes with the enzymatic reactivity of an immunoassay test.

5.12 Interference with Urine Screen for THC

There have been reports of false-positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs, including Pantoprazole [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.13 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate

Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Urinary 11-nor-9-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol elimination in adolescent and young adult cannabis users during one month of sustained and biochemically-verified abstinence [^1141xJCU]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite adolescents and young adults being the most frequent users of cannabis, all information on cannabis drug testing interpretation is based on data from adults.

Aims

This study aimed to define the time course of urinary 11-nor-9-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) excretion among 70 adolescent and young adult cannabis users during 1 month of biochemically-verified cannabis abstinence.

Methods

Urine specimens were collected at non-abstinent baseline and after 2, 3, 8, 15, 21 and 28 days of abstinence. Specimens were tested for THCCOOH with a 'rapid' immunoassay drug test and a confirmatory assay using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, with a 5 ng/mL limit of quantitation. Elimination rate was tested using a population pharmacokinetics model.

Results/Outcomes

Participants had an average of 26 days of abstinence (SD = 6). Initial creatinine-adjusted THCCOOH concentration (CN-THCCOOH) was 148 ng/mg (SD = 157). Half-life was 2 days (SD = 5), with a 10-day window of detection (estimated range: 4–80 days). At the final timepoint and among those with > 25 days of abstinence (n = 62), 40% (n = 25) had THCCOOH concentrations > 5 ng/mL (i.e. detectable on confirmatory assay) and 19% (n = 12) were 'positive' per federal drug testing guidelines (i.e. values greater than 50 ng/mL on the screening immunoassay and 15 ng/mL on the confirmatory assay). More frequent past month cannabis use was associated with higher baseline CN-THCCOOH concentrations, but not with rate of elimination. Nested five-fold cross-validation suggested high model reliability and predictive validity.

Conclusions/Interpretation

Findings underscore that, as with adults, detectable cannabinoid metabolites do not necessarily indicate recent use in adolescents and young adults. Algorithms that account for THCCOOH levels, assessed longitudinally and time between specimen collections are best equipped to confirm abstinence.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^117GyKXv]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Screening versus confirmation — cutoffs and clinical interpretation: A common practice in testing is to first screen samples using an inexpensive test to rule out likely negative samples and then confirm potential positive results using a highly specific test. When using a cutoff, a negative result does not exclude the presence of a drug or metabolite in a sample, but reflects it was not a sufficient amount to cross the cutoff limit. Screening tests often use cutoffs chosen to minimize the incidence of false positives, which consequently increases the incidence of false negatives. Many laboratories and point of care tests (POCTs) use screening cutoff levels intended for workplace or law enforcement drug testing, and these cutoffs may not be appropriate for clinical use. Providers should know the cutoff concentration used for an immunoassay when interpreting a presumptive or definitive test result of "no drug present".

Purpose and triggers for definitive urine drug testing (UDT) clarify that "Presumptive UDT is typically requested by a clinician caring for a patient when there is a need for swift access to results that can be promptly integrated into the clinical evaluation and treatment decisions", whereas "Definitive UDT is considered justifiable and essential when the clinical context provides strong support for the need for comprehensive testing". Situations include when "There's a requirement to identify a specific substance or metabolite not adequately detected by a presumptive UDT screen", the need "to definitively pinpoint specific drugs within a broad drug category", identification of agents such as "fentanyl, meperidine, synthetic cannabinoids, and other synthetic or analog drugs" that "aren't typically detected by presumptive UDT", when "Precise drug concentrations are needed to guide patient management (e.g., discontinuing THC use as part of a treatment plan)", when "A presumptive UDT result contradicts a patient's self-report, clinical presentation, medical history, or current prescribed pain medication plan", when "There's a need to eliminate the possibility of an error as the cause of a presumptive UDT result", when "Non-prescribed medication or illicit substance use needs to be identified for the safe ongoing prescribing or other interventions", and because "Definitive UDT is essential for conducting a thorough assessment of medication effectiveness, side effects, or potential drug interactions". The decision "should be guided by patient-specific considerations", and "the clinician's rationale for ordering definitive UDT and the chosen tests must be documented in the patient's medical record".

### Medical marijuana laws and workplace fatalities in the United States [^115KHCdy]. ACOEM (2018). Medium credibility.

Legalization of cannabis – impairment and testing limitations states that "ACOEM unambiguously states that cannabis products have the capacity to negatively affect judgment, motor coordination, reaction times, and driving ability", yet "to date there is no consistent definition of a dose or blood concentration of cannabis at which impairment begins or ends". In this context, "Taking that into account, urine testing is not a measure of impairment, it is only an indicator of past use", and "Although there are ways to measure impairment, well-validated tools are not readily available or easy to implement in the workplace and at present are more useful in research settings". Reflecting product variability, "Unlike Federal Drug Administration approved medications which have identified active component(s), a known side effect profile, a scientifically identified half-life and specific dose and dosing interval, these characteristics are not identified nor consistent between cannabis products". Accordingly, "ACOEM is advocating for increased research and collaboration between all stakeholders in defining and/or measuring the impairment risks of cannabis products use as it relates to the workplace".

Second, the quantitative level of THC‐COOH in urine can be obtained to corroborate self‐reported continuous abstinence. It also predicts withdrawal symptoms, CUD severity, tolerance to the acute effects of cannabis and level of cognitive impairment. The level of THC‐COOH in urine can also be used to confirm regular cannabis use status in chronic users, where residual circulating levels of cannabinoids from chronic use can be detected up to 4 weeks after last use. Therefore, the level of THC‐COOH in urine is recommended for use in experimental, neuroimaging and cognitive studies as a way of corroborating current cannabis use or abstinence. It can also be used to examine the quantity of THC exposure such as in clinical trials of CUD. It cannot sensitively measure the duration of abstinence because of the long half‐life of THC and individual differences in metabolism. Its major limitations are that it requires access and costs of laboratory facilities and analyses, it requires multiple samples and creatinine normalisation for reliable testing and does not offer an immediate test result, unlike rapid, qualitative testing. Therefore, it is particularly well suited to research settings where detailed assessment of cannabis exposure is required. Often, drug testing programs will integrate the use of both qualitative and quantitative urine THC‐COOH testing.

Third, the quantitative level of THC in saliva is a proxy of recent cannabis exposure that has been associated with cognitive function and driving performance. Limitations of this measure include uncertainty of time of last exposure and risk of contamination of the buccal area (e.g. food). It may be used in experimental, neuroimaging and cognitive studies investigating how recent cannabis use affects acute drug effects, brain function and cognition.

Fourth, THC, THC‐COOH or 11‐OH‐THC in plasma provide precise and reliable quantitation of THC consumption and metabolism. Measuring these involves taking a blood sample and quantifying THC or its metabolites either in that sample, or using a centrifuge to extract plasma for analysis. As a more invasive measure, it may reduce compliance levels. It is recommended for use in settings where rigorous checking of THC and other cannabinoid levels is required. THC in plasma can be used to confirm recent exposure to THC in experimental studies with acute cannabinoid administration. Interpretation of results showing THC levels in blood can be more complicated in sober chronic users and people exposed to environmental cannabis smoke.

### Clinical and cognitive improvement following full-spectrum, high-cannabidiol treatment for anxiety: open-label data from a two-stage, phase 2 clinical trial [^11531pRq]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study design and participants

This study was approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board (IRB) and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients provided written informed consent to voluntarily participate in study procedures. As stipulated in our IRB-approved protocol, analyses from the open-label stage were required before initiating the double-blind stage of the study in order to ensure clinical efficacy at the selected dose. Study enrollment was completed at McLean Hospital between June 2018–February 2020. The study timeline included a baseline visit with weekly check-in visits during the 4-week trial (5 visits total). Participants were compensated $350 for completing the study.

Outpatients reporting at least moderate levels of anxiety, defined as ≥ 16 on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)or ≥ 11 on the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS)at baseline, were recruited from the New England area through online advertisements and social media postings. Patients were required to have a stable pharmacotherapeutic regimen with no changes in the past three months. History of previous cannabis and cannabinoid use was assessed using a modified version of the Timeline Followback, which queried both recreational and medical cannabis use. For this assessment, we specified that the term cannabis referred to marijuana, hemp, CBD, or any cannabinoid-containing product. To minimize effects of previous cannabinoid exposure, patients were required to be either cannabis naïve (< 15 lifetime uses) or abstinent from regular use (defined as > 1x/month) for ≥ 1 year prior to their baseline visit. Patients provided urine samples at each visit which were assessed using CLIA-waived drug assays. At baseline, patients were required to test negative for metabolites of Δ−9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary intoxicating constituent in cannabis. At follow-up visits, positive urine samples were sent to an outside laboratory for quantification of THC metabolites (results already published). Additionally, patients were asked about their substance use at weekly check-in visits throughout the 4-week trial. Patients were disqualified from the trial if they endorsed use of any cannabis/cannabinoid-based products other than the study product. Full inclusion/exclusion criteria are provided in Fig. 1. The open-label stage was initially designed to assess 16 patients in order to assess efficacy, safety, and dosing for the double-blind stage; however, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent prohibition of in-person visits for research studies resulted in early termination of the open-label stage. At the time enrollment closed for the open-label arm, 15 patients had already been enrolled and complete data was available for 14 patients.

Introduction

A growing market of medical cannabis products claim to have specific Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) content, but regulation of THC and CBD content is inconsistent across states and generally weak. To examine the association between medical cannabis product use and exposure to THC and CBD, we quantified levels of THC, CBD, and their metabolites in urine of participants in a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier) of medical cannabis in Massachusetts.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^111YovYR]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ASAM appropriate use of drug testing — presumptive and definitive tests — states that presumptive testing should be a routine part of initial and ongoing patient assessment and should be used when it is a priority to have more immediate (although less accurate) results. Providers should know the cutoff threshold concentrations their laboratory uses when interpreting a report of "no drug present", and federal cutoff threshold concentrations used for occupational testing are not appropriate for clinical use. Definitive testing techniques should be used whenever a provider wants to detect specific substances not identified by presumptive methods, quantify levels of the substance present, and refine the accuracy of the results, and definitive testing should be used when the results inform clinical decisions with major clinical or non-clinical implications for the patient. If a patient disputes presumptive findings, a definitive test should be done, and when ordering a definitive test, providers should advise the laboratory if specific substances are suspected. Because not all laboratories automatically perform "reflex" testing of positive presumptive results, providers should be aware that a specific order may be required for definitive testing.

Alcohol by itself impairs performance and can cause sleepiness. Since the intended effect of ROZEREM is to promote sleep, patients should be cautioned not to consume alcohol when using ROZEREM [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. Use of the products in combination may have an additive effect.

7.3 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

ROZEREM is not known to interfere with commonly used clinical laboratory tests.

Do not co-administer with atazanavir or nelfinavir (7.1)
Concomitant warfarin use may require monitoring (7.2)
May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability (7.3)
May produce false-positive urine screen for THC (7.4)

7.1 Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy

Concomitant use of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir or nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir or nelfinavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of drug resistance.

7.2 Coumarin Anticoagulants

There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including PROTONIX, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.

7.3 Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability

Pantoprazole causes long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts).

7.4 False Positive Urine Tests for THC

There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results.

Workplace urine drug testing for an inactive THC metabolite is common in both federally regulated and non-regulated drug testing. A positive result does not document impairment, or even recent use, when impairment is likely the most important parameter being searched for by the drug testing procedure. Most cannabinoid testing does not detect imported synthetics.

### A urinary test procedure for identification of cannabidiol in patients undergoing medical therapy with marijuana [^115wHWyb]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

The following ions are used to quantitate and identify (qualify) the compounds: internal standard (CBD-D3): quantitation: 393, qualifier: 461; CBD: quantitation: 390, qualifiers: 458, 443. The linearity of the assay is 2–100 ng/mL. The limit of detection of the assay is 2 ng/mL. Results are normalized to urine creatinine determined using the Jaffe method.

Two different groups were studied. Group I consisted of specimens from individuals who were submitted for drug screening and confirmation if positive. Forty depersonalized samples were randomly selected from the confirmed positives. The study of the samples in this group was intended to demonstrate that the assay for urine CBD was negative for individuals using THC-rich marijuana. Group II consisted of the study of 15 volunteers who used CBD or CBD-rich marijuana as follows: 12 marijuana using volunteers who agreed to a one time use of a CBD-rich oil capsule; one volunteer used a CBD-rich, THC-poor cigarette; one volunteer used a commercially produced CBD-rich oil capsule; one volunteer used commercially produced herbal (hemp) extract. The study of samples in this group was intended to demonstrate that the assay for urine CBD was positive for individuals known to use CBD-rich marijuana. All samples were also tested for THC by assaying for the metabolite, carboxy-THC.

A single volunteer was studied to develop a time profile of the detection time of urinary CBD postdose.

### Using measured cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites in urine to differentiate marijuana use from consumption of commercial cannabidiol products [^112AbbF9]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Detecting marijuana use is a component of most urine drug screens targeting a single Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol metabolite. Recently, the non-intoxicating cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), has gained popular acceptance for a myriad of reasons. Commercially available CBD products sold without purity regulations have become ubiquitous. Many products contain trace tetrahydrocannabinol. Long-term or high dose use of CBD products can result in tetrahydrocannabinol exposures, potentially producing a positive marijuana drug test. These results are not false positives since marijuana biomarkers are present, but inaccurately identify donors as marijuana users. Addressing this conundrum, we developed an assay discriminating marijuana use from the use of CBD contaminated with tetrahydrocannabinol.

Methods

Following the synthesis of a primary CBD metabolite, a LC-MS/MS assay was developed measuring the urinary metabolites tetrahydrocannabinol, 11-nor-carboxy-Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol, CBD, and 7-carboxy-cannabidiol. The assay was utilized on 425 patients claiming CBD use, and sixteen samples from trusted users of commercial CBD products.

Results and Discussion

Clear data clusters enabled metabolic cut-points assignments. Forty-three percent of samples contained CBD metabolites in ten-fold excess to tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites which was then used as a set point to classify donors as CBD users. An excess of tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites classify donors as marijuana users. Additionally, urine samples were procured from donors personally known to use commercial CBD ad libitum, yet abstain from tetrahydrocannabinol. Results from trusted users substantiated the use of the resulting metabolic ratios despite 11-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol measured in 75% of these samples.

Conclusion

A method has been developed and utilized to distinguish marijuana use from tetrahydrocannabinol exposure from contaminated CBD use.

### A urinary test procedure for identification of cannabidiol in patients undergoing medical therapy with marijuana [^115XXJ2e]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Marijuana is classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule I controlled substance. Marijuana is complex, having some 480 natural components and more than 100 cannabinoids. Of the cannabinoids, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most prevalent cannabinoids, respectively. The plant, marijuana, and its components are classified as Schedule I. Exceptions are the synthetic cannabinoids, dronabinol (Marinol), a Schedule III compound, and nabilone, which is Schedule II. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a substance having "no currently accepted medical use in the USA, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse". A few examples of drugs included in the Schedule I list, in addition to marijuana, are heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide, 3,4-methylenedioxym-ethylamphetamine (ecstasy), and peyote. Paradoxically, 23 states and the District of Columbiahave recognized that marijuana has therapeutic benefits and have considered the risk for abuse as an acceptable level of risk. Additionally, 17 states have approved CBD for medical use. This change in the legal status has been substantially driven by voter referendum rather than by scientific studies that have been described as "thin and conflicting". Effectively, this means that these initiatives have been the result of personal choices rather than systematic law based on a substantial body of accepted medical evidence.

### The effects of adulterants and selected ingested compounds on drugs-of-abuse testing in urine [^117A4wZJ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Household chemicals such as bleach, table salt, laundry detergent, toilet bowl cleaner, vinegar, lemon juice, and eyedrops are used for adulterating urine specimens. Most of these adulterants except eyedrops can be detected by routine specimen integrity tests (creatinine, pH, temperature, and specific gravity); however, certain adulterants such as Klear, Whizzies, Urine Luck, and Stealth cannot. These adulterants can successfully mask drug testing if the concentrations of certain abused drugs are moderate. Several spot tests have been described to detect the presence of such adulterants in urine. Urine dipsticks are commercially available for detecting the presence of such adulterants, along with performance of tests for creatinine, pH, and specific gravity. Certain hair shampoo and saliva-cleaning mouthwashes are available to escape detection in hair or saliva samples, but the effectiveness of such products in masking drugs-of-abuse testing has not been demonstrated. Ingestion of poppy seed cake may result in positive screening test results for opiates, and hemp oil exposure can cause positive results for marijuana. These would be identified as true-positive results in drugs-of-abuse testing even though they do not represent the actual drug of abuse.

### An assessment of urine THC immunoassay in healthy volunteers receiving an oral proton-pump inhibitor [^114HBRia]. Clinical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Limitations of urine drug-screening (UDS) by immunoassay include false-positive results. Pantoprazole, a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), is reported to cause false-positive results for THC on UDS. The objective of this study was to determine if oral PPIs cause false-positive THC results using the THC One Step Marijuana Test Strip ®. Methods: Eligible healthy volunteers completed a 5-day course of a PPI followed by urine testing using the THC One Step Marijuana Test Strip ®. Phase one included 3 subjects taking pantoprazole 40mg once daily for 5days. On day 5, urine specimens underwent THC screening. Phase two included 9 subjects randomized to 5-day supply of once-daily oral esomeprazole 20mg, lansoprazole 15mg, or omeprazole 20mg. All study methods and testing mirrored those in phase one. Results: All 12 subjects completed the study protocol. All urine samples collected on day 5 were negative for THC in all subjects. Discussion: Our results demonstrate that oral PPIs did not cause a false-positive THC using the THC One Step Marijuana Test Strip ®. Limitations include small sample size, use of a single commercial immunoassay, and inability to confirm medication compliance. Further, large-scale research using other commercial urine immunoassays is warranted.

### Rational urine drug monitoring in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain: consensus recommendations [^114qvrhb]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Alcohol Screening

For patients with a substance use disorder, alcohol may be problematic and prohibited in any amount; for other patients with chronic pain, only high-risk alcohol use (e.g. binge drinking) is a concern. Many opioids include black box warnings about the concurrent use of alcohol because of the potential for fatal overdose. One reviewed guideline recommends screening for alcohol with UDM in patients with chronic pain; ethyl glucuronide, ethyl sulfate, or ethanol in UDM indicates alcohol use. As a caveat, immunoassay and definitive UDM may not differentiate between alcoholic beverages and alcohol-containing medications, mouthwashes, and hand sanitizers. Instead of UDM, the panelists recommend the SISQ "How many times in the past year have you had (five or more drinks [men], four or more drinks [women]) in a day?" from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism to identify unhealthy alcohol use, as this question is simple to administer and is validated. In primary care settings, the sensitivity of the alcohol SISQ for identifying alcohol use disorder is 88%, and the specificity is 84%.

Cannabis Screening

Practices for cannabis screening vary; individual prescribers can decide whether detecting cannabis by UDM is appropriate by consulting local laws and common practice, as well as by considering the advantages/disadvantages discussed below. At the time of this publication, cannabis is federally illegal (i.e. classified by the US Drug Enforcement Administration as Schedule 1 under the Controlled Substances Act), but several states have passed legislation to decriminalize it for medical and/or recreational use. The CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain indicates that the clinical implications of a positive UDM result for cannabis are uncertain; the VA/US Department of Defense guidelines estimate the length of time it can be detected in urine; and the Washington State guidelines suggest implementing an office policy for patients who use cannabis. These guidelines and this consensus report do not provide formal graded recommendations for or against UDM screening for cannabis or for interpretation of the results.

### Variation in cannabinoid metabolites present in the urine of adults using medical cannabis products in Massachusetts [^114uDCUT]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

Ninety-seven participants (mean [SD] age, 39.6 [14.74] years; 65 women [67.01%]) provided 256 urine samples meeting the criteria for analysis. Participants were light users at baseline (53% used less than monthly). After baseline, 39% to 47% used 3 to 4 days per week, 15% to 20% used 5 to 6 days per week, and 29% to 45% used daily.

At least 1 cannabis metabolite was detected in 220 samples (85.9%) (Table 1). Among participants who reported using CBD-dominant or equal CBD-THC products, there was no detectable CBD metabolite in 10 samples (30.3%) and 20 samples (37.0%), respectively (Table 2). THC was detected in 26 samples (78.8%) from participants reporting use of CBD-dominant products. Among samples from participants reporting THC-dominant or equal CBD-THC products, no THC metabolites were present in 13 samples (10.9%) and 19 samples (35.2%), respectively.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^117PxL3x]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Urine testing for specific substances — addiction treatment emphasizes that urine testing for the use of alcohol is appropriate with current clinical tools and that EtG is an appropriate target metabolite when monitoring a patient for complete alcohol abstinence; ethanol-containing products, including hand sanitizers and mouthwash, should be avoided before an EtG test; urine testing is helpful when assessing amphetamine use and particular caution should be paid to the interpretation of amphetamine immunoassays due to known limitations in specificity; urine testing is helpful when assessing benzodiazepine use and particular caution should be paid to the interpretation of benzodiazepine immunoassays due to known limitations in specificity; immunoassay results should be used cautiously when monitoring a patient's adherence to prescribed benzodiazepines, and if a patient reports taking the medication but the screening test is negative, further analysis is needed; urine testing is helpful when assessing opioid use and particular caution should be paid to the interpretation of opiate immunoassays due to known limitations in specificity, and patients should be instructed to avoid the consumption of food items that contain poppy seeds because they can result in a positive opiate test; urine testing is helpful when assessing cannabis use, although it is difficult to determine the timing or cessation of consumption in chronic users due to extended windows of detection for THC.

### Variation in cannabinoid metabolites present in the urine of adults using medical cannabis products in Massachusetts [^117SMaWB]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Among adults using medical cannabis frequently and recently, THC and CBD metabolite concentrations in urine often differed from expected exposure. Approximately one-third of samples from people reporting using CBD-dominant products contained no measurable CBD metabolite. Nearly 1 in 5 samples from those using vaped cannabis contained no detectable cannabinoids. There were no dose-metabolite associations for vaped products. This may indicate that vaping devices may not heat cannabis products appropriately, and US Food and Drug Administration–approved devices may deliver more consistent cannabinoid exposure. Product and delivery method variability present challenges to assessing the efficacy and safety of medical cannabis.

Methodological limitations of this study include participant-determined doses, possible errors in self-report, no analysis of the cannabis products themselves, and individual differences in rate of absorption and metabolism. Products were purchased in Greater Boston dispensaries, so results may not generalize to regions with different regulations.

The findings of this cohort study are consistent with those of a studyof cannabis products purchased in California and Washington, in which more than one-half of products were incorrectly labeled. These findings indicate that adults using medical cannabis products may have incomplete or incorrect information regarding expected cannabinoid exposure from these purchased products, impeding informed patient choice and investigation of pharmacologic and therapeutic properties of cannabis products.

### Urine drug screening: a valuable office procedure [^111ffj2E]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Urine drug screening can enhance workplace safety, monitor medication compliance, and detect drug abuse. Ordering and interpreting these tests requires an understanding of testing modalities, detection times for specific drugs, and common explanations for false-positive and false-negative results. Employment screening, federal regulations, unusual patient behavior, and risk patterns may prompt urine drug screening. Compliance testing may be necessary for patients taking controlled substances. Standard immunoassay testing is fast, inexpensive, and the preferred initial test for urine drug screening. This method reliably detects morphine, codeine, and heroin; however, it often does not detect other opioids such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, fentanyl, buprenorphine, and tramadol. Unexpected positive test results should be confirmed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry or high-performance liquid chromatography. A positive test result reflects use of the drug within the previous one to three days, although marijuana can be detected in the system for a longer period of time. Careful attention to urine collection methods can identify some attempts by patients to produce false-negative test results.

Discussion of Current Literature

Current Evidence for CBD and Pain

When looking at the current literature, it is evident, that well-controlled studies investigating the effects of CBD on pain are currently not available. However, some literature is starting to investigate its effects. For example, a well-controlled study of purified CBD has demonstrated that CBD has low abuse potential, even within sensitive populations. In a preclinical study, CBD use has also been attributed to reducing drug-seeking behavior in mice. These positive results have brought up discussions about the role of CBD in combating the world's opioid epidemic. While studies have investigated the combined use of fentanyl with CBD, the results were inconclusive and currently the impact of CBD on opioids is not known. Another recent study was investigating the role that CBD plays on craving behavior in abstinent individuals with heroin use disorder. This study shows that CBD doses (Epidiolex) of 400 mg and 800 mg were able reduce craving and anxiety induced by heroin's cues compared to placebo. However, while the CBD doses of 400 mg and 800 mg are relevant from a pharmacologic and therapeutic perspective, these doses vastly exceed the regularly commercially available hemp-CBD products which may present cost challenges as Epidiolex therapy is around $16,000/year. Several manuscripts review the current state of knowledge and point out important questions. Specifically, could CBD have a role in addressing the national opioid crisis?, Conversely, the data supporting THC as an analgesic and for opioid-sparing effects is more robust, specifically for neuropathic pain. The known benefit of THC for pain raises the question of whether the small THC component in some products was responsible for perceived analgesic effects and reduction of pain medications in our cohort, further highlighting the uncertainty of product content/potency consumed by respondents.

### A urinary test procedure for identification of cannabidiol in patients undergoing medical therapy with marijuana [^112quLns]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Patients coming to a physician bring their medical problems as well as their lifestyles including the use of marijuana. It may be helpful in the therapeutic management of patients being treated with marijuana or marijuana extracts, for the physician to have knowledge of the major cannabinoids present in the marijuana used by the patient. This information may not be forthcoming from the patient and the patient who discloses marijuana use may not have specific information with regard to the cannabinoid content of the marijuana used. This assay, particularly in combination with an assay for the THC metabolite, informs the physician of the principle cannabinoids present in the marijuana used. This information may be helpful to the physician in seeking the balance of benefits vs risksfor a patient using, or wishing to use marijuana for medical therapy. The patient using marijuana for relief of chronic pain may have an altered response to opioids prescribed for pain relief. Opioid sparing has been reported and there may be opportunity to achieve lowered dosage of opioids or avoiding the use of opioids. This is important since opioid therapy may have serious consequences up to and including death due to respiratory depression. Marijuana receptors are not present in the brainstem where the center for respiration is located and for this reason marijuana does not cause respiratory death. The presence of CBD or the combination of CBD and carboxy-THC in voided urine is consistent with primary medical intent for use of marijuana. Presence of carboxy-THC is consistent with either primary recreational intent or medical intent. It remains for the physician to determine the significance of marijuana use in medical management of the patient with consideration of the cannabinoids present in urine.

5.13 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole Sodium with Methotrexate

Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is described as "a non-FDA approved agent readily available and sold in stores, gas stations and online", made from hemp-derived CBD and "unregulated by the federal government and is not considered illegal", producing "a mild high" and being "considered weaker than delta 9 THC". Mechanistically, it "mimics many delta 9 THC's partial agonist activities at CB 1, and CB 2 cannabinoid receptors", is "about half as potent as delta 9 THC", and is "metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system through dual pathways CYP2C9, CYP3A4". Reported adverse effects include "intention tremor, anxiety, euphoria, time distortion, dry mouth, paresthesia, and tinnitus" as well as "increased heart rate, red eyes, dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, sedation, visual images", and "on testing for THC, delta 8 will cause a positive test", while potential benefits noted are that "Delta 8 does prevent nausea and vomiting in cancer therapy and can also boost appetite". Safety and quality concerns are emphasized: "cannabis is considered one of the top 10 most addictive drugs"; Delta-8-THC occurs in "very low concentrations in THC or CBD" so production is synthetic and "involves refluxing CBD in an organic solvent, such as toluene or heptane, with p-Toluenesulfonic acid or another acid or heavy metal that serves as a catalyst", often by people who "are not chemists and merely follow directions found on Reddit or YouTube", and "the FDA reports adverse events" though "they do not seem to be common".

### Urinary tetrahydrocannabinol after 4 weeks of a full-spectrum, high-cannabidiol treatment in an open-label clinical trial [^115XdGdd]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Methods

This study was approved by the Partners Healthcare institutional review board, and all participants provided written informed consent. Study enrollment was conducted at McLean Hospital between June 2018 and February 2020. Participants were required to be 18 years or older, report at least moderate levels of anxiety assessed using well-validated measures, and test negative at baseline for 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH), a major metabolite of Δ9-THC. Patients did not use cannabis and could not use any other cannabis/cannabinoid–based products throughout the 4-week trial. Women were required to have a negative pregnancy test result. Exclusion criteria included serious medical illness (eg, kidney or liver disease, neurological disorder). The open-label phase was capped at 15 participants to determine dosing and tolerability. The CONSORT guidelines were followed. A protocol is available in the Supplement.

The study product was formulated using a full-spectrum, high-CBD extract containing 9.97 mg/mL of CBD (1.04%) and 0.23 mg/mL of Δ9-THC (0.02%), as confirmed by ProVerde Laboratories. Patients self-administered 1 mL of the study product sublingually 3 times per day, for a targeted daily dose of approximately 30 mg of CBD and less than 1 mg of Δ9-THC. The actual dosage was quantified using outgoing vs incoming bottle weights, cross-referenced with weekly drug diaries. Urine drug assays (a 12-panel test, waived by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) assessed the presence of THC-COOH, which was confirmed via gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Quest Diagnostics). Exploratory logistic regression analyses (SPSS version 25 [IBM]; α = .05, 2-tailed) assessed associations between THC-positive status, demographic variables, and creatinine, which is reflective of kidney function and hydration.

### A urinary test procedure for identification of cannabidiol in patients undergoing medical therapy with marijuana [^114zZ8F6]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This CBD assay is reliable, and is performed on standard laboratory equipment. The assay is suitable as a convenient test to provide an assessment as to whether CBD is a cannabinoid in marijuana currently being used. Coupled with as assay for urinary carboxy-THC, testing discloses the principle cannabinoids and whether that composition is CBD only, THC only, or a combination of CBD and THC. The physician is provided information that enables a judgment as to the value of marijuana therapy in the patient. Legislative changes, as distinguished from a policy preference by the Department of Justice, that ensured that physicians complying with state laws were not at risk for Federal prosecution would provide confidence; a confidence that is essential to increased formal study of medical uses of marijuana as well as use of medical marijuana as an effective agent for clinical problems.

Legislature that distinguishes medical marijuana from recreational marijuana would inure to the benefit of patients and society as a whole.

### Cannabinoid content and label accuracy of hemp-derived topical products available online and at national retail stores [^113EAqoA]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2018, the Agriculture Improvement Act (ie, The Farm Bill) removed hemp (cannabis containing < 0.3% Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol [THC], the primary psychoactive cannabis constituent) and its derivative products from the US controlled substances list. Consequently, various products containing hemp-derived cannabinoids have proliferated in both illicit and licit cannabis markets. Products containing hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD) as a key constituent have become particularly popular, largely because of the growing interest in the use of CBD among consumers as an alternative treatment for various therapeutic conditions. Importantly, to date, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved CBD to treat rare epilepsy disorders only.

Cannabinoid products intended for topical application (eg, lotions, creams, and patches) have seen arguably the largest growth since the Agriculture Improvement Act was enacted. Oral and vaping cannabinoid products are often labeled inaccurately for CBD and/or THC content, highlighting the poor regulatory oversight of cannabis products. However, to our knowledge, no such research has been conducted on hemp-derived topical cannabinoid products, which are now available for purchase nationwide at major retail stores and online. Of note, topical CBD products are increasingly being used to treat various health conditions (eg, pain and inflammation) or for cosmetic purposes (eg, antiaging), despite limited clinical research to demonstrate efficacy. In this case series study, we investigated the cannabinoid content and label accuracy of topical cannabinoid products and determined whether they made therapeutic or nontherapeutic claims.

Step 6 external validation

In an additional external sample of 84 pregnant participants, we validated CEPT responses against urine bioassay measurements of 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ 9 - THC, the most abundant THC metabolite (Fig. 2). Participants provided urine samples in sterile collection containers that were shipped frozen to our laboratory by pre-paid courier for analysis, within 24 h of completing an online questionnaire including the CEPT. We stored samples at -80°c until analysis. 2ml aliquots were taken from thawed samples, centrifuged and diluted (10x) with ultrapure water and assayed in duplicate using a 96-strip-well, THC Metabolite ELISA Kit (catalogue # 701570, Cayman Chemicals™, United States of America) according to manufacturer's protocol, by team members blinded to CEPT results. No freeze–thaw cycles were allowed, and the lowest threshold of THC positivity detectable by the kits with 88% sensitivity (0.072ηg/ml) was used to classify those with PCU versus those without.

### A preliminary evaluation of the relationship of cannabinoid blood concentrations with the analgesic response to vaporized cannabis [^1138ew4c]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The constituent in cannabis responsible for its psychoactive effects is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). A total of 40 metabolites of this cannabinoid have been identified, of which two metabolites, 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THC-COOH), have been extensively investigated. 11-OH-THC is the most important psychotropic metabolite of THC, with a spectrum of activity similar to the parent molecule.–THC-COOH is the most significant nonpsychotropic metabolite of THC. Interestingly, from a forensic point of view, THC-COOH has an unusually long elimination half-life in urine. Urine toxicology tests take advantage of this fact to detect the previous use of cannabis.

### Rational urine drug monitoring in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain: consensus recommendations [^117XnBQb]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description of UDM Technologies

A presumptive UDM test is a screening immunoassay that is relatively inexpensive, can be used in the office at point of care (POC), and produces a rapid result (e.g. within minutes). Clinicians may be unfamiliar with the characteristics of immunoassays, which have variable sensitivity and specificity (e.g. 0%–50% missed positive results and 11%–100% incorrectly identified positive results across drug classes), and may therefore miss substances that can lead to inaccurate immunoassay results (Figure 1). The classic "urine screen tests" are often enzyme immunoassays that target amphetamines/methamphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, phencyclidine, and opioids (i.e. the "federal five") and are based on a specific antidrug antibody reaction. Opiate immunoassays can more accurately detect naturally occurring opiate alkaloids (i.e. morphine, codeine) than commonly prescribed synthetic (e.g. fentanyl, methadone) and semisynthetic (e.g. buprenorphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydromorphone) opioids. Immunoassays are at best semiquantitative (i.e. an estimate of levels only) because of cross-reaction across multiple drugs. Reasonably sensitive options are now available for testing many common drug classes.

### Urinary tetrahydrocannabinol after 4 weeks of a full-spectrum, high-cannabidiol treatment in an open-label clinical trial [^111ZHzok]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Results

Of 15 patients enrolled (11 women [79%]; 12 White individuals [86%]), 1 discontinued participation because of use of another cannabinoid product; the remaining 14 patients completed all study procedures (Figure). The study drug was well tolerated; no serious adverse events were reported, and no patients reported psychoactivity. Patients used a mean (SD) of 3.48 (0.60) mL of the study product per day, equivalent to a mean (SD) of 34.73 (6.03) mg of CBD per day and 0.80 (0.14) mg of Δ9-THC per day. Results revealed that after 4 weeks, 7 participants (50%) tested positive for THC-COOH, while 7 tested negative. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry results confirmed assay findings but indicated that the drug screen was often more sensitive than its stated lower limit of detection (50 ng/mL). Participants' THC status was only significantly associated with creatinine levels (B, 1.92; P < .001; Table).

### Implications of positive urine toxicology screening in trauma patients [^114nUEMt]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pain management in trauma patients can be difficult due to their varied injuries and presence or absence of illicit substances in their systems. Additionally, trauma patients have variable lengths of stay. Limiting length of stay to what is medically necessary and preventing long-term dependence on narcotic medications are important in trauma patient care.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of 385 consecutive trauma activations at a Level II trauma center with urine toxicology screens from 2015. Main outcome measures recorded were urine toxicology results, average daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME), length of stay (LOS), injury severity score (ISS). We also recorded patient demographic information. Statistical analysis compared outcomes and demographics between trauma patients with positive urine toxicology screens to those with negative screens. Significance was set at p < 0.05.

Results

Positive urine toxicology screens were present in 230/385 (59.7%) patients. The median (interquartile range (IQR)) daily MME usage in the positive urine toxicology group was 25.2 (12.0–48.6) versus 12.4 (2.5–27.5) for those with a negative drug screen (p < 0.001). Median LOS was 3 (1–6) days versus 2 (1–4) days for the positive and negative groups, respectively (p = 0.004). There were no differences in age, gender distribution, or ISS between the two groups. Subgroup analysis showed urine toxicology positive for opiates, benzodiazepines, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) were associated with increased daily MME. Benzodiazepines and amphetamines were associated with increased LOS.

Conclusion

This study identifies a positive toxicology screening as a risk factor for increased narcotic demands and longer length of stay in trauma patients. These findings may assist in developing treatment plans and setting expectations in this population. This information can also lead to proactive interventions aimed at minimizing narcotic use and shortening LOS in this population.

Drug testing, when carefully collected and thoughtfully interpreted, offers a critical adjunct to clinical care and substance use treatment. However, because test results can be misleading if not interpreted in the correct clinical context, clinicians should always conduct a careful interview with adolescent patients to understand what testing is likely to show and then use testing to validate or refute their expectations. Because of the ease with which samples can be tampered, providers should also carefully reflect on their own collection protocols and sample validation procedures to ensure optimal accuracy".
