## Question

chest pain differential

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of chest pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and the initial assessment priorities. Then, I should verify the key elements of history and physical examination that separate life-threatening from non-life-threatening causes. Next, I will review the core diagnostic tests and how to interpret them, including ECG, troponin, chest radiography, and when to escalate to advanced imaging. After that, I need to consider special populations and risk stratification frameworks. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision algorithm and highlight pitfalls and documentation standards, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and rapid identification of immediately life-threatening causes, because missing ACS, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, tension pneumothorax, or esophageal rupture carries high morbidity and mortality. I should obtain an ECG within 10 minutes of arrival and order high-sensitivity troponin as soon as possible in suspected ACS, while starting IV access and continuous monitoring, and I must not delay reperfusion for imaging in STEMI [^14fb3a47] [^9b2313f7] [^c819e1c0].

> Wait, let me verify the history elements that meaningfully shift pretest probability: onset and tempo, location and radiation, character (pressure, tightness, burning, sharp, pleuritic), precipitating and relieving factors, duration, and associated symptoms such as dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, syncope, or abdominal pain. I should also ask about prior CAD, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, cocaine/methamphetamine use, and family history, and I need to remember that women more often present with accompanying symptoms like nausea and dyspnea, which should not distract from evaluating for ACS [^b07dcb40] [^75b3aea0] [^414c0472].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "typical" versus "atypical" pain. I should avoid labeling symptoms as "atypical" because it is imprecise and potentially misleading; instead, I will classify as cardiac, possible cardiac, or noncardiac, and I will consider any chest, shoulder, arm, neck, back, upper abdominal, or jaw discomfort as a potential anginal equivalent, especially when exertional or relieved by rest or nitroglycerin [^1f174986] [^e8f14299] [^b517b8fe].

> I will now examine the patient with a focused cardiovascular and respiratory exam, looking for signs of instability, new murmurs suggesting acute MR or VSD, jugular venous distension, pulmonary edema, and pulse deficits or blood pressure differentials that raise suspicion for aortic dissection. I should confirm that chest wall tenderness or pain with inspiration lowers the likelihood of ACS, while remembering that a normal exam does not exclude serious disease [^e3d5e8e9] [^a036eb32] [^6d92faf5].

> Next, I should review the ECG carefully and serially. A normal or unchanged ECG does not rule out ACS, so I need to repeat ECGs if symptoms persist or evolve, compare with prior tracings, and consider posterior leads when posterior ischemia is suspected. I should double-check for subtle ST depression, T-wave inversions, and new conduction abnormalities that might indicate NSTE-ACS [^b88c412e].

> Let me consider troponin interpretation. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin is the preferred biomarker for myocardial injury, and I should obtain serial measurements at 0 and 1–3 hours depending on the assay and clinical context to detect or exclude MI. I need to ensure I integrate troponin with ECG and clinical assessment rather than interpreting it in isolation [^c819e1c0] [^51d6219e].

> I should confirm the role of chest radiography. A chest X-ray is useful in the initial evaluation to screen for alternative cardiopulmonary and thoracic causes and should be obtained in most patients with possible ACS unless it delays emergent reperfusion. It can reveal pneumothorax, pneumonia, mediastinal widening, or other clues that redirect the workup [^e5b37d60] [^76d005d2] [^59db01b7].

> But wait, what if the ECG and initial troponin are nondiagnostic and suspicion remains intermediate or high? In that case, I should escalate to advanced imaging guided by pretest probability and institutional expertise: transthoracic echocardiography to assess wall motion and complications, coronary CT angiography for anatomical exclusion of CAD, stress testing with echo or nuclear imaging for functional ischemia, CT pulmonary angiography for suspected PE, and CT aortography for suspected aortic syndromes. I need to ensure test selection is individualized and timely [^4f7ec50d] [^6814a2eb] [^c31df5af].

> Let me think about special populations and risk modifiers. Older adults may present with dyspnea, syncope, delirium, or falls rather than classic chest pain, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion for ACS. Women are at risk for underdiagnosis and often have more accompanying symptoms, so I must actively counteract bias. Patients with cocaine or methamphetamine use can have vasospasm or myocardial injury. And language barriers and cultural factors can impair communication and worsen disparities, so I should use interpreters and culturally sensitive approaches [^2cf296d0] [^75b3aea0] [^00a05061] [^918ab5f4].

> I should double-check risk stratification frameworks. Clinical decision pathways that categorize patients into low, intermediate, or high risk for 30-day major adverse cardiac events guide disposition and testing. Low-risk patients generally do not need urgent cardiac testing, intermediate-risk patients benefit from appropriate noninvasive imaging, and high-risk patients warrant invasive coronary angiography. Shared decision-making improves alignment with patient preferences and reduces low-value testing [^77ef922a] [^1df9b569] [^ceea6c14].

> Hold on, I should verify the noncardiac differential and when to pivot. After excluding ACS, PE, and aortic syndromes, I should consider gastrointestinal etiologies such as GERD, esophageal dysmotility, or gastritis. Respiratory causes like pneumonia, pneumothorax, and pleurisy. Musculoskeletal sources including costochondritis and rib fractures. And psychological contributors such as anxiety and panic disorder, especially with recurrent presentations and negative cardiac workups, where referral to cognitive behavioral therapy is reasonable [^fd99ea65] [^2284732c] [^d2ee8d9a].

> Let me reconsider documentation and terminology to avoid misclassification. I should explicitly record the suspected etiology as cardiac, possible cardiac, or noncardiac, describe the pain quality and associated symptoms precisely, and avoid the term "atypical", which obscures meaning and can lead to undertreatment. I also need to document shared decision-making discussions, test rationale, and follow-up plans [^1f174986] [^1354f7fc].

> I will now synthesize a practical decision algorithm without oversimplifying. First, stabilize and obtain an ECG within 10 minutes and troponin in suspected ACS. Second, classify risk using a validated CDP. Third, if high risk, pursue invasive angiography. If intermediate risk, select appropriate noninvasive testing based on pretest probability and patient factors. If low risk, avoid urgent testing and arrange outpatient follow-up. Throughout, continuously reassess for alternative life-threatening diagnoses and use shared decision-making to align care with patient goals [^c31df5af] [^77ef922a] [^1df9b569].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "never discharge on a single normal ECG and troponin". That would be too absolute. I should correct that: while a single normal ECG and troponin reduce the likelihood of ACS, up to 6% of patients with evolving ACS may have a normal ECG, so serial ECGs and troponins, clinical judgment, and appropriate follow-up are essential, and discharge is reasonable in truly low-risk patients with clear return precautions and close follow-up [^b88c412e] [^77ef922a].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed pitfalls: anchoring on a single diagnosis, underestimating risk in women and older adults, failing to consider posterior MI or pulmonary embolism, and delaying appropriate imaging or specialty consultation. By adhering to guideline-driven pathways, maintaining diagnostic humility, and communicating clearly with patients, I can reduce missed diagnoses and improve outcomes [^75b3aea0] [^2cf296d0] [^c31df5af].

Chest pain has a **broad differential** spanning cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and psychiatric causes [^fd99ea65]. The most **life-threatening** are acute coronary syndrome (ACS), pulmonary embolism (PE), and aortic dissection, which must be rapidly excluded with ECG, high-sensitivity troponin, and targeted imaging [^c31df5af] [^367f8a1a]. Initial evaluation should be **structured**: obtain a focused history, vitals, and exam; perform an ECG within 10 minutes; and order troponin serially to risk-stratify and guide testing [^14fb3a47] [^c819e1c0]. Use clinical decision pathways (HEART, TIMI, Wells, D-dimer) to determine the need for further testing (stress imaging, CCTA, CTPA, TTE) and to decide on disposition [^77ef922a] [^6814a2eb]. Most chest pain is noncardiac, but missing ACS, PE, or dissection carries high morbidity and mortality, so maintain a high index of suspicion and reassess continuously [^fd99ea65] [^e4cd8dd7].

---

## Musculoskeletal causes

Musculoskeletal causes include **costochondritis** — localized reproducible tenderness without systemic features — and **muscle strain/rib fracture**, which present with focal pain and a history of trauma or repetitive use. Cervical radiculopathy produces pain radiating from the neck with neurologic symptoms.

---

## Psychiatric causes

Psychiatric causes include **anxiety/panic attacks**, characterized by episodic chest tightness, palpitations, hyperventilation, and a history of similar episodes, and **somatization disorder**, marked by chronic, recurrent pain without organic findings [^d2ee8d9a].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnostic approach

- **History**: onset, location, radiation, character, duration, precipitating/relieving factors, associated symptoms, risk factors, medications, social history [^b07dcb40].
- **Physical exam**: vitals, HEENT, chest, cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, extremities [^e3d5e8e9].
- **ECG**: within 10 minutes for acute chest pain; compare with prior [^14fb3a47].
- **Troponin**: serial hs-troponin at 0 and 1–3 hours [^notfound].
- **CXR**: most patients with acute chest pain to exclude pulmonary/thoracic causes [^e5b37d60].
- **Labs**: CBC, CMP, coagulation profile as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Risk stratification tools

- **HEART score**: History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin; low risk ≤ 3, intermediate 4–6, high ≥ 7 [^notfound].
- **TIMI risk score**: age ≥ 65, ≥ 3 CAD risk factors, prior CAD, ASA use, recent severe angina, ST deviation, elevated troponin [^notfound].
- **Wells/D-dimer**: for suspected PE [^586398a5].

---

## Imaging and specialized testing

Imaging and specialized testing should be guided by suspicion: **echocardiography** for wall motion abnormalities, valvular disease, or pericardial effusion [^4f7ec50d]; **stress testing** (echo, nuclear, CCTA) for intermediate-risk patients without STEMI [^6814a2eb]; **CTPA** for suspected PE [^586398a5]; and **CT angiography** for suspected aortic dissection [^a036eb32].

---

## Disposition and follow-up

Low-risk patients can be discharged with **clear return precautions and close follow-up** [^1df9b569]. Intermediate-risk patients should undergo observation with serial troponins and further testing (stress imaging or CCTA) [^6814a2eb]. High-risk patients require admission, cardiology consultation, and consideration of invasive coronary angiography [^41dcd841].

---

Chest pain requires a **structured, risk-stratified approach** to rapidly identify life-threatening causes while avoiding unnecessary testing. Most chest pain is noncardiac, but missing ACS, PE, or dissection has major consequences, so maintain vigilance and reassess continuously [^fd99ea65] [^e4cd8dd7].

Acute chest pain may represent the initial and/or accompanying symptom in a variety of disease processes that may occur in the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, or musculoskeletal system. Although clinical history, risk factors, and physical examination are important factors in establishing the etiology of symptoms in patients presenting with acute chest pain, imaging modalities are frequently utilized. Noncardiac causes of acute chest pain are reviewed in this paper with special reference to the most recently published literature and emphasis on acute aortic diseases. Imaging modalities with indication of appropriateness, optimal technique and practical keys for interpretation are discussed.

Chest pain — setting considerations for diagnostic testing are as follows: Unless a noncardiac cause is evident, an ECG should be performed for patients seen in the office setting with stable chest pain; if an ECG is unavailable the patient should be referred to the ED so one can be obtained. Patients with clinical evidence of ACS or other life-threatening causes of acute chest pain seen in the office setting should be transported urgently to the ED, ideally by EMS. In all patients who present with acute chest pain regardless of the setting, an ECG should be acquired and reviewed for STEMI within 10 minutes of arrival. In all patients presenting to the ED with acute chest pain and suspected ACS, cTn should be measured as soon as possible after presentation. For patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS initially evaluated in the office setting, delayed transfer to the ED for cTn or other diagnostic testing should be avoided.

### Outpatient diagnosis of acute chest pain in adults [^ebf0b2f8]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately 1 percent of primary care office visits are for chest pain, and 1.5 percent of these patients will have unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction. The initial goal in patients presenting with chest pain is to determine if the patient needs to be referred for further testing to rule in or out acute coronary syndrome and myocardial infarction. The physician should consider patient characteristics and risk factors to help determine initial risk. Twelve-lead electrocardiography is typically the test of choice when looking for ST segment changes, new-onset left bundle branch block, presence of Q waves, and new-onset T wave inversions. For persons in whom the suspicion for ischemia is lower, other diagnoses to consider include chest wall pain/costochondritis (localized pain reproducible by palpation), gastroesophageal reflux disease (burning retrosternal pain, acid regurgitation, and a sour or bitter taste in the mouth), and panic disorder/anxiety state. Other less common but important diagnostic considerations include pneumonia (fever, egophony, and dullness to percussion), heart failure, pulmonary embolism (consider using the Wells criteria), acute pericarditis, and acute thoracic aortic dissection (acute chest or back pain with a pulse differential in the upper extremities). Persons with a higher likelihood of acute coronary syndrome should be referred to the emergency department or hospital.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis take-home messages emphasize that clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making and information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. Noncardiac is in and atypical is out; "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain and its use is discouraged. Structured risk assessment should be used and, for patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

Pleuritic chest pain is characterized by sudden and intense sharp, stabbing, or burning pain in the chest when inhaling and exhaling. Pulmonary embolism is the most common serious cause, found in 5% to 21% of patients who present to an emergency department with pleuritic chest pain. A validated clinical decision rule for pulmonary embolism should be employed to guide the use of additional tests such as d-dimer assays, ventilation-perfusion scans, or computed tomography angiography. Myocardial infarction, pericarditis, aortic dissection, pneumonia, and pneumothorax are other serious causes that should be ruled out using history and physical examination, electrocardiography, troponin assays, and chest radiography before another diagnosis is made. Validated clinical decision rules are available to help exclude coronary artery disease. Viruses are common causative agents of pleuritic chest pain. Coxsackieviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza, mumps, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus are likely pathogens. Treatment is guided by the underlying diagnosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are appropriate for pain management in those with virally triggered or nonspecific pleuritic chest pain. In patients with persistent symptoms, persons who smoke, and those older than 50 years with pneumonia, it is important to document radiographic resolution with repeat chest radiography six weeks after initial treatment.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

2021 AHA/ACC Chest Pain Guideline — Setting considerations for initial ECG and transport: Unless a noncardiac cause is evident, an ECG should be performed for patients seen in the office setting with stable chest pain; if an ECG is unavailable the patient should be referred to the ED so one can be obtained. Patients with clinical evidence of ACS or other life-threatening causes of acute chest pain seen in the office setting should be transported urgently to the ED, ideally by EMS. In all patients who present with acute chest pain regardless of the setting, an ECG should be acquired and reviewed for ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) within 10 minutes of arrival.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to do not describe chest pain as atypical, because it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature. Describe chest pain as cardiac, possibly cardiac or noncardiac, as these terms are more specific to the potential underlying diagnosis.

Considerations for diverse patient populations with chest pain — two COR 1 (LOE C-LD) recommendations are provided: "Cultural competency training is recommended to help achieve the best outcomes in patients of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds who present with chest pain" and "Among patients of diverse race and ethnicity presenting with chest pain in whom English may not be their primary language, addressing language barriers with the use of formal translation services is recommended." The synopsis states "There are marked racial and ethnic disparities when triaging patients who present for the evaluation of chest pain," noting that Black patients are "less likely to be treated urgently and less likely to have an ECG performed, samples for cardiac biomarkers drawn, cardiac monitoring performed, or pulse oximetry measured," with "Similar treatment disparities" among "Hispanic patients and those who are covered by Medicaid or are uninsured." These observations were "Derived from a nationally representative sample from the National Hospital Ambulatory Health Care Survey reflecting an estimated 78 million ED visits in the United States over a 10-year period," and "have been unchanged over time," and there are "disparities in the management of patients of South Asian descent who present with ACS, with the diagnosis often missed or delayed, resulting in poor outcomes."

### High-risk chief complaints I: chest pain – the big three [^e4cd8dd7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Chest pain is one of the most frequently seen chief complaints in patients presenting to emergency departments, and is considered to be a "high-risk" chief complaint. The differential diagnosis for chest pain is broad, and potential causes range from the benign to the immediately life-threatening. Although many (if not most) emergency department patients with chest pain do not have an immediately life-threatening condition, correct diagnoses can be difficult to make, incorrect diagnoses may lead to catastrophic therapies, and failure to make a timely diagnosis may contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. Several atraumatic "high-risk" causes of chest pain are discussed in this article, including myocardial infarction and ischemia, thoracic aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. Also included are brief discussions of tension pneumothorax, esophageal perforation, and cardiac tamponade.

Considerations for older patients with chest pain — COR 1 (LOE C-LD) specifies that in patients with chest pain who are ≥ 75 years of age, ACS should be considered when accompanying symptoms such as shortness of breath, syncope, or acute delirium are present, or when an unexplained fall has occurred. Increased age is a significant risk factor for ACS, and although patients > 75 years of age account for 33% of all cases of ACS, alternative diagnoses are still more common than a cardiac cause of chest pain at presentation. A substudy of the PROMISE trial has shown that patients ≥ 75 years of age with stable symptoms suggestive of CAD are more likely to have a positive noninvasive test and more coronary artery calcification than younger people, and for these older patients, when compared with anatomic noninvasive testing for obstructive CAD with cardiac CT, a positive stress test result was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death or MI. Patients > 75 years of age may have symptoms of shortness of breath, syncope, mental impairment, or abdominal pain, or experienced an unexplained fall, and the physician should have a heightened awareness to understand that these symptoms may be associated with ACS, in addition to chest pain.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest, and that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9-1-1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, whereas "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, structured risk assessment should be used and risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

Evaluation of acute chest pain with suspected anxiety and other psychosomatic considerations — For patients with recurrent, similar presentations for acute chest pain with no evidence of a physiological cause on prior diagnostic evaluation including a negative workup for myocardial ischemia, referral to a cognitive-behavioral therapist is reasonable (COR 2a, LOE B-R). This presentation includes recurrent chest pain despite angiographically normal coronary arteries and no definable cardiac disease, including an assessment for INOCA, and has been variously labeled angina, angina-like, "atypical" angina, or noncardiac chest pain. Prognosis of patients with noncardiac chest pain is largely devoid of cardiac complications, and the close association with psychological syndromes such as anxiety, panic attack, depression, somatoform disorder, and cardiophobia suggests that there may be a psychogenic origin in many patients.

Nontraumatic chest pain is a frequent concern of emergency department patients, with causes that range from benign to immediately life threatening. Identifying those patients who require immediate/urgent intervention remains challenging and is a high-risk area for emergency medicine physicians where incorrect or delayed diagnosis may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This article focuses on the 3 most prevalent diagnoses associated with adverse outcomes in patients presenting with nontraumatic chest pain, acute coronary syndrome, thoracic aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. Important aspects of clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, treatment, and disposition and other less common causes of lethal chest pain are also discussed.

Initial evaluation — synopsis and comprehensive history elements in the emergency department (ED): Patients presenting to the ED with nontraumatic chest pain are a frequent diagnostic challenge. The priorities are rapid initiation of optimal management for life-threatening conditions such as acute coronary syndromes (ACS), aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as nonvascular syndromes (eg, esophageal rupture, tension pneumothorax), and deliberate therapy for those with less critical illness. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is important to the evaluation, but history, examination, biomarkers, and other aids remain essential, and there is frequently a lack of correlation between intensity of symptoms and seriousness of disease. A comprehensive history that captures chest pain characteristics — nature, onset and duration, location and radiation, precipitating factors, relieving factors, and associated symptoms — can help better identify potential cardiac causes and should be obtained from all patients.

### Management of acute coronary syndrome [^b4c18a93]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the most common complaints encountered in the emergency department is chest pain. In many evaluations, the leading diagnostic consideration is an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS refers to a spectrum of coronary artery pathologies, including unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The distinction between subtypes of ACS guides acute diagnostic and management decisions. Failure to diagnose and manage ACS properly is a frequent cause of medico-legal litigation. In this article, we review the initial identification and critical management steps in patients presenting to the emergency department with ACS.

Chest pain — terminology and characterization — emphasizes precise language and symptom context: Chest pain should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and chest pain should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Because patients may not use the descriptor "pain," a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort". Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac. Pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

Chest pain symptom characterization and terminology — For myocardial ischemia, the sensation is described as "characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse," and "Point tenderness renders ischemia less likely." "It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation.17" Although "A patient's history is the most important basis for considering presence or absence of myocardial ischemia," "The diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone," and "In some patients, what appears to be noncardiac chest pain may be ischemic in origin." Features more consistent with ischemia are summarized as "Chest pain that is more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin." Terminology guidance states "Atypical chest pain is a problematic term" and "we discourage the use of atypical chest pain"; to reduce ambiguity, "To diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac," "possible cardiac," and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged," and "chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen."

### Differential diagnosis of chest symptoms in the athlete [^1c1e91c4]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Chest pain is a common complaint of athletes in all age groups. In athletes, chest pain is often attributed to "chest tightness", and treatment for bronchospasm is considered. However, the causes of the pain are wide and varied, and the pain is referable to the many organ systems that localize to the thorax. Therefore, when treatment with bronchodilators fails, it becomes important to consider other nonasthmatic causes of the pain. These causes can be organized by system and are explained in this article. Cardiac causes are the most feared and, fortunately, are very rare in the adolescent setting. With a thorough knowledge of etiologies of chest pain, the physician can often make a diagnosis with only a history and a physical exam.

Initial assessment of chest pain — terminology, examination, and chest X-ray guidance include using the terms "cardiac, possible cardiac, and noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause; clinical assessment "should include the chest pain description and associated symptoms, onset, duration, location, radiation, and precipitating and relieving factors"; there are "no physical examination findings specific for coronary ischemia," so the exam "should be targeted to identify findings associated with high risk for morbidity and mortality in ACS, or to the presence of potential alternative diagnoses," with high-risk findings including "signs of low cardiac output… heart failure… and a new systolic murmur concerning for acute mitral regurgitation or a ventricular septal defect"; as part of the initial assessment, "a chest X-ray should be performed in almost all patients with possible ACS," given its potential to identify high-risk and noncardiac causes, and "performance of a chest X-ray should not delay emergent interventions such as primary percutaneous coronary intervention for those with a definitive STEMI."

### Use of transthoracic echocardiography in the evaluation of chest pain: illustrative cases and review of recent guidelines [^c569f605]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Chest pain (CP) is a very common presentation with a wide range of differential diagnoses, including life-threatening conditions, which need to be considered, diagnosed and treated urgently. Cardiac CP accounts for less than one-third of causes. Echocardiography is a valuable non-invasive tool that can help in diagnosing and treating patients presenting with CP. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines state that echocardiography can help in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes and also in ruling out other serious conditions. We present three cases where transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was essential in assessing patients, making the correct diagnosis and offering the right treatment. This article emphasises the importance of using TTE in assessing patients with CP and hopes to promote its consideration in day-to-day practice.

Physical examination in patients with chest pain — key findings include the following: For aortic dissection, extremity pulse differential (30% of patients, type A), the combination of severe pain, abrupt onset + pulse differential + widened mediastinum on CXR confers ≥ 80% probability of dissection, the frequency of syncope > 10%, and AR occurs in 40%–75% (type A). Esophageal rupture may present with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax (20% patients), unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds. Specific clues can be helpful, and chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration markedly reduce the probability of ACS.

### Pitfalls in evaluating the low-risk chest pain patient [^ab8db5af]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Risk stratification and management of the patient with low-risk chest pain continues to be challenging despite the considerable effort of numerous investigators. Evidence exists that a specific subset of young patients can be defined as low risk in whom further testing may not be necessary. A high index of suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and an understanding of the many, subtle, and atypical presentations of ischemic heart disease are required. The initial history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and biomarkers are important, but serial ECGs and biomarkers improve sensitivity in detecting ACS. Unless chest pain is clearly explained, objective testing, such as exercise treadmill testing, nuclear scintigraphy, stress echocardiography, or coronary computed tomography angiogram, should be considered before, or soon after, discharge.

Electrocardiogram — supportive considerations: When an ECG is nondiagnostic, it "should be compared with previous ECGs, if available," and "a normal or unchanged ECG is reasonably useful but not sufficient at ruling out ACS," so decision‑making "should not be based solely on a single normal or nondiagnostic ECG." Masking conditions may occur, and "Up to 6% of patients with evolving ACS are discharged from the ED with a normal ECG," therefore "serial ECGs should be performed and management should be guided by new electrocardiographic changes or other diagnostic testing." When ST‑elevation is present on the initial ECG, "management should follow the prescribed STEMI treatment algorithms," and if ST depression is identified, "management should follow the NSTE-ACS guidelines." Because a normal ECG may accompany certain occlusions and posterior ischemia, which is "often 'electrically silent'; therefore, right-sided ECG leads should be considered when such lesions are suspected."

Acute chest pain is one of the most common complaints of patients who present to an emergency department, and accounts for up to 5% of all visits. It also is one of the most complex issues in an emergency setting because, although clinical signs and symptoms often are nonspecific, rapid diagnosis and therapy are of great importance. The chest radiograph remains an important component of the evaluation of chest pain, and usually is the first examination to be obtained. Nevertheless, cross-sectional imaging has added greatly to the ability to characterize the wide constellation of clinical findings into a distinct etiology. This article reviews how the various entities that can present as nontraumatic chest pain can manifest radiographically.

Introduction

Acute chest pain is one of the most common presenting symptoms at the emergency department (ED), up to 10% of all ED admissions in the United States. The differential diagnosis is vast and includes aortic, coronary artery, pericardial and pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary embolism, thereby frequently providing a diagnostic challenge. Although the primary diagnostic goal is to exclude life threatening causes such as acute coronary artery syndrome (ACS, referred to as a symptomatic coronary artery stenosis or myocardial infarction, i.e. reduced coronary artery flow leading to acute cardiac ischemic states), in only a minority of the patients with acute chest pain ACS is there ultimately a confirmed diagnosis, yielding a substantial number of possible alternative diagnosis. On the contrary, missing the diagnosis of ACS accounts for frequent litigation and is reported in patients with atypical presentations, such as those of younger age or without electrocardiography (ECG) abnormalities. In the last decade, computed tomography (CT) imaging has become a powerful tool in the diagnostic process, aiming to decrease false negative outcomes and providing clues for an alternative diagnosis.

Different modalities have been proposed in the workup of suspected ACS. In the (sub) acute setting the availability and speed of ECG gated CT has lead mainly to an increase in acute thoracic CT exams. A variety of scanning protocols have been developed and extensively studied for this diagnostic question. The expected increase in chest "rule-out" CT scans in patients with acute chest pain stresses the need for radiologists to be aware of an alternative diagnosis. We retrospectively identified patients who presented with acute chest pain at the ED in our hospitals, and selected the most educative cases, not aiming to present a complete overview of all causes of chest pain. The present pictorial essay reviews, thus, some of the alternative diagnoses, focused on aortic, coronary artery, pericardial and pulmonary diseases, which may help the general radiologist in clinical practice.

Conclusions

In patients with NCCP, timely diagnostic evaluation and treatment of the underlying disease is important. A thorough history of symptoms and clinical examination findings can inform clinicians which diagnostic tests are most appropriate. Response to high-dose PPI treatment can indicate whether GERD is the underlying disease and should be considered as an early test. Panic and anxiety disorders are often not diagnosed and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain.

### Imaging of non-cardiac, non-traumatic causes of acute chest pain [^418aa13b]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Non-traumatic chest pain is a common symptom in patients who present in the emergency department. From a clinical point of view, it is important to differentiate cardiac chest pain from non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP). Among the plethora of potential causes of NCCP, life-threatening diseases, such as aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, and esophageal rupture, must be differentiated from non-life threatening causes. The majority of NCCP, however, is reported to be benign in nature. The presentation of pain plays an important role in narrowing the differential diagnosis and initiating further diagnostic management and treatment. As the benign causes tend to recur, and may lead to patient anxiety and great costs, a meticulous evaluation of the patient is necessary to diagnose the underlying disorder or disease.

### Chest CT examinations in patients presenting with acute chest pain: a pictorial review [^400c9774]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Acute chest pain (ACP) is one of the most common presenting symptoms at the emergency department. The differential diagnosis is vast. To exclude life-threatening causes, radiologists encounter an increasing amount of thoracic computed tomography (CT) examinations including CT angiography of the heart and great vessels. The dual- and triple-rule CT examinations are currently implemented in clinical practice. We retrospectively identified chest CT examinations in the setting of acute chest pain in our hospitals and collected a variety of common and uncommon cases. In this pictorial essay, we present the most educative cases from patients who presented with acute chest pain in the emergency department of our hospitals and for whom a thoracic CT was ordered. When aortic emergencies, acute coronary syndrome, and pulmonary embolism are excluded, these cases may help the radiologist to suggest alternative diagnoses in the diagnostic challenge of acute chest pain. Teaching Points
- The number of chest CT examinations for ACP is increasing.• Chest CT examinations may help suggesting alternative diagnosis in ACP.• Radiologists should be aware of the differential diagnosis of ACP.

Chest pain in women — synopsis and risk patterns indicate that most patients who present to the ED with chest pain are women, particularly among those ≥ 65 years of age. The ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) trial demonstrated that women with moderate-to-severe ischemia are more symptomatic than men, and women are less likely to have timely and appropriate care. Women may also present with accompanying symptoms more often than men, yet chest pain remains the predominant symptom among those ultimately diagnosed with ACS, occurring with a frequency equal to men. Traditional risk score tools and physician assessments often underestimate risk in women and misclassify them as having nonischemic chest pain.

Chest pain — symptom characterization and terminology — should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Although the term chest pain is used in clinical practice, patients often report pressure, tightness, squeezing, heaviness, or burning, and a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort"; patients may also report a location other than the chest, including the shoulder, arm, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw. Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac, and pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

Conclusion

The expected increase in thoracic, tailored rule-out CT examinations will urge the (general) radiologist to gain confidence in detecting and reporting alternative diagnoses on regular thoracic CT or CTA examinations requested in the setting of acute chest pain. Familiarity with some of the aortic, coronary, pericardial, and pulmonary diagnoses, and the sometimes subtle imaging findings will help to suggest alternative diagnoses, thereby avoiding diagnostic delay.

### Diagnosis and treatment of noncardiac chest pain [^18831d59]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Chest pain is common: one in four of the population have an episode annually. Of those who present to hospital, nearly two-thirds have noncardiac chest pain. More than half of these cases might have gastroesophageal reflux disease. Opinion differs over what is the most appropriate application of current investigatory methods. Evidence suggests that, once cardiac disease is ruled unlikely, empiric use of a proton pump inhibitor is an option; if acid suppression fails, detailed investigations as clinically indicated can be considered. A range of esophageal investigations is available, including 24-hour or 48-hour esophageal pH testing and esophageal manometry, as well as provocative tests, but there is no consensus as to which methods are the most useful. Psychiatric evaluation is not routine, but psychiatric or psychological disorders are common. Musculoskeletal disorders are also common, but are frequently overlooked. It is possible to subject patients to a comprehensive set of investigations before empiric therapy, but recent studies have failed to demonstrate an improved outcome using this exhaustive approach. A new tactic is required, with less attention spent on absolute diagnostic accuracy and more emphasis on optimizing the long-term clinical outcome in patients with noncardiac chest pain. It is possible that the targeted use of multiple drug trials in a policy of 'therapy as investigation' might be a superior methodology.

Physical examination — a focused cardiovascular examination should be performed initially in patients presenting with chest pain to aid in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or other potentially serious causes of chest pain (eg, aortic dissection, PE, or esophageal rupture) and to identify complications, and life-threatening causes of chest pain include, but are not limited to, ACS, PE, aortic dissection, and esophageal rupture. Because ST–segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) can be recognized on the ECG, the major challenge is to distinguish between non–ST–segment–elevation (NSTE)-ACS and noncardiac chest pain, and with an uncomplicated AMI, the examination may be negative; sudden onset of severe chest pain or back pain associated with limb pulse differential suggest aortic dissection, but sensitivity of the latter finding alone was only 30%.

Acute chest pain with suspected gastrointestinal syndromes — among outpatients who present with chest pain, approximately 10% to 20% have a gastrointestinal cause, and in patients with recurrent acute chest pain without evidence of a cardiac or pulmonary cause, evaluation for gastrointestinal causes is reasonable. The first step in evaluation of potential esophageal chest pain is a careful history, and a history of use of medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, potassium supplements, iron, or bisphosphonates should be sought. When an esophageal cause of chest pain is suspected, upper endoscopy should be considered, and symptoms and signs that merit early evaluation (usually within 2 weeks) include dysphagia, odynophagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, weight loss, and recurrent vomiting. Patients without these symptoms may merit a trial of empiric acid suppression therapy, and if an upper endoscopy is normal and the symptoms persist despite a trial of acid suppression, consideration should be given to additional evaluation, such as esophageal function testing and pH monitoring, to exclude other esophageal causes.

### Role of imaging for acute chest pain syndromes [^6176ac6a]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Acute chest pain suggestive of ischemic cardiac origin, with a normal or nondiagnostic electrocardiogram and negative initial cardiac markers for myocardial necrosis represent a significant diagnostic dilemma for clinicians. Multiple imaging modalities play a pivotal role in early diagnosis and safe discharge of these patients. In this review, we compare the current imaging modalities available for these patients including their diagnostic accuracy, feasibility, and cost effectiveness. Acute rest myocardial perfusion imaging significantly improves the clinical outcome in these patients and reduces the overall cost when incorporated into the decision making pathway. The choice of imaging modality recommended should be based on local institutional expertise and the overall clinical presentation. The imaging modality with high diagnostic accuracy and negative predictive value will provide for precise risk stratification which is important to clinical decision making, including patients who require admission to the hospital and those who can be safely discharged.
