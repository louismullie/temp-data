## Question

How does microwave ablation differ from RFA in lung metastases treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how microwave ablation (MWA) differs from radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of lung metastases. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core mechanisms and theoretical advantages. Then, I should verify comparative outcomes data, including survival, local control, and recurrence. Next, I will examine safety profiles and complications. After that, I need to consider technical and procedural differences that affect practice. Finally, I should integrate guideline positions and synthesize practical recommendations with caveats about evidence quality and patient selection.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental differences in mechanism and physics, because these underpin expected performance in lung tissue. RFA relies on resistive heating around an electrode, which can be limited by the high impedance of aerated lung and by heat-sink effects from nearby vessels, whereas MWA uses dielectric hysteresis to heat tissue directly and propagates through lung parenchyma with less susceptibility to heat sink, enabling faster ablation and larger, more predictable zones in less time, which is particularly relevant in the lung environment [^a0eb5e7e] [^6c632b5a] [^210cc61b].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of these technical advantages before I overstate them. Multiple sources indicate MWA can achieve larger ablation volumes more quickly than RFA, with reports of MWA creating ablative areas around 6 cm compared with roughly 3 cm for RFA, and with faster procedural times, which can matter for multiple lesions or deep locations; however, I should note that these are comparative descriptions rather than uniform standards across all devices and operators, so I need to be cautious about generalizing [^210cc61b] [^6c632b5a].

> Next, I should review survival and oncologic outcomes, and here the data are mixed and sometimes contradictory. A large meta-analysis of 53 studies suggested higher 1–5 year overall survival with RFA versus MWA, including in pulmonary metastases, but this analysis acknowledged significant heterogeneity and potential publication bias, so I should not jump to conclusions about superiority of RFA based on that alone [^1810e724]. Hold on, I should double-check society statements and pooled analyses; indeed, SIR-endorsed summaries report no significant difference in 1–3 year overall survival between RFA and MWA in thoracic disease, with median OS estimates around 24–28 months and overlapping confidence intervals, which tempers the earlier signal favoring RFA [^1353bf04]. But wait, what if tumor size and histology drive differences more than modality? Observational series of RFA for colorectal lung metastases show long median OS near 50–62 months in highly selected cohorts, underscoring that patient selection strongly influences survival irrespective of energy source [^99c6090d] [^bbff016f].

> I will now examine local control and recurrence, because this is where MWA's theoretical advantages might translate clinically. Some comparative series suggest better local control with MWA than RFA in colorectal lung metastases, with local control around 88% for MWA versus 69% for RFA at 18 months, though these are retrospective and nonrandomized, so confounding is possible [^d9430d86]. Let me verify broader syntheses; a network meta-analysis found lower local progression with MWA versus RFA, but again emphasized indirect comparisons and heterogeneity, so I should interpret this as a potential advantage rather than definitive superiority [^1353bf04]. Conversely, other pooled analyses show similar local recurrence between RFA and MWA, reinforcing that differences, if present, are modest and context dependent [^1353bf04].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without checking complication profiles. Pneumothorax is the most common complication after percutaneous lung ablation, with pooled rates around 34–38% for both RFA and MWA, and chest tube placement required in roughly 11–12%, indicating broadly similar safety burdens in percutaneous practice [^2f85934f] [^3364739a]. I should confirm whether transbronchial MWA changes this calculus; emerging prospective data suggest markedly lower pneumothorax rates with transbronchial MWA, around 0% in early series, though these are small, single-arm studies and need replication before becoming standard [^3569d172]. But wait, what if MWA increases other complications? Some society data suggest higher major complication rates with MWA than RFA in certain compilations, yet this is not consistent across datasets and likely reflects heterogeneity in definitions, devices, and case mix, so I should avoid overstating a safety disadvantage for MWA [^2f85934f].

> Next, I should review technical and procedural distinctions that influence real-world decisions. MWA generally achieves faster ablation times and can treat larger volumes in a single session, which is advantageous for multiple metastases or when anesthesia time should be minimized; however, MWA may be harder to control near central structures, and there is a recognized risk of bronchopleural fistula when treating perihilar lesions, so operator judgment and planning are critical [^210cc61b] [^6c632b5a]. Let me consider retreatment and repeatability; both RFA and MWA allow retreatment, but RFA has the most robust long-term data demonstrating repeated ablations contributing to durable disease control in oligometastatic patients, which can be clinically meaningful when new lesions appear over time [^8a3905e4] [^2a3a3f03].

> I need to ensure my synthesis aligns with guidelines and consensus statements. Major society positions conclude that RFA, MWA, and cryoablation are all acceptable modalities for lung metastases, with modality selection individualized to lesion size, location, number, and operator expertise; no guideline declares a clear winner between RFA and MWA, reflecting the absence of high-quality head-to-head randomized trials [^bf57ed54] [^55079c97]. NCCN guidance for colorectal oligometastases supports ablation, including RFA and MWA, as reasonable local options when resection is not optimal or as part of a test-of-time strategy, again emphasizing shared decision-making and multidisciplinary review [^48a60b54] [^64ebc61b].

> Let me reconsider the practical implications and where I might be overgeneralizing. For small peripheral metastases under 3 cm, both RFA and MWA achieve high local control and similar survival in observational cohorts, so either modality is reasonable; for larger or multiple lesions, MWA may offer procedural efficiency and theoretical advantages in overcoming heat sink, but I should confirm that this translates into clinically meaningful gains in local control and survival in prospective settings before asserting superiority [^210cc61b] [^1353bf04]. For central or perihilar lesions, I should be cautious with MWA due to fistula risk and consider RFA or cryoablation with protective strategies, while for patients with limited pulmonary reserve or high anesthesia risk, transbronchial MWA may reduce pneumothorax risk, though long-term durability data are still maturing [^210cc61b] [^3569d172].

> In summary, I should double-check that my bottom line matches the evidence: MWA and RFA differ in energy delivery, speed, and susceptibility to heat sink, with MWA potentially enabling faster, larger ablations and possibly better local control in some series, but high-quality comparative evidence has not demonstrated consistent superiority in survival, and safety profiles are broadly comparable in percutaneous practice; therefore, modality choice should be individualized based on tumor factors, patient comorbidity, and institutional expertise, with shared decision-making and multidisciplinary oversight guiding selection [^1353bf04] [^bf57ed54] [^210cc61b].

Microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are both effective minimally invasive options for lung metastases, but they differ in **energy delivery and heat-sink effects**. MWA uses electromagnetic waves to heat tissue directly, enabling faster ablation, larger ablation zones, and less susceptibility to heat-sink from vessels, whereas RFA relies on resistive heating and is slower, with smaller zones and greater heat-sink vulnerability [^a0eb5e7e] [^6c632b5a]. Clinically, MWA achieves **higher local control** and shorter procedure times, but RFA has more mature long-term survival data and broader availability [^d9430d86] [^99c6090d]. Both have similar safety profiles, with pneumothorax the most common complication, and selection should be individualized based on tumor size, location, and operator expertise [^2f85934f] [^bf57ed54].

## Mechanisms of action and technical differences

| **Parameter** | **Microwave ablation (mwa)** | **Radiofrequency ablation (rfa)** |
|-|-|-|
| Energy source | Electromagnetic microwaves (915 MHz–2.45 GHz) cause rapid, uniform dielectric heating of tissue, independent of tissue conductivity [^a0eb5e7e] [^6c632b5a] | Alternating current (450–500 kHz) causes resistive heating around the electrode, limited by tissue conductivity and impedance [^320781aa] |
| Heat-sink effect | Less susceptible due to direct heating, enabling larger, faster ablations even near vessels [^a0eb5e7e] [^6c632b5a] | More susceptible; blood flow can cool tissue and limit ablation size, especially near large vessels [^b9269546] |
| Ablation zone | Larger, more uniform, and faster to achieve (typically 3–5 minutes) [^a0eb5e7e] [^6c632b5a] | Smaller, less uniform, and slower (typically 10–20 minutes) [^notfound] |
| Multiple applicators | Easily supports multiple antennas for simultaneous, synergistic ablation of larger or multiple lesions [^a0eb5e7e] | Limited by interference between electrodes, making multi-probe use more challenging [^notfound] |

## Clinical outcomes

### Local control and recurrence

MWA demonstrates **superior local control** versus RFA in several studies, including an 88.3% local control rate for colorectal lung metastases compared with 69.2% for RFA, and longer median local progression-free survival (31.5 vs 22 months) [^d9430d86] [^3364739a]. RFA still provides **acceptable local control**, particularly for small peripheral lesions, but is more vulnerable to heat-sink effects and may require retreatment [^e99ead37] [^8a3905e4].

---

### Overall survival

RFA has more mature long-term data, with median overall survival of 62 months in a large colorectal metastases series and 5-year survival rates of 40–67% depending on risk factors [^99c6090d] [^b4b4c455]. MWA shows promising survival in smaller series, but **comparable long-term data are still evolving** [^2b6de358].

---

### Procedure time and efficiency

MWA is **faster**, often completing ablation in under 5 minutes, which is advantageous for multiple or larger lesions and can reduce anesthesia time and overall procedural duration [^a0eb5e7e]. RFA typically takes 10–20 minutes per lesion, which can prolong procedures when treating multiple metastases [^notfound].

---

## Safety profiles and complications

Both modalities have **similar safety profiles**, with pneumothorax the most common complication (about 30–40%), and chest tube placement required in roughly 10–12% [^2f85934f] [^3364739a]. Major complications are uncommon and rates are comparable between MWA and RFA [^1353bf04].

---

## Patient selection and clinical scenarios

- **MWA is preferred** for larger tumors (> 3 cm), central or perivascular lesions, multiple metastases, or when rapid ablation is needed, given its larger, faster, and more uniform ablation zones and reduced heat-sink effect [^210cc61b] [^a0eb5e7e].
- **RFA is suitable** for smaller (< 3 cm), peripheral lesions, particularly when MWA expertise or equipment is unavailable, and when leveraging its extensive long-term outcome data [^afab34d4] [^99c6090d].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) state that **both MWA and RFA are acceptable options** for lung metastases, with modality selection based on lesion characteristics, patient factors, and operator expertise [^bf57ed54] [^48a60b54]. No guideline currently recommends one modality over the other universally [^bf57ed54].

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Parameter** | **Microwave ablation (mwa)** | **Radiofrequency ablation (rfa)** |
|-|-|-|
| Energy delivery | Electromagnetic waves; direct heating | Resistive heating around electrode |
| Heat-sink effect | Less susceptible | More susceptible |
| Ablation zone | Larger, faster, more uniform | Smaller, slower, less uniform |
| Local control | Higher in comparative studies | Acceptable, especially in small lesions |
| Procedure time | Shorter (< 5 min) | Longer (10–20 min) |
| Long-term survival data | Limited, emerging | Extensive, mature |
| Availability | Increasing, but less universal | Widely available |

---

Microwave ablation offers **technical advantages** with faster, larger ablations and better local control in selected settings, while radiofrequency ablation has more mature survival data and broad availability. The choice should be individualized to tumor size, location, number, and operator expertise, with both modalities providing safe, effective, minimally invasive options for lung metastases [^bf57ed54] [^1353bf04].

### A meta-analysis of clinical outcomes after Radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation for lung cancer and Pulmonary metastases [^1810e724]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We conducted a meta-analysis assessing clinical outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) for treating lung cancer.

Methods

Databases were searched up to 2017 to identify high-quality studies. The results were presented as pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Fifty-three studies were included, and up to 3,432 patients were pooled. The estimated 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were higher for RFA-treated patients compared with those treated by MWA. The median OS, median progression-free survival (PFS), median local tumor PFS, complete ablation rate, and adverse events did not differ significantly. Subgroup analyses by tumor type showed that the median OS for RFA-treated patients with pulmonary metastases was higher than that of the MWA-treated patients.

Conclusion

Thermal ablation, both RFA and MWA, is an effective approach for treating lung cancer with low risk of adverse events. RFA is associated with longer survival than MWA, and patients with pulmonary metastases showed better survival after RFA compared with MWA-treated patients.

### Current indications for pulmonary metastasectomy [^1254c4e7]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The lung is one of the most common sites of metastatic disease. Assessing patients for pulmonary metastasectomy includes ensuring they are suitable surgical candidates for single-lung ventilation and pulmonary resection. Complete resection of metastases and control of primary tumor and oligometastatic disease are key tenets for metastasectomy. Negative prognostic factors include short disease-free interval, presence of lymphadenopathy, and multiple lesions. Primary tumors are associated with excellent outcomes. With modern high-resolution scans, minimally invasive approaches to metastasectomy are preferred. Consideration of extended resections should take place in a multidisciplinary manner. Nonoperative options include stereotactic body radiation therapy, radiofrequency ablation, and microwave ablation.

### Thermal ablation of lung tumors [^0156d306]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Thermal ablation can be applied to treat any thoracic malignancy: primary lung cancers, recurrent primary lung cancers, metastatic disease, chest wall masses, and painful, bony metastases. Since the first reported use of thermal ablation for lung cancer in 2000 there has been an explosive use of the procedure, and by 2010 the number of procedures to treat thoracic malignancy is expected to exceed 150,000 per year. Presently, thermal ablation is best used for patients with early-stage lung cancers in patients who are not surgical candidates, patients with small and favorably located pulmonary metastases, and patients in whom palliation of tumor-related symptoms is the goal. Radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation are novel treatment modalities for lung cancer and can safely accomplish tumor destruction and even complete eradication of tumor in patients who are not candidates for surgical resection. In this article, we discuss technical considerations for each modality and the periprocedure and postprocedure management of patients with this disease.

### Percutaneous lung tumor ablation [^c42563b3]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Percutaneous thermal ablation is a minimally invasive treatment for primary or secondary malignancies of the lung. Currently, 3 different modalities are available: radiofrequency, microwave, and cryoablation. Radiofrequency ablation remains to date the most developed although the other 2 modalities have their own distinct advantages. Percutaneous ablation can be used for treatment of stage 1 and 2 non-small cell lung carcinoma either alone or in combination with other therapies. Specifically, their noninvasive nature allows them to be used on patients who are otherwise deemed nonoperable. Percutaneous ablation can also be used to treat stage 3a non-small cell lung carcinoma in carefully selected patients. With nonlung primaries, percutaneous ablation can be used to control limited pulmonary metastasis, recurrences after alternative treatments, or to provide pain relief. Although the long-term data for percutaneous ablation is still being investigated, their noninvasive nature and efficacy will ensure their viability and evolution in the future. In this article we review the indications for percutaneous ablation, evaluation of the potential patient, an overview of the ablation options currently available, procedural details, potential complications, and expected results and follow-up.

### Image-guided percutaneous ablation for the treatment of lung malignancies: current state of the art [^ef3f26eb]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Image-guided percutaneous lung ablation has proven to be a valid treatment alternative in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma or oligometastatic lung disease. Available ablative modalities include radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation. Currently, there are no sufficiently representative studies to determine significant differences between the results of these techniques. However, a common feature among them is their excellent tolerance with very few complications. For optimal treatment, radiologists must carefully select the patients to be treated, perform a refined ablative technique, and have a detailed knowledge of the radiological features following lung ablation. Although no randomized studies comparing image-guided percutaneous lung ablation with surgery or stereotactic radiation therapy are available, the current literature demonstrates equivalent survival rates. This review will discuss image-guided percutaneous lung ablation features, including available modalities, approved indications, possible complications, published results, and future applications.

### Is there a role for percutaneous ablation for early stage lung cancer? What is the evidence? [^6059fa52]. Current Oncology Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

For patients with early stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), thermal ablation (TA) has become in the least two decades an option of treatment used worldwide for patients with comorbidities who are not surgical candidates. Here, we review data published with different TA techniques: radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA) and cryoablation. This paper reviews also the comparison that has been made between TA and stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT).

Recent Findings

A majority of retrospective studies, the absence of comparative studies, and the variety of techniques make difficult to get evident data. Nevertheless, these stand-alone techniques have demonstrated local efficacy for tumors less than 3 cm and good tolerance on fragile patients. Many recent reviews and database analyses show that outcomes after TA (mainly RFA and MWA) are comparable to SBRT in terms of survival rates. For patients who are unfit for surgery, TA has demonstrated interesting results for safety, benefits in overall survival, and acceptable local control.

SIR position statement on lung ablation—choice of modality: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation (CA), and microwave ablation (MWA) are all appropriate modalities for image-guided thermal ablation of primary or secondary lung tumors, and the method of ablation should be determined by lesion characteristics and risk mitigation and should be left to the discretion of the operating physician (Level of Evidence, C; Strength of Recommendation, Weak).

### Long-term outcomes in percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for histologically proven colorectal lung metastasis [^350c1855]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 3 
Surgical studies focusing on colorectal lung metastases with reported 5-year survival data

Although microwave ablation (MWA) has theoretical advantages over RFA, such as less heat sink effect and potentially more uniform ablation zones in a shorter time [,–], the LUMIRA RCT has found no statistically significant difference between MWA and RFA in terms of survival. In 2019, a meta-analysis of 53 studies showed the 5-year OS rates for RFA-treated patients (n = 738) were higher compared with MWA-treated patients (n = 469) (P < 0.001) and treatment with RFA was correlated with a longer median OS of 34.8 months compared to 18.7 for MWA. Confounding factors may be that RFA is better known and has been used for longer, with more reproducible results, whereas MWA is a newer modality with smaller study sample sizes. Larger groups with longer follow-up periods are required before firm conclusions can be drawn.

Currently, no RCT exists that compares thoracic surgery versus image-guided ablation and will be difficult to achieve. The recent Pulmonary Metastasectomy in Colorectal Cancer (PulMiCC) trial (comparing surgery vs active monitoring) had to be stopped due to failure to recruit the required number of patients. An RCT in the setting of colorectal lung metastases would also be of questionable value, given many patients receive multiple different treatment modalities throughout their course. Registries can provide evidence of the technical success and safety of ablation in the context of treating metastatic disease.

The limitations of this study were the retrospective single-centre design with a small sample size. Given that only patients with histological proven cancer were included, this may have biased the results towards better outcomes if comorbid patients were not subjected to biopsy due to the inherent small additional risks of lung biopsy.

### Thermal ablation of colorectal lung metastases: retrospective comparison among laser-induced thermotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and microwave ablation [^d9430d86]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to retrospectively evaluate local tumor control, time to tumor progression, and survival rates among patients with lung metastatic colorectal cancer who have undergone ablation therapy performed using laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or microwave ablation (MWA).

Materials and Methods

Data for this retrospective study were collected from 231 CT-guided ablation sessions performed for 109 patients (71 men and 38 women; mean [± SD] age, 68.6 ± 11.2 years; range, 34-94 years) from May 2000 to May 2014. Twenty-one patients underwent LITT (31 ablations), 41 patients underwent RFA (75 ablations), and 47 patients underwent MWA (125 ablations). CT scans were acquired 24 hours after each therapy session and at follow-up visits occurring at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after ablation. Survival rates were calculated from the time of the first ablation session, with the use of Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. Changes in the volume of the ablated lesions were measured using the Kruskal-Wallis method.

Results

Local tumor control was achieved in 17 of 25 lesions (68.0%) treated with LITT, 45 of 65 lesions (69.2%) treated with RFA, and 91 of 103 lesions (88.3%) treated with MWA. Statistically significant differences were noted when MWA was compared with LITT at 18 months after ablation (p = 0.01) and when MWA was compared with RFA at 6 months (p = 0.004) and 18 months (p = 0.01) after ablation. The overall median time to local tumor progression was 7.6 months. The median time to local tumor progression was 10.4 months for lesions treated with LITT, 7.2 months for lesions treated with RFA, and 7.5 months for lesions treated with MWA, with no statistically significant difference noted. New pulmonary metastases developed in 47.6% of patients treated with LITT, in 51.2% of patients treated with RFA, and in 53.2% of patients treated with MWA. According to the Kaplan-Meier test, median survival was 22.1 months for patients who underwent LITT, 24.2 months for those receiving RFA, and 32.8 months for those who underwent MWA. The overall survival rate at 1, 2, and 4 years was 95.2%, 47.6%, and 23.8%, respectively, for patients treated with LITT; 76.9%, 50.8%, and 8.0%, respectively, for patients treated with RFA; and 82.7%, 67.5%, and 16.6%, respectively, for patients treated with MWA. The log-rank test revealed no statistically significant difference among LITT, RFA, and MWA. The progression-free survival rate at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years was 96.8%, 52.7%, 24.0%, and 19.1%, respectively, for patients who underwent LITT; 77.3%, 50.2%, 30.8%, and 16.4%, respectively, for patients who underwent RFA; and 54.6%, 29.1%, 10.0%, and 1.0%, respectively, for patients who underwent MWA, with no statistically significant difference noted among the three ablation methods.

Conclusion

LITT, RFA, and MWA can be used as therapeutic options for lung metastases resulting from colorectal cancer. Statistically significant differences in local tumor control revealed a potential advantage in using MWA. No differences in time to tumor progression or survival rates were detected when the three different ablation methods were compared.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). High credibility.

Colorectal cancer pulmonary metastases—retrospective single-arm trials, databases, and a systematic review report survival, local control, and progression-free outcomes after radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), and CA. In unresectable metastases, RFA yielded overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 87%, 57%, and 57%; MWA reported 1-, 2-, and 3-year local tumor progression-free survival (PFS) of 93%, 86%, and 86% with 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of 94% and 99%, 82% and 90%, and 61% and 70%; and CA showed 1- and 3-year local progression-free interval rates of 90.8% and 59% with OS of 91% and 59.6%. A larger series found OS at 1, 2, and 5 years of 95% (95% CI, 90.9–97.3), 85.5% (95% CI, 79.6–89.9), and 54.7% (95% CI, 45.4–63.1), with median chemotherapy-free survival of 12.2 months (95% CI, 10.3–17.7). In a database of 191 patients treated with RFA, 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 92.9%, 76.1% and 56%, and PFS at 1, 3, and 5 years was 37.6%, 17% and 14.8%. A systematic review of eight RFA studies (n = 903) reported OS ranges of 84%–95%, 35%–72%, and 20%–54% at 1, 3, and 5 years and local progression rates of 9% to 21%, while reported 5-year OS after complete surgical resection ranged from 27% to 68%.

Image-guided thermal ablation versus surgical resection in stage I non-small cell lung cancer—In a Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results–Medicare propensity-matched cohort, overall survival (OS) and lung cancer–specific survival (CSS) showed no statistically significant differences between sublobar resection and ablation (P = .695; P = .819), whereas a National Cancer Database study reported 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year relative survival of 90%, 73%, 58%, and 37% for ablation versus 96%, 90%, 84%, and 71% for sublobar resection with a hazard ratio (HR) 1.90 (95% CI, 1.73–2.10). Retrospective comparisons of microwave ablation (MWA) and lobectomy found no significant differences, with 1- and 2-year OS of 97.82% and 91.30% versus 97.56% and 90.59% and similar 2-year disease-free survival, and in a propensity score–matched analysis 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS were 100%, 92.6%, and 50% for MWA and 100%, 90.7%, and 46.3% for lobectomy (P = .608). Studies of sublobar resection versus ablation reported no significant OS differences at 3 years across sublobar resection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and cryoablation (CA) (87.1%, 87.5%, and 77%; P > .05), and after adjusting for age and tumor size no differences were found in OS or progression-free survival (PFS) (HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 0.77–9.59; P = .121; and HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 0.82–3.92; P = .143). A larger retrospective series reported 5-year OS and PFS of 59.7% and 35.9% for RFA versus 71.0% and 61.9% for sublobar resection, but following propensity score matching the groups were not significantly different (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.28–1.10; P = .090). No systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses were found comparing IGTA and surgical resection in stage I NSCLC.

### Percutaneous radiofrequency versus microwave ablation for the treatment of colorectal liver metastases (...) [^5d233b23]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract 401 Background: Microwave and radiofrequency ablation are commonly used for the treatment of unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer. MWA has a few theoretical advantages over RFA however limited data exists on this field. Our aim was to analyse the safety and efficacy of MWA and RFA in the treatment of CRC liver metastases. Methods: All patients with unresectable CRC liver metastasis who were treated with RFA or MWA in a single center between March 2006 and December 2016 were included. Medical records and imaging studies were reviewed retrospectively for demographic data, to assess for local tumour recurrence and overall survival and to evaluate ablation-related adverse events. RFA was used in 343 procedures and MWA in 113. Median number of procedures per patient was
2. Median lesion size was 17mm.

Mean follow-up per lesion was 2. 0 years in the RFA group and
1. 3 years in the MWA group. Local tumour recurrence rate was 45% for RFA and 28% for MWA, with a hazard ratio of 0. 6 in favour of MWA. Two and five year overall survival rates from diagnosis of liver metastasis were 88% and 35% for RFA and 89% and 66% for MWA, respectively. Complications classified as CTCAE grade 3 or higher were: haemothorax requiring surgery, biloma, biliary stricture, liver failure, liver abscess, pneumonia and pulmonary embolism. Segmental portal vein occlusion was only seen with MWA. One patient died due to multi-organ failure post RFA. Conclusions: MWA could achieve better local tumour control compared with RFA in the treatment of CRC liver metastasis, with slightly higher complication rate.

### The role of percutaneous image-guided thermal ablation for the treatment of pulmonary malignancies [^95dbd08c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Image-guided thermal ablation is a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with primary and secondary pulmonary malignancies. Modalities include radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation.

Conclusion

Although no large randomized studies exist comparing ablation to surgery or radiotherapy, numerous studies have reported safety and efficacy for the treatment of both primary and metastatic disease in select patients. Future studies will refine patient selection, procedural technique, and assessment for local recurrence and will evaluate long-term survival.

### Thermal ablation of lung tumors [^293217a1]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The 5-year survival for all stages of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains bleak, having increased from 13% to just 16% over the past 30 years. Despite promising results in nonoperative patients with NSCLC and pulmonary metastatic disease, thermal ablation appears to be limited by large tumor size and proximity to large vessels. This article discusses the particular challenges of performing thermal ablation in aerated lung tissue and reviews important considerations in performing ablation including treatment complications and imaging follow-up. The article compares and contrasts the three major thermal ablation modalities: radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation.

### Transbronchial microwave ablation under electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic guidance is a versatile strategy for multiple lung malignancies (...) [^596bbf5f]. ASCO Daily News (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points:
- Multifocal lung cancers detected by screening present diagnostic challenges and management dilemmas.
- Transbronchial microwave ablation of lung nodules is a novel, reliable local therapy that carries less risk and provides greater lung access than other radiotherapy and surgical approaches in select patients.
- With promising midterm local control rates, as indicated in ongoing studies, transbronchial microwave ablation shows utility and promise in the management of multiple lung malignancies. Transbronchial Microwave Ablation Transbronchial microwave ablation of lung nodules is a novel and reliable local therapy that has been developed in the past 5 years. In theory, the transbronchial approach—as opposed to the percutaneous approach—carries less risk of pneumothorax, BPF, and pleural effusion because it avoids transpleural puncture.

8 It also provides access to the deep centrally-located area and other locations in the lung that are otherwise difficult to reach percutaneously—for example, the inferior medial aspect, the apical lung, and areas shielded by the scapula. In contrast to radiofrequency energy, microwave energy produces larger and more predictable ablation zones in less time, owing to less heat-sink effects and heat propagation by dielectric hysteresis rather than conduction alone. 9, 10 This is especially important in the human lung, which has one of the highest impedances among all organs. One-stop treatment of multiple nodules is attractive to patients, as the alternative usually requires multiple sessions over weeks. The radiation dose calculation may be difficult in cases involving multiple lung nodules, but is of less concern for multiple ablations. However, for nodules between 2 and 3 cm, SBRT may provide better coverage.

In general, transbronchial thermal ablation is not recommended for nodules that are more than 3 cm in size. The Table summarizes our experience above with transbronchial microwave ablation for multiple lung malignancies. Conclusion Transbronchial microwave ablation in the hybrid operating room is a novel, safe, and versatile local treatment strategy for malignant lung nodules, with promising midterm local control rates. Its utility is most profound in the management of multiple lung malignancies, where lung preservation is of paramount importance and multiple targets can be ablated and resected in the same setting, leading to shorter overall anesthetic time, lower hospital cost, and higher patient satisfaction.

### Lung ablation: best practice / results / response assessment / role alongside other ablative therapies [^08e8bb29]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Today, in addition to surgery, other local therapies are available for patients with small-size non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and oligometastatic disease from various cancers. Local therapies include stereotactic ablation radiotherapy (SABR) and thermal ablative therapies through percutaneously inserted applicators. Although radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been explored in series with several hundreds of patients with pulmonary tumours, investigation of the potential of other ablation technologies including microwave ablation, cryoablation, and irreversible electroporation is ongoing. There are no randomised studies available to compare surgery, SABR, and thermal ablation. In small-size lung metastases, RFA seems to produce results very close to surgical series with >90% local control and 5-year overall survival of 50%. In primary lung cancer, the technique is reserved for non-surgical candidates. In future, the low invasiveness of thermal ablative therapies will allow for a combination of ablation and systemic therapies in order to improve the outcomes of ablation alone. Another major advantage of thermal ablation is the possibility to treat several metastases in close proximity to one another and retreatment in the same location in case of failure, which is not possible with SABR.

### Microwave ablation: principles and applications [^6c632b5a]. Radiographics (2005). Low credibility.

Microwave ablation is the most recent development in the field of tumor ablation. The technique allows for flexible approaches to treatment, including percutaneous, laparoscopic, and open surgical access. With imaging guidance, the tumor is localized, and a thin (14.5-gauge) microwave antenna is placed directly into the tumor. A microwave generator emits an electromagnetic wave through the exposed, noninsulated portion of the antenna. Electromagnetic microwaves agitate water molecules in the surrounding tissue, producing friction and heat, thus inducing cellular death via coagulation necrosis. The main advantages of microwave technology, when compared with existing thermoablative technologies, include consistently higher intratumoral temperatures, larger tumor ablation volumes, faster ablation times, and an improved convection profile. Microwave ablation has promising potential in the treatment of primary and secondary liver disease, primary and secondary lung malignancies, renal and adrenal tumors, and bone metastases. The technology is still in its infancy, and future developments and clinical implementation will help improve the care of patients with cancer.

### Stereotactic body radiation therapy and thermal ablation for treatment of patients with pulmonary metastases: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^320781aa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Twenty-five to thirty percent of patients with malignant tumors will eventually get a pulmonary metastasis, making it one of the most frequent sites of tumor metastasis. Common primary tumors that metastasize to the lung include the breast, lung, colorectal, head/neck, kidney, skin, gynecological organs, and sarcomas. Survival of patients with pulmonary metastases remains inadequate with five-year survival rates ranging from 29% to 94% (dependent upon primary tumor histology). Systemic chemotherapy is a hallmark of treatment in this patient population, however, these patients are still considered incurable.

Local treatments can be an option for a subset of patients with limited metastatic disease. Surgery (referred to as metastasectomy) can be an effective treatment, however, some patients may not be eligible due to presence of multiple tumors, tumor location, comorbidities, or inadequate pulmonary reserve. Other non-surgical local treatments such as image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA) (radiofrequency ablation [RFA] and microwave ablation [MWA]) or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) are also used in clinical practice. Microwave ablation is performed by inserting an antenna into tumors, heating the tissue to approximately 100°C with application of an electromagnetic field that causes dielectric polarization, resulting in coagulation of neoplastic cells and parenchyma, leading to necrosis. For RFA, frequencies from 450 to 500 kHz are applied resulting in resistive heating in the tissue surrounding the electrode. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is an external beam radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation to damage cancer cells in fractionated doses.

Studies comparing non-surgical approaches such as IGTA and SBRT are lacking, making comprehensive assessment of these different techniques challenging. SBRT may have limited efficacy in lung tumors with relatively radioresistant histologies (e.g. colorectal carcinoma [CRC], renal cell carcinoma [RCC], and sarcoma). Thus, as tumor histology may be an important predictor of outcomes in patients with pulmonary metastases, exploration of the outcome differences between SBRT and IGTA in patients with lung tumors from these specific histologies may be valuable. Moreover, to date there are no systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and metaanalyses comparing IGTA to SBRT in the treatment of patients with pulmonary metastases. The aim of this study was to compare local tumor progression (LTP) and overall survival (OS) after IGTA and SBRT in patients with pulmonary metastases using single-arm pooled metaanalyses and metaregressions.

### Update on image-guided thermal lung ablation: society guidelines, therapeutic alternatives, and postablation imaging findings [^d596278c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2022). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA) has been endorsed by multiple societies as a safe and effective lung-preserving treatment of primary lung cancer and metastases involving the lung and chest wall. This article reviews the role of IGTA in the care continuum of patients with thoracic neoplasms and discusses strategies to identify the optimal local therapy considering patient and tumor characteristics. The advantages and disadvantages of percutaneous thermal ablation compared with surgical resection and stereotactic body radiotherapy are summarized. Principles of radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation, as well as the emerging use of transbronchial thermal ablation, are described. Specific considerations are presented regarding the role of thermal ablation for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multifocal primary NSCLC, pulmonary metastases, salvage of recurrent NSCLC after surgery or radiation, and pain palliation for tumors involving the chest wall. Recent changes to professional society guidelines regarding the role of thermal ablation in the lung, including for treatment of oligometastatic disease, are highlighted. Finally, recommendations are provided for imaging follow-up after thermal ablation of lung tumors, accompanied by examples of expected postoperative findings and patterns of disease recurrence.

Comparison of image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA) techniques—systematic reviews and meta-analyses report no significant difference in overall survival between RFA (n = 246) and MWA (n = 319) for thoracic cancer at 1 year (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.63–1.44), 2 years (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.70–1.44), and 3 years (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.42–1.18). In an indirect comparison including 53 studies, median OS did not differ between RFA (24.4 months; 95% CI, 16.9–31.8 months) and MWA (28.4 months; 95% CI, 20.9–35.8 months). A network meta-analysis of 34 studies (n = 1,840 patients) found local progression rates of 19.8% for RFA, 23.7% for CA, and 10.9% for MWA (with follow-up periods of 12–47 months); RFA and MWA were significantly more effective for local control than CA (OR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.004–0.38; P = .005; and OR, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.002–0.24; P = .001), with comparable progression between RFA and MWA (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.04–10.39; P = .745). Weighted average overall survival rates were reported for RFA (84.3%, 66.8%, 62.4%, 55.1%, 43.5%), CA (86.5%, 73.5%, 71.2%), and MWA (82.5%, 54.6%, 35.7%, 29.6%, 16.6%), and there was no difference in safety between CA and RFA (P = .974) and MWA and RFA (P = .979). Although there have been no direct comparisons of the different IGTA techniques, based on the current available indirect evidence, all three are valid options for lung ablation.

### Image-guided percutaneous ablation for the treatment of lung malignancies: current state of the art [^b359de3f]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung cancer has long been the leading cause of cancer incidence, with around 2.1 million new cases each year and cancer-related mortality worldwide, representing close to 1 in 5 (18.4%) cancer-related deaths. Similarly, the lung is the second most common site for metastases from other malignant tumors. Furthermore, the widespread use of chest computed tomography (CT) has dramatically increased the early detection of potentially treatable lung tumors. Many advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of malignant lung tumors. Although surgical resection remains the gold-standard treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the increasing number of patients with comorbidities or other reasons for inoperability has led to an increase in the use of less invasive therapeutic options. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of metastasectomy for the treatment of oligometastatic lung disease (OLD). Thus, as in the NSLCL, minimally invasive techniques have emerged as an option for inoperable patients.

In this regard, image-guided percutaneous lung ablation has significantly improved in recent years. Several advances regarding ablative modalities, procedure performance, patient selection improvements, and a greater understanding of the imaging findings observed after the procedure have been accomplished, especially in patients with NSCLC or OLD. Currently, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), and cryoablation (CA) are the only percutaneous ablative modalities with proven efficacy and safety in the treatment of lung malignancies. They all have shown reasonable local disease control with acceptable complication rates while preserving lung function.

This review will discuss the different ablative modalities available, current indications, and the preprocedural management of image-guided percutaneous lung ablation. It will also address the most relevant aspects of treatment follow-up, imaging findings after the procedure, and the results obtained in the most relevant research studies published to date.

introduction

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) aims at destroying small tumor deposits by applying thermal energy under image guidance. When compared with other organs, there are organ-specific differences favoring RFA in the lung, the same quantity of energy results in larger ablation volume in lung, due to heat insulation and low electric conductivity provided by the lung around the tumor. A clinical study demonstrated 100% necrosis at histopathology for nine of nine lung metastases targeted with RFA. Lung RFA has been reported first in man in 2000.

The aim of this study was to evaluate results of RFA of lung metastases in terms of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (PFS), local ablation efficacy, and to define the parameters associated with better outcomes.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction—lung cancer epidemiology and image-guided tumor ablation (IGTA) context presents disease burden and therapeutic positioning. An estimated 228,820 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed in 2020 in the United States, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 80%–85% of primary lung cancers. While surgery is the preferred treatment for resectable early-stage lung cancer and lung metastases, only a minority of patients meet resection criteria; for surgically inoperable patients or those who refuse surgery, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and IGTA are alternative options. Percutaneous IGTA can employ radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation (CA), or microwave ablation (MWA); IGTA is listed in National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. The Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) states its position on IGTA for early-stage NSCLC (stage I), recurrent lung cancer, and metastatic disease to the lungs.

### Image-guided percutaneous ablation for the treatment of lung malignancies: current state of the art [^2b6de358]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Unlike NSCLC, several published studies have evaluated the value of MWA in OLD. One of the first prospective studies published evaluated 80 patients with unresectable lung metastases treated with MWA. At 12 and 24 months, the OS rates were 91.3% and 75%. Furthermore, as in RFA, size was the main predictor of therapeutic success, with incomplete ablation more likely in lesions > 3 cm. There was also a better technical success in peripheral lesions than those close to the pulmonary hilum. Another retrospective study compared MWA, RFA, and LITT results in 109 patients with lung metastases from colorectal carcinoma. Local tumor control rates were 68.0% for LITT, 69.2% for RFA, and 88.3% for MWA, with statistically significant differences between MWA and the other two techniques. The median time of local tumor progression published for each technique was 10.4 months for LITT, 7.2 months for RFA, and 7.5 months for MWA, as well as OS of 22.1 months for LITT, 24.2 months for RFA, and 32.8 months for MWA. A much recent published meta-analysis compared the results obtained between RFA and MWA in the ablative treatment of pulmonary metastases, with a total inclusion of 3,432 patients. Patients treated with RFA presented an OS and a survival rate at 1,- 2,- 3, and 5 years higher than the MWA branch, reporting similar local recurrence rates between the two techniques. However, given the studies' heterogeneity, the high probability of publication bias, especially in the RFA branch, and a lower number of patients in the MWA group, one technique's superiority over the other could not be definitively concluded. In conclusion, MWA has proven to be a technique at least as effective and safe as RFA in OLD's ablative treatment. However, prospective randomized studies comparing both techniques are still needed.

### Standardizing percutaneous microwave ablation in the treatment of lung tumors: a prospective multicenter trial (MALT study) [^158a1cfe]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To prospectively assess reproducibility, safety, and efficacy of microwave ablation (MWA) in the treatment of unresectable primary and secondary pulmonary tumors.

Methods

Patients with unresectable primary and metastatic lung tumors up to 4 cm were enrolled in a multicenter prospective clinical trial and underwent CT-guided MWA. Treatments were delivered using pre-defined MW power and duration settings, based on target tumor size and histology classifications. Patients were followed for up to 24 months. Treatment safety, efficacy, and reproducibility were assessed. Ablation volumes were measured at CT scan and compared with ablation volumes obtained on ex vivo bovine liver using equal treatment settings.

Results

From September 2015 to September 2017, 69 MWAs were performed in 54 patients, achieving technical success in all cases and treatment completion without deviations from the standardized protocol in 61 procedures (88.4%). Immediate post-MWA CT scans showed ablation dimensions smaller by about 25% than in the ex vivo model; however, a remarkable volumetric increase (40%) of the treated area was observed at 1 month post-ablation. No treatment-related deaths nor complications were recorded. Treatments of equal power and duration yielded fairly reproducible ablation dimensions at 48-h post-MWA scans. In comparison with the ex vivo liver model, in vivo ablation sizes were systematically smaller, by about 25%. Overall LPR was 24.7%, with an average TLP of 8.1 months. OS rates at 12 and 24 months were 98.0% and 71.3%, respectively.

Conclusions

Percutaneous CT-guided MWA is a reproducible, safe, and effective treatment for malignant lung tumors up to 4 cm in size.

Key Points

• Percutaneous MWA treatment of primary and secondary lung tumors is a repeatable, safe, and effective therapeutic option. • It provides a fairly reproducible performance on both the long and short axis of the ablation zone. • When using pre-defined treatment duration and power settings according to tumor histology and size, LPR does not increase with increasing tumor size (up to 4 cm) for both primary and metastatic tumors.

Results

Literature search and study characteristics

The systematic search for studies on MWA, RFA, and SBRT identified 13,316 records which included non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and patients with pulmonary metastases. After the removal of duplicate records, 9,338 abstracts were screened with 8,508 excluded (e.g. nonhuman, population out of scope; Fig. 1). Eight hundred thirty studies that included NSCLC and patients with pulmonary metastases were screened in fulltext and 452 studies were excluded. Ninety two arms (from 88 studies) were included that enrolled patients with pulmonary metastases who were treated with IGTA (n = 35 study arms with 3,264 patients) or SBRT (n = 57 study arms with 5,486 patients; Table 1). Due to the PICOS criteria (i.e. inclusion of patients with pulmonary metastases and active sites of disease outside the lung), the patients with pulmonary metastases group analyzed here may include some stage IV NSCLC patients that were amenable to local treatment. However, the results of this manuscript will refer to this group as simply patients with pulmonary metastases, and additionally will refer to study arms as studies for brevity. Table 1 presents baseline characteristics for included studies on patients with pulmonary metastases. Table 7 of the Online Supplement provides the type of primary cancer for both study arms.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: a research framework for pulmonary nodule evaluation and management [^3a64079e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Emerging treatments for early-stage lung cancer—stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and other ablative therapies—directly impact the evaluation of pulmonary nodules and thus should be rigorously evaluated; a variety of ablative therapies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, and microwave ablation have been used for inoperable patients, but there are no randomized trials comparing ablative therapies to surgery and recent studies of SBRT versus sublobar resection were terminated early due to poor accrual; it will be important to compare the efficacy and effectiveness of emerging therapies to surgery to guide decision-making about the risks and benefits of different evaluation strategies and treating patients with pulmonary nodules that may not be cancerous.

### Transbronchial microwave ablation of peripheral lung tumors: the NAVABLATE study [^3364739a]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

The increased adoption of lung cancer screening and incidental nodule management programs has improved the detection of tumors in the lung.While surgical resection remains the gold standard approach to treat small, localized malignant nodules, many patients are ineligible for surgical resection due to comorbidities. Local therapies, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or thermal ablation, are recognized alternatives, especially for medically inoperable patients.

Thermal ablation is a minimally invasive treatment option that is available for solitary lung tumors or selected metastatic tumors.Energy sources include radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), and cryoablation.In a meta-analysis of 34 studies of primary and metastatic lung cancer, the weighted average local recurrence rates following percutaneous ablation were 19.8% for RFA and 10.9% for MWA.In a meta-analysis of 53 studies, the median local tumor progression-free survival was 22 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.8–32.2) for RFA and 31.5 months (95% CI 19.0–44.0) for MWA.However, percutaneous thermal ablation carries a pooled pneumothorax risk of 34.3% (95% CI 25.9%–43.1%) following RFA and 33.9% (95% CI 23.8%–44.8%) following MWA, with intervention required in 12.3% (95% CI 6.8%–19.1%) and 11.0% (95% CI 4.5%–19.7%), respectively.

Transbronchial thermal ablation – may provide effective local control with a lower complication risk than percutaneous approaches. Transbronchial ablation may be associated with less pain than a percutaneous approach, more preserved lung function than surgery, and unlike SBRT, allows for repeated ablations in the event of local recurrence.The transbronchial approach also provides the ability to diagnose, stage with endobronchial ultrasound, and treat all in the same minimally invasive procedure based on current data. Several single-center retrospective studies and case reports have been published describing the use of transbronchial MWA for the local treatment of primary and metastatic tumors in the lung., The current paper is the largest prospective, multicenter evaluation of transbronchial microwave ablation in the lung.

### Expert consensus document on pulmonary metastasectomy [^fdb4b60f]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Nonsurgical local treatment modalities—thermal ablation for pulmonary metastases were reviewed with inclusion limited to studies with 20 or more patients and a minimum reported 3-year overall survival (OS); no randomized studies exist. Thermal ablation options include radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave, and cryotherapy, but no studies compare available systems or modalities and all studies meeting inclusion criteria used RFA. RFA studies allowed tumors with diameters up to 80 mm, and the largest ablation series included 566 patients (293 colorectal, 51 sarcoma); among colorectal metastases, size (>2 cm) and number of metastases (>3) were both significantly associated with poorer survival. In a prospective open-label Australian series of 148 nonresectable colorectal patients, median survival was 50 months and 5-year survival was 45%. For sarcoma, 3-year survival was 85% in 266 patients with metastases sized 2 cm or less, and although another study included tumors up to 70 mm, 3-year survival for sarcoma patients was 58%.

### Tumor ablation: common modalities and general practices [^82c8de09]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Tumor ablation is a minimally invasive technique that is commonly used in the treatment of tumors of the liver, kidney, bone, and lung. During tumor ablation, thermal energy is used to heat or cool tissue to cytotoxic levels (less than -40°C or more than 60°C). An additional technique is being developed that targets the permeability of the cell membrane and is ostensibly nonthermal. Within the classification of tumor ablation, there are several modalities used worldwide: radiofrequency, microwave, laser, high-intensity focused ultrasound, cryoablation, and irreversible electroporation. Each technique, although similar in purpose, has specific and optimal indications. This review serves to discuss general principles and technique, reviews each modality, and discusses modality selection.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^48a60b54]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Tumor ablation for colorectal cancer oligometastases—Resection is the standard approach for the local treatment of resectable metastatic disease, but patients with liver or lung oligometastases can also be considered for tumor ablation therapy when resection may not be optimal or for resectable disease that can be ablated with sufficient margins within the “test of time”; ablative techniques include radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), cryoablation, and electrocoagulation (irreversible electroporation). There is extensive evidence on the use of RFA as a reasonable treatment option for non-surgical candidates and for recurrent disease after hepatectomy with small liver metastases that can be treated with clear margins, and more recent data describe outcomes of MWA that have been superior to RFA.

Results

Characteristics of included studies

As depicted in Fig. 1, a total of 266 and 31 articles were initially identified from databases searching and citation searching, respectively. After screening by reviewing title, abstract and full text, 12 articles were finally included in the meta-analysis [,–]. The characteristics of included articles were summarized in Table 1. All the studies were conducted in China, with a total of 1282 patients included. One study included patients with lung metastases from colorectal cancer. Most of the study population were with advanced lung cancer (stage IIIb-IV). Half of the studies were randomized performed. As for the technique of ablation, 5 and 7 studies used RFA and MWA, respectively. The outcomes of patients in each study were listed in Table 2.

### Update on treatment of liver metastases: focus on ablation therapies [^b13a2aeb]. Current Oncology Reports (2015). Low credibility.

There is substantial and growing interest in the use of local therapies to treat patients with metastatic cancer, especially those deemed to have "oligometastatic" disease. Much of the literature to date consists of reports on metastasectomy for liver and lung metastases. Non-surgical minimally or non-invasive treatments including thermal ablation, irreversible electroporation, and high-dose radiation therapy (stereotactic ablative radiation therapy) can also be used in the treatment of primary and secondary tumors, including in the treatment of liver metastases. In this review, we discuss the rationale for using these ablative treatments in the treatment of liver metastases including similarities and differences between them.

### Ablative and catheter-directed therapies for colorectal liver and lung metastases [^cabfb5d4]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Increasing data on treatment of liver metastases with locoregional therapies have solidified the expanding role of interventional radiologists (IRs) in the treatment of liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Ablative approaches such as radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation have shown durable eradication of tumors. Catheter-directed therapies such as transarterial chemoembolization, drug-eluting beads, yttrium-90 radioembolization, and intra-arterial chemotherapy ports represent potential techniques for managing patients with unresectable liver metastases. Understanding the timing and role of these techniques in multidisciplinary care of patients is crucial. Implementation of IRs for consultation enables better integration of these therapies into patients' overall care.

### Comparison of percutaneous image-guided microwave ablation and cryoablation for sarcoma lung metastases: a 10-year experience [^f6102b58]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2022). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND . To our knowledge, outcomes between percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) and cryoablation of sarcoma lung metastases have not been compared. OBJECTIVE . The purpose of this study was to compare technical success, complications, local tumor control, and overall survival (OS) after MWA versus cryoablation of sarcoma lung metastases. METHODS . This retrospective cohort study included 27 patients (16 women, 11 men; median age, 64 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score, 0-2) who, from 2009 to 2021, underwent 39 percutaneous CT-guided ablation sessions (21 MWA and 18 cryoablation sessions; one to four sessions per patient) to treat 65 sarcoma lung metastases (median number of tumors per patient, one [range, one to 12]; median tumor diameter, 11.0 mm [range, 5-33 mm]; 25% of tumors were nonperipheral). We compared complications according to ablation modality by use of generalized estimating equations. We evaluated ablation modality, tumor size, and location (peripheral vs nonperipheral) in relation to local tumor progression by use of proportional Cox hazard models, with death as the competing risk. We estimated OS using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS . Primary technical success was 97% for both modalities. Median follow-up was 23 months (range, one to 102 months; interquartile range, 12-44 months). A total of seven of 61 tumors (11%) showed local progression. Estimated 1-year and 2-year local control rates were, for tumors 1 cm or smaller, 97% and 95% after MWA versus 99% and 98% after cryoablation, and for tumors larger than 1 cm, 74% and 62% after MWA versus 86% and 79% after cryoablation. Tumor size of 1 cm or smaller was associated with a decreased cumulative incidence of local progression ( p = .048); ablation modality and tumor location were not associated with progression ( p = .86 and p = .54, respectively). Complications (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade, ≤ 3) occurred in 17 of 39 sessions (44%), prompting chest tube placement in nine (23%). There were no CTCAE grade 4 or 5 complications. OS at 1, 2, and 3 years was 100%, 89%, and 82%, respectively. CONCLUSION . High primary technical success, local control, and OS support the use of MWA and cryoablation for treating sarcoma lung metastases. Ablation modality and tumor location did not affect local progression. The rate of local tumor progression was low, especially for small tumors. No life-threatening complications occurred. CLINICAL IMPACT . Percutaneous MWA and cryoablation are both suited for the treatment of sarcoma lung metastases, especially for tumors 1 cm or smaller, whether peripheral or nonperipheral. Complications, if they occur, are not life-threatening.

### Dual-energy CT after radiofrequency ablation of liver, kidney, and lung lesions: a review of features [^93e5b2e5]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The typical finding on lung window CT during and after RF ablation is ground-glass opacification surrounding the treated tumour, which is fully circumferential (Fig. 8) in the majority of cases, but can also be partial (Fig. 9a). It is less common to find ground-glass opacification along the electrode tract. These ground-glass changes typically lead to an overestimation of the necrosis zone by 2–4 mm. The distinction between the inner necrotic zone and the outer haemorrhagic viable zone is not clear on CT imaging; thus, the effective necrotic zone is easily overestimated. As a result, the boundary between the ablated and non-ablated zones cannot be clearly defined using traditional morphologic imaging (Fig. 7b).

Fig. 9 
Pulmonary metastases. A focal lung nodule is found in a 65-year-old female diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma. A biopsy reveals a non-small-cell carcinoma. A multidisciplinary team meeting leads to the choice for RF ablation treatment. Coronal reconstructions of the lesion in the right upper lobe before (first column), 24 h after the first RF ablation (second column), and 24 h after microwave ablation (third column) are demonstrated. a A focal nodule of 9 mm in the upper lobe is seen on the 70-keV lung window (black arrow) prior to the ablation. This nodule is “enhanced” on the synthesised monochromatic images compared to the water map image. This “increase in density” is better appreciated on the 40-keV rather than on the 70-keV images. Twenty-four hours after the first ablation, the spicular nodule appears enlarged on the lung windows. On the 40-keV image, a focal enhancement (arrow) is noted at the inferior border of the ablation zone, again more clearly visible compared to the 70-keV image. After re-ablation with microwave technique, we notice more important changes on the lung window than after the first ablation. b The iodine content of the hypermetabolic lesion before the RF ablation is most observable on the greyscale- and colour-coded iodine images (circles). The nodule is hypermetabolic on PET/CT. Twenty-four hours after the first ablation, the greyscale- and colour-coded iodine maps clearly show the focal area of iodine uptake (white arrows) on the inferior border. PET/CT confirms hypermetabolic remnants (yellow arrow). After re-ablation, the larger area of thermal damage has lost its internal focal iodine uptake, which is most appreciable on the iodine-coded images (arrowheads). Images after the re-ablation lack FDG uptake on PET/CT

### National variation in pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal cancer [^e9f3efd8]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

‘Pulmonary metastasectomy in colorectal cancer’, published in 2020, was the first randomized trial on this topic. Patients were randomized to lung metastasectomy (N = 46) or control (N = 47) and 87% were followed for more than 5 years or until death. There was no significant difference comparing metastasectomy to controls; the hazard ratio (HR) for death was 0.93 (95% CI 0.56, 1.56). This puts into question the recommendations for practice from ACPGBI, Society of Thoracic Surgeons and NICE.

It had been estimated that 15%–25% of those with pulmonary metastases were being considered for local treatments. Traditionally surgery has been the main local treatment, but more recently image guided thermal ablation (IGTA), including radiofrequency, microwave or cryoablation, and stereotactic radiotherapy (variously abbreviated as SABR or SBRT) have been increasingly used as alternatives. Each has been tested in a randomized controlled trial but, unfortunately, both had major imbalances across trial arms so, again, it is not clear what constitutes gold standard care.

Further studies with an emphasis on understanding the extent and characteristics of patients with metastases are required. Arguably more information is required about the disease in its totality rather than outcomes amongst patients carefully selected for local treatments. Most existing studies on pulmonary metastasectomy are single‐centre surgical case series with very few population‐based cohorts or registry studies. When the larger series within these studies are considered, the incidence of pulmonary metastasectomy is estimated to be only around 2.5% of all colorectal cancer patients and 3.5%–5% of those with metastases at diagnosis. As such, pulmonary metastasectomy is clearly used in a highly selectively manner.

This population‐based study therefore aimed to investigate the use of pulmonary metastasectomy in the colorectal cancer population across the English NHS and to quantify the extent of any variations in practice and outcome.

### Radiofrequency ablation of lung malignancies: where do we stand? [^ebee0081]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation is a minimally invasive technique used to treat solid tumors. Because of its ability to produce large volumes of coagulation necrosis in a controlled fashion, this technique has gained acceptance as a viable therapeutic option for unresectable liver malignancies. Recently, investigation has been focused on the clinical application of RF ablation in the treatment of lung malignancies. In theory, lung tumors are well suited to RF ablation because the surrounding air in adjacent normal parenchyma provides an insulating effect, thus facilitating energy concentration within the tumor tissue. Experimental studies in rabbits have confirmed that lung RF ablation can be safely and effectively performed via a percutaneous, transthoracic approach, and have prompted the start of clinical investigation. Pilot clinical studies have shown that RF ablation enables successful treatment of relatively small lung malignancies with a high rate of complete response and acceptable morbidity, and have suggested that the technique could represent a viable alternate or complementary treatment method for patients with non-small cell lung cancer or lung metastases of favorable histotypes who are not candidates for surgical resection. This article gives an overview of lung RF ablation, discussing experimental animal findings, rationale for clinical application, technique and methodology, clinical results, and complications.

### The efficacy and safety of thermal ablation for patients with lung malignancy: a meta-analysis of 12 studies in China [^f1c09c07]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung malignancy is one of the most hard-to-treat types of cancer in recent years, with the death incidence being the first among all cancer types worldwide. Lung malignancy can be classified into primary diseases including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and metastatic diseases which most commonly originate from colorectal cancer. Among them, NSCLC is the predominant type which accounts for approximately 80% of total lung cancer cases, and NSCLC is frequently found as adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.During the recent decades, lung lobectomy has been the first choice in the curative treatment of lung malignancy. However, lung malignancy is difficult to detect and diagnose timely in the early stage due to its mild and obscured symptoms, and it is usually diagnosed when the cancer has progressed. Thus most patients with lung malignancy have missed the best time for surgical resection. Besides, quite a portion of patients are intolerable to major operation due to old age, underling diseases and poor pulmonary function. Patients with unresectable lung malignancy can only receive other treatments such as chemotherapy, EGFR-TKIs. Systemic chemotherapy as the major adjuvant therapy in the treatment of cancer has been widely applied in treating lung cancer. However, the survival benefit after chemotherapy remains limited and poor for patients with unresectable lung malignancy. Given above, a novel therapeutic regimen is necessary to improve the survival outcome of patients with unresectable disease.

Thermal ablation, including radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA), is an emerging non-operative therapeutic approach with minimally invasiveness. In recent years, thermal ablation has been extensively and successfully applied in the treatment of advanced primary and metastatic cancer which are usually unresectable. The working mechanism of thermal ablation is that tumor tissue turns into necrosis under the local high temperature environment mediated by radiofrequency current or microwave. Thermal ablation is a promising therapy with certain curative potential for lung malignancy. Currently, several studies have explored the efficacy and safety of thermal ablation in combination regimens in treating lung malignancy, and certain significance for short-term efficacy has been observed. However, as an invasive operation, thermal ablation is associated with various complications including pneumothorax, hemorrhage hemoptysis, pneumonia cavitation, etc. Therefore, the use of thermal ablation in treating lung malignancy should be given a further investigation on its effectiveness and safety.

In the present meta-analysis, we focused on investigating the clinical efficacy and safety of thermal ablation plus chemotherapy as compared with chemotherapy alone, and tried to provide a valuable reference for the future treatment of lung malignancy.

### Radiofrequency ablation is a valid treatment option for lung metastases: experience in 566 patients with 1037 metastases [^2a3a3f03]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

conclusion

We demonstrated in this report on a large series of RFA for lung metastases that OS after lung RFA is comparable with what reported in the surgical literature for lung metastasectomy, with superimposable predictive factors. RFA demonstrated a 53.7% 3-year, and a 44.1% 4-year control rate of lung metastatic disease in part due to the low invasiveness of RFA that allowed to repeat the procedure up to four times when needed. These results advocate RFA as an option for treatment of small size lung metastases, namely the ones below 2–3 cm.

### Radiofrequency ablation of lung malignancies [^ecc93131]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Radiofrequency ablation is a new technology that has been used successfully to treat hepatic tumors. Recently, an increasing number of reports have described the use of radiofrequency ablation for primary and metastatic lung tumors. Although such early experience appears promising, many questions regarding patient selection, radiofrequency ablation technique, effectiveness of ablation on lung tumors, radiographic follow-up, and survival remain unanswered. This article addresses these issues and provides the thoracic surgeon with a current review of the application of radiofrequency ablation to lung tumors.

### Systematic review of image-guided thermal ablation for treatment of high-risk patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer [^8853db8c]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA) applied to pulmonary pathology is an alternative to surgery in high-risk patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Its application to lung neoplasm was first introduced in 2001 and has been implemented to treat metastatic disease to the lung or in select medically inoperable patients with peripheral stage I NSCLC. IGTA may also be an alternative to treat stage I NSCLC in non-operable patients with interstitial lung disease in whom a radiation modality is deemed too high risk. There are 3 methods of delivery: radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation and cryoablation. Observational series and some prospective trials have shown safety and efficacy across all three modalities. Despite accumulating experience, there are no large randomized clinical trials comparing the outcomes of lung IGTA to alternative locoregional therapies (eg, stereotactic body radiotherapy or sublobar pulmonary resection) for the treatment of stage I NSCLC. Because IGTA is a local therapy, a higher risk of locoregional recurrence is inherently understood as compared with anatomic resection. In the literature, primary tumor control after RFA ranges from 47 to 90% and is dependent on tumor size and proximity to bronchovascular structures. Local failure ranges from 10 to 47%, and tumors ≥3 cm have the highest rate of local recurrence. The most prevalent side effects are pneumothorax and reactive pleural effusion; hemorrhage is uncommon. Of note, observational series show no significant loss of lung function after IGTA. This expert review contextualizes limitations, complications and outcomes of IGTA in patients with stage I NSCLC.

### Radiofrequency ablation is a valid treatment option for lung metastases: experience in 566 patients with 1037 metastases [^8a3905e4]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Predictive factors of OS after surgery were complete resection, location of primary disease, and DFI in 5206 patients, DFI, number of metastases and positive lymph nodes at pathology in a meta-analysis 2925 patients, and number of metastases, completeness of resection and pre-resection CarcinoEmbryonic (CEA) level in 1030 patient with CRC lung metastases. If we assimilate incomplete ablation by RF and incomplete resection at surgery, it is noteworthy that all our predictive factor of OS match predictive factors reports in major surgical series, excepted CEA level and lymph node involvement that were not available in our series.

Challenge of disease control in lung metastatic patients is more linked to the occurrence of new metastases distant from the ablation site than to local recurrences as demonstrated with lung progressions in 72.4% of patients. In such setting, RFA allows for possible retreatment due to good tolerance and lung parenchyma sparing with no change in respiratory function after RFA. Indeed, 24% of the initially treated patients were retreated by RF up to four times, resulting in 44.1% 4-year control rate of lung metastatic disease. Even if, RFA is mostly used today as a stand-alone technique, with the main objective of complete destruction of tumor cells in the targeted volume, its good tolerance might render easier pre-RFA or post-RFA systemic therapy feasible in an effort to decrease recurrences.

Composite scores reported in this study for PFS and OS will help to select the patients that would likely benefit from local treatment, and potentially may or may not need combined treatment including neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy associated with RFA according to the risk of recurrence. The possibility of performing biopsy at the time of RFA should be used more extensively in the future to help to define such strategy according to molecular biology of the targeted tumor.

limitations

Our study has some limitations. No confirmatory biopsy was carried out on a routine basis. Because of a previous known primary carcinoma in these patients, new discovery or enlarging focal pulmonary tumor and a standard uptake value >4 at PET/CT was considered diagnostic of malignant disease. Another limitation is that we included in this analysis different location of primary tumor, even if only metastasis of the rectal origin demonstrated differences and colonic metastases are analyzed separately. Another limitation is that our data were analyzed without taking into account the chemotherapy delivered before or after RFA that obviously may impact on PFS and OS.

### Lung ablation-how I do It [^e988cb78]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Interventional oncology and the value of thermal ablation of small tumors is increasingly recognized by the oncological community. Primary lung cancers and lung metastases have been one of the most researched applications of percutaneous ablation and as interventional oncologists gain more experience and confidence, it is becoming a more effective treatment with expanding indications. Importantly, the current literature does not demonstrate major differences in survival between ablation, sublobar resection, and stereotactic body radiation. The advantages of percutaneous ablation over other local therapies like surgery or SBRT are significantly lower morbidity, mortality, and repeatability of treatments. The focus of this essay is to highlight technical and procedural aspects of lung ablation as well as management and follow-up in a practical fashion.

Methods

Database search

We searched all articles focusing on the combination of thermal ablation plus chemotherapy in patients with either primary or metastatic lung malignancy in the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and the Cochrane Library. The databases were searched for studies published from inception to Jan 31, 2022. In PubMED database, we used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and text words to generate a three-check subset including thermal ablation, chemotherapy and lung malignancy. The following MeSH terms were used: “radiofrequency ablation” and “microwaves” for identifying the literature of thermal ablation; “chemotherapy, adjuvant” and “drug therapy”, for identifying the literature of chemotherapy; “carcinoma, non-small-cell lung”, “small cell lung cancer” and “lung neoplasms” for identifying the literature of lung malignancy. The following text words including “radiofrequency”, “RFA” and “MWA” were also used for searching literature of thermal ablation. The retrieval formula for this research was generated using “OR” to combine the MeSH terms and text words within each subset, and “AND” to connect the three subsets. Therefore, the generated retrieval formula in PubMed Database was: ((((((radiofrequency ablation[MeSH Terms]) OR (microwaves[MeSH Terms])) OR (radiofrequency[Title/Abstract])) OR (RFA[Title/Abstract])) OR (MWA[Title/Abstract])) AND ((chemotherapy, adjuvant[MeSH Terms]) OR (drug therapy[MeSH Terms]))) AND (((carcinoma, non-small-cell lung[MeSH Terms]) OR (small cell lung cancer[MeSH Terms])) OR (lung neoplasms[MeSH Terms])). The detailed retrieval formula in other databases including Web of Science, Embase and the Cochrane Library was provided in the Additional file 1 : Appendix Table.

Several factors are known to affect lung ablation zones. Questions remain as to why there are discrepancies between achieved and vendor-predicted ablation zones and what contributing factors can be modified to balance therapeutic effects with avoidance of complications. This retrospective study of lung tumour microwave ablation analyses day 1 post-treatment CT to assess the effects of lesion-specific and operator-dependent factors on ablation zones.

Consecutive patients treated at a tertiary centre from 2018 to 2021 were included. All ablations were performed using a single microwave ablation device under lung isolation. The lung tumours were categorised as primary or secondary, and their "resistance" to ablation was graded according to their locations. Intraprocedural pulmonary inflation was assessed as equal to or less than the contralateral non-isolated lung. Ablation energy was categorised as high, medium, or low. Ablation zone dimensions were measured on day 1 CT and compared to vendor reference charts. Ablations with multiple needle positions or indeterminate boundaries were excluded.

Results

A total of 47 lesions in 31 patients were analysed. Achieved long axes are longer than predicted by 5 mm or 14% (p<0.01) without overall short axis discrepancy. Secondary tumours (p=0.020), low-resistance location (p<0.01), good lung inflation (p<0.01), low (p=0.003) and medium (p=0.038) total energy produce lengthened long axes by 4-6 mm or 10-19%. High total energy results in shorter than predicated short axes by 6 mm or 18% (p=0.010).

Conclusion

We identified several factors affecting ablation zone dimensions which may have implications for ablation planning and the avoidance of complications.

### Image-guided combined ablation and resection in thoracic surgery for the treatment of multiple pulmonary metastases: a preliminary case series [^8d1d519c]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In patients presenting with multiple pulmonary metastases, staged procedures have historically been performed. The potential risk of this strategy is interim disease progression and subjecting the patient to multiple general anesthetics. Similarly, in the absence of a hybrid surgical suite with intraoperative imaging, the patient must be transferred from the radiology department to an operating room, which may risk dislodgement of localizing devices, discomfort for the patient, or anesthetic complications.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of combined percutaneous ablation and wire-assisted VATS wedge resection using image-guidance for the treatment of multiple pulmonary metastases. It appears to be safe and effective from our limited early experience and combines the advantages of tissue-preserving ablation and diagnostic wedge resection. It offers a minimally invasive personalized therapy that can be tailored to the individual patient's disease (Figure 4).

Figure 4 
Combined percutaneous ablation and wire-assisted VATS wedge resection with intraoperative image guidance can be used for patients with multiple pulmonary nodules in a single anesthetic without the need to transfer from radiology to an operating theatre. This minimally invasive procedure provides a comprehensive treatment strategy for a wide range of nodule characteristics, the demand for which is likely to increase significantly with the expansion of lung cancer screening.

Both wedge resection and ablation are demonstrated to improve survival in pulmonary metastasis, although they have never been compared in a randomized trial. Ablative techniques include cryoablation, RFA, and MWA. The majority of evidence relates to RFA; however, there is growing support for the superiority of MWA, which may have several advantages. Ablation speed is typically 3 times faster and microwave energy propagates more efficiently through air and tissue, offsetting the high intrinsic impedance of lung tissue. Similarly, tissue carbonization (which reduces thermal conduction in RFA) does not occur in MWA. Theoretically, tumor recurrence may be reduced with MWA due to reduced heat sink effect, although data supporting this is limited. With development in efficiency of ablative technology, outcomes are now comparable between wedge resection and ablation with 5-year survivals reported at 36% to 68% and 35% to 56%, respectively, for pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer. Recurrence rates within the lung are similar after ablation and wedge resection at approximately 32% to 62% with local recurrence at the resection or ablation site quoted at 7% to 28% and 12% to 36%, respectively.,,Recurrence is common in pulmonary metastasis and patients often require multiple interventions over their lifetime.

Non–small cell lung cancer—local therapy for oligometastatic disease: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) for limited oligometastases to the brain or other body sites is recommended for patients with good performance status (PS) if their thoracic disease can be treated with definitive therapy; SRS or SABR can be considered for select patients with stage M1c disease who have limited metastases amenable to definitive local therapy, and clinical trials have included up to 3 to 5 metastatic sites. For patients with disease progression on targeted therapy for ALK rearrangements, ROS1 rearrangements, or the common EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R), consideration of local therapy (eg, surgery or SABR [or SRS]) is recommended for limited progression. If an established SABR program is not available, hypofractionated or dose-intensified conventional 3D-CRT is a less preferred option; nonrandomized data indicate that local tumor control with SABR is higher than with image-guided thermal ablation techniques, although image-guided thermal ablation (cryotherapy, microwave, radiofrequency) may be an option for selected patients who will not be receiving SABR or definitive radiotherapy (RT).

ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC—role of local therapy: Definitive local therapy has a role in treatment. For patients with a limited number of initial metastatic sites (oligometastasis; clinical trials have included 3–5 metastases), definitive local therapy such as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) or surgery should be considered as consolidation after initiating ALK TKI therapy if not given prior, and may also be appropriate for some who progress after initial ALK TKI. For asymptomatic progression or limited symptomatic systemic progression (oligoprogression), definitive local therapy for limited lesions should be considered, and image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA; eg, cryotherapy, microwave ablation, radiofrequency ablation) may also be an option. For central nervous system (CNS) progression, definitive local therapy (eg, stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] with or without surgical resection) should be considered for symptomatic lesions, and SRS should be considered for asymptomatic lesions at risk of symptomatic progression based on size, location, and edema.

Methods

Before the ECIO conference, experts per topic (total panelists: 5) were identified and asked to participate in the ECIO session as a panelist. A telephone conference was used to discuss the aims of the session and to start the construction of the recommendations. All participants were asked to provide a systematic review on their topic, according to the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews for which a template was provided to the participants. The systematic review the panelists provided was a manuscript including the search question, search strategy (including in/exclusion criteria, number of hits, databases used), selection strategy of the identified papers, list of references), and a summary and discussion of the results from the included papers. Expert panelists were allowed to invoke assistance from colleagues for this systematic review.

The following topics were addressed:
Follow-up after radiological intervention for colorectal liver metastases, comprising of radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA) (M.M. diagnostic radiologist).
Follow-up after transarterial radioembolization (TARE) for CRLM (N.S. diagnostic radiologist).
Follow-up after radiological intervention for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by transarterial chemoembolization and TARE (P.V.M. and N.S. interventional radiologist and diagnostic radiologist).
Follow-up after radiological intervention for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) by RFA or MWA (S.S. interventional radiologist).
Follow-up after radiological intervention for primary lung cancer and lung metastases by RFA, MWA, and cryoablation (J.G. interventional radiologist).

### Image-guided percutaneous ablation for the treatment of lung malignancies: current state of the art [^210cc61b]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Current scientific evidence indicates similar therapeutic results for all three ablative modalities. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider the tumor features and the patient's characteristics when choosing the ablative technique. For example, although RFA is a widely available technique with proven efficacy and safety, MWA may be preferable in larger tumors. Lung MWA can produce ablative areas of about 6 cm, compared to 3 cm for RFA. Although MWA may be more effective on tumors near the pulmonary hilum and major vessels since the heat dissipation effect does not affect its therapeutic effect, the ablation volume is difficult to control, which increases the risk of bronchial fistula if used near the pulmonary hilum.

Among the advantages of cryoablation compared to heat-based techniques, there is evaluating the ablation site during the procedure. This feature allows the optimization of the treatment in real-time. Cryoablation is an effective alternative in tumors near the great vessels, airways, pericardium, and subpleural lesions, as it tends to cause less pain to the patient than RFA and MWA. As for its disadvantages, CA is not recommended in patients with coagulopathies since a higher rate and severity of lung bleeding. Higher hemoptysis rates have also been reported compared to heat-based modalities (Table 1).

Relationship to blood vessels

Ablation of tumours next to blood vessels is more difficult due to the cooling effect of blood flow. Ablation can be applied to tumours in contact with larger vessels (>3 mm in diameter) accepting an increased risk for tumour recurrence and the need for more than one treatment. This well known phenomenon has not been quantified in detail, but the risk of recurrence varies with the size of the vessel, the ablation technology and the length of vessel contact with the tumour. Strategies to ablate more vigorously next to blood vessels have been successfully adopted by many centres but are not part of standard commercial protocols. These strategies include increased power or duration of ablation next to the vessel or preferential placement of applicators towards the vessel side of the tumour. The patient and referring clinician should be advised as to the possible need for repeat treatment and the necessity of appropriate follow-up to detect and treat early tumour re-growth and so control the liver tumour load. Alternative technologies, for example microwave and IRE, may also have a role.

Consensus level: strong

Proximity to vulnerable structures

Ablation in close proximity to vulnerable structures, such as the colon, requires measures to create an acceptable safety margin or an operative approach. Percutaneous hydro/gas dissection is a simple and very effective technique and should be part of the routine armamentarium of any ablation practice.

Consensus level: strong

As size, number and location are all important features, there is a strong consensus that these three factors should be considered in concert when evaluating the appropriateness of ablation in any given patient.

Patients with small volume, ablatable liver metastases and extra-hepatic disease

Patients with extra-hepatic disease can be divided into those with limited, treatable extra-hepatic disease, by resection, ablation or radical radiotherapy, and those with more extensive disease for which the only treatment option is chemotherapy. The first group can benefit from ablation in the liver if the primary site and others sites of extra hepatic disease are radically treated, for example ablation of small volume lung metastases. Liver ablation in patients with more extensive extra-hepatic disease is of uncertain value. There is a wide range of survival reported for this group depending on volume of disease, sites involved, chemotherapy regimen and response, but in one paper the 5-year survival for 85 patients who had extra-pulmonic, extra-hepatic disease but limited liver disease treated with liver ablation was only 3 %. The optimal ablation patient, as for resection, has disease limited to the liver.

Consensus level: strong

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). High credibility.

Current society clinical practice guidelines on IGTA for NSCLC—RFA may also be considered for peripheral tumors < 3 cm in inoperable patients (Grade 2C). Under National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidance, image-guided thermal ablation is a treatment option in patients with multiple primary lung cancers in which definitive local therapy is possible, in patients with T1-3, N0 tumors for which definitive therapy of thoracic disease is feasible, and in patients with resectable locoregional recurrent NSCLC. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology Society of Europe guidance states that lung ablation should be restricted to patients with primary lung cancer not suitable for surgery, or to patients with oligometastatic lung disease (mainly colorectal) with radical intent (Level of Evidence 2); that RFA and MWA present comparable efficacy but MWA is usually considered better tolerated by patients and more suitable for large tumor treatment (Level of Evidence 2); that better results are achieved when lesion size does not exceed 2 cm with a tumor margin recommendation of ≥1 cm (Level of Evidence 2); that for primary NSCLC, accurate pre-operative loco-regional staging should be performed with contrast-enhanced CT and FDG-PET/CT (Level of Evidence 2); and that pulmonary function tests should be performed in patients with a history of lung surgery or pulmonary disease, with no lower limit of forced expiratory volume in 1 s or diffusion capacity in candidates for percutaneous thermal ablation, but spirometry should be discussed by the multidisciplinary tumor board (Level of Evidence 2).

Microwave ablation (MWA) versus radiofrequency ablation (RFA)—the panel judged that there are moderate benefits across critical outcomes. Perioperative complications defined as Clavien-Dindo Grade >3: 8 observational studies with a total of 882 participants reported an absolute difference of 3 fewer patients per 1,000 (95% CI 46 fewer to 54 more). Incomplete ablation: 6 observational studies with a total of 715 participants found an absolute difference of 3 fewer per 1,000 (95% CI 21 fewer to 39 more). Local/Regional Recurrence: 6 observational studies with a total of 668 participants showed an absolute difference of 11 fewer patients per 1,000 (95% CI 97 fewer to 108 more). For 5-year Disease Free Survival (DFS): 4 observational studies with a total of 177 participants reported an absolute difference of 32 more patients achieving 5-year disease free per 1,000 (95% CI 75 fewer to 183 more). For 5-year Overall Survival (OS): 6 observational studies with a total of 782 participants showed an absolute difference of 7 more patients per 1,000 (95% CI 59 fewer to 73 more).

### Survival outcomes for surgical resection versus CT-guided percutaneous ablation for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7f8b8cdc]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Multiple cohort studies have compared surgical resection with CT-guided percutaneous ablation for patients with stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, the results have been heterogeneous. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare surgery with ablation for stage 1 NSCLC.

Method

A search of five databases was performed from inception to 5 July 2020. Studies were included if overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and/or disease-free survival (DFS) were compared between patients treated with surgical resection versus ablation (radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA)) for stage 1 NSCLC. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated.

Results

A total of eight studies were included (total 792 patients: 460 resection and 332 ablation). There were no significant differences in 1- to 5-year OS or CSS between surgery versus ablation. There were significantly better 1- and 2-year DFS for surgery over ablation (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.14-4.34; OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.21-5.57 respectively), but not 3- to 5-year DFS. Subgroup analysis demonstrated no significant OS difference between lobectomy and MWA, but there were significantly better 1- and 2-year OS with sublobar resection (wedge resection or segmentectomy) versus RFA (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.33-6.10; OR 4.54, 95% CI 2.51-8.21, respectively). In the two studies which only included patients with stage 1A NSCLC, pooled outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in 1- to 3-year OS or DFS between surgery versus ablation.

Conclusion

Surgical resection of stage 1 NSCLC remains the optimal choice. However, for non-surgical patients with stage 1A, ablation offers promising DFS, CSS, and OS. Future prospective randomized controlled trials are warranted.

Key Points

• Surgical resection of stage 1 NSCLC remains the optimal choice. • In patients with stage 1A NSCLC who are not surgical candidates, CT-guided microwave or radiofrequency ablation may be an alternative which offers promising disease-free survival and overall survival.

### Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of lung tumors with expandable needle electrodes: current status [^2665d6ea]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Percutaneous radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA) has been used to treat primary and secondary liver tumors under ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance for the past decade [Park et al., Radiol Clin North Am 38:545-561, 2000; Siperstein and Gotomirski, Cancer J 6:S293-S301, 2000; Kelekis et al., Eur Radiol 13:1100-1105, 2003]. RFA is a low-cost, minimally invasive treatment that has recently attracted attention for treating tumors in different solid organs with promising results [Dupuy and Goldberg, J Vasc Interv Radiol 12:1135-1148, 2001; Friedman et al., Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol 27:427-434, 2004]. It can be provided with minimal hospitalization, and experienced practitioners have reported low complication rates [Dupuy and Goldberg, J Vasc Interv Radiol 12:1135-1148, 2001; Livraghi et al., Radiology 226:441-451, 2003]. Patients with lung malignancies (primary lung cancer or pulmonary metastases), who cannot be operated, might be candidates for RFA treatment. It can also be used in association with other treatments (i.e., chemotherapy, radiotherapy) for better disease control. Combination of the above with RFA may help reduce morbidity and mortality. Many ways to apply energy to the tumor exist (monopolar and bipolar RFA, microwave, laser, brachytherapy). In this review we will focus on expandable monopolar systems, which despite their deficiencies are the most popular in the interventional radiology sector.

Combined ablation and resection to treat multiple pulmonary metastases in 1 operation.

Central Message

iCART is a novel, minimally invasive, personalized treatment strategy for patients with multiple pulmonary metastases combining lung tissue-sparing microwave ablation and diagnostic wedge resection.

Perspective

iCART is a personalized treatment strategy for patients with multiple pulmonary metastases, combining diagnostic wedge resection and tissue-sparing ablation. It allows treatment of multiple nodules in a single anesthetic without the need for transfer from radiology. Emergence of ablation for treating stage 1 lung cancer and lung cancer screening may widen the application of iCART in the near future.

See Commentaries on pages 163 and 165.

The incidence of metastasis in the lung is second only to the liver and failure to treat these in a timely manner can lead to respiratory failure and death. Chemotherapy forms the mainstay of treatment for pulmonary metastasis and the efficacy of both immunotherapy and molecular-targeted personalized therapies continues to improve. However, patient response is variable and side-effects are common.

Surgical metastatectomy by wedge resection has long been established as safe and potentially curative procedure for pulmonary metastases.More recently, percutaneous ablation has been demonstrated as a safe alternative, particularly for small, deep nodules that may otherwise require major lung resection.Percutaneous microwave ablation (pMWA) is increasingly favored due to its superior characteristics versus radiofrequency ablation (RFA). However, peripheral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) can be difficult to palpate and may not be suitable for pMWA due to proximity to the chest wall and risk of chest pain, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax with bronchopleural fistula.Image-guided video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (iVATS) using localization techniques can facilitate removal of such lesions.

Complex patterns of multiple pulmonary metastases demand an equally sophisticated personalized therapy tailored to each individual patient. Image-guided combined ablation and resection in thoracic surgery (iCART) was developed to treat multiple pulmonary metastases in a single general anesthetic without the need to transfer the patient from the radiology department. We present the technique and preliminary outcomes of iCART for managing for multiple pulmonary metastases.

### SAGES / AHPBA guidelines for the use of microwave and radiofrequency liver ablation for the surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma or colorectal liver metastases less than 5 CM [^2643607f]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions—laparoscopic versus percutaneous MWA—The panel judged that no clear benefit was derived from the laparoscopic MWA approach as compared to the percutaneous MWA approach, with an indication of increased complications for laparoscopic ablation. The panel agreed that due to differences in timing of ablation and tumor anatomical differences, the outcomes assessed reflect these differences and are not a true comparison; overall, there was very low certainty of evidence for this key question, and mixed outcomes on DFS and OS, so the panel decided on a conditional recommendation for either percutaneous or laparoscopic MWA approach in the situation that hepatectomy is not recommended after multidisciplinary review of the patient’s case.

Fig. 7 
Pulmonary metastases. A 77-year-old female, with a known melanoma, undergoes a PET/CT that shows a hypermetabolic nodule in the right upper lobe (not in our possession). The biopsy is non-conclusive. The therapeutic option is RF ablation. a Imaging is performed before (first column) and 24 h after (second column) RF ablation. The 70-keV lung window shows a focal nodule of 11 mm (white arrow) in proximity of a blood vessel. This nodule is hyperdense on the synthesised monochromatic 40-keV images and shows iodine content on the greyscale- and colour-coded iodine maps (circles). Destructive lung parenchyma is seen after the ablation as an irregular hyperdensity on the lung window (black arrows). The synthesised monochromatic 40-keV reconstructions show very heterogeneous densities in this region. The vessel on the anterior side is still intact (white arrowhead). On the iodine maps, we clearly observe the absence of iodine uptake (yellow arrowheads). PET/CT shows no activity in this region. b Imaging is performed before (first column) and 24 h after (second column) microwave ablation (MWA). After 6 months, a well-circumscribed consolidation is seen on the 70-keV lung window and synthesised monochromatic 40-keV image (arrows). The greyscale- and colour-coded iodine maps show no focal iodine uptake. This consolidation is hypermetabolic on PET/CT. As a result of the discrepancy between the morphologic and metabolic imaging methods, and the proximity of the blood vessel, which could lead to a heat-sink effect, the patient opts for further focal thermal treatment through microwave ablation. Twenty-four hours after ablation, a large heterogeneously shaped density is recognised on the lung window. The greyscale- and colour-coded iodine maps very clearly show the zone without internal contrast uptake (arrowheads) when compared to the 40-keV images. Again, a photopenic area is seen on the PET/CT image

### SAGES / AHPBA guidelines for the use of microwave and radiofrequency liver ablation for the surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma or colorectal liver metastases less than 5 CM [^255ed11e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

Microwave and radiofrequency ablation—harms and certainty of evidence were limited in included studies of HCC and CRLM. There was no evidence reported of harms or burdens from MWA or RFA for any important or critical outcomes in any studies meeting the inclusion criteria; thus, the panel judged the potential harms to be unknown. The certainty of the above evidence was evaluated as very low due to high risk of bias from baseline differences in comparative cohorts without statistical matching and because estimated effects crossed meaningful thresholds from benefit to harms.

### Current readings: percutaneous ablation for pulmonary metastatic disease [^2925e63b]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Percutaneous image-guided ablation is a technique for maintaining local control of metastatic lung lesions that may, in selected patients, confer a survival benefit over no treatment or systemic therapy alone. Although the currently accepted treatment for oligometastatic pulmonary disease is surgical resection, the existing body of literature, including the recent investigations reviewed within this article, supports a role for percutaneous ablation as an important and relatively safe therapeutic option for nonsurgical and in carefully selected surgical patients, conferring survival benefits competitive with surgical metastasectomy. Continued clinical investigations are needed to further understand the nuances of thermal technologies and applications to treat lung primary and secondary pulmonary malignancy, directly compare available therapeutic options and further define the role of percutaneous image-guided ablation in the treatment of pulmonary metastatic disease.

### Radiofrequency ablation to treat non-small cell lung cancer and pulmonary metastases [^2edaf85c]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Radiofrequency ablation is being reported with increasing frequency for the treatment of lung tumors. Several studies have demonstrated that this is a feasible and safe approach. Intermediate outcomes are now becoming available. Although tumors up to 5 cm in size can be effectively treated with radiofrequency ablation, results are better for smaller tumors (3 cm or less). This review describes the techniques, available ablation devices, and the potential role of radiofrequency ablation for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pulmonary metastases. Resection (lobar or sublobar) should remain the standard therapy for NSCLC. Radiofrequency ablation may be better than conventional external-beam radiation for the treatment of the high-risk individual with NSCLC. Preliminary results for pulmonary metastases are similar to those reported after resection. In addition, patients with pulmonary metastases have been demonstrated to develop recurrences even after thoracotomy and bimanual palpation of the lung. Radiofrequency ablation may be an alternative to resection for the patient with small-diameter pulmonary metastases, and future study of this may be indicated.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^31f45d46]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Tumor ablation for colorectal cancer liver metastases—resection is the standard approach for resectable metastatic disease, but patients with liver or lung oligometastases can also be considered for tumor ablation therapy; ablative techniques include radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), cryoablation, and electrocoagulation (irreversible electroporation). There is extensive evidence on the use of RFA as a reasonable treatment option for non-surgical candidates and for recurrent disease after hepatectomy with small liver metastases that can be treated with clear margins, and more recent data describe outcomes of MWA that have been superior to RFA. In a prospective cohort comparing stereotactic MWA (SMWA) to hepatic resection for potentially resectable disease, three-year overall survival (OS) rates were 78% for SMWA versus 76% for resection (P = .861), estimated 5-year OS rates were 56% and 58%, overall and major complications were lower after SMWA (P < .01), although hepatic retreatments were more frequent (percentage increase 78%, P < .01); this supports the use of ablation in selected patients with small resectable CRC liver metastases, and COLLISION is a randomized phase III trial comparing thermal ablation to resection of CRC liver metastases.

SAGES/AHPBA laparoscopic microwave ablation (MWA)—benefits and effect estimates: There were no randomized trials addressing this question, and two observation studies met the inclusion criteria. The panel judged that there were moderate desirable effects to laparoscopic MWA across critical outcomes. Reported absolute differences were: incomplete ablation (2 observational studies with a total of 151 participants) absolute difference of 67 fewer per 1,000 (95% CI 88 fewer to 51 more); local/regional recurrence (1 observational study with a total of 75 participants) absolute difference of 127 fewer patients per 1,000 (95% CI 200 fewer to 167 more); 1-year disease free survival (DFS) (1 observational study with a total of 75 participants) absolute difference of 111 more (95% CI 48 fewer to 303 more); and 1-year overall survival (OS) (1 observational study with a total of 75 participants) absolute difference of 0 more patients per 1,000 (95% CI 70 fewer to 70 more). Several of the outcomes of interest were judged to be noninformative by the panel; due to the wide confidence intervals, the anticipated absolute effects were equally likely to result in a benefit or a harm to the patient; these outcomes included incomplete ablation, local/regional recurrence and 1-year OS; 1-year DFS was more likely a benefit of laparoscopic MWA.

### Radiofrequency ablation of lung lesions: practical applications and tips [^09d58865]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy is a minimally invasive technique that can be used in the management of inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer and for palliation in selected patients with pulmonary metastases. Surgical resection remains the gold standard of treatment; however, many patients are ineligible due to comorbidities or poor cardiopulmonary reserve. Others may simply decline radical surgical intervention. Alternative treatment options are limited mainly to chemotherapy and external beam radiation. With the development of RFA, a new promising technique has evolved that can be offered to many, as an alternative choice or as part of combination therapy. The published results of RFA for the treatment of primary and secondary lung malignancies are encouraging. This article aims to minimize the learning curve for performing RFA of lung lesions by examining the technical difficulties more commonly encountered and offering practical tips and applications.

### Microwave tumor ablation: mechanism of action, clinical results, and devices [^a0eb5e7e]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Microwave ablation uses dielectric hysteresis to produce direct volume heating of tissue. Microwaves are capable of propagating through many tissue types, even those with high impedance such as lung or bone, with less susceptibility to "heat-sink" effects along vessels. Microwaves are highly conducive to the use of multiple applicators, showing the synergy seen with other energies, but also the potential capability for phasing of the electromagnetic field. As a result, larger, more customizable ablation zones may be created in less time. Although multiple microwave ablation systems are currently available, further study and continued development are needed.

Percutaneous Ablation of Lung Tumors

Image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA), including radiofrequency ablation (RFA) microwave ablation (MWA), and cryoablation, may be a consideration for patients with ILD and early-stage lung cancer although additional research is needed.While data on use of IGTA for management of lung cancer in patients with ILD is limited, efficacy and overall survival of patients treated with IGTA has been shown to be similar to sublobar resection and SBRT in patients with NSCLC.In patients age ≥65 years and stage I NSCLC, overall survival was similar between those treated with sublobar resection versus thermal ablation when controlling for demographics and certain clinical variables.In a study of 54 patients with inoperable stage IA NSCLC treated with RFA, survival rates at 2 years were in line with those historically reported for SBRT.

The development of AE-ILD is also concern for patients with ILD who undergo IGTA. In retrospective analysis of 420 patients including patients with ILD who underwent RFA for primary lung cancer or pulmonary metastases, 3 of 4 deaths were due to AE-ILD.A systematic review of 3 retrospective studies and a total of 46 inoperable patients treated with RFA for early-stage NSCLC or oligo metastases reported an ILD-specific toxicity of 25% and 9% mortality.Data on cryoablation is limited. A conference abstract reported AE-ILD and subsequent death in 2 of 11 patients with IPF (18%) after percutaneous cryoablation of T1N0M0 NSCLC.In the absence of a detailed report, the potential role of cryoablation in this population remains to be determined.

Main finding: major complication

As shown in Fig. 7 A, the risk of major complication of the combination treatment and chemotherapy monotherapy was not different (OR = 0.75; 95% CI 0.47–1.22; P = 0.252). The heterogeneity was minor with I 2 = 37% and P = 0.161).The sensitivity analysis also supported the main finding, with lower limits of 95% CIs < 1 and upper limits > 1 (Fig. 7 B). Egger’s test indicated no significant publication bias (P = 0.686) and the funnel plot in Fig. 7 C showed good symmetry.

Additional analysis: subgroup analysis

The subgroup analysis further supported the main findings of the meta-analysis, with significantly improved ORR, DCR, PFS and OS in almost all subgroups with number of studies > 1 (Table 3). Notably, despite that there might be subjective bias for HRs of PFS and OS extracted from Kaplan–Meier curve, it turned out that the survival results remained the same regardless of whether HR was extracted from Kaplan–Meier curve. As for the heterogeneity, heterogeneity was not significantly reduced by dividing the studies into different subgroups according to the above mentioned variables.

Cryoablation in lung tumours

In early non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and lung oligometastases, the classic ablation technique is radiofrequency (RF). It is well-known, however, that due to the high electrical resistance and poor thermal conductivity of alveolar air, RF is less successful in the lung than in the liver. Microwave ablation, another heat-based ablative technique, has been proposed to overcome the limitations of RF. However, data on microwave ablation in the literature are sparse, and high complication rates have been reported. Cryoablation has been successfully used within the last decade in primary and secondary lung tumours, with 2-year local progression-free survival rates of 60.7–100 % in early NSCLC and 45.6–80.4 % in metastases. In the lung, a triple-freeze protocol is generally preferred to the classic dual-freeze protocol, as the former was shown in an animal study to be associated with faster and larger ablation.

The advantages of cryoablation in the lung include the ability to perform the ablation under local anaesthesia with breath-holding, which is important for successful ablation of small lesions located near the diaphragm, as well as the visibility of the ablation area (iceball) on CT and little or no pain during or after the procedure (Fig. 2). The absence of major damage to collagen fibres makes cryoablation an attractive option for lesions located near the mediastinum, pericardium, diaphragm, or pleura. In tumours that have infiltrated the chest wall, cryoablation is superior to other ablation methods in that it causes less pain and little damage to the connective tissue.

SAGES/AHPBA microwave and radiofrequency liver ablation—key question 1 addresses whether microwave ablation (MWA) (laparoscopic or open) vs. radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (laparoscopic or open) should be used for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) less than 5 cm ineligible for other therapies, and concludes: “The panel suggests MWA or RFA as a primary ablative approach for HCC and/or CRLM as both technologies were deemed safe and feasible (conditional recommendation; very low certainty of evidence).” The evidence base noted that “There were no randomized trials addressing this question. A total of eight observational studies met the inclusion criteria [17-25],” and “These studies were used to inform the panel’s decision on the key question,” with limitations that “several larger studies possessed high risk of bias due to baseline differences in the compared cohorts, the overall low event rate leading to most endpoints crossing thresholds from meaningful harm to benefit, and the substantial risk of bias stemming from the retrospective and non-randomized nature of these studies.”

### Transbronchial microwave ablation of peripheral lung tumors: the NAVABLATE study [^3569d172]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To date, NAVABLATE is the largest prospective, multicenter evaluation of transbronchial MWA in histologically confirmed malignant lung nodules. The study aimed to characterize the safety and short-term performance of the transbronchial ablation device in patients with limited alternative treatment options. There was a low (3.3%) rate of device-related adverse events, no serious adverse events related to the transbronchial MWA device, no pneumothoraces, and no deaths. The overall CTCAE grade 3 or above rate was 13.3%, with no grade 4 or 5 events. In addition, the procedure-day technical success and 1-month technique efficacy were both 100% (30/30).

Transbronchial thermal ablation may be associated with less risk than percutaneous thermal ablation. Pritchett et al reported no pneumothoraces occurred in all 10 subjects where image-guided transbronchial MWA was performed.Yuan et al reported pneumothorax in 34.3% following percutaneous RFA (12.3% requiring intervention) and 33.9% following percutaneous MWA (11.0% requiring intervention).Lyons et al, 2015, reported on 8 studies of percutaneous RFA to treat pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer. Pneumothorax rates ranged from 32% to 70%, with chest tube drainage required at 23%. Nelson et al, 2019, reported pneumothorax requiring a chest tube in 1% to 15% of patients across 10 percutaneous ablation studies, with 8 studies reporting rates between 5% and 15%.Among these meta-analyses, a total of 4 procedure-related deaths were reported in 3 studies. – In contrast, there were no pneumothoraces or deaths following transbronchial MWA in NAVABLATE.

### New and evolving treatment methods for pulmonary metastases [^9cc165e1]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment strategies other than surgery for pulmonary metastases are needed to improve disease-free and overall survival. Surgical attempts to solve a biologic problem by mechanical means. Alternative treatment may include induction or adjuvant chemotherapy, lung perfusion or regional drug delivery, biologic therapies (inhaled IL-2, biologic modifiers), and potentially, molecular or genetic therapy. Experimental radiofrequency ablation techniques are rarely applicable. Combinations of resection of macrometastases with treatment of occult micrometastases may be best in improving disease-free and overall survival.

discussion

Our median OS of 62 months compares favorably with previously published data on RFA of lung metastases. Indeed, the largest lung metastases RFA series published today reports 148 patients with a median OS of 51 months (95% CI 19–83). Another relatively large study, 122 patients with 398 metastases reports 41 months OS. Our impressive results might be explained by the very restricted inclusion criteria, resulting in more favorable predictive factors (size of metastases, number of metastases, extrapulmonary disease, DFI). Indeed, our inclusion criteria of tumor 4 cm or smaller resulted in a median diameter of metastases of 15 mm, while tumors were larger than 40 mm in 40% of cases in the largest study mentioned earlier. Moreover, mean number of metastases per patient was 1.8 in our series, versus 3.3 metastases for Gillams et al. Extrapulmonary disease represented 22% of our population, versus 51% for Gillams et al. At last, DFI shorter than 12 months accounts for 21% of our patients versus 12% and 52% for Chua et al. and Gillams et al. respectively.

### Imaging following thermal ablation of early lung cancers: expected post-treatment findings and tumour recurrence [^9bf84d98]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Thermal ablation is a minimally invasive technique that is growing in acceptance and popularity in the management of early lung cancers. Although curative resection remains the optimal treatment strategy for stage I pulmonary malignancies, percutaneous ablative treatments may also be considered for selected patients. These techniques can additionally be used in the treatment of oligometastatic disease. Thermal ablation of early lung tumours can be achieved using several different techniques. For example, microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) utilise extreme heat, whereas cryoablation uses extremely cold temperatures to cause necrosis and ultimately cell death. Typically, post-ablation imaging studies are performed within the first 1-3 months with subsequent imaging performed at regular intervals to ensure treatment response and to evaluate for signs of recurrent disease. Surveillance imaging is usually undertaken with computed tomography (CT) and integrated positron-emission tomography (PET)/CT. Typical imaging findings are usually seen on CT and PET/CT following thermal ablation of lung tumours, and it is vital that radiologists are familiar with these appearances. In addition, radiologists should be aware of the imaging findings that indicate local recurrence following ablation. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the expected post-treatment findings on CT and PET/CT following thermal ablation of early primary lung malignancies, as well as describing the imaging appearances of local recurrence.

outcomes

The median follow-up was 35.5 months (interquartile range = 20–53 months). One hundred seventy-six patients died. At the time of analysis, 390 patients were alive, including 235 who were followed more than 2 years. Among 566 patients enrolled in this study, 227 demonstrated no pulmonary disease progression. A total of 339 patients demonstrated lung tumor progression, including 112 who died and 227 who were alive at their latest follow-up.

overall survival

Median OS was 62 months, and 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year OS rates were 92.4% [standard error (SE) = 1.2), 79.4% (SE = 1.9), 67.7% (SE = 2.4), 58.9% (SE = 2.8) and 51.5% (SE = 3.3), respectively. Specific OS according to origin of the primary is given in Table 1. Gender, age, unilateral or bilateral location and extrapulmonary disease were not associated with OS. Location of primary disease, disease free interval (DFI), size and number of metastases were associated with OS in univariate analysis and remained independently associated with OS in multivariate analysis. In a Cox model using local tumor progression as a time-dependent variable and adjusted for these four prognostic factors, local tumor progression at the site of RFA was associated with poor OS { P = 0.011, hazard ratio (HR): 1.69 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13–2.54]}.

### Lung tumor radiofrequency ablation: where do we stand? [^e99ead37]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Today, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of primary and metastatic lung tumor is increasingly used. Because RFA is most often used with curative intent, preablation workup must be a preoperative workup. General anesthesia provides higher feasibility than conscious sedation. The electrode positioning must be performed under computed tomography for sake of accuracy. The delivery of RFA must be adapted to tumor location, with different impedances used when treating tumors with or without pleural contact. The estimated rate of incomplete local treatment at 18 months was 7% (95% confidence interval, 3-14) per tumor, with incomplete treatment depicted at 4 months (n = 1), 6 months (n = 2), 9 months (n = 2), and 12 months (n = 2). Overall survival and lung disease-free survival at 18 months were, respectively, 71 and 34%. Size is a key point for tumor selection because large size is predictive of incomplete local treatment and poor survival. The ratio of ablation volume relative to tumor volume is predictive of complete ablation. Follow-up computed tomography that relies on the size of the ablation zone demonstrates the presence of incomplete ablation. Positron emission tomography might be an interesting option. Chest tube placement for pneumothorax is reported in 8 to 12%. Alveolar hemorrhage and postprocedure hemoptysis occurred in approximately 10% of procedures and rarely required specific treatment. Death was mostly related to single-lung patients and hilar tumors. No modification of forced expiratory volume in the first second between pre- and post-RFA at 2 months was found. RFA in the lung provides a high local efficacy rate. The use of RFA as a palliative tool in combination with chemotherapy remains to be explored.

### Percutaneous image-guided ablation in the treatment of osseous metastases from non-small cell lung cancer [^fd87abeb]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Percutaneous image-guided ablation is an emerging minimally invasive therapy for patients with metastatic bone disease for whom radiation therapy is ineffective or contraindicated. The purpose of this study was to examine the safety and efficacy of percutaneous ablation in achieving pain palliation and local tumor control of osseous metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of 76 musculoskeletal metastases in 45 patients treated with percutaneous ablation. 63% (48/76) were treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), 35% (27/76) with cryoablation, and 1.3% (1/76) with microwave ablation (MWA). In 70% (53/76) of cases, associated cementoplasty was performed. Primary outcomes measured were pre- and post-procedure pain scores 4 weeks after treatment and local tumor control at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up.

Results

Mean age of the cohort was 63.6 ± 9.5 years. Median tumor diameter was 3.60 cm (range 1.0-10.0 cm). Mean and median pain scores before treatment were 7.5 ± 2.3 and 8.0, respectively. Post-procedure, patients reported significantly decreased pain scores at 4 weeks (mean, 3.7 ± 3.5; median, 3.0; p < 0.00001). Radiographic local tumor control rates were 83% (35/42) at 3 months, 77% (23/30) at 6 months, and 68% (17/25) at 12 months after treatment. The overall complication rate was 2.6% (2/76).

Conclusion

Percutaneous tumor ablation is a well-tolerated, minimally invasive procedure associated with improving pain palliation and achieving local tumor control of osseous metastases from NSCLC.

Since the first reported use of radiofrequency ablation of the lung in 2000, the field of image-guided lung ablation has received a considerable amount of attention. Survival studies have demonstrated the potential utility of thermal ablation in the treatment of patients with early-stage primary and limited secondary pulmonary tumors with promising results. Diagnostic imaging studies have advanced the understanding of the expected immediate postablation appearance of treated lesions, leading the way for early detection of local tumor progression. These survival studies and the expected imaging follow-up of these patients are reviewed herein.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal liver metastases (CRCLM) scope and decision‑making—HCC and CRCLM are distinct diseases in treatment algorithms and overall survival; the review’s goal was to assess differences between MWA and RFA rather than argue for ablation over other therapies; it is inappropriate to make such claims with current evidence; a surgeon or multidisciplinary group should always make the decision when ablation is appropriate; due to limited studies the working group prioritized procedure specific and short‑term outcomes and included HCC and CRCLM as one analysis.

### Microwave ablation of refractory oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer in the liver [^50cebf58]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate safety and effectiveness of microwave ablation (MWA) in the treatment of liver metastases (LMs) secondary to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Materials and Methods

This retrospective study included patients with NSCLC who underwent MWA of LM from March 2015 to July 2022. Local tumor progression-free survival (LTPFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using competing risk analysis and the Kaplan-Meier method. Postprocedural adverse events were recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0.

Results

Twenty-three patients with 32 LMs were treated in 27 MWA sessions. The mean dimension of the largest index tumor was 1.96 cm (SD ± 0.75). Technical success was 100%. Technical effectiveness was achieved in 26 (81.3%) of 32 tumors. The median length of follow-up was 37.7 months (interquartile range, 20.5-54.5 months). The median LTPFS was 16.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.87-44.10 months). The median OS was 31.7 months (95% CI, 11.1-65.8 months). Ablation margin was a significant factor for LTPFS, with tumors ablated without a measurable margin being more likely to progress than those with measurable margins (subdistribution hazard ratios [HRs], 0.008-0.024; P < .001). Older age (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.28; P < .001) and presence of synchronous lung metastases (HR, 14.73; 95% CI, 1.86-116.95; P = .011) were significant predictors of OS. Serious adverse events (CTCAE Grade ≥3) within 30 days occurred in 2 (7.4%) of 27 sessions, including pulmonary embolus and severe abdominal pain.

Conclusions

Percutaneous MWA was a safe treatment for NSCLC LM, with longer survival noted in younger patients and those without synchronous lung tumors.
