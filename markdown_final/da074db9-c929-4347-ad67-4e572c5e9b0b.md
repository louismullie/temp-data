## Question

What is the prognosis of transient ischemic attack secondary to hyperglycemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how hyperglycemia affects the prognosis of a transient ischemic attack and what that means for risk of recurrent stroke and mortality. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exactly "transient ischemic attack" implies for short-term stroke risk and why it matters. Then, I should verify whether hyperglycemia on presentation is an independent risk marker for early recurrence and whether stress hyperglycemia adds more information than absolute glucose. Next, I will review mechanistic explanations and reconcile them with the epidemiology. After that, I should examine how hyperglycemia modifies or interacts with standard secondary prevention strategies. Finally, I will translate this into practical risk stratification and guideline-based management recommendations, while checking where the evidence is strongest and where it remains uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk context of TIA so I don't over- or under-attribute risk to hyperglycemia alone. TIA carries a substantial short-term risk of stroke, with about 10–20% of patients experiencing a stroke within 90 days and roughly half of those early strokes occurring within the first 48 hours, which frames why even modest shifts in risk can translate into clinically meaningful absolute increases in early events [^115sLeqf] [^111pKj6u].

> Now, I should verify whether hyperglycemia on presentation independently worsens that short-term prognosis. In a post hoc analysis of POINT (high-risk TIA or minor ischemic stroke), hyperglycemia defined as glucose ≥ 180 mg/dL was associated with a higher hazard of subsequent ischemic stroke at 90 days with an adjusted hazard ratio around 1.50, and there was a suggestion of a nonlinear relationship across the glucose spectrum, which supports hyperglycemia as a dynamic risk signal rather than a mere epiphenomenon [^112dbZ3M] [^112zDJaE].

> Wait, let me verify the stress hyperglycemia angle because absolute glucose can reflect chronic dysglycemia rather than acute physiologic stress. Using the glucose/glycated albumin ratio as a stress hyperglycemia marker in CHANCE, patients in the highest quartile had a 46% higher risk of new stroke at 90 days, and an approximate threshold around a glucose/glycated albumin ratio of 0.29 identified increased risk, suggesting that relative hyperglycemia beyond baseline glycemic background carries independent prognostic information in minor stroke/TIA cohorts [^114E55Ui] [^114ZKd2z].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. Mechanistically, acute hyperglycemia can amplify ischemic injury through acidosis, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, blood–brain barrier disruption, and impaired recanalization and reperfusion, with experimental data indicating potential benefit from insulin-mediated glycemic control. However, randomized trials in acute ischemic stroke have not shown that aggressive insulin protocols improve functional outcomes and have increased hypoglycemia, so hyperglycemia likely functions as both a marker of stress severity and a contributor to tissue injury in many patients [^115tS4fi] [^115kBmqE] [^111zFHoR] [^115HomTH].

> I should confirm whether hyperglycemia also tracks with early neurological deterioration and poor functional outcomes beyond simple recurrence. Multiple studies and meta-analyses link admission hyperglycemia with greater infarct severity, early neurological deterioration, higher symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage after thrombolysis, and worse 90-day functional outcomes, and these associations persist even after adjustment for baseline stroke severity, supporting a partially independent prognostic role rather than purely an epiphenomenon of stroke severity [^1146MSUh] [^113NtFuW] [^115tS4fi] [^111zFHoR].

> Next, I should review how hyperglycemia interfaces with standard secondary prevention. Initially, I thought dual antiplatelet therapy might not reduce recurrent stroke in hyperglycemic TIA patients, but wait, I should double-check the confidence intervals. The POINT post hoc analysis showed no statistically significant reduction in recurrent stroke with clopidogrel–aspirin in the hyperglycemia subgroup, with an adjusted hazard ratio around 1.18 and wide confidence intervals, so I cannot claim harm, but the absence of clear benefit in this subgroup does raise the possibility that hyperglycemia identifies a biologically distinct high-risk phenotype where antiplatelet efficacy may be attenuated, necessitating more aggressive metabolic and vascular risk modification alongside guideline-directed DAPT in appropriate noncardioembolic patients [^112dbZ3M] [^112zDJaE] [^115HomTH].

> Let me consider risk stratification and screening because identifying dysglycemia after TIA changes management. The ABCD2 score is useful but imperfect; adding hyperglycemia and hypertension modestly improves sensitivity for very early stroke, and HbA1c is preferred for detecting undiagnosed diabetes or prediabetes in the immediate post-event period because it is less perturbed by acute stress than fasting glucose, with approximately 11–20% of stroke/TIA patients found to have previously unrecognized diabetes, underscoring the need for systematic glycemic screening [^1176ZWMg] [^115NzqsD] [^113YwziS] [^111mKdfg].

> I will now examine how to translate this into management, and I need to ensure I align with high-quality guidelines. In the acute phase, persistent hyperglycemia is associated with worse outcomes; it is reasonable to treat to a target range of 140–180 mg/dL with close monitoring to avoid hypoglycemia, recognizing that the evidence base is largely extrapolated and that intensive insulin strategies have not improved functional outcomes in randomized trials; therefore, a pragmatic, careful approach balancing benefit and hypoglycemia risk is advised [^117NtFun] [^115B1PKC] [^113Ck1AS] [^111rp2v8].

> For long-term secondary prevention, I should confirm that HbA1c targets are individualized. AHA/ASA recommends HbA1c ≤ 7% for most adults with TIA/stroke and diabetes, but less stringent targets may be appropriate in older adults or those with limited life expectancy or hypoglycemia risk, and there is insufficient evidence that intensive control beyond the acute phase reduces recurrent stroke, so the emphasis should be on durable, safe glycemic control and comprehensive cardiometabolic risk reduction rather than aggressive titration solely for stroke prevention [^115RJzF6] [^113vtonB] [^116PRsJX] [^117NqNJm].

> But wait, what if the patient has prediabetes or insulin resistance rather than overt diabetes. Let me verify guideline-directed options. For patients with prediabetes after TIA/stroke, lifestyle optimization is recommended and metformin can be considered, particularly in those with higher BMI or prior gestational diabetes; in patients within 6 months of TIA with insulin resistance, HbA1c < 7%, and without heart failure or bladder cancer, pioglitazone may be considered to reduce recurrent stroke risk, and GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit should be prioritized when pharmacotherapy is indicated in type 2 diabetes [^113nmt88] [^116onSLn] [^114YAf2k] [^113hGHJi] [^116dfqKG].

> I should double-check the overall prognostic message to ensure internal consistency. Hyperglycemia at TIA presentation is associated with roughly a 50% higher risk of early recurrent ischemic stroke and tracks with worse functional outcomes, with stress hyperglycemia indices refining risk beyond absolute glucose; mechanistically, hyperglycemia both marks systemic stress and can worsen cerebral ischemia, which helps explain why its presence should trigger intensified secondary prevention and glycemic evaluation without assuming that aggressive insulin in the acute phase will reverse risk [^112dbZ3M] [^114E55Ui] [^115tS4fi] [^111zFHoR].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical next steps are clear. In patients with TIA and hyperglycemia, I would obtain HbA1c to detect undiagnosed diabetes or prediabetes, initiate guideline-directed secondary prevention including timely antiplatelet therapy when indicated, high-intensity statin, blood pressure control, lifestyle interventions, and consider GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors if diabetes is present and cardiovascular benefit is desired. I would individualize HbA1c targets, consider pioglitazone in appropriate insulin-resistant patients, and in the hospital treat persistent hyperglycemia cautiously to 140–180 mg/dL while avoiding hypoglycemia, recognizing that this approach addresses both the risk marker and potential pathophysiologic contributor embedded in hyperglycemia [^115NzqsD] [^113hGHJi] [^116onSLn] [^116PRsJX] [^117NtFun].

Patients with TIA and hyperglycemia have a **higher risk of early stroke recurrence and poor outcomes** [^112zDJaE] than those with normal glucose [^114E55Ui] [^112zDJaE]. Hyperglycemia — especially stress hyperglycemia — is a strong independent predictor of **early recurrence** and mortality [^113KNgXR] [^114E55Ui] [^115tS4fi]. The 90-day stroke risk is about 12–20% overall and is higher with hyperglycemia, particularly within 48 hours [^112zDJaE] [^115sLeqf]. Persistent or stress-related hyperglycemia warrants aggressive risk factor control, including **tight glucose targets (140–180 mg/dL)** [^117NtFun] and guideline-directed antiplatelet, statin, and blood pressure therapy [^notfound]. Intensive glucose lowering beyond the acute phase does not clearly reduce recurrent stroke risk, so targets should be individualized to balance hypoglycemia risk [^117NqNJm] [^116PRsJX].

## Prognostic impact of hyperglycemia in TIA

### Early stroke recurrence risk

Early stroke recurrence risk is high after TIA [^115sLeqf], with a **90-day risk of 10–20%** and about half of events occurring within 48 hours [^111pKj6u]. Hyperglycemia at presentation is independently associated with higher early recurrence risk [^112dbZ3M]. Stress hyperglycemia — quantified by the glucose/glycated albumin ratio — predicts **new stroke at 90 days** in TIA or minor stroke (adjusted HR 1.46) [^114E55Ui].

---

### Mortality and functional outcomes

Mortality and functional outcomes are worse with **hyperglycemia**, which correlates with higher short- and long-term mortality and worse functional status after TIA or minor stroke [^notfound]. Stress hyperglycemia is linked to **early neurological deterioration** and poor outcomes after thrombolysis, independent of hemorrhagic transformation [^112oSJHH] [^1146MSUh].

---

## Mechanisms underlying poor prognosis in hyperglycemic TIA patients

Several mechanisms plausibly explain the **worse prognosis** with hyperglycemia:

- **Increased oxidative stress and inflammation**: Hyperglycemia amplifies ischemic injury via oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction [^112oSJHH].

- **Impaired cerebral blood flow and microvascular dysfunction**: Hyperglycemia worsens cerebral perfusion and microvascular function, promoting ischemia and recurrence [^115tS4fi].

- **Platelet hyperactivity and thrombosis**: Hyperglycemia enhances platelet aggregation and thrombosis, increasing recurrence risk [^111EMTXP].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Multiple studies and guidelines affirm the association between hyperglycemia and **poor TIA prognosis**:

| **Study/trial** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|
| CHANCE trial | Stress hyperglycemia (glucose/glycated albumin ratio) independently predicted new stroke at 90 days (HR 1.46) [^114E55Ui] |
| POINT trial | Admission hyperglycemia (≥ 180 mg/dL) increased subsequent ischemic stroke risk at 90 days (HR 1.50) [^112dbZ3M] |
| AHA/ASA guidelines | Persistent hyperglycemia after AIS/TIA is associated with worse outcomes; treat to 140–180 mg/dL and avoid hypoglycemia [^117NtFun] |

---

## Management strategies and their impact on prognosis

### Acute phase management

During the acute phase, **treat hyperglycemia** to 140–180 mg/dL with close monitoring to avoid hypoglycemia [^117NtFun]. Also initiate **dual antiplatelet therapy** with aspirin and clopidogrel early to reduce early recurrence [^111AocYv].

---

### Long-term management

- **Individualized glycemic control**: Target HbA1c ≤ 7% for most, but tailor to age, comorbidities, and hypoglycemia risk [^113vtonB] [^116PRsJX].

- **Glucose-lowering agents with cardiovascular benefit**: Use GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce cardiovascular events [^113hGHJi] [^116dfqKG].

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Diet, exercise, and weight loss reduce recurrence and improve outcomes [^116twnSd].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Causality vs. epiphenomenon**: Hyperglycemia may reflect stress severity rather than directly cause poor outcomes [^117MYQWS] [^115HomTH].

- **Optimal glucose targets**: The best glucose targets remain debated; intensive control may increase hypoglycemia without clear stroke benefit [^111zFHoR] [^117NqNJm].

- **Individualized care**: Management should balance glycemic control with hypoglycemia risk and patient factors [^113vtonB] [^116PRsJX].

---

Hyperglycemia in TIA is a **strong predictor of early recurrence, mortality, and poor outcomes** [^114E55Ui] [^114fQYxr]. Aggressive risk factor control, including tight but safe glucose targets and guideline-directed antiplatelet, statin, and blood pressure therapy, is essential [^117NtFun] [^113hGHJi]. Intensive glucose lowering beyond the acute phase does not clearly reduce recurrent stroke, so targets should be individualized [^117NqNJm] [^116PRsJX].

### Risk of stroke and cardiovascular events after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome… [^116Fp7HD]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Subjects with MetS were not at increased risk for stroke or major cardiovascular events but more frequently had revascularization procedures. There were no treatment × subgroup interactions for the SPARCL primary end point. Transient ischemic attack was defined by the loss of cerebral or ocular function for less than 24 hours of presumed ischemic cause. Patients had to be ambulatory with a modified Rankin score of 3 or less and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 100 to 190 mg/dL. The SPARCL primary outcome was the time from randomization after an ischemic stroke or TIA to the occurrence of a nonfatal or fatal stroke.

The SPARCL trial included several secondary composite outcomes, including major coronary events, major cardiovascular events, any CHD event, and any revascularization procedure. 17 Subjects were followed up until the end of the study or death; only 0. 5% of enrolled subjects were lost to follow-up. Subjects with MetS had no increase in the risk of major cardiovascular events or major coronary events but were more likely to have any CHD event or revascularization procedure. Figure 2 shows that there was no treatment × subgroup interaction for the SPARCL primary end point.

Among those experiencing a stroke during the trial, there was no difference in subtypes between groups. In this post hoc analysis, we found that SPARCL subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus were at higher risk for recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events but that there was no difference in the effect of statin treatment in reducing these events in subjects with or without type 2 diabetes or MetS.

### Validation and refinement of the ABCD2 score: a population-based analysis [^1176ZWMg]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Transient ischemic attacks are a frequent diagnosis in the emergency department setting, yet expert opinion as to the proper follow-up and need for hospitalization differs widely. Recently, an effort has been made to risk-stratify patients presenting with transient ischemic attacks through scoring systems such as the ABCD and ABCD2 scales. The aim of our study was to independently validate these scores using a population-based cohort.

Methods

Using the data from the Rochester Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack Registry and resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, medical records of all residents of Rochester, Minn, with a diagnosis of incident transient ischemic attack from 1985 through 1994 were examined (N = 284). Patients were scored on the ABCD and ABCD2 scales and new scores were created by adding hyperglycemia and a history of hypertension. The end points of stroke and death were collected previously and were verified through the Rochester Epidemiology Project data.

Results

Although our study did find that scores > 4 had a statistically significant predictive value for future stroke, a substantial proportion of strokes within 7 days (9 of 36 cases [25%]) occurred in patients with low or intermediate risk scores (≤ 4) on the ABCD2 scale. Including history of hypertension and hyperglycemia on presentation increased the sensitivity of the score to identify patients who had a stroke within 7 days.

Conclusions

Reliance on the ABCD and ABCD2 scores misses some patients who will have a stroke within 7 days of a transient ischemic attack. Adding hyperglycemia and a history of hypertension to the predictive model could be useful, but the value of these additions need to be evaluated further.

Regarding medical management for transient ischemic attack, more specifically with respect to management of diabetes, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider initiating metformin to control blood glucose and to prevent the progression of prediabetes to diabetes in patients with a TIA and prediabetes, particularly with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², ≥ 35 kg/m² in < 60 years of age, or females with a history of gestational diabetes.

IV alteplase pretreatment deliberation and timing — The potential risks should be discussed during thrombolysis eligibility deliberation and weighed against the anticipated benefits during decision making. It is reasonable that urgent IV alteplase treatment not be delayed while waiting for hematologic or coagulation testing if there is no reason to suspect an abnormal test. Treating clinicians should be aware that hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may mimic acute stroke presentations and determine blood glucose levels before IV alteplase initiation. IV alteplase is not indicated for nonvascular conditions. Because time from onset of symptoms to treatment has such a powerful impact on outcomes, treatment with IV alteplase should not be delayed to monitor for further improvement.

### Hyperglycemia, risk of subsequent stroke, and efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy: a post hoc analysis of the POINT trial [^115AiVL1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Our study sample was described using descriptive statistics with mean ± SD or median ± interquartile range as appropriate for continuous variables and frequencies/counts for categorical variables. Patients with or without hyperglycemia were compared on univariate analysis using the Student t test or Mann‐Whitney test for continuous variables and the χ 2 or Fisher exact test for categorical variables, as appropriate. We compared the rate of subsequent ischemic stroke between patients with and without hyperglycemia on presentation using Kaplan‐Meier statistics. The log‐rank test was used to compare survival curves between groups.

We constructed a Cox proportional hazards regression model to calculate HRs for the primary end point between those with and without admission hyperglycemia. We adjusted for known predictors of subsequent stroke by including age, biological sex, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, congestive cardiac failure, tobacco exposure, valvular heart disease, carotid disease, treatment assignment (clopidogrel/aspirin versus placebo/aspirin based on the intent‐to‐treat analysis), and index event classification (high‐risk TIA or acute minor ischemic stroke). Additionally, we chose to include both race and ethnicity in multivariable modeling because each are known to predict subsequent stroke. We tested the assumption of proportional hazards by inspection of Schoenfeld residuals plots. We fitted models containing the interaction terms hyperglycemia*clopidogrel and hyperglycemia*final adjudicated cause. No adjustment was performed in the clopidogrel interaction analysis because we expected equal distribution of covariates across groups. We reported the HRs with 95% CIs for clopidogrel within the stratifications of hyperglycemia or no hyperglycemia and for hyperglycemia within the subdivisions of diabetes or no diabetes and minor stroke or other adjudicated cause. These analyses were repeated for the secondary end points of major hemorrhage and the composite outcome of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116PRsJX]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Intensive glycemic control and targets — evidence and thresholds indicate that intensive control of blood sugar for patients with both type 1 diabetes and T2D reduces microvascular complications, with DCCT enrolling patients between 13 and 39 years of age and showing after a mean of 6.5 years delayed onset or progression of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, although intensive control was associated with increased risk for hypoglycemia. For most adults, the American Diabetes Association recommends a target HbA1c < 7%, while it advocates less stringent goals (eg, 7%–8%) in patients with limited life expectancy, history of hypoglycemia, long-standing disease, or advanced macrovascular or microvascular disease when the risk and inconvenience of intensive control outweigh the potential benefit.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116dfqKG]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetes — epidemiology, stroke associations, and cardiometabolic therapy signals are as follows: The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among US adults is 9%, and prediabetes and diabetes are associated with increased risk for first ischemic stroke (RR, 1.5%–3.7% for diabetes). Prediabetes is present in ≈30% of patients with acute ischemic stroke and is associated with increased risk for recurrence, and T2D is also present in ≈30% of patients with ischemic stroke with recurrence risk (RR, ≈1.6). Recent trials show at least one drug in each of three glucose-lowering classes — thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like protein 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor — can reduce risk for MACEs in T2D with established atherosclerotic vascular disease, while cardiovascular outcome trials of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors do not suggest a specific effect on stroke but rather on cardiovascular death, MI, and heart failure.

### Diabetes mellitus and ischemic stroke in the young: clinical features and long-term prognosis [^116GCx68]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare risk factors, stroke characteristics, and long-term prognosis between nondiabetic young ischemic stroke patients and similar patients having either type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) to provide information for patient management, counseling, and future research in these patient groups.

Methods

Our database comprised 1,008 consecutive patients aged 15 to 49 with first-ever ischemic stroke from 1994 to 2007. Primary outcome measures were 1) nonfatal or fatal recurrent ischemic stroke and 2) composite vascular endpoint (myocardial infarction, any stroke, revascularization, or vascular death).

Results

Compared with nondiabetic stroke patients (n = 904), patients with T1D (44) or T2D (60) were more likely to have hypertension and stroke attributable to small-vessel disease (SVD). In addition, when compared with nondiabetic patients, those with T1D more frequently had coronary heart disease and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and those with T2D more often had obesity, PAD, history of TIA, and stroke attributable to large-artery atherosclerosis, and T2D patients were also more likely to be older and male than were the nondiabetic patients. Mean follow-up in survivors was 9.0 (± 3.8) years. Cumulative recurrent ischemic stroke rate at 10 years was 40.9% for T1D (14 events), 29.7% for T2D (15), and 12.0% for nondiabetic patients (94). Corresponding rates for the composite vascular endpoint were 65.1% for T1D (25), 46.9% for T2D (28), and 19.3% for nondiabetic patients (153).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that ischemic stroke patients with T1D or T2D exhibit a distinct risk-factor and etiologic profile and a worse vascular prognosis than do nondiabetic patients.

### Impact of glycemic treatment and blood glucose monitoring on outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke without prior diabetes: a longitudinal cohort study [^1158eczi]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Appropriate glycemic management, especially when combining glycemic treatment with intensive BGM, is crucial for the acute care of patients with FIS and hyperglycemia who have not previously been diagnosed with DM. While this study highlights the potential benefits of BGM and glycemic management in reducing the risk of stroke recurrence within one year and improving short- and long-term mortality rates among patients with AIS, it does not determine the optimal glucose threshold for initiating treatment. The risk associated with hyperglycemia during acute stroke is well-recognized; however, the optimal strategy for glycemic treatment and the specific benefits of insulin are still under active debate. Thus, BGM is essential for optimal glycemic management during the acute phase of FIS in patients with hyperglycemia who have not previously been diagnosed with DM.

### Blood glucose increases early after stroke onset: a study on serial measurements of blood glucose in acute stroke [^111oKP7V]. European Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if blood glucose levels change within the first 12 h after stroke onset and to investigate if the degree of change is related to stroke severity, type of stroke, or prognosis. This was a retrospective, descriptive trial based on 445 stroke patients with two blood glucose tests within 12 h of stroke onset and no history of diabetes mellitus. Blood glucose increased in the first 12 h after stroke onset; in mild to moderate stroke from 5.8 to 6.1 mmol/l (P < 0.001) and in severe stroke from 6.2 to 6.7 mmol/l (P < 0.001). In patients who died within 7 days of stroke onset, blood glucose increased from 6.8 to 7.1 mmol/l (P < 0.001). In conclusion, blood glucose increases after the onset of acute stroke and the increase is related to the severity of the stroke.

### Predicting clinical outcomes and response to thrombolysis in acute stroke patients with diabetes [^111RYK3k]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network (RCSN) was used to identify patients admitted with acute stroke to stroke centers across the province of Ontario, Canada. Eligibility criteria included age ≥ 18 years, a primary diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, and admission to any of the 11 participating institutions between 1 July 2003 and 30 June 2008. Any patient with missing baseline characteristics (Canadian Neurological Scale score, glucose on admission, and unique health identifier) (n = 1,005 [7.3%]) was excluded. Also, patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) were not eligible for this study. TIA was defined as a stroke with transient symptoms < 24 h with no evidence of acute infarction on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Further details on the RCSN can be obtained from the RCSN Report atand have previously been published. Information on poststroke all-cause mortality was obtained through linkages to the Ontario Registered Persons Database at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. The Registered Persons Database is a population-based administrative database including basic demographic data and date of death that provides complete follow-up for all residents in the province.

Diabetes is one of the variables systematically collected in the RCSN, identified from documented history and medical notes, including any of the following: adult-onset diabetes, diet-controlled diabetes, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, insulin-dependent diabetes, and non–insulin-dependent diabetes.

The iScore is a risk score that estimates functional outcomes in patients with an ischemic stroke early after hospitalization using clinical parameters and comorbid conditions, which include age, sex, stroke severity, stroke subtype, smoking status, preadmission dependency, the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, cancer, renal failure on dialysis, and hyperglycemia on admission. The risk scoring system is represented in. We calculated the iScore for each eligible participant in the RSCN. Details of the selection of variables for the iScore, data sources, and the creation and conceptualization of the iScore have previously been published. An online Web-based tool and an iPhone version are currently available free of charge.

Lifestyle and behavioral interventions in type 2 diabetes — optimal management is multidimensional, including medical nutritional therapy, lifestyle counseling, diabetes self-management education and support, and medication therapy; for patients with overweight or obesity, it can be helpful to include intensive behavioral counseling for weight loss, and weight loss can result in diabetes remission for some patients and reduced medication use in most; among patients with impaired glucose tolerance, multifactorial interventions reduce risk for progression to diabetes by 43% to 58% during 3 to 5 years of treatment, with benefit proportional to the achievement of lifestyle goals.

### Hyperglycemia, risk of subsequent stroke, and efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy: a post hoc analysis of the POINT trial [^112zDJaE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

One‐quarter of all strokes are subsequent events. It is not known whether higher levels of blood glucose are associated with an increased risk of subsequent stroke after high‐risk transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic stroke.

Methods and Results

We performed a secondary analysis of the POINT (Platelet Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke) trial to evaluate the relationship between serum glucose hyperglycemia (≥ 180 mg/dL) versus normoglycemia (< 180 mg/dL) before enrollment in the trial and outcomes at 90 days. The primary end point was subsequent ischemic stroke modeled by a multivariable Cox model with adjustment for age, sex, race, ethnicity, study treatment assignment, index event, and key comorbidities. Of 4878 patients included in this study, 267 had a recurrent stroke. There was a higher hazard of subsequent stroke in patients with hyperglycemia compared with normoglycemia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.50 [95% CI, 1.05–2.14]). Treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy was not associated with a reduced hazard of subsequent stroke in patients with hyperglycemia (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.69–2.03]), though the wide confidence interval does not exclude a treatment effect. When modeled as a continuous variable, there was evidence of a nonlinear association between serum glucose and the hazard of subsequent stroke (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Hyperglycemia on presentation is associated with an increased risk of subsequent ischemic stroke after high‐risk transient ischemic attack or minor stroke. A rapid, simple assay of serum glucose may be a useful biomarker to identify patients at particularly high risk of subsequent ischemic stroke.

Acute ischemic stroke — IV alteplase general principles state that in patients eligible for IV alteplase, benefit of therapy is time dependent, and treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible (I A). In patients undergoing fibrinolytic therapy, physicians should be prepared to treat potential emergent adverse effects, including bleeding complications and angioedema that may cause partial airway obstruction (I B-NR). The potential risks should be discussed during IV alteplase eligibility deliberation and weighed against the anticipated benefits during decision-making (I C-EO). Treating clinicians should be aware that hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may mimic acute stroke presentations and determine blood glucose levels before IV alteplase initiation, and IV alteplase is not indicated for nonvascular conditions (III: No Benefit B-NR). Because time from onset of symptoms to treatment has such a powerful impact on outcomes, treatment with IV alteplase should not be delayed to monitor for further improvement (III: Harm C-EO).

### Copeptin as a biomarker for prediction of prognosis of acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack: a meta-analysis [^111iA1Vc]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the predictive effect of copeptin as a biomarker for the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. Electronic databases including PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Central were searched for studies assessing the association of copeptin level on admission with prognosis of acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality assessment scale for cohort study was used to evaluate quality. A total of 1976 acute ischemic stroke patients from 6 studies were included, and 59% of patients were male. Patients with poor outcomes and nonsurvivors had a higher copeptin level at admission (P < 0.0001). Copeptin combined with an admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score significantly improved the discriminatory accuracy of functional outcome and mortality compared with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale alone. Elevation in plasma copeptin level carried a higher risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio = 4.16; 95% CI: 2.77–6.25) and poor functional outcome (odds ratio = 2.56; 95% CI: 1.97–3.32) after acute ischemic stroke. In addition, copeptin improved the prognostic value of the ABCD2 (age, blood pressure, clinical features of transient ischemic attack, duration of symptoms and presence of diabetes mellitus) score for a recurrent cerebrovascular event in transient ischemic attack. Copeptin seems to be a promising independent biomarker for predicting the functional outcome and all-cause mortality within 3 months or 1 year after acute ischemic stroke, and it could also be a powerful tool for early risk stratification for patients with transient ischemic attack.

Algorithm for evaluating patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke — Ancillary notes specify that basic laboratory tests include complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, creatinine, and fasting or nonfasting lipid profile. Abbreviations are defined (e.g. CT indicates computed tomography; CTA, computed tomography angiogram; ECG, electrocardiogram; MRA, magnetic resonance angiography; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; TEE, transesophageal echocardiography; US, ultrasound). When a patient has a transient neurological deficit clinically characteristic of transient ischemic attack, the patient should be evaluated in the same manner as a patient who has an ischemic stroke with a corresponding cerebral infarct on imaging. Confirmation of stroke diagnosis may require follow-up head imaging because of poor sensitivity of noncontrast CT for small or hyperacute infarcts. Some conditions associated with stroke and with specific therapies are common whereas others are relatively rare, and the variable yield of testing means that treating physicians need to exercise judgment on the likelihood that a test will alter management in a given clinical situation.

### Stress hyperglycemia is associated with early neurologic deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke after intravenous thrombolysis without hemorrhagic transformation [^115j2NWo]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide, and its current primary treatments are intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular procedures, which are typically administered during the early phases of stroke management. However, the effectiveness of these reperfusion therapies is limited by a strict time window, resulting in fewer than 10% of patients receiving these interventions. A significant complication of stroke is early neurological deterioration (END), which is characterized by an increase of more than 2 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) within 72 h of the initial assessment. Although the definitions of END can vary, its occurrence notably increases the risk of both morbidity and mortality. While extensive research has focused on END following hemorrhagic transformations after thrombolysis, there is limited investigation into END in patients with non-cardiogenic cerebral infarction who do not experience hemorrhagic transformation. Herein, we designed this study to address this gap by examining the impact of stress hyperglycemia on END in patients with acute non-cardiogenic cerebral infarction, excluding those with hemorrhagic transformation following intravenous thrombolysis and to identify risk factors associated with END in this specific patient population.

Regarding specific circumstances for in-hospital hyperglycemia, more specifically with respect to patients with AIS, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to consider treating hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels in a range of 140–180 mg/dL and obtaining close monitoring to prevent hypoglycemia in patients with AIS as persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours after AIS is associated with worse outcomes.

### The role of hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke [^112jXg3E]. Neurocritical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Stroke remains a leading cause of death and long-term disability in the developed world. Reperfusion and anti-thrombotic therapies are of limited benefit for the majority of patients following acute ischemic stroke, and increasing interest has focused on therapeutic approaches that seek to modulate infarct evolution. Animal and human studies have linked hyperglycemia in the acute phase of ischemic stroke to worse clinical outcomes regardless of the presence of pre-existing diabetes mellitus. Experimental data suggest that elevated blood glucose may directly contribute to infarct expansion through a number of maladaptive metabolic pathways, and that treatment with insulin may attenuate these adverse effects. In this review, we analyze the relationship between elevated serum glucose and acute cerebrovascular ischemia, and critically appraise the potential of a clinical strategy that targets euglycemia in all acute stroke patients.

### Hyperglycemia, risk of subsequent stroke, and efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy: a post hoc analysis of the POINT trial [^114fQYxr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Every ischemic stroke represents a critical opportunity to prevent another, potentially more severe, stroke. The risk of subsequent stroke is as high as 17% in the 90 days following the index event, but this risk is front‐loaded within the first 7 days. For this reason, there is a need to incorporate dynamic physiological metrics into risk stratification schemes, and not simply long‐term risk factors. Serum glucose is an intriguing potential predictor of recurrent stroke risk, because it is already assessed in the majority of patients with acute stroke using widely available, low‐cost assays.

Hyperglycemia, an elevation in serum glucose, is associated with an increase in lesion volume, and worse functional outcomes, after acute ischemic stroke. Several studies, have shown that a history of diabetes is associated with subsequent stroke after transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke. One prior studysuggested that stress hyperglycemia (serum glucose indexed against glycosylated albumin) was associated with subsequent stroke. However, it is not known whether serum glucose itself is associated with subsequent stroke risk.

The objective of this study was to determine whether serum glucose measured on presentation to the emergency department is associated with the risk of subsequent ischemic stroke within 90 days after a high‐risk TIA or minor ischemic stroke. We hypothesized that elevated admission serum glucose is associated with a higher risk of subsequent stroke.

### Prognostic significance of diabetes and stress hyperglycemia in acute stroke patients [^115XT4Gs]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

What causes hyperglycemia in Group 1?

The most probable cause of hyperglycemia, generally transient, characterizing Group 1, was probably the marked acute phase, witnessed by the increase in the indices of inflammation, in turn an expression of the severity and extent of cerebral lesions. There are various mechanisms by which hyperglycemia can follow the acute phase. It has already been mentioned that inflammatory cytokines, by binding to insulin receptors, may cause hyperglycemia. The main mechanism seems to be reduced tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Another important mechanism linking the acute phase with hyperglycemia is the secretion of adrenal stress hormones. In this regard, if in acute stroke patients van Kooten et al. found no correlation between norepinephrine levels and blood glucose, Tracey et al. found a correlation between cortisol levels and cerebral lesion volume, so that the relationship between blood glucose and mortality disappeared by adjusting the analysis for cortisol levels. Finally, a further possible cause of hyperglycemia is the presence, among non-diabetic patients, of high risk prediabetic patients (about 50% in Group 1), who may be particularly likely to develop hyperglycemia in stressful conditions. In this regard, in a group of 106 patients with ischemic stroke, Vancheri et al. found that more than two-thirds of them had impaired glucose tolerance, even 3 months after the acute stroke.

The presence, in Group 1, of high risk prediabetic patients, could also explain the higher prevalence, compared to Group 0, of atherosclerotic lesions of large vessels, as documented by the significant higher frequency of arterial revascularizations and (although not significantly) of carotid stenosis, previous myocardial infarct and previous stroke. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation was also significantly higher in Group 1 than in Group 0 (in the TOAST classification, strokes classified as cardioembolic were less numerous than the cases of atrial fibrillation, because some cases of atrial fibrillation had been classified as undetermined, being associated with other possible causes of stroke).

Thus, Group 1 included many strokes associated with atrial fibrillation and large vessel atherosclerosis, all conditions that tend to generate large ischemic cerebral lesions, thus determining an important acute stress condition. Transient hyperglycemia, accentuated by the possible presence of prediabetes, could be the consequence and the indicator of this stress condition.

### Hyperglycaemia in acute ischaemic stroke is associated with an increased 5-year mortality [^114Yr4iW]. Age and Ageing (2009). Low credibility.

Background

admission hyperglycaemia (HG) is associated with worse prognosis and higher mortality within 3 months after stroke. Reports on long-term mortality are inconsistent.

Objective

to evaluate the influence of admission HG [blood glucose (BG) levels > 8 mmol/L] on long-term mortality after ischaemic stroke (IS) and transient ischaemic attack (TIA).

Methods

consecutive patients with IS or TIA, admitted from January 1997 until December 2002, were retrospectively screened. BG was measured within 3 days from onset of symptoms. Information on the date of death was obtained within 10 years after onset.

Results

a total of 509 patients (78% IS; 22% TIA) were included. Admission HG was present in 28% and 18% of the IS and TIA patients, respectively (P = 0.05). Mean admission BG was 7.6 ± 3.2 mmol/L in the IS and 6.7 ± 2.3 mmol/L in TIA (P = 0.002). During a mean observation of 66 ± 35 months, the overall 1- and 10-year mortality rate was 12% and 51% in IS compared to 4% and 38% in TIA patients (P = 0.004). Normoglycaemic IS patients had a longer median survival than those with HG (113 vs 84 months, P = 0.04). Admission HG did not affect the mortality rates in TIA patients.

Conclusion

admission HG is associated with greater mortality rates up to 5 years after stroke but does not influence the survival of TIA patients.

### Hyperglycemia as an independent predictor of worse outcome in non-diabetic patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke [^115kKCdo]. Neurocritical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if differences in outcome exist between diabetic and non-diabetic patients who present to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute ischemic stoke (AIS) and elevated blood glucose.

Methods

The study population consisted of 447 consecutive patients who presented to the ED with AIS within 24 h of symptom onset and had blood glucose measured on presentation. Hyperglycemia was defined as > 130 mg/dl. Outcomes studied included infarct volume, stroke severity (NIH Stroke Scale), functional impairment (modified Rankin Score), and 90-day mortality. Patients with hyperglycemia were then stratified into those with and without a prior history of diabetes mellitus (DM) for the purposes of analysis.

Results

Patients with hyperglycemia exhibited significantly greater stroke severity (P = 0.002) and greater functional impairment (P = 0.004) than those with normoglycemia. Patients with hyperglycemia were 2.3 times more likely to be dead at 90 days compared to those with normal glucose (P < 0.001). Stroke severity (P < 0.001) and functional impairment (P < 0.001) were both significantly worse in patients with hyperglycemia and no prior history of DM, when compared to patients with hyperglycemia and previously diagnosed DM. Among the patients without a prior history of DM, patients with hyperglycemia were 3.4 times more likely to die within 90 days (P < 0.001) when compared with patients with normoglycemia. In contrast, the hazard ratio was 1.6 among the patients with DM (P = 0.66).

Conclusion

Hyperglycemia on presentation is associated with significantly poorer outcomes following AIS. Patients with hyperglycemia and no prior history of DM have a particularly poor prognosis, worse than that for patients with known diabetes and hyperglycemia.

### Hyperglycemia, risk of subsequent stroke, and efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy: a post hoc analysis of the POINT trial [^115HomTH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The SHINE trialrandomized 1151 patients with hyperglycemia on presentation to either intensive therapy via continuous intravenous insulin infusion (target glucose 80–130 mg/dL) or standard therapy (target glucose 80–179 mg/dL) via an insulin sliding scale administered subcutaneously. There was no difference in the primary outcome (proportion of patients with a favorable score on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days) between the 2 groups and more episodes of hypoglycemia in the intensive versus standard therapy groups (11.2% versus 3.2%). Subsequent ischemic stroke was not ascertained as a secondary outcome in this trial, but there were an equivalent number of ischemic strokes (16) reported across each arm as a serious adverse event. Although not specifically designed to test the hypothesis that control of serum glucose reduced the risk of subsequent stroke, the results suggest that elevated serum glucose may be a marker of overall sickness/illness severity and not a target for therapy itself.

There are limitations inherent in this study. First, because this is a secondary analysis of data already collected from a well‐phenotyped clinical trial population with high‐risk TIA or acute minor ischemic stroke, our results should be used for hypothesis generation only. Second, the subgroup of patients with hyperglycemia was small (12.2% of the study sample), which limits our power to observe true effects. In particular, our finding that dual antiplatelet therapy was not associated with a reduced risk of subsequent stroke should be interpreted with caution and should not be evoked as a reason to deviate from guideline‐based care in this population (the most recent American Heart Association stroke secondary prevention guidelines advocate for the use of dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 to 90 days for patients with noncardioembolic minor ischemic stroke or high‐risk TIA). Third, the POINT excluded patients who received IV tissue‐type plasminogen activator, underwent mechanical thrombectomy, had an indication for anticoagulation, or were planned for a revascularization procedure, and so our results may not apply to these groups of patients. Fourth, hypo‐ or hyperglycemia can cause acute, focal neurological deficits. Although abnormalities in serum glucose were not listed as exclusion criteria for POINT, the trial protocol did require that the study investigator believed the primary reason for the presenting neurological deficit to be focal brain ischemia. Thus, it is possible that some patients with hypo‐ or hyperglycemia and concurrent stroke were erroneously excluded from the trial. Finally, glucose levels were not taken with reference to the time of a patient's last meal and thus are classified as random levels.

### Association between glycemia and outcomes of neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161nX2e]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Stable normal glycemia is crucial to improve the prognosis of neonates with HIE because it helps to maintain a normal brain metabolism. Neonates with HIE are prone to glucose-metabolism disorders due to ischemia and hypoxia. During the transition from fetal to neonatal life, the primary energy supply is converted from glucose to substitute substances such as ketones, lactate, and fatty acids. Transient hypoxia is a part of the normal delivery process, but asphyxia leads to rapid depletion of the neonate glucose supply, leading to hypoglycemia and affecting the nervous, hepatic, and endocrine systems. Some neonates experience a stress-induced hyperglycemic episode that interrupts the hypoglycemic period that is due to acute activation of the endocrine system by ischemia and hypoxia. The activation promotes secretion of metabolic hormones such as catecholamines, cortisol, growth hormone, and glucagon, stimulating glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis, inhibiting the biological effects of insulin, and thereby increasing levels of glycemia. Early hyperglycemia in neonates with asphyxia may reflect a decrease in brain glucose uptake and acute sustained utilization of adenosine triphosphate and H1 release, as indicated by low blood pH values. Hyperglycemia may reflect an acute response, a hypothesis supported by experiments in piglets, in which glycemia levels increased immediately after asphyxiation. These findings are similar to those after cardiac arrest or traumatic brain injury in animals and humans, with hyperglycemia being associated with severe brain injury. Since the 1990s, scholars have reported an association between glycemia and the prognosis of neonates with HIE. However, most studies have explored mortality rates without elucidating other prognostic factors. In this context, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of data in 13 comparative studies involving 2,832 patients.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with metabolic syndrome after mild ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^111AocYv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Patients with acute mild ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at high risk of recurrent stroke. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) of clopidogrel combined with aspirin administered within 24 or 72 hours after symptom onset can reduce the risk of recurrent stroke at 90 days as compared with aspirin therapy alone. Guidelines recommend that the DAPT can be administered to patients with a minor ischemic stroke within 24 hours after symptom onset. However, there remain knowledge gaps in efficacy and potential harm of DAPT among specific subgroups of patients.

The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients with stroke is up to 32.5% to 47.2% according to different criteria and is substantially associated with an adverse prognosis. Currently, subgroup analyses of DAPT trials have investigated the impact of specific components of MetS, such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, on the efficacy of DAPT. The INSPIRES (Intensive Statin and Antiplatelet Therapy for Acute High‐Risk Intracranial or Extracranial Atherosclerosis; identifier: NCT03635749) trial found that patients with hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia may have lower benefit from DAPT in stroke prevention within 90 days. The Platelet‐Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke trial found that hypertension and hyperglycemia compromised the therapeutic effect of DAPT on stroke recurrence. Furthermore, extensive studies demonstrate that all components of MetS are involved in the prothrombotic tendency through platelet hyperaggregability and hyperactivation. This raises a possibility that the efficacy of DAPT on recurrent stroke prevention may be decreased in patients with MetS compared with those without MetS. However, empirical evidence remains limited on whether MetS itself rather than its components could lower the efficacy of DAPT for stroke prevention as compared with the aspirin therapy alone. Only 1 study from subgroup analysis of the CHANCE (Clopidogrel in High‐Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events) trial showed that the efficacy of DAPT on stroke recurrence prevention was not different between patients with and without MetS. Notably, the CHANCE trial initiated DAPT within 24 hours after the onset of minor stroke or high‐risk TIA. Whether MetS would make a difference to the efficacy of DAPT initiated beyond 24 hours remain unknown. Addressing this issue may provide more elaborate evidence to determine the applicability of DAPT in patients with stroke combined with MetS.

Using the data from the INSPIRES trial, we investigated the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel–aspirin therapy initiated within 72 hours after symptom onset in patients with MetS.

Endpoints and follow up

In this study, the mean follow-up duration was 34 months. Clinical outcomes were recorded by two experts via telephone calls, clinic visits, review of medical case history, and communication with patients' families. The primary observational clinical endpoints of the present investigation were MACE, which includes cardiac death, heart failure, nonfatal MI, stroke, and angina rehospitalization. Deaths caused by malignant arrhythmias, acute MI, heart failure, or other cardiac conditions were defined as cardiac deaths. Nonfatal MI was defined as positive cardiac biomarkers or dynamic changes on electrocardiograms in addition to the typical symptoms of myocardial ischemia. A heart failure diagnosis was made based on recent ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. A stroke is diagnosed when there is evidence of ischemic cerebral infarction because of thrombotic or embolic obstruction.

Secondary stroke prevention — laboratory and metabolic assessment. Control of hypertension, blood glucose, and lipids has been proven effective in reducing ischemic stroke risk; fasting is not routinely required for lipid testing except for patients with nonfasting triglycerides of > 440 mg/dL, who should have fasting levels drawn. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing can detect new type 2 diabetes in ≈11.5% and prediabetes in 36.2% of patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke. In lacunar infarction, chronic kidney disease is associated with a 50% increase in risk of recurrent stroke. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time testing screens for relevant clotting and bleeding disorders; an isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time can be seen with heparin use, lupus anticoagulant, or clotting factor deficiencies.

### Fasting blood glucose-to-glycated hemoglobin ratio and all-cause mortality among Chinese in-hospital patients with acute stroke: a 12-month follow-up study [^113KNgXR]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this multicenter, prospective study, we explored the association between stress hyperglycemia and all-cause mortality and poor prognosis in patients with acute stroke and found that the glucose/HbA1c ratio may independently predict mid- and long-term all-cause mortality (adjusted OR: 2.59, 95% CI: 1.14–5.89), infectious complications (adjusted OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.27–4.43), and dysfunction (adjusted OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.06–3.01) in acute stroke patients. There are several types of markers of stress hyperglycemia. Absolute increasing in admission glucose level was found to be associated with in-hospital mortality after acute stroke in earlier studies. Recent studies have shown that relative hyperglycemia, defined as the glucose to HbA1c ratio or as admission glucose divided by the estimated average glucose level derived from HbA1c, could work as an economical and practical indicator to precisely detect and quantify stress hyperglycemia. The present study also revealed that relative glucose levels were much better than absolute glucose indicators in predicting 3 months and 12 months mortality (Additional file 3 and Fig. 4). Besides glucose/HbA1c ratio, glucose/glycated albumin ratio was shown to be associated with an increased risk of stroke in patients with a minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. The advantage of HbA1c is that it has been proposed to be a valuable diagnostic tool for monitoring long-term glycemic control for about 2 to 4 months while glycated albumin level reflects mean glycemia level over 2 to 4 weeks. Besides, HbA1c appears to be rather affordable and routine compared with glycated albumin.

### Influence of prestroke glycemic status on outcomes by age in patients with acute ischemic stroke and diabetes mellitus [^1174abDC]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a significant risk factor for stroke in the general population and for vascular events after acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). In patients with ischemic stroke and diabetes, admission HbA1c levels have been linked to 1‐year vascular events and 3‐month functional outcomes. However, clinical trials have not demonstrated a benefit of intensive glucose control on early recurrent stroke or functional outcomes in these patients.

The European or American stroke guidelines suggest maintaining HbA1c below 7.0% in patients with ischemic stroke, but emphasize that targets should be individualized based on age and patient‐specific factors. However, age‐specific HbA1c targets for stroke patients are not well‐defined, and research in this area remains limited. Guidelines for diabetes management generally recommend an HbA1c target of 7%–8%, or even 8%–9% for elderly individuals with limited life expectancy or significant comorbidities, to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Notably, the risk of vascular events associated with diabetes is higher in younger adults than in older adults. Previous studies have often categorized age groups simply as < 65 years versus ≥ 65 years, lacking detailed granularity. Given that ischemic stroke and TIA patients are typically older and have preexisting vascular conditions, the impact of prestroke glycemic control on stroke prognosis may vary by age.

This study aims to explore the association between admission HbA1c levels and the risk of subsequent vascular events, stratified by age, in patients with ischemic stroke and diabetes. By classifying patients into more specific age and HbA1c groups, we seek to identify potential variations in outcomes across different age groups.

### Triglyceride-glucose index as a prognostic marker after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack: a prospective observational study [^116jp6Yz]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 866 patients (mean age, 70.1 years; male, 60.9%) were included in the analysis. The median TyG index was 8.74 (interquartile range, 8.34–9.16). Patients were classified into three groups according to tertiles of the TyG index (tertile 1, TyG index < 8.48, n = 288; tertile 2, 8.48 ≤ TyG index ≤ 9.01, n = 289; and tertile 3, TyG index > 9.01, n = 289). The mean (standard deviation) TyG index levels of the three groups were 8.11 (0.33), 8.74 (0.15), and 9.41 (0.49), respectively. Table 1 presents the baseline patient characteristics. Compared with patients in the lowest tertile group, those in the higher tertile groups were more likely to be male and obese, to have hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and drinking habit, and less likely to have atrial fibrillation. The examination and investigation results are presented in (Additional file 1: Table S1). Higher TyG index levels were associated with higher systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, TG, glucose, and HbA1c levels, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Regarding the etiologic subtype of the index event, patients in the highest tertile group were more likely to have had atherothrombosis, whereas those in the lowest tertile group were more likely to have had cardioembolism.

### Admission hyperglycemia predicts a worse outcome in stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis [^117MYQWS]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

What remains unclear is whether hyperglycemia is merely an epiphenomenon of underlying stroke severity or if it is itself directly harmful to ischemic brain tissue. After adjustment for clinical stroke severity, a dose-response relationship between baseline glucose and unfavorable outcome is still suggested by our results and those of others. There is ample animal literature suggesting plausible mechanisms by which glucose may exert a deleterious effect on ischemic brain, including cellular acidosis caused by anaerobic glycolysis, enhanced free radical production, increased blood-brain barrier permeability, impaired mitochondrial function, influx of intracellular Ca 2+, and cellular edema.

However, noncausal explanations have also been proposed. Baseline hyperglycemia may represent an acute stress response from activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis causing a rise in cortisol and catecholamines and, therefore, may simply be indicative of underlying stroke severity. Furthermore, it may also be a result of injury or irritation of brain areas involved in glucose regulation, a theory supported by the association of hyperglycemia with strokes involving the insula. Finally, hyperglycemia may reflect previously undiagnosed diabetes.

### Stress hyperglycemia and prognosis of stroke in nondiabetic and diabetic patients: a systematic overview [^1152t9h7]. Stroke (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

"Stress" hyperglycemia may be associated with increased mortality and poor recovery in diabetic and nondiabetic patients after stroke. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature relating acute poststroke glucose levels to the subsequent course were done to summarize and quantify this relationship.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was done for cohort studies reporting mortality and/or functional recovery after stroke in relation to admission glucose level. Relative risks in hyperglycemic compared with normoglycemic patients with and without diabetes were calculated and meta-analyzed when possible.

Results

Thirty-two studies were identified; relative risks for prespecified outcomes were reported or could be calculated in 26 studies. After stroke of either subtype (ischemic or hemorrhagic), the unadjusted relative risk of in-hospital or 30-day mortality associated with admission glucose level > 6 to 8 mmol/L (108 to 144 mg/dL) was 3.07 (95% CI, 2.50 to 3.79) in nondiabetic patients and 1.30 (95% CI, 0.49 to 3.43) in diabetic patients. After ischemic stroke, admission glucose level > 6.1 to 7.0 mmol/L (110 to 126 mg/dL) was associated with increased risk of in-hospital or 30-day mortality in nondiabetic patients only (relative risk = 3.28; 95% CI, 2.32 to 4.64). After hemorrhagic stroke, admission hyperglycemia was not associated with higher mortality in either diabetic or nondiabetic patients. Nondiabetic stroke survivors whose admission glucose level was > 6.7 to 8 mmol/L (121 to 144 mg/dL) also had a greater risk of poor functional recovery (relative risk = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.73).

Conclusions

Acute hyperglycemia predicts increased risk of in-hospital mortality after ischemic stroke in nondiabetic patients and increased risk of poor functional recovery in nondiabetic stroke survivors.

Acute ischemic stroke — glucose management: Evidence indicates that persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours after AIS is associated with worse outcomes than normoglycemia, and thus, it is reasonable to treat hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels in a range of 140 to 180 mg/dL and to closely monitor to prevent hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 60 mg/dL) should be treated in patients with AIS.

### Transient hyperglycemia in ischemic stroke patients [^112ruwCb]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to investigate glucose derangement and its short- and long-term prognostic significance in nondiabetic ischemic stroke patients. The study involved 262 consecutive patients, mean age: 70.1 ± 12.4 years, with a supratentorial ischemic stroke. The following data were collected: patients characteristics, risk factors, comorbidities, and stroke severity assessed by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS). Serum glucose levels were measured on admission, on the next, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 14th day after stroke onset. The outcome measures on day 30 were mortality and capacity to perform daily activities: the Barthel Index and Rankin Scale. The 1-year survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess predictors of 1-year mortality in nondiabetics. Diabetes mellitus was found in 24.8% of patients and transient hyperglycemia in 36.3% of patients. Patients with transient hyperglycemia scored lower on SSS in the subsequent days of assessment than patients with either diabetes mellitus or normoglycemia. They had larger ischemic lesions on computer tomography (CT) than diabetics and had higher 30-day mortality than normoglycemics (p < 0.05). One-year mortality was similar in transient hyperglycemics and diabetics, and both were significantly higher than in normoglycemics (p < 0.05). A proportional hazards model analysis showed that transient hyperglycemia is not an independent predictor of death within a year after stroke.

### Hospital management of diabetes [^112kRh2R]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

The degree of hyperglycemia may be an important predictor of morbidity and mortality among patients with MI or stroke, and in those undergoing surgical procedures including coronary artery bypass. Hyperglycemia should be aggressively controlled from the time of hospital admission regardless of the patient's primary medical problem or previous diabetes status. Innovative systems for monitoring glucose and for delivering insulin coupled with new pharmacologic therapy, such as long-acting insulin analogues, may help reduce the morbidity and mortality occurring in the estimated 6 million annual hospitalizations that are accompanied by hyperglycemia in the United States.

### Secondary prevention medication persistence and prognosis of acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack [^112qASQr]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study showed that persistence in secondary prevention medications, especially in all classes of medications prescribed by the physician, can significantly decrease the risk of adverse events after stroke. These findings support the current guidelines set by the Chinese Stroke Association and the American Stroke Association on secondary prevention. Secondary prevention is an important part of the comprehensive strategy for stroke prevention, and all appropriate secondary prevention medications should be prescribed and continued for eligible patients who have experienced an ischaemic stroke or TIA.

There are several limitations in our study. Since the hospitals participated in this study were voluntary, compared with other hospitals, they may have more motivations which may lead to better outcomes. Persistence is often defined as the duration of treatment, while adherence is often defined as the extent to which patients took medications according to the provider's advice. Our study analysed the association between stroke prognosis and secondary prevention medication persistence, but not adherence. As such, we did not know whether patients stopped taking medications due to their provider's instructions or due to other reasons. Furthermore, with the improvement of people's living standards and awareness of stroke, more and more patients with mild symptoms go to hospital for treatment as soon as possible. Despite representative as a whole, potential bias was unavoidable in this study since participants at admission had a median NIHSS score of 3. In addition, persistence was defined from discharge to 3 months, while the relevant data of factors such as blood pressure, glucose and lipids of the patients at 3 months were not collected, but these factors may confound the observed relationships. Finally, medication persistence and stroke outcomes were only analysed from 3 months to 1 year after onset. Further studies are needed to determine the association between secondary prevention medications and long-term stroke outcomes.

### Admission hyperglycemia predicts a worse outcome in stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis [^112Meidh]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The argument for causality is also further mitigated by the equivocal results of trials targeting aggressive glucose-lowering therapy in the acute phase after stroke. No evidence to date supports the concept that ensuring strict poststroke normoglycemia improves outcome. The UK Glucose Insulin in Stroke Trial (GIST-UK) was both stopped early and underpowered but suggested no difference in clinical outcome between patients randomly assigned to glucose-potassium-insulin infusion to maintain glucose levels at 4–7 mmol/l over the first 24 h and patients given saline without glucose-lowering interventions. The lack of benefit may be related to the relatively late initiation of therapy after stroke (median 14 h) and the modest mean reduction in glucose achieved in the treatment arm (0.57 mmol/l).

Our prospective cohort study is the largest yet to report on the effect of admission glucose exclusively in stroke patients treated uniformly with IV-tPA. Our results confirm the notion that poststroke hyperglycemia is a predictor of death, worse functional outcome, and SICH in thrombolyzed patients. This association remains true regardless of stroke subtype or severity and in patients with and without diabetes. We acknowledge that our work has several limitations. First, it is an observational study. Nonetheless, the data were prospectively collected from a large number of representative patients drawn from 60 hospitals across Canada. Second, our results are based on only a single admission glucose value. Contrary to data for acute coronary syndromes arguing that dynamic changes in glucose are not prognostically significant, it has recently been suggested that changes in glucose over the first 24 h among stroke patients may provide additional prognostic value. However, use of a single baseline glucose value presumably underestimates potential harm, because patients with the highest admission glucose levels would most likely have been treated earlier and more aggressively with glucose-lowering therapies. Also, because thrombolytic treatment is necessarily rapid, a single admission glucose level has greater clinical utility for guiding acute treatment decisions. Third, we did not collect A1C values and so we do not have any measures of chronic dysglycemia. However, in acute coronary syndromes, A1C levels convey little short-term prognostic value with respect to mortality. Fourth, the method of blood glucose determination was not uniform, with either capillary blood or laboratory glucose measurements used at different sites. Both methods have been shown to provide comparable results in critically ill patients. Fifth, we have no information regarding glycemic management during hospitalization or after discharge. Last, baseline differences between both groups may be potential confounders that cannot be entirely accounted for using statistical adjustments.

### Impact of glycemic treatment and blood glucose monitoring on outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke without prior diabetes: a longitudinal cohort study [^113wkAVG]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Glycemic management practices vary widely, often adopting a conservative approach due to the risks of iatrogenic hypoglycemia, ambiguous benefits, and potential overuse of healthcare resources, which vary by the robustness of each country's healthcare system. Frequently, hyperglycemia remains unmanaged, and its control in AIS continues to be debated. Despite these controversies, there is a scarcity of large-scale longitudinal studies investigating the comprehensive effects of glycemic management, including both glycemic treatment and BGM, on AIS outcomes. This study leverages the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to examine both the short- and long-term prognostic impacts of managing glycemia during the acute hospitalization phase on stroke recurrence and mortality among patients experiencing their first-ever ischemic stroke (FIS) with hyperglycemia (FISHG), who had not been previously diagnosed with DM.

### Transient ischemic attack: part II. risk factor modification… [^112w2gva]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Initial Management The risk of stroke within 90 days after a TIA has been reported at 10 to 20 percent, with approximately one-half of these strokes occurring within the first 48 hours after initial presentation. 35, 36 Early initiation of treatment after a TIA, including medication and surgical intervention, can significantly reduce the risk of early stroke. 37 This may suggest that hospitalization is beneficial in patients at high risk. Advantages of admission include the opportunity for complete diagnostic evaluation, confirmation of the diagnosis, and early treatment to reduce the risk of stroke. 38 The potential administration of tissue plasminogen activator may be optimized if an early stroke occurs while the patient is hospitalized and should be considered in any patients with lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. 1 Urgent access to tissue plasminogen activator and management of TIA can reduce subsequent stroke risk.

Of those presenting with TIA or minor stroke, 50 to 80 percent have elevated blood pressure on initial evaluation. 39 Patients with systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg are at higher risk of stroke after TIA. 39 Blood pressure reduction should be individualized based on comorbidities, age, and risk of hypotension. For patients who have a history of TIA or stroke, statin therapy lowers the five-year absolute risk of stroke by 2. 2 percent. 10 A 50 percent or greater reduction in LDL-C level confers a 33 percent RRR for ischemic stroke and a 37 percent RRR for major coronary events, compared with no change or an elevation in LDL-C levels.

11 For patients who have a history of TIA or stroke and no known coronary heart disease, statin therapy decreases the five-year absolute risk of developing clinically evident coronary heart disease from 8. 6 to
5. 1 percent.

### Impaired glucose metabolism and the risk of vascular events and mortality after ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1116wHd6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus (DM), prediabetes, and insulin resistance are highly prevalent in patients with ischemic stroke (IS). DM is associated with higher risk for poor outcomes after IS.

Objective

Investigate the risk of recurrent vascular events and mortality associated with impaired glucose metabolism compared to normoglycemia in patients with IS and transient ischemic attack (TIA).

Methods

Systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library on 21st March 2024 and via citation searching. Studies that comprised IS or TIA patients and exposures of impaired glucose metabolism were eligible. Study Quality Assessment Tool was used for risk of bias assessment. Covariate adjusted outcomes were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes

Recurrent stroke, cardiac events, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and composite of vascular outcomes.

Results

Of 10,974 identified studies 159 were eligible. 67% had low risk of bias. DM was associated with an increased risk for composite events (pooled HR (pHR) including 445,808 patients: 1.58, 95% CI 1.34–1.85, I² = 88%), recurrent stroke (pHR including 1.161.527 patients: 1.42 (1.29–1.56, I² = 92%), cardiac events (pHR including 443,863 patients: 1.55, 1.50–1.61, I² = 0%), and all-cause mortality (pHR including 1.031.472 patients: 1.56, 1.34–1.82, I² = 99%). Prediabetes was associated with an increased risk for composite events (pHR including 8,262 patients: 1.50, 1.15–1.96, I² = 0%) and recurrent stroke (pHR including 10,429 patients: 1.50, 1.18–1.91, I² = 0), however, not with mortality (pHR including 9,378 patients, 1.82, 0.73–4.57, I² = 78%). Insulin resistance was associated with recurrent stroke (pHR including 21,363 patients: 1.56, 1.19–2.05, I² = 55%), but not with mortality (pHR including 21,363 patients: 1.31, 0.66–2.59, I² = 85%).

Discussion

DM is associated with a 56% increased relative risk of death after IS and TIA. Risk estimates regarding recurrent events are similarly high between prediabetes and DM, indicating high cardiovascular risk burden already in precursor stages of DM. There was a high heterogeneity across most outcomes.

Secondary stroke prevention — intensive glucose control and macrovascular outcomes indicates less evidence for a benefit of intensive glucose control on stroke; initial major trials did not show macrovascular benefit, although long-term follow-up of the DCCT and the UKPDS showed benefit, and meta-analyses reported benefits for some cardiovascular outcomes but not for stroke; no trials or meta-analyses have assessed patients with a history of stroke; experts view any macrovascular benefit as likely limited to younger patients with recent-onset diabetes and no established vascular disease, and some professional organizations recommended targeting an HbA1c of 7% to 8% or even 8% to 9% in elderly individuals with limited life expectancy or significant comorbid illness to reduce hypoglycemia risk.

Management of abnormal glucose metabolism

Recommendations

The prognosis of persistent hyperglycaemia in patients with AIS within 24 hours after onset is worse than that of normal blood glucose. So, it is reasonable to control blood glucose to the range between 140~180 mg/dL. At the same time, blood sugar should be closely monitored to prevent hypoglycaemia (class IIa, level of evidence C).
Treatment should be given to patients with AIS with hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 60 mg/dL) (class I, level of evidence C).
It is recommended that patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA with diabetes should be evaluated and given the best management guideline (class I, level of evidence A).
For all inpatients/outpatients with ischaemic stroke or TIA, rapid blood glucose, 2 hours postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin or 75 g oral glucose tolerance test are recommended for screening of diabetes mellitus (class IIa, level of evidence C).
Lifestyle and/or drug intervention in patients with diabetes or prediabetes can reduce ischaemic stroke or TIA events. The recommended treatment target for glycosylated haemoglobin is ≤ 7% (class I, level of evidence B).
The hypoglycaemic regimen should consider the clinical characteristics of patients and the safety of drugs. To set up individual blood glucose control targets, one should be on guard against the harm caused by hypoglycemia (class IIa, level of evidence B).

Results

General characteristics of the 4 groups of stroke patients

Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the 4 groups of stroke patients (1055 ischemic and 164 hemorrhagic). Diabetic patients, both non-hyperglycemic and hyperglycemic, had higher glucose levels than the corresponding non-diabetic groups. The hyperglycemia of non-diabetic patients (Group 1) was generally mild and transient, falling below the threshold of 126 mg/dl (7 mmol/l) within a few days and, in fact, only in 9.6% of cases a short insulin treatment was administered. In sporadic cases (1.9%) insulin was administered to Group 0 patients who had hyperglycemia in the days following admission. Glycated hemoglobin values were highest in Group 3, intermediate in Group 2 and lowest in Group 1 (glycated hemoglobin was not measured in Group 0). Among group 1 patients, 46.7% had glycated hemoglobin ≥ 6% (≥ 42 mmol/mol), thus being defined as high risk prediabetic according to the International Expert Committee on HbA1c. Compared to Group 0, in Group 3 there was a higher prevalence of men and chronic kidney disease; in addition, in both groups of diabetic patients there was a higher frequency of hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, HDL hypocholesterolemia, carotid stenosis, previous myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease and arterial revascularizations. In relation to all these variables, Group 1 did not differ significantly from Groups 2 and 3, and generally had higher values, although not significantly, than Group 0. In addition, in Group 1 there was a higher frequency of atrial fibrillation than in Groups 0 and 3, a higher frequency of previous stroke than in Group 3 and a higher frequency of arterial revascularizations than in Group 0. Finally, Group 1 had a significantly lower prevalence of small artery strokes than all other groups, while Group 3 had the highest prevalence of such strokes and the lowest frequency of thrombolysis.

### Detrimental effect of acute hyperglycemia on the outcomes of large ischemic region stroke [^114ZayMx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Poorer functional and safety outcomes after EVT versus medical management alone by increase in admission blood glucose have implications for future research on treatment decisions for large ischemic region stroke. However, the nature of this study as a subanalysis should be well understood when interpreting the present results; the results do not necessarily suggest that EVT should be withheld for large ischemic region stroke with severe hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia may have become more severe in patients with stroke who originally had a poor prognosis because of the disease stress, which may have linked hyperglycemia to a worse prognosis. The negative results of the previous randomized trials of treating hyperglycemia in patients with acute stroke may reflect the possibility that acute hyperglycemia in stroke patients is a stress response. The higher levels of white blood cell count and C‐reactive protein in the group with severe hyperglycemia in the present analysis may indicate that the stroke itself was severe with poor prognosis. Nevertheless, the median admission glucose level of 131 mg/dL in the present study was not particularly high compared with the previous mechanical thrombectomy trials of non‐large ischemic region stroke. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the clinical relevance of hyperglycemia in the prognosis after EVT for acute ischemic stroke.

Although it is necessary to be cautious in interpreting the present results by directly associating them to the issue of optimizing acute glycemic control in large ischemic region strokes, patients with severe hyperglycemia on admission still had a median glucose level of 200 mg/dL at 48 hours. The blood glucose levels of 10 patients who did not have severe hyperglycemia on admission became ≥ 180 mg/dL at 48 hours; compared with patients who experienced no severe hyperglycemia during the course, those with transient, delayed, and persistent severe hyperglycemia tended to show a less achievement rate of mRS score, a higher symptomatic ICH rate, and a higher rate of decompressive craniectomies. Current stroke guidelines suggest treating hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels in the range of 140 to 180 mg/dL (7.8–10.0 mmol/L) with close monitoring to avoid hypoglycemia. However, the evidence for this recommendation is significantly limited.

### Admission hyperglycemia predicts a worse outcome in stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis [^1146MSUh]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Admission hyperglycemia has been associated with worse outcomes in ischemic stroke. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia (glucose > 8.0 mmol/l) in the hyperacute phase would be independently associated with increased mortality, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH), and poor functional status at 90 days in stroke patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA).

Research Design and Methods

Using data from the prospective, multicenter Canadian Alteplase for Stroke Effectiveness Study (CASES), the association between admission glucose > 8.0 mmol/l and mortality, SICH, and poor functional status at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale > 1) was examined. Similar analyses examining glucose as a continuous measure were conducted.

Results

Of 1,098 patients, 296 (27%) had admission hyperglycemia, including 18% of those without diabetes and 70% of those with diabetes. After multivariable logistic regression, admission hyperglycemia was found to be independently associated with increased risk of death (adjusted risk ratio 1.5 [95% CI 1.2–1.9]), SICH (1.69 [0.95–3.00]), and a decreased probability of a favorable outcome at 90 days (0.7 [0.5–0.9]). An incremental risk of death and SICH and unfavorable 90-day outcomes was observed with increasing admission glucose. This observation held true for patients with and without diabetes.

Conclusions

In this cohort of IV-tPA-treated stroke patients, admission hyperglycemia was independently associated with increased risk of death, SICH, and poor functional status at 90 days. Treatment trials continue to be urgently needed to determine whether this is a modifiable risk factor for poor outcome.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to management of glucose levels, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to consider treating hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels of 140–180 mg/dL and obtaining close monitoring to prevent hypoglycemia in patients with AIS since persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours after AIS is associated with worse outcomes.

### Stress hyperglycemia and prognosis of minor ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack: the CHANCE study (clopidogrel in high-risk patients with acute nondisabling cerebrovascular events) [^114E55Ui]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

We aimed to determine the association between stress hyperglycemia and risk of new stroke in patients with a minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Methods

A subgroup of 3026 consecutive patients from 73 prespecified sites of the CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events) were analyzed. Stress hyperglycemia was measured by glucose/glycated albumin (GA) ratio. Glucose/GA ratio was calculated by fasting plasma glucose divided by GA and categorized into 4 even groups according to the quartiles. The primary outcome was a new stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) at 90 days. We assessed the association between glucose/GA ratio and risk of stroke by multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for potential covariates.

Results

Among 3026 patients included, a total of 299 (9.9%) new stroke occurred at 3 months. Compared with patients with the lowest quartile, patients with the highest quartile of glucose/GA ratio was associated with an increased risk of stroke at 3 months after adjusted for potential covariates (12.0% versus 9.2%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–2.01). Similar results were observed after further adjusted for fasting plasma glucose. We also observed that higher level of glucose/GA ratio was associated with an increased risk of stroke with a threshold of 0.29 using a Cox regression model with restricted cubic spline.

Conclusions

Stress hyperglycemia, measured by glucose/GA ratio, was associated with an increased risk of stroke in patients with a minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Glucose after acute ischemic stroke — after AIS, it is reasonable to screen all patients for diabetes mellitus with testing of fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, or an oral glucose tolerance test; choice of test and timing should be guided by clinical judgment and recognition that acute illness may temporarily perturb measures of plasma glucose, and in general, hemoglobin A1c may be more accurate than other screening tests in the immediate postevent period.

### Association between blood glucose level trajectories and 30-day mortality risk in patients with acute ischemic stroke: analysis of the MIMIC database 2001–2019 [^111EMTXP]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is an acute condition in which brain cells are damaged due to reduced blood flow to the brain. AIS is one of the major types of stroke, which causes a significant disease burden and is a leading cause of death and disability. Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally, with nearly 7 million stroke-related deaths, more than 100 million stroke patients and 12 million new stroke cases worldwide in 2019. Major risk factors for the development of AIS include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and obesity.

Hyperglycemia is one of the most common comorbidities in patients with AIS. Hyperglycemia promotes thrombotic inflammation through activation of endothelial cells, platelets, and neutrophils, and is associated with a poor short-term prognosis of hemorrhagic transformation, deterioration of neurological function, and death in patients with AIS. Some studies suggest that changes in blood glucose levels may be more valuable for clinical monitoring than baseline blood glucose levels. Blood glucose level trajectory refers to the longitudinal change in an individual's blood glucose over time, which better reflects blood glucose levels, the range and direction of blood glucose changes at different time points than variability indicators. Li et al. showed that individuals with longitudinally elevated fasting glucose level trajectories had a higher risk of death even if they had normal glucose levels at baseline. The longitudinal trajectory of common indicators (e.g. hemoglobin, etc.) over time was also significantly associated with short-term prognosis in critically ill patients. However, the impact of the longitudinal trajectory of short-term glucose changes on the prognosis of patients with AIS remains unclear. Therefore, this study intended to investigate the association between different short-term longitudinal blood glucose level change trajectories and the 30-day mortality risk in patients with AIS, to provide a basis for glucose management in patients with AIS.

### Short-term prognosis of stroke among patients diagnosed in the emergency department with a transient ischemic attack [^116P8jEd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objective

It is now clear that transient ischemic attacks and strokes are different manifestations of the same disease and transient ischemic attacks are often warning signs of an impending stroke. Unfortunately, it is unclear when the next event will occur in an individual patient. It is critical for emergency physicians to know what the true risk of stroke is for patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with a transient ischemic attack and a normal neurologic examination result. We perform an evidence-based emergency medicine shortcut review of the short-term outcome of stroke among patients diagnosed in the ED with a transient ischemic attack.

Methods

We searched PubMed for articles that studied patients with transient ischemic attack and reported their risk of stroke up to 30 days. We used standard criteria to appraise the quality of prognostic studies.

Results

Eight studies met the inclusion criteria; 5 were conducted prospectively and 3 had a retrospective design. Of the 5 prospective studies, only 2 enrolled patients from the ED. The 48-hour risk of stroke after transient ischemic attack ranged from 1.4% to 9.9% and the 7-day risk ranged from 3.8% to 12.8%. However, the 2 ED-based studies suggest that the short-term risk of having a stroke after a transient ischemic attack in the next 48 hours is approximately 3% to 5% and during the next week is 4% to 7%.

Conclusion

According to studies assessing the short-term prognosis of patients diagnosed with transient ischemic attack in the ED, approximately 1 in 20 patients will have a stroke during the following 48 hours.

### Admission hyperglycemia predicts a worse outcome in stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis [^116FNzJk]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Although it remains unclear whether correcting elevated glucose in the acute phase after ischemic stroke is beneficial, it is apparent that admission hyperglycemia rapidly identifies patients at higher risk for poor outcomes in whom glucose levels should be closely monitored.

### Hyperglycemia, risk of subsequent stroke, and efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy: a post hoc analysis of the POINT trial [^114ZKd2z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

One previous studyexamined glycemic control as a predictor of subsequent stroke in the CHANCE (Clopidogel in High‐Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Events) trial. Using the glucose/glycosylated albumin ratio they found that patients in the highest quartile had an HR of 1.46 (95% CI, 1.06–2.01) of subsequent stroke compared with patients in the lowest quartile. This study was performed in an exclusively Chinese population and relied on 2 separate assays (serum glucose and glycosylated albumin), calculation of a ratio, then classification into quartiles. The current study overcomes the limitations inherent in this prior study by (1) focusing on 1 simple, rapid measurement of serum glucose, and (2) testing our hypothesis in a population more diverse and representative with respect to race, ethnicity, and national origin.

Currently, direct serum glucose measurements are not incorporated in stroke risk classification schemes. However, the presence/absence of diabetes is included in scores used to predict subsequent stroke after TIA, and risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation. Subsequent stroke risk may be estimated based on imaging characteristics or cause classification. The ABCD2and Californiascores aim to predict the risk of stroke after an index TIA at 7 and 90 days, respectively, by combining data on vascular risk factors and characteristics of the presenting stroke. However, there is a heightened risk of stroke within a short period of time after the index event, which suggests that more short‐term, dynamic factors are likely at play. Serum glucose may be a useful measure for identifying patients at high‐risk of early recurrence. By contrast, assay of glycosylated hemoglobin is reflective only of glycemic control over a period of approximately 2.5 months. Additionally, measurement of serum glucose can be performed rapidly, is inexpensive, and does not require calculation. For this reason, its use is proposed in 2 scoring systems for predicting hemorrhage after intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tissue‐type plasminogen activator) use (the TAGand SEDAN scores).

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) blood glucose management states that evidence indicates that persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours after AIS is associated with worse outcomes than normoglycemia and thus, it is reasonable to treat hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels in a range of 140 to 180 mg/dL and to closely monitor to prevent hypoglycemia in patients with AIS. Additionally, hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 60 mg/dL) should be treated in patients with AIS.

### Diabetes, hyperglycaemia, and acute ischaemic stroke [^111zFHoR]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Diabetes and ischaemic stroke often arise together. People with diabetes have more than double the risk of ischaemic stroke after correction for other risk factors, relative to individuals without diabetes. Multifactorial treatment of risk factors for stroke-in particular, lifestyle factors, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia-will prevent a substantial number of these disabling strokes. Hyperglycaemia occurs in 30–40% of patients with acute ischaemic stroke, also in individuals without a known history of diabetes. Admission hyperglycaemia is associated with poor functional outcome, possibly through aggravation of ischaemic damage by disturbing recanalisation and increasing reperfusion injury. Uncertainty surrounds the question of whether glucose-lowering treatment for early stroke can improve clinical outcome. Achievement of normoglycaemia in the early stage of stroke can be difficult, and the possibility of hypoglycaemia remains a concern. Phase 3 studies of glucose-lowering therapy in acute ischaemic stroke are underway.

### Effect of hyperglycemia on stroke outcomes [^1169YCno]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review published data about the relationship between hyperglycemia and the outcome of patients with stroke.

Results

Stroke is the most frequent cause of permanent disability in the Western world and the third leading cause of death among Americans. Each year, more than 500,000 Americans have a cerebrovascular accident. In the medical literature, numerous reports have discussed how hyperglycemia during acute stroke, regardless of a patient's prior diabetes status, has been associated with significantly higher morbidity, higher mortality, longer hospital stays, reduced long-term recovery, and diminished ability to return to work. In the United States alone, an estimated $300 million in additional health-care costs are incurred among hospitalized patients with stroke who also have high blood glucose levels. Treatment of hyperglycemia has safely, successfully, and effectively yielded glucose levels in the normal range in the hospital setting under the direction of specialty physicians and should be implemented in patients with stroke.

Conclusion

Until convincing randomized prospective trials prove that tight glycemic control does not improve stroke outcomes, the overwhelming preponderance of data suggests that aggressive glucose management should be the standard care in all patients with stroke and hyperglycemia.

### Stress hyperglycemia is associated with early neurologic deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke after intravenous thrombolysis without hemorrhagic transformation [^1139Y2n5]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Current research faces several challenges, including the rapid and accurate identification of patients at high risk for END, the development of effective therapeutic strategies to prevent or mitigate END, and the establishment of standardized criteria for defining and evaluating neurological decline. Therefore, managing END in ischemic stroke continues to be a significant challenge in stroke care, underscoring the urgent need for ongoing research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and develop effective prevention and treatment strategies. While many studies have focused on END related to hemorrhagic transformation following thrombolysis in acute cerebral infarction, there is a notable lack of research on END associated with non-hemorrhagic transformation after thrombolysis in patients with acute cerebral infarction caused by non-cardiogenic embolisms.

It has been widely reported that stress hyperglycemia contributes to poor prognosis in patients experiencing acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, its predictive value for early neurological deterioration (END) after intravenous administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV-rtPA) in AIS patients is still unclear. The SHR is a metric used to assess the degree of hyperglycemia in acutely ill patients relative to their estimated baseline glucose levels. SHR aims to differentiate between true diabetic hyperglycemia and stress-induced glucose elevations, which have distinct implications for patient outcomes and management approaches. Recently, SHR has gained recognition as an important prognostic indicator. Several studies have demonstrated that a higher SHR is associated with poorer outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Elevated SHR may indicate a higher risk of mortality, increased incidence of heart failure, and a greater likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events.

### Triglyceride-glucose index as a prognostic marker after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack: a prospective observational study [^111VSmXU]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index has been proposed as a simple and credible surrogate for insulin resistance and an independent predictor of cardiovascular outcomes. Due to lack of data on TyG index in stroke, we aimed to evaluate the predictive value of the index for recurrent vascular event risk among stroke patients.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study, in which 866 patients (mean age, 70.1 years; male, 60.9%) with ischemic stroke (n = 781) or transient ischemic attack (n = 85) within 1 week of onset were consecutively enrolled and followed up for 1 year. The TyG index was calculated as ln (fasting triglycerides [mg/dL]×fasting glucose [mg/dL]/2). Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the tertile of TyG index levels: tertile 1, < 8.48; tertile 2, 8.48–9.01; and tertile 3, > 9.01. The primary outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including nonfatal stroke, nonfatal acute coronary syndrome, and vascular death.

Results

The median TyG index was 8.74 (interquartile range, 8.34–9.16). Higher levels of TyG index were significantly associated with increased prevalence of ipsilateral extracranial carotid (P = 0.032) and intracranial (P = 0.003) atherosclerotic stenosis. There were significant differences in the MACE risk between the three groups (annual rate, 8.6%, 11.6%, and 17.3% in the tertile 1, tertile 2, tertile 3 groups, respectively; log-rank P = 0.005). After multivariable adjustments, the TyG index remains to be a significant predictor of MACE, with an adjusted hazard ratio for tertile 3 versus tertile 1 groups (95% confidence interval) of 2.01 (1.16–3.47). Similar results were also found for the risk of recurrent stroke.

Conclusions

TyG index is associated with cervicocerebral atherosclerosis and the MACE risk after a stroke, suggesting the potential value of TyG index to optimize the risk stratification of stroke patients. Trial registration URL: https://upload.umin.ac.jp. Unique identifier: UMIN000031913.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^112oP8Qq]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Glucose — ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) with diabetes: In patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA who also have diabetes, the goal for glycemic control should be individualized based on the risk for adverse events, patient characteristics and preferences, and achieving a goal of HbA1c ≤ 7% is recommended to reduce risk for microvascular complications; treatment of diabetes should include glucose-lowering agents with proven cardiovascular benefit to reduce the risk for future major adverse cardiovascular events; in patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA who also have diabetes, multidimensional care is indicated to achieve glycemic goals and to improve stroke risk factors. In patients with prediabetes and ischemic stroke or TIA, lifestyle optimization can be beneficial for the prevention of progression to diabetes. In patients with TIA or ischemic stroke, it is reasonable to screen for prediabetes/diabetes using HbA1c, which has the advantage of convenience because it does not require fasting and is measured in a single blood sample. In patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA who also have diabetes, the usefulness of achieving intensive glucose control (ie, HbA1c < 7%) beyond the acute phase of the ischemic event for prevention of recurrent stroke is unknown. In patients with prediabetes and ischemic stroke or TIA, particularly those with a high body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m^2, ≥ 25 kg/m^2 in those < 60 years of age, or women with a history of gestational diabetes, metformin may be beneficial to control blood sugar and to prevent progression to diabetes. In patients < 6 months after TIA or ischemic stroke with insulin resistance, HbA1c < 7.0%, and without heart failure or bladder cancer, treatment with pioglitazone may be considered to prevent recurrent stroke.

death, recurrent TIA, and hospitalization for cardiovascular events. Results During the 90 days after index TIA, 180 patients returned to the ED with a stroke, 91 of which occurred in the first 2 days. Five factors were independently associated with stroke: age greater than 60 years in the 90 days after the TIA and included 44 hospitalizations for cardiovascular events, 45 deaths, and 216 recurrent TIAs. Conclusions Our results indicate that the short-term risk of stroke and other adverse. alone was associated with a lower risk of stroke.

### Hyperglycemia, risk of subsequent stroke, and efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy: a post hoc analysis of the POINT trial [^112dbZ3M]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background One-quarter of all strokes are subsequent events. It is not known whether higher levels of blood glucose are associated with an increased risk of subsequent stroke after high-risk transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic stroke. Methods and Results We performed a secondary analysis of the POINT (Platelet Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke) trial to evaluate the relationship between serum glucose hyperglycemia (≥ 180 mg/dL) versus normoglycemia (< 180 mg/dL) before enrollment in the trial and outcomes at 90 days. The primary end point was subsequent ischemic stroke modeled by a multivariable Cox model with adjustment for age, sex, race, ethnicity, study treatment assignment, index event, and key comorbidities. Of 4878 patients included in this study, 267 had a recurrent stroke. There was a higher hazard of subsequent stroke in patients with hyperglycemia compared with normoglycemia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.50 [95% CI, 1.05–2.14]). Treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy was not associated with a reduced hazard of subsequent stroke in patients with hyperglycemia (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.69–2.03]), though the wide confidence interval does not exclude a treatment effect. When modeled as a continuous variable, there was evidence of a nonlinear association between serum glucose and the hazard of subsequent stroke (P < 0.001). Conclusions Hyperglycemia on presentation is associated with an increased risk of subsequent ischemic stroke after high-risk transient ischemic attack or minor stroke. A rapid, simple assay of serum glucose may be a useful biomarker to identify patients at particularly high risk of subsequent ischemic stroke.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) — glucose management specifies that hypoglycemia should be treated and provides a reasonable target range for hyperglycemia treatment. Hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 60 mg/dL) should be treated in patients with AIS, and evidence indicates that persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours after AIS is associated with worse outcomes than normoglycemia; thus, it is reasonable to treat hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels in a range of 140 to 180 mg/dL and to closely monitor to prevent hypoglycemia.

### Impaired glucose metabolism and the risk of vascular events and mortality after ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115N6Qo4]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

There was a statistically significant association between increased IR and stroke recurrence. However, it should be noted that, there were only three studies eligible for the analysis and the parameters used to define an increased IR as well as the timing of measurement after stroke (7 days and 14 days) was heterogeneous between studies. IR can be increased during the acute phase of the stroke due to the stress reaction and show changes during this time. The increased relative risk for recurrent stroke observed in patients with IR compared to patients without IR was higher than the relative risk in diabetics compared to non-diabetics. This might be explained by the differences in the patient groups. Patients with DM are more likely to receive antidiabetic treatment and have a higher risk of dying before suffering a recurrent stroke. Another difference could be in the comparator groups, namely that the patients without IR could be generally healthier than patients without DM.

Despite the association between increased IR and stroke recurrence, we could not identify many studies with other cardiovascular outcomes. Furthermore, we encountered different parameters and criteria to define IR across studies. Thus, prognostic value of increased IR in terms of composite cardiovascular risk as well as the best biomarker to predict the said risk remains speculative in patients with IS or TIA. Further research is needed to investigate this conundrum.

We observed a significant research gap in the number of large studies with congruent definitions of prediabetes and IR. Uncertainty remains about the different diagnostic criteria for both prediabetes and IR, leading to the lack of adequate implementation of preventive strategies. As the prevalence of prediabetes expected to rise, the whole spectrum of IGM rather than DM alone is assumed to gain more significance in terms of primary and secondary stroke prevention. Consistent diagnostic criteria would facilitate a reliable data synthesis and the development of prevention strategies.

### Diagnosis, workup, risk reduction of transient ischemic attack in the emergency department setting: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115sLeqf]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

At least 240 000 individuals experience a transient ischemic attack each year in the United States. Transient ischemic attack is a strong predictor of subsequent stroke. The 90-day stroke risk after transient ischemic attack can be as high as 17.8%, with almost half occurring within 2 days of the index event. Diagnosing transient ischemic attack can also be challenging given the transitory nature of symptoms, often reassuring neurological examination at the time of evaluation, and lack of confirmatory testing. Limited resources, such as imaging availability and access to specialists, can further exacerbate this challenge. This scientific statement focuses on the correct clinical diagnosis, risk assessment, and management decisions of patients with suspected transient ischemic attack. Identification of high-risk patients can be achieved through use of comprehensive protocols incorporating acute phase imaging of both the brain and cerebral vasculature, thoughtful use of risk stratification scales, and ancillary testing with the ultimate goal of determining who can be safely discharged home from the emergency department versus admitted to the hospital. We discuss various methods for rapid yet comprehensive evaluations, keeping resource-limited sites in mind. In addition, we discuss strategies for secondary prevention of future cerebrovascular events using maximal medical therapy and patient education.

### Impaired glucose tolerance increases stroke risk in nondiabetic patients with transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic stroke [^114Z3PKb]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Impaired glucose tolerance, an intermediate metabolic state between normal glucose and diabetes characterized by nonfasting glucose levels between 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L, is associated with an increased stroke risk in patients with coronary heart disease. Whether impaired glucose tolerance increases the risk of stroke in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke is unknown.

Methods

In total, 3127 patients with a TIA or minor ischemic stroke participated in the Dutch TIA Trial, testing 2 different doses of aspirin and atenolol versus placebo. We estimated the risk of stroke and the risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death in relation to baseline nonfasting glucose levels (mean 6.0, SD 2.2 mmol/L) with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors.

Results

During 2.6 years follow-up, 272 patients (9%) experienced a stroke and 200 (6%) a myocardial infarction or cardiac death. We found a J-shaped relationship between baseline nonfasting glucose levels and stroke risk. Stroke risk was nearly doubled in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (glucose 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) compared with those with normal glucose levels (hazard ratio [HR] 1.8, 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.0) and nearly tripled in diabetic patients (glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L; HR 2.8, 95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1). Patients with low glucose levels (< 4.6 mmol/L) had a 50% increased stroke risk (HR 1.5, 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.2) compared with those with normal glucose levels. There was no association between glucose levels and risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death.

Conclusions

Impaired glucose tolerance is an independent risk factor for future stroke in nondiabetic patients with TIA or minor ischemic stroke.

### Association of acute and chronic hyperglycemia with acute ischemic stroke outcomes post-thrombolysis: findings from get with the guidelines-stroke [^113NtFuW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Stroke outcomes are worse in patients with diabetes. 1, 2 This is likely due to hyperglycemia, which is considered a poor prognostic factor in stroke patients. 3, 4 Increased admission glucose levels in acute stroke have also been associated with longer in‐hospital stay, increased cost, and mortality. 5 Hyperglycemia before reperfusion potentially decreases the beneficial effect of tissue‐type plasminogen activator (tPA) 6 given that hyperglycemia may act as an inhibitor of fibrinolysis. 7

Some studies have reported an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) after tPA treatment in patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia, 8, 9, 10 and admission glucose has been used in prognostic models to identify patients at risk of sICH after tPA. 11 Even though studies did not find overall reduced benefit of tPA in diabetic patients, 12 decreased rates of tPA administrations are observed in diabetic patients. 13 Guidelines recommend against tPA use in the 3‐ to 4.5‐hour window in patients with prior stroke plus diabetes based on insufficient evidence for its effectiveness, as patients with both prior stroke and diabetes were excluded from the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study 3 trial. 14 In this study, we sought to evaluate the relationship between admission hyperglycemia and the chronic hyperglycemic state on clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients with and without a recognized history of diabetes who were treated with tPA.

### Stress hyperglycemia is associated with early neurologic deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke after intravenous thrombolysis without hemorrhagic transformation [^112VAPeM]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Complications following a stroke significantly contribute to elevated morbidity and mortality rates, with approximately 5.5 million stroke-related deaths reported globally each year. END, characterized by the worsening of neurological status within the first few hours or days post-stroke, affects approximately 10–20% of patients. END is linked to poorer functional outcomes, increased disability, and higher mortality rates. Preventive strategies for END emphasize maintaining hemodynamic stability, rigorous blood glucose control, and close monitoring for any signs of deterioration. The variability in the incidence of END underscores the necessity for personalized care and highlights the need for continued research to identify high-risk individuals and develop targeted interventions.

The pathophysiology of END in ischemic stroke is multifaceted and not fully understood. END can arise from various mechanisms, including the expansion of the initial infarct due to ongoing ischemia, unstable atherosclerotic plaques, cerebral edema leading to increased intracranial pressure, hemorrhagic transformation within the infarcted area, and secondary embolic events. Additionally, post-ischemic inflammatory responses can exacerbate tissue damage, significantly contributing to the onset of END. Despite extensive research, substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding the specific triggers and underlying mechanisms of END. The heterogeneity of stroke pathology, along with the influence of comorbidities and pre-existing conditions, complicates the identification of consistent predictors or therapeutic targets for END. Moreover, the variability in the timing of neurological decline among patients presents challenges in determining optimal intervention windows.

### Stress hyperglycemia is associated with early neurologic deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke after intravenous thrombolysis without hemorrhagic transformation [^112oSJHH]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms linking an elevated SHR to adverse cardiovascular outcomes are complex and multifaceted. Stress-induced hyperglycemia can exacerbate oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to endothelial dysfunction and plaque instability. Additionally, acute hyperglycemia may negatively impact myocardial function by altering myocardial metabolism and increasing the susceptibility of cardiomyocytes to ischemic injury. Elevated stress-related hyperglycemia is often associated with increased levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and catecholamines, which can further exacerbate cardiovascular instability and contribute to poor outcomes.

The SHR has been extensively examined in the context of AIS and transient ischemic attacks (TIA). However, the influence of SHR on stroke prognosis remains debatable. Previous research has often focused on absolute hyperglycemia as a determinant of stroke outcomes, overlooking variations in patients' baseline blood glucose levels. This oversight could confound the analysis of hyperglycemia's impact on prognosis. To address this, SHR incorporates baseline glycemia into analyses, emphasizing the relative increase in blood glucose levels. Several studies have underscored the importance of SHR in predicting both short-term and long-term outcomes for AIS patients. Elevated SHR has been linked to more severe initial neurological deficits, a higher incidence of END, and poorer functional outcomes at discharge and follow-up. Despite its prognostic value, the use of SHR in ischemic cerebrovascular disease is still debated. A major point of contention is the variability in threshold values used to define elevated SHR, which differs widely across studies and populations. Furthermore, there is ongoing debate about whether adverse outcomes in AIS patients are primarily driven by hyperglycemia itself or by the underlying stress response. Some experts advocate targeting hyperglycemia to improve patient outcomes, while others suggest that focusing on the overall stress response might be more beneficial.

### Hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke: pathophysiology and clinical management [^115kBmqE]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Patients with acute ischemic stroke frequently test positive for hyperglycemia, which is associated with a poor clinical outcome. This association between poor glycemic control and an unfavorable prognosis is particularly evident in patients with persistent hyperglycemia, patients without a known history of diabetes mellitus, and patients with cortical infarction. To date, however, only one large clinical trial has specifically investigated the effect of glycemic control on stroke outcome. This trial failed to show a clinical benefit, but had several limitations. Despite a lack of clinical evidence supporting the use of glycemic control in the treatment of patients with stroke, international guidelines recommend treating this subset of critically ill patients for hyperglycemia in the hospital setting. This treatment regime is, however, particularly challenging in patients with stroke, and is associated with an increased risk of the patient developing hypoglycemia. Here we review the available evidence linking hyperglycemia to a poor clinical outcome in patients with ischemic stroke. We highlight the pathophysiological mechanisms that might underlie the deleterious effects of hyperglycemia on acute stroke prognosis and systematically review the literature concerning tight glycemic control after stroke. Finally, we provide directions on the use of insulin treatment strategies to control hyperglycemia in this patient group.

Secondary stroke prevention — knowledge gaps and future research emphasizes that having T2D is one of the most prevalent risk factors for future stroke after an initial acute ischemic stroke or TIA; diabetes remission can be achieved through weight management and vascular protection can be achieved by newer glucose-lowering agents; diabetes is also associated with CNS small vessel disease and vascular dementia; and it is plausible that interventions for prediabetes, established diabetes, and glucose management will reduce risk for neurocognitive outcomes and subclinical ischemic damage and discrete stroke events.

### The role of hyperglycemia in acute stroke… [^115tS4fi]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Most human studies have shown that in acute stroke, admission hyperglycemia in patients with or without diabetes is associated with a worse clinical outcome than in patients without hyperglycemia. This association is more consistent in the nonlacunar type of stroke. Animal studies support these findings by showing both in global and in focal postischemic models that hyperglycemia exaggerates the following damaging processes: intracellular acidosis, accumulation of extracellular glutamate, brain edema formation, blood-brain barrier disruption, and tendency for hemorrhagic transformation. Insulin treatment of hyperglycemic animals was found to have a beneficial effect in focal and global brain ischemia, which may be mediated by the glucose-reduction effect or by a direct neuroprotection. Conclusions Most studies show the deleterious effect of early hyperglycemia, especially in patients with nonlacunar focal or global ischemia. Clinical trials of intensive insulin treatment are needed.

Meanwhile simple measures to avoid excessive hyperglycemia are recommended., stress hyperglycemia in patients without diabetes was found to be associated with increased in-hospital mortality after MI. 6 The Diabetes and Insulin-Glucose Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction Study has recently provided compelling evidence that achieving euglycemia during acute MI resulted in a significant reduction of long-term mortality. 7 These results have revolutionized the standard care of patients with diabetes and acute MI. Several studies9–12 showed that patients with diabetes who develop stroke have a less favorable outcome than those without; however, a few other studies did not confirm these findings. 13, 14 Interestingly, most studies, including large trials, have shown that admission hyperglycemia is a risk factor for poor outcome following focal and global cerebral ischemia.

15–19 Weir et al17 performed a long-term follow-up of 750 nondiabetic patients with acute stroke and, after adjusting for age, sex, type of stroke, smoking, and blood pressure, admission hyperglycemia remained a significant independent predictor of long-term higher mortality and morbidity., and to a lesser extent insulinlike growth factor 1, reduced ischemic damage when injected directly into the brain ventricles. 52 Therefore, it was suggested that in transient global ischemia, insulin and IGF-1 have a direct neuroprotective effect on central nervous system parenchyma.

### Secular trends in the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of transient ischemic attack in Japan: the hisayama study [^116Tfy9H]. Atherosclerosis (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

We aimed to investigate secular trends in the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA) in a general Japanese population.

Methods

Two cohorts consisting of stroke-free Japanese individuals aged ≥ 40 years in 1961 (n = 1621) and 1988 (n = 2646) were followed up for 24 years. The associations of potential risk factors with the development of TIA were estimated by a Cox proportional hazards model. The influence of TIA on the risk of total stroke over the subsequent 10 years was compared between the sub-cohorts of subjects with TIA and age- and sex-matched control subjects from each cohort.

Results

During follow-up, 28 subjects in the 1961 cohort and 34 in the 1988 cohort experienced TIA. The age-standardized incidence of TIA was significantly lower in the 1988 cohort than the 1961 cohort (0.66 vs. 1.01 per 1000 person-years, p = 0.02). While elevated systolic blood pressure was significantly associated with the risk of TIA in both cohorts, glucose intolerance and higher serum cholesterol levels were associated with TIA risk only in the 1988 cohort. The subjects experiencing TIA had approximately 7–8-fold higher risks for the 10-year incidence of total and ischemic strokes compared with the corresponding control subjects without TIA both in the 1961 and 1988 sub-cohorts, and the relative risks were not significantly different between sub-cohorts.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that the incidence of TIA decreased during the past half century, probably due to the spread of antihypertensive treatments in the general Japanese population.

### Acute-to-chronic glycemic ratio as an outcome predictor in ischemic stroke in patients with and without diabetes mellitus [^1157UbXo]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The inflammatory response secondary to the presence of an acute disease can lead to an increase in glucose levels, known as stress hyperglycemia. Previous research confirmed that this glucose disturbance could play a role in the clinical prognosis of certain diseases. For instance, stress hyperglycemia predicts mortality in subjects with established cardiovascular disease, both in patients with and without diabetes.

Acute hyperglycemia is a frequent condition observed in patients with an acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, contrary to other cardiovascular diseases, the exact role of stress hyperglycemia in subjects after stroke diagnosis has not been fully characterized. This may be explained, at least in part, since previous publications are scarce and these have mostly included non-diabetic subjects or have only evaluated fasting blood glucose (FBG).

Regarding stress hyperglycemia assessment, different ratios and indexes have been recently described to evaluate the balance between chronic and acute glucose control, and assess the impact of stress hyperglycemia on clinical prognosis. In this regard, the acute-to-chronic glycemic ratio (ACR) is calculated as the glucose at admission divided by chronic glucose levels. This ratio has shown a good correlation with illness severity in patients with acute myocardial infarction or infection. Moreover, in our population, ACR was found to be a predictive factor of poor functional outcomes both in subjects with COVID-19 infection and heart failure diagnoses. As to neurological patients, ACR is known to be linked to stroke severity in patients with diabetes, although no previous studies have evaluated the role of ACR as a stroke-prognostic factor in subjects with and without diabetes.

The main aim of the present study was to assess the association between ACR and 3-month poor prognosis in patients with AIS, with or without previous diabetes diagnosis. As secondary aims, the presence of other factors independently associated with mortality and poor prognosis at 3 months, and the differences between subjects with AIS diagnosis according to the 3 distinct ACR tertiles were also evaluated. Finally, we assessed whether adding glucose at admission or ACR added extra value to a predictive model based on classical clinical variables.
