## Question

In what ways does isoniazid affect the host immune system?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how isoniazid affects the host immune system. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about isoniazid's primary mechanism of action and whether it is inherently immunomodulatory or not. Then, I should verify evidence for direct immune effects such as hypersensitivity and drug-specific T-cell activation. Next, I will examine indirect immune effects driven by changes in mycobacterial antigen load, including IGRA and IFN-γ T-cell dynamics. After that, I need to consider host and population contexts like HIV coinfection and pregnancy. I will also review metabolic effects such as pyridoxine deficiency that could secondarily impact immunity. Finally, I should synthesize a conclusion, note limitations, and outline practical implications for clinicians, making sure I continually self-verify each claim with appropriate citations [^114eB5iv].

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacology, because I don't want to mistake antibacterial activity for host-directed immunomodulation. Isoniazid inhibits mycolic acid synthesis and is bactericidal against actively replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis; this is a pathogen-targeted mechanism, not a host-targeted immune pathway, so any immune changes are likely secondary to altered bacillary burden rather than direct immunosuppression or stimulation of host immune circuits [^114eB5iv] [^115ftJng].

> Wait, let me verify whether there are any bona fide direct immune effects in humans. There is evidence of drug-specific adaptive immune activation in the setting of hypersensitivity: CD4+ T-cell clones recognizing isoniazid have been generated from patients with cutaneous adverse drug reactions, showing IFN-γ and granzyme B secretion in an MHC class II–restricted manner; that is a direct, antigen-specific host immune effect, but it is context-limited to idiosyncratic hypersensitivity rather than therapeutic immunomodulation of TB immunity [^112gBpVr]. I should also confirm clinical guidance: the FDA label emphasizes prompt cessation and cautious rechallenge if hypersensitivity occurs, reinforcing that these immune phenomena are unpredictable and require monitoring rather than dose-driven immune modulation during routine therapy [^116xo97c].

> Next, I should review indirect immunological effects via antigen load changes, and I need to check the longitudinal T-cell data carefully. A study of LTBI treatment showed a biphasic pattern: an early increase in IFN-γ–producing T cells within about 3–4 weeks of isoniazid, followed by a decline by around 12 weeks; mechanistically, this fits with transient antigen release during bacillary killing and later contraction of effector responses as antigenic stimulation wanes, which is an indirect effect of microbial reduction rather than direct immune suppression or stimulation by the drug itself [^114tPtrm]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about generalizability, but the temporal association with killing and antigen kinetics is biologically consistent with antigen-load–dependent T-cell dynamics [^114tPtrm].

> I need to check IGRA behavior during preventive therapy, because clinicians sometimes infer immune modulation from IGRA changes. In HIV-positive pregnant women, decreased IFN-γ responses during pregnancy drove frequent reversion of QFT positivity, and about 12% reverted after IPT, suggesting that both host state and bacterial antigen influence IGRA results; this cautions against attributing changes solely to isoniazid's direct immune effects [^114FdV6a]. Conversely, healthcare workers remained QFT positive after 9 months of isoniazid and showed persistent proliferative responses, and a controlled study in South African adults found no differential reversion or slope of IFN-γ decline with IPT versus observation, indicating that IGRA is often insensitive as a treatment response biomarker in high-incidence settings [^111fCgy9] [^1161xUUX]. Let me reconsider the immunologic baseline: the durability of IGRA/TST positivity tracks with immune memory as much as with ongoing infection, especially in longstanding infections, which explains why reversion is more common after recent infection and uncommon after established latency [^111tHEJv].

> I will now examine targeted data on antigen-load–dependent effector responses. A pilot study of RD1 responses supports the concept that short-incubation IFN-γ assays preferentially capture recently antigen-exposed effector T cells; IPT early after recent infection likely reduces metabolically active bacilli and the corresponding RD1 effector pool, whereas remote LTBI may include dormant bacilli and durable memory that persist despite isoniazid's activity against replicating organisms, thereby limiting measurable immune contraction in some individuals [^111Ts4Mv]. This aligns with the idea that isoniazid reshapes the immune landscape indirectly by reducing antigenic drive, rather than directly suppressing host immunity [^111Ts4Mv].

> Hold on, I should verify disease-state distinctions so I don't misattribute findings. Earlier I almost framed the biphasic IFN-γ response as occurring during active TB treatment, but wait, let me verify the cohort: that pivotal study was in LTBI, not active disease; thus, extrapolating the same temporal kinetics to active TB requires caution given different antigenic loads and concomitant drugs during full treatment, and we should treat the LTBI dynamics as supportive but not definitive for active disease [^114tPtrm].

> Let me consider host contexts that modulate observed immune responses independently of isoniazid. In HIV coinfection, tuberculosis risk and immune readouts are shaped by CD4 count and ART status; IPT reduces TB risk at higher CD4 counts and can be complementary to ART, but waning immune function may limit durability and complicate IGRA interpretation, underscoring that immune changes under IPT in HIV are confounded by host immune recovery or suppression rather than direct INH immunomodulation [^115LdRqa]. For PLHIV, extended IPT durations reduce TB incidence without clear resistance signals at the trial level, reinforcing clinical benefit while again emphasizing that host status often dominates the immune phenotype we observe during IPT [^112ezVt5] [^1163HJug].

> I need to check non-immune pharmacometabolic effects that could secondarily affect immune competence. The FDA label notes that isoniazid can induce pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency via interference with pyridoxal phosphate pathways, which is clinically relevant for neuropathy risk; although not a direct host immune target, B6 deficiency could theoretically impair aspects of lymphocyte function, so routine B6 supplementation in at-risk patients is a reasonable strategy to avoid confounding immune or neurologic assessments during therapy [^114eB5iv]. I should confirm that this is framed as an indirect, nonspecific effect, not as a primary immunomodulatory mechanism of INH [^114eB5iv].

> Next, I should review immune-mediated adverse effects and how they are managed clinically. Isoniazid can precipitate hypersensitivity reactions that are immune-driven in susceptible individuals, and the label recommends immediate discontinuation with cautious graded rechallenge only after full resolution; this clinical pattern dovetails with the mechanistic evidence of drug-specific CD4+ T-cell responses in hypersensitivity, underscoring that when direct immune activation occurs, it is idiosyncratic and adverse-event related rather than dose-dependent therapeutic immunomodulation [^116xo97c] [^112gBpVr].

> Let me synthesize the overall immunological impact, being careful not to overstate causality. Isoniazid is not a classical immunomodulator of host pathways; its dominant "immune effects" are indirect and follow from reducing bacillary replication and antigenic stimulation, which can transiently increase then diminish antigen-specific IFN-γ responses, and may or may not shift IGRA status depending on infection chronicity and host factors; direct host immune activation is largely confined to hypersensitivity phenomena rather than on-target immune mechanisms of action [^114eB5iv] [^114tPtrm]. But wait, what if persistent IGRA positivity implies persistent bacilli? Hmm, wait a minute, immunological memory can outlast bacterial clearance, so IGRA persistence is not definitive proof of ongoing infection after IPT, particularly in remote infections, and should not be taken as evidence that INH failed to alter antigen load [^111tHEJv].

> I should double-check the evidentiary limitations before drawing firm conclusions. Much of the immunologic literature around IPT and IGRA dynamics involves small, observational cohorts with heterogeneous assays, and animal models may not recapitulate human immune responses reliably, so extrapolation from mice or macaques to humans must be cautious; therefore, the safest inference is that INH's immune effects are indirect, with magnitude and detectability modulated by host context, infection chronicity, and assay characteristics rather than by a direct host-directed mechanism of the drug [^117WamrK] [^113ibt4j].

> Finally, let me translate this into practical clinical implications and ensure they align with the evidence. IGRA should not be used as a reliable biomarker of short-term response to IPT in high-incidence or mixed populations, given inconsistent reversion and parallel declines even without therapy; clinicians should avoid overinterpreting IGRA changes as "immunosuppression" or "immune boosting" due to INH itself and instead focus on adherence, toxicity monitoring, and exclusion of active TB before IPT initiation, with vigilance for hypersensitivity and hepatotoxicity per labeling guidance [^1161xUUX] [^111fCgy9] [^116xo97c]. I need to ensure the bottom line is clear: isoniazid shapes host immune readouts primarily by altering the mycobacterial antigenic stimulus, not by directly modulating the immune system in a predictable, therapeutic manner [^114eB5iv].

Isoniazid interacts with the host immune system primarily by **reducing antigen load** through bactericidal activity [^114eB5iv], which indirectly modulates immune responses [^112WLEUb]. This reduction in mycobacterial burden leads to **transient increases in IFN-γ–producing T cells** early in therapy, followed by declines as antigen exposure diminishes [^114tPtrm]. Isoniazid does not directly suppress or enhance immune cells, but its antigen-lowering effect can cause **IGRA reversion** or reduced IFN-γ responses, especially in recent infections or during pregnancy [^111Ts4Mv] [^114FdV6a]. It can also cause immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions [^116xo97c], including hepatitis and rash, via drug-specific T-cell responses [^112gBpVr]. Overall, isoniazid's immune effects are indirect and driven by its antimicrobial action, with clinical implications for immune monitoring and adverse event management [^115ftJng].

---

## Indirect immunomodulatory effects via bacterial clearance

- **Bactericidal activity**: Isoniazid inhibits mycolic acid synthesis, killing actively replicating M. tuberculosis and reducing antigen load [^114eB5iv].

- **Antigen load reduction**: Lower antigen exposure alters immune activation, particularly T-cell responses [^112WLEUb].

- **T-cell response modulation**: LTBI treatment with isoniazid shows a transient early rise in IFN-γ–producing T cells, then a decline as antigen decreases [^114tPtrm].

- **IGRA reversion**: Reduced antigen exposure can lead to IGRA reversion or lower IFN-γ responses, notably in recent infections or pregnancy [^114FdV6a].

---

## Direct immunological effects and adverse reactions

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Isoniazid can cause immune-mediated hypersensitivity [^116xo97c] (e.g. hepatitis, rash) via drug-specific T-cell responses [^112gBpVr].

- **Immune-mediated hepatitis**: Hepatitis may involve immune mechanisms, including drug-specific T cells and cytokine release.

- **Immune-mediated rash**: Maculopapular exanthema and DRESS are linked to drug-specific T-cell responses [^112gBpVr].

---

## Interaction with specific immune cells and cytokines

- **Macrophages**: Isoniazid's bactericidal effect reduces intracellular mycobacteria, indirectly altering macrophage activation and cytokine production [^112WLEUb].

- **T cells**: Antigen load reduction modulates T-cell activation and cytokine secretion, especially IFN-γ [^114jrQrV].

- **Cytokines**: Changes in antigen exposure can alter cytokine profiles, including IFN-γ and TNF-α, though isoniazid does not directly target cytokine pathways [^112WLEUb].

---

## Clinical implications of immune modulation

Key clinical implications include **efficacy, safety, and immune testing**. Antigen reduction contributes to treatment efficacy in LTBI [^111A37io] and active TB [^115ftJng], while immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions require monitoring and management [^116xo97c]. Isoniazid-induced antigen reduction can also alter IGRA [^111Ts4Mv] and other immune assay results, complicating interpretation [^114FdV6a].

## Summary of isoniazid's interaction with the immune system

| **Mechanism** | **Immune effect** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|-|
| Bactericidal activity [^114eB5iv] | Reduces antigen load | Modulates T-cell responses; affects IGRA results [^114tPtrm] [^114FdV6a] |
| Hypersensitivity reactions [^112gBpVr] | Immune-mediated hepatitis, rash [^116xo97c] | Requires monitoring and management |
| Antigen load reduction [^112WLEUb] | Modulates cytokine production | Alters immune activation and inflammation |

---

Isoniazid's primary immune effect is **indirect modulation** of T-cell and cytokine responses via antigen load reduction, with additional **immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions**. Together, these effects influence treatment efficacy, immune monitoring, and adverse event management.

### Addressing T-cell responses to antituberculous drugs [^112gBpVr]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Another confounding factor in antituberculous drugs (ATD)-associated adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) comorbidity present in 12% of newly diagnosed patients with tuberculosis (TB). In this subset of HIV-TB coinfected patients, systemic reactions to patch testing with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol have been reported to occur in as many as 90% of patients, and the delay in treatment of ATD is detrimental. Multidrug causality in ATD-associated drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) has also been indicated in HIV-infected patients.

The study by Ye et al. provides insight into the mechanism of ATD-associated adverse reactions, supporting a role of drug-specific CD4+ T cells in the pathogenesis. The authors show that drug-specific CD4+ T-cell clones can be generated for both isoniazid and rifampicin in patients with both maculopapular exanthema (MPE) and DRESS, with two cases showing the presence of specific CD4+ T-cell clones for both drugs. Interferon-γ/granzyme B secretion is dose-dependent, drug-specific, and requires the presence of both soluble drug and antigen-presenting cells. Finally, blocking experiments demonstrate that the CD4+ T-cell response is major histocompatibility complex class II restricted. Existing human leucocyte antigen (HLA) data is minimal in relation to anti-TB drugs. There has been an association reported in Korean patients with DRESS for the class I allele HLA-C*04:01, which extends to the haplotype HLA-A*11:01-B*15:01-C*04:01. However, these alleles are not reported in the cases presented by Ye et al, providing evidence that other class II HLA alleles may be important.

Future work is required to confirm multiple HLA associations in the pathogenesis of ATD-associated ADRs.

### Isoniazid [^114eB5iv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Isoniazid acts against actively growing tubercle bacilli. Within one to two hours after oral administration, isoniazid produces peak blood levels, which decline to 50 percent or less within six hours. It diffuses readily into all body fluids, including cerebrospinal, pleural, and ascitic fluids, as well as tissues, organs, and excreta such as saliva, sputum, and feces. The drug also crosses the placental barrier and enters milk in concentrations comparable to those in plasma. Approximately 50 to 70 percent of a dose of isoniazid is excreted in the urine within 24 hours.

Isoniazid is metabolized primarily by acetylation and dehydrazination. The rate of acetylation is genetically determined. Approximately 50 percent of Blacks and Caucasians are slow acetylators, while the rest are rapid acetylators. In contrast, the majority of Eskimos and Orientals are rapid acetylators. The rate of acetylation does not significantly alter the effectiveness of isoniazid therapy when dosage is administered daily. However, slow acetylation may lead to higher blood levels of the drug and, consequently, an increase in toxic reactions.

Pyridoxine (B6) deficiency is sometimes observed in adults receiving high doses of isoniazid and is probably due to its competition with pyridoxal phosphate for the enzyme apotryptophanase.

- **Mechanism of action**: Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. At therapeutic levels, isoniazid is bacteriocidal against actively growing intracellular and extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms.

### Effects of pregnancy and isoniazid preventive therapy on Mycobacterium tuberculosis interferon gamma response assays in women with HIV [^114FdV6a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Pregnancy is accompanied by immune suppression. We hypothesized that Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific inflammatory responses used to identify latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) lose positivity during pregnancy. We also hypothesized that isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) may revert LTBI diagnoses because of its sterilizing activity.

- **Methods**: 944 women with human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing 28 weeks of IPT antepartum versus postpartum. They were tested by QuantiFERON-gold-in-tube (QGIT) antepartum and by QGIT and tuberculin skin test (TST) at delivery and postpartum. Serial QGIT positivity was assessed by logistic regression using generalized estimating equations.

- **Results**: From entry to delivery, 68 (24%) of 284 QGIT-positive women reverted to QGIT-negative or indeterminate. Of these, 42 (62%) recovered QGIT positivity postpartum. The loss of QGIT positivity during pregnancy was explained by decreased interferon gamma (IFNγ) production in response to TB antigen and/or mitogen. At delivery, LTBI was identified by QGIT in 205 women and by TST in 113 women. Corresponding numbers postpartum were 229 and 122 women. QGIT and TST kappa agreement coefficients were 0.4 and 0.5, respectively. Among QGIT-positive women antepartum or at delivery, 34 (12%) reverted to QGIT-negative after IPT. There were no differences between women who initiated IPT antepartum or postpartum.

- **Conclusions**: Decreased IFNγ responses in pregnancy reduced QGIT positivity, suggesting that this test cannot reliably identify LTBI during pregnancy.

### Effect of treatment of latent tuberculosis infection on the T cell response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens [^114tPtrm]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Most cases of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) do not cause symptoms during the lifetime of the infected person. Longitudinal analysis of the immune response of healthy Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected people might, therefore, give insight into the basis of protective immunity. In a longitudinal study, we documented the effect that treatment had on the T cell response to M. tuberculosis antigens in 33 healthy people with LTBI.

Preventive treatment of LTBI resulted in a 1.8-fold average increase in the numbers of interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing T cells within 26 ± 4 days (P = .006), followed by a decrease by the end of the treatment period (82 ± 6 days; p = 0.004). There was no significant overall change in the T cell response to any antigen in a control group (n = 8) of patients who elected radiological follow-up. Using live M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv as a stimulant in an enzyme-linked immunospot assay in sensitized individuals, we showed that isoniazid, but not rifampin, led to an increase in the number of IFN-gamma-producing cells. These results suggest that the integrity of the bacterial cell wall is important for M. tuberculosis in avoiding immune recognition by T cells and favor a dynamic model of LTBI.

### Isoniazid prophylaxis differently modulates T-cell responses to RD1-epitopes in contacts recently exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a pilot study [^111Ts4Mv]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

The reasons for the different effect of therapy in modulating RD1 responses in recently infected patients versus those potentially reinfected, as observed in the present study, are currently unclear. In several models of infectious diseases, it has been shown that the immune response is strictly dependent on pathogen replication and antigenic load. In studies on in vitro IFN-gamma response to TB antigens in particular, it has been hypothesized that short incubation assays (like those used in this study) detect responses of partially activated effector T cells that have recently encountered antigens in vivo and can therefore rapidly release IFN-gamma when stimulated in vitro. This suggests a correlation between the measure of this response and antigen load.

All the contacts who received INH in this study were exposed to an index TB case infected by an INH-sensitive strain, and all these contacts had good adherence to treatment as assessed by interview. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that subjects treated early after recent infection may have had a rapidly controlled infection due to the combination of effective treatment and an efficient immune response, with a consequent decrease of the RD1-specific effector cells. In contrast, it is likely that contacts with previous untreated latent TB infection (LTBI) host different populations of mycobacteria, characterized by different growth rates: those originating from the recent infection, which are actively replicating and on which INH is effective, and those in a dormant state that INH is not effective in killing.

### Evaluation of the effect of treatment of latent tuberculosis infection on QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay results [^111fCgy9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

To evaluate the utility of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay for monitoring the efficacy of latent tuberculosis treatment, the assay was performed serially for healthcare workers receiving isoniazid therapy. After nine months of isoniazid therapy, all of these healthcare workers remained QuantiFERON-TB Gold positive, and cellular proliferation assays revealed persistently strong purified protein derivative responses. These results do not support the use of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay to monitor therapy.

### Isoniazid or rifampicin preventive therapy with and without screening for subclinical TB: a modeling analysis [^113kAec2]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

To focus on outcomes that TPT could affect, we simulated two distinct subgroups in progressive TB states within each cohort.

- **Latent progressors**: These are individuals with M. tuberculosis infection but no active TB disease. Without TPT, their infections would eventually progress to active disease.

- **Subclinical progressors**: These individuals have TB disease that is undetectable by a symptom screen but is microbiologically active (e.g. culture-positive) and would progress to symptoms (i.e. to active disease) if untreated.

Figure 1 provides a conceptual overview of the model, both without screening for subclinical TB (main panel) and with screening (inset). Within each cohort, we identify two subgroups whose outcomes may be affected by TPT: those with a latent infection that will, if untreated, progress to active TB at some point in the future ("latent progressors"), and those who have prevalent subclinical TB (asymptomatic but detectable through additional testing such as chest X-ray or sputum testing) that will progress to active rather than resolving spontaneously ("subclinical progressors"). These subgroups are further stratified (not shown) by the drug resistance present at t = 0 and by CD4 count (people living with HIV) or age (household contacts).

These latent and subclinical progressor groups are followed through the following steps: (1) testing to detect and treat subclinical TB in some modeled scenarios (inset), (2) TPT (if given), and (3) TB treatment (if subclinical TB is diagnosed, or if progression to active TB occurs despite the intervention).

### Continuous isoniazid for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in people living with HIV [^112ezVt5]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of continuous isoniazid (administered for at least 36 months) for treating latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in people living with HIV (PLHIV).

- **Methods**: Six databases and HIV and tuberculosis (TB) conference abstract books were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of continuous isoniazid with a 6-month isoniazid regimen. Outcomes of interest were TB incidence, mortality, adverse events, and the risk of drug resistance. Data were pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Three studies from Botswana, South Africa, and India were included. The risk of active TB was 38% lower among patients receiving continuous isoniazid compared with those on a 6-month regimen [relative risk (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42–0.89; I = 0%], and 49% lower for those with a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) (RR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.30–0.86; I = 7%). Individuals with a positive TST also had a 50% lower chance of death (RR 0.50, 95% CI: 0.27–0.91; I = 3%). Two studies found no evidence of an increase in adverse events in the continuous isoniazid group, whereas a third study, which used a different definition for adverse events, found strong evidence of an increase. There was no evidence of increased drug resistance with continuous isoniazid administration.

- **Conclusion**: For PLHIV in settings with high TB and HIV prevalence and transmission, continuous isoniazid for at least 36 months is beneficial and likely outweighs the risk of increased adverse events compared with a shorter isoniazid regimen.

### Potential of immunomodulatory agents as adjunct host-directed therapies for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^113qhTib]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary pathology observed in patients with all forms of TB can be attributed to intrinsic exaggerated inflammatory responses to M. tuberculosis. Since HIV co-infection is the major comorbidity associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with active TB, early restoration of immune cells in HIV-TB patients following antiretroviral therapy (ART) can result in the development of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS). In TB-IRIS, existing M. tuberculosis-specific T cells proliferate uncontrollably, consequently perpetrating local and systemic overt immune reactions and potentially leading to death. An exaggerated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-18, and interferons alpha and beta (IFN-α/β), invariably causes tissue damage in active TB as well as TB-IRIS. Although TB-IRIS is more closely associated with drug-susceptible TB patients starting on ART, it has been reported in South African patients with MDR-TB and HIV co-infection. Therefore, an exigent need exists to develop new strategies to treat and prevent harmful inflammatory responses in MDR/extensively drug-resistant TB patients to avoid long-term, if not permanent, lung damage.

Considering these limitations and intricate clinical scenarios in TB, host-directed therapies (HDTs) have emerged as a promising intervention avenue against all forms (drug-sensitive and drug-resistant) of the disease. HDTs generally target clinically relevant biological pathways in the host to modulate and rectify pathological immune responses.

### Isoniazid prophylaxis: Highly effective but underutilised to prevent tuberculosis in people living with HIV [^1163HJug]. The Lancet Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Isoniazid prophylaxis is highly effective in preventing tuberculosis in people living with HIV, yet it remains underutilised. Despite its proven efficacy, several barriers impede its widespread adoption, including logistical challenges and gaps in implementation strategies. Addressing these issues is crucial to improving health outcomes for HIV-positive individuals and reducing the incidence of tuberculosis within this population.

### Chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid in liver transplant recipients [^111rHPu3]. Liver Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

A patient receiving a liver graft needs to be treated with immunosuppressive drugs to avoid rejection. These kinds of drugs predispose the patient to the reactivation of latent infections such as tuberculosis (TB). Therefore, it is necessary to establish treatment regimens to prevent this. We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) at our center between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010. Latent tuberculosis infections (LTBIs) were diagnosed with positive tuberculin skin test results. After LT, infected patients were treated with isoniazid for 6 months; the treatment began soon after transplantation, and the patients were followed until the end of the study.

During this period, 53 patients had LTBI data. All these patients were treated with isoniazid after LT. The median observation period after LT was 52 months (range = 12–129 months). No cases of TB reactivation were reported during follow-up. Only 4 patients presented alterations in liver enzymes related to this treatment, and they showed clear improvement after the treatment was stopped. None of these patients showed severe graft dysfunction.

In conclusion, preventive isoniazid appears to be a safe drug for use in LTBI patients after LT. The treatment may be established just after LT without important graft dysfunction or severe consequences for the patient.

### Isoniazid for preventing tuberculosis in HIV-infected children [^113zg6ov]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

- **Summary of findings for the main comparison**: Isoniazid prophylaxis was compared to a placebo for HIV-positive children not on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

- **Summary of findings 2**: Isoniazid prophylaxis was compared to a placebo for HIV-positive children on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

### The timing of tuberculosis after isoniazid preventive therapy among gold miners in South Africa: A prospective cohort study [^111PvB4f]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The durability of protection by isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) was lost within 6–12 months in this population with a high annual risk of M. tuberculosis infection and a high HIV prevalence. The observed TB incidence in the first year after IPT was higher than the crude estimate of the TB incidence attributable to reinfection, suggesting that reactivation of persistent latent infection played a role in the rapid return to baseline TB incidence. Further studies of the durability of alternative (rifamycin-containing) TB preventive therapy regimens, alone or in combination with ART, are warranted.

### Non-specific immunological effects of selected routine childhood immunisations: Systematic review [^111Nj5fG]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

- **Definitions**: We defined specific immunological effects as an effect of immunisation on an immunological variable in response to an antigen contained within the initial immunisation. The terms heterologous and non-targeted effects have also been used in the literature to describe non-specific immunological effects. For the purpose of this review, we defined non-specific immunological effects as an effect on the immune system resulting from immunisation that modifies the way it subsequently responds to antigens not present in the initial immunisation.

- **Study design and selection criteria**: Using a comprehensive search strategy, we identified and critically appraised available evidence (published and unpublished) addressing possible non-specific effects of vaccines. We included randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised control trials, clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, case series, and case reports. The vaccines examined included live attenuated vaccines (BCG and measles-containing vaccines), inactivated vaccines, and toxoids (all diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and Bordetella pertussis-containing vaccines). Although the target population was infants under 5 years, the inclusion of studies was not limited to this age group to ensure all relevant studies were identified. Sex, age at vaccination, and co-administration of vitamin A were examined as possible effect measure modifiers.

Ecological, animal, and in vitro studies, as well as studies using recombinant vaccines or no vaccine at all, were excluded.

### Community-wide isoniazid preventive therapy drives drug-resistant tuberculosis: a model-based analysis [^112UpFUi]. Science Translational Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) control is especially difficult in settings of high HIV prevalence; HIV co-infection erodes host immunity and increases the risk of progression to active TB. Studies have demonstrated that a 6-month (or longer) course of monotherapy with isoniazid [isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT)] can reduce this risk. The World Health Organization endorses IPT for symptom-free individuals with HIV/TB co-infection and has recommended expanding IPT to entire communities (community-wide IPT).

Although previous reviews have not found a statistically significant elevated risk of isoniazid-resistant TB among individuals previously treated with IPT, community-wide IPT programs may nonetheless generate substantial selective pressure and increase the burden of drug-resistant TB (DRTB).

We developed mathematical models to identify the conditions under which community-wide IPT interventions could increase the burden of isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, even when we assumed that IPT does not select for resistance among those treated with IPT. We found that in models including any mechanism of interstrain competition (such as partial immunity conferred by a previous M. tuberculosis infection), community-wide IPT interventions conferred an indirect benefit to drug-resistant strains through selective suppression of drug-sensitive infections.

This result suggests that the absence of an observed elevation in the risk of DRTB among those receiving IPT in small-scale studies of limited duration does not imply that the selective pressure imposed by community-wide IPT will not increase the burden of drug-resistant strains.

### Isoniazid for preventing tuberculosis in HIV-infected children [^1119bqEm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

In evaluating the certainty of RCT evidence, we used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of the evidence. The assessment process considered methodological limitations, inconsistency in study results, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias as potential factors for downgrading certainty. We summarized the evidence in two 'Summary of Findings' tables for isoniazid prophylaxis efficacy: one for HIV-positive children not on ART and the other for HIV-positive children on ART.

The evidence regarding the effect of isoniazid prophylaxis for active TB and death in HIV-positive children not on ART was of low certainty. Conversely, the evidence on the effect of isoniazid prophylaxis for active TB and death in HIV-positive children on ART was inconclusive and of very low certainty. We downgraded the trials for serious indirectness and imprecision since they were conducted in a single setting and were underpowered with broad confidence intervals.

- **Potential biases in the review process**: We conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases without language restrictions to identify published and unpublished trials. MZ and TY independently performed study selection, while MZ and OA independently extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. To maintain the review's independence, authors of included studies did not participate in data extraction or quality assessment of any included studies.

### Immunotherapeutics for tuberculosis in experimental animals: Is there a common pathway activated by effective protocols [^115xVJna]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The increasing threat posed by drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis is leading to a reappraisal of the possibility of treating tuberculosis (TB) through immunotherapy. We analyze six strategies that have been shown to be therapeutic in animal models of TB and identify a common pathway underlying the activity of the superficially different immunotherapeutic protocols.

- **Pathway involvement**: This pathway involves enhanced induction of CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and down-regulation of interleukin-4 and transforming growth factor-beta. This leads to further enhancement of the activity of CD8(+) CTLs and other microbicidal pathways.

This unifying analysis strengthens the rationale for future trials of immunotherapy in humans and points to surrogate markers that could be studied in such trials.

### Isoniazid for preventing tuberculosis in HIV-infected children [^114YRKPF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of illness and death in HIV‐positive children living in areas of high TB prevalence. It is known that isoniazid prophylaxis prevents TB in HIV‐negative children following TB exposure, but there is uncertainty related to its role in TB preventive treatment in HIV‐positive children.

- **Objectives**: To summarise the effects of TB preventive treatment versus placebo in HIV‐positive children with no known TB contact on active TB, death, and reported adverse events.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, and two trial registers up to February 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: Trials of HIV‐positive children with and without known TB exposure were included, randomized to receive TB preventive treatment or placebo.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently used the study selection criteria, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Effects were assessed using risk, incidence rate, and hazard ratios, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE.

- **Main results**: Three trials were included, involving 991 participants below the age of 13 years from South Africa and Botswana. Children were randomized to isoniazid prophylaxis or placebo, given daily or three times weekly. The median length of follow‐up ranged from 5.7 to 34 months, and some participants were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). In HIV‐positive children not on ART, isoniazid prophylaxis may reduce the risk of active TB (hazard ratio (HR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.87; 1 trial, 240 participants).

### What are the most efficacious treatment regimens for isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis? A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115ZRBTA]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

The study examines various treatment regimens for isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis using systematic review and network meta-analysis methodologies.

- **Odds ratios and treatment ranks**:
	- Relative ranks and absolute proportion differences were analyzed from fixed-effects and random-effects network meta-analyses across all isoniazid resistance profiles.

- **Data network**:
	- The main analysis includes all isoniazid resistance patterns, while a secondary analysis excludes any inconsistent studies. Lines and numbers in the data network indicate the quantity of studies making each comparison. Certain study arms were classified with specific rifampicin (RIF) regimens. Terms such as ED (effective drugs) and RIF (rifampicin) are routinely used to categorize these analyses.

- **Forest plots**:
	- The analysis featured forest plots from both fixed-effects and random-effects network meta-analyses. These plots compare treatments from the network, presented with odds ratios on a log scale and a 95% credible interval. A vertical line represents the null hypothesis.

- **Relative treatment ranks**:
	- Histograms depicting relative ranks from both fixed-effects and random-effects analyses illustrate the treatment comparisons, reflecting the methodological outcomes of different analyses.

Sensitivity analyses investigated the impact of categorizing individual study arms differently, especially where PZA (pyrazinamide) usage affected reported outcomes. These analyses showed minimal effect on the general findings of the study.

### Remembering the host in tuberculosis drug development [^114H1U8S]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

New therapeutics to augment approaches and shorten treatment duration are of critical importance for combating tuberculosis (TB), especially those with novel mechanisms of action to counter the emergence of drug-resistant TB. Host-directed therapy (HDT) offers a novel strategy with mechanisms that include activating immune defense mechanisms or ameliorating tissue damage. These and related concepts will be discussed along with issues that emerged from the workshop organized by the Stop TB Working Group on New Drugs, held at the Gordon Research Conference for Tuberculosis Drug Development in Lucca, Italy, in June 2017, titled "Strategic Discussion on Repurposing Drugs & Host Directed Therapies for TB". In this review, we will highlight recent data regarding drugs, pathways, and concepts that are important for the successful development of HDTs for TB.

### Failure of isoniazid chemoprophylaxis during infliximab therapy [^115jz1s3]. Emerging infectious diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Isoniazid chemoprophylaxis can effectively lessen the likelihood of active TB in patients treated with TNF antagonists. However, at least one failure of TB chemoprophylaxis in a severely immunocompromised patient treated with infliximab and methotrexate has been published. Our patient is unique because the mycobacterial lung infection seemed to emerge as a result of the lack of activity of isoniazid chemoprophylaxis due to resistance of the infecting organism.

Decreased susceptibility to isoniazid among M. kansasii isolates is common, and this microorganism is naturally resistant to pyrazinamide. This pattern of resistance is a serious obstacle for the use of these drugs in monotherapy or when combined with rifampin in the prevention of lung disease caused by M. kansasii.

The source of the infection in this patient is unknown. In a large series of infectious diseases associated with infliximab therapy, nontuberculous mycobacteria were isolated in 9% of the patients who had mycobacterial diseases. As in our patient, these infections developed shortly after initiation of treatment with infliximab, which suggests that reactivation of a latent infection is the most probable origin of the disease. Although a mildly positive tuberculin skin test result can be observed in patients infected with atypical mycobacteria, the strong reaction seen in this patient suggests a latent infection with M. tuberculosis. We could speculate on the possibility of a double infection with M. tuberculosis (contracted through household contacts with his father) and M. kansasii through environmental exposure.

### Modeling the implementation of population-level isoniazid preventive therapy for tuberculosis control in a high HIV-prevalence setting [^116jCf3a]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is the second greatest infectious cause of mortality worldwide. Over two billion people are estimated to have latent infection, which does not cause disease symptoms but increases the risk of reactivation and disease. For that reason, individuals diagnosed with latent TB in most countries with a low prevalence of latent TB are treated with a regimen known as isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), which presumably cures the latent TB infection, thus reducing the risk of future TB reactivation and disease.

The WHO is promoting the use of IPT in all contexts and has been monitoring IPT coverage rates since 2003. However, in high-TB burden contexts, only a small fraction of individuals infected with latent TB is treated with IPT. Developing countries typically are not able to screen for latent TB at the community level, as public health systems can be overwhelmed when treating cases of active TB. They are therefore largely unable to screen asymptomatic individuals for latent TB, leaving large numbers of latent TB cases untreated. In addition to competing resource needs, barriers include possible monitoring requirements for liver function for individuals on IPT, concerns about the development of drug resistance, and challenges of distinguishing between latent and active TB in areas of high HIV prevalence; inadvertently providing IPT to a person suffering from active TB could result in a delay of appropriate treatment and the development of resistance.

Individuals infected with latent TB who are, or who become, HIV-positive have an elevated risk of TB act.

### The role of interleukin-32 against tuberculosis [^112io9kJ]. Cytokine (2015). Low credibility.

IL-32 is increasingly recognized as an important host-protective molecule against tuberculosis. In this commentary, we highlight some of the potential mechanisms by which the immunomodulatory effect of IL-32 occurs against mycobacterial infections, but also identify areas where mechanistic clarifications are needed.

### Isoniazid [^112TDAYK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In the absence of any of the above risk factors, individuals under the age of 35 with a tuberculin skin test reaction of 10 mm or more are considered appropriate candidates for preventive therapy if they belong to any of the following high-incidence groups: foreign-born persons from high-prevalence countries who never received the BCG vaccine; medically underserved low-income populations, including high-risk racial or ethnic minority populations such as Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans; and residents of facilities for long-term care, such as correctional institutions, nursing homes, and mental institutions.

Children under 4 years old are candidates for isoniazid preventive therapy if they have more than 10 mm induration from a PPD Mantoux tuberculin skin test.

Persons under 35 who have none of the above risk factors, do not belong to any high-incidence groups, and have a tuberculin skin test reaction of 15 mm or more are appropriate candidates for preventive therapy.

The risk of hepatitis must be weighed against the risk of tuberculosis in positive tuberculin reactors over the age of 35. Nevertheless, the use of isoniazid is recommended for those with the additional risk factors listed above and on an individual basis in situations where there is a likelihood of serious consequences to contacts who may become infected.

### Short-course therapy with daily rifapentine in a murine model of latent tuberculosis infection [^113ibt4j]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). High credibility.

Regimens recommended to treat latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) are 3 to 9 months long. A 2-month rifampin plus pyrazinamide regimen is no longer recommended. Shorter regimens are highly desirable. Because substituting rifapentine for rifampin in the standard regimen for active tuberculosis halves the treatment duration needed to prevent relapse in mice, we hypothesized daily rifapentine-based regimens could shorten LTBI treatment to 2 months or less.

- **Objectives**: To improve an existing model of LTBI chemotherapy and evaluate the efficacy of daily rifapentine-based regimens.

- **Methods**: Mice were immunized with a more immunogenic recombinant Bacille Calmette-Guérin strain (rBCG30) and received very low-dose aerosol infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis to establish a stable lung bacterial burden below 10^4 CFU without drug treatment. Mice received a control (isoniazid alone, rifampin alone, rifampin plus isoniazid, rifampin plus pyrazinamide) or test (rifapentine alone, rifapentine plus isoniazid, rifapentine plus pyrazinamide, rifapentine plus isoniazid plus pyrazinamide) regimen for 8 weeks. Rifamycin doses were 10 mg/kg/d, analogous to the same human doses. Outcomes were biweekly lung CFU counts and relapse after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment.

- **Measurements and main results**: M. tuberculosis CFU counts remained stable around 3.65 log(10) in immunized, untreated mice. Isoniazid or rifampin left all or most mice culture-positive at week 8. Rifampin plus isoniazid cured 0 and 53% of mice, and rifampin plus pyrazinamide cured 47 and 100% of mice in 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Rifapentine-based regimens were evaluated for their potential benefits.

### Immunomodulatory agents combat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis by improving antimicrobial immunity [^112pSGXe]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

**Results**: VitD+PBA treatment inhibited intracellular growth of MDR tuberculosis strains in human macrophages and exhibited additive effects together with RIF or INH. Macrophages were infected with 15 different clinical M. tuberculosis isolates, representing lineages 1–4, with different resistance patterns. The panel was tested for intracellular growth inhibition after treatment with vitD+PBA in the presence or absence of subinhibitory or high doses of RIF or INH compared with H37Rv. VitD+PBA inhibited growth of all M. tuberculosis isolates (median, 39.8%; range, 12.3%–57.8%). Extracellular growth rates of the clinical strains as well as intracellular growth of MDR tuberculosis (absolute CFU counts) were largely similar to those with H37Rv, although the different strains showed variable growth rates in macrophages prepared from different donors. Three lineage 4 isolates were selected for continued analyses: 2 MDR tuberculosis and 1 drug-susceptible strain.

### Isoniazid [^116xo97c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

All drugs should be discontinued, and an evaluation should be conducted at the first sign of a hypersensitivity reaction. If isoniazid therapy must be reintroduced, the drug should only be administered after symptoms have completely resolved. It should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of a hypersensitivity reaction.

- **Monitoring suggested for the following cases**:
	- Daily users of alcohol, as daily ingestion may be associated with a higher incidence of isoniazid hepatitis.
	- Patients with active chronic liver disease or severe renal dysfunction.
	- Individuals aged over 35 years.
	- Users of any chronically administered medication.
	- Patients with a history of previous isoniazid discontinuation.
	- Those with existing peripheral neuropathy or conditions predisposing to neuropathy.
	- Pregnant individuals.
	- Injection drug users.
	- Women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the post-partum period.
	- HIV seropositive patients.

Periodic ophthalmologic examinations during isoniazid therapy are recommended when visual symptoms occur.

- **Laboratory tests**:
	- Due to the higher frequency of isoniazid-associated hepatitis among certain patient groups, including those aged over 35 years, daily alcohol users, individuals with chronic liver disease, injection drug users, and women from minority groups particularly in the post-partum period, transaminase measurements should be obtained prior to starting and monthly during preventive therapy, or more frequently as needed. If any of the values exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, isoniazid should be temporarily discontinued.

### Update on the treatment of tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis infection [^115ftJng]. JAMA (2005). High credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) has emerged as a global public health epidemic. Despite decreasing numbers of cases in the United States since 1992, TB remains a serious public health problem among certain patient populations and is highly prevalent in many urban areas. The responsibility for prescribing an appropriate drug regimen and ensuring that treatment is completed is assigned to the public health program or the clinician, not the patient. The initial prescribed regimen for the treatment of TB usually consists of four drugs: isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.

The minimum length for the treatment of drug-susceptible TB with a rifampin-based regimen is 6 to 9 months. Providing medications directly to the patient and observing them swallow the anti-TB drugs, termed directly observed therapy, is recommended for all patients diagnosed with TB. This approach can help ensure higher completion rates, prevent the emergence of drug-resistant TB, and enhance TB control.

There has been renewed interest in treating individuals with latent TB infection as a TB-control strategy in the United States to eliminate the large reservoir of individuals at risk for progression to TB. The two broad categories of persons who should be tested for latent TB infection are: those likely to have been recently infected (such as contacts to infectious TB cases) and those at increased risk of progression to TB disease following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (e.g. individuals with human immunodeficiency virus infection, selected medical conditions, or recent immigrants to the United States).

### What can we offer to 3 million MDrtb household contacts in 2016 [^1154tLnk]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

For close contacts of index cases known to have drug-susceptible TB (susceptible to rifampicin and isoniazid) who are deemed to be at high risk of progression to active disease — such as young children, HIV-infected individuals, and the immunosuppressed — preventive therapy with isoniazid is recommended. There is strong evidence that this affords good protection against subsequent TB disease in well-defined populations. In low incidence settings, where the force of infection is low, this is presumed to be mediated through the sterilization of existing latent infection, preventing reactivation disease. In contrast, in high-burden settings, waning efficacy after preventive therapy is discontinued suggests there may also be an effect mediated while taking therapy through the prevention of the establishment of further infection upon re-exposure.

Most studies demonstrate that preventive therapy efficacy is greatest among subjects with a positive tuberculin skin test (TST), though this is not a universal finding. Moreover, the discourse about TST-negative subjects, particularly among patients with HIV, fails to adequately recognize that this group is a mix of those who can correctly be assumed not to have latent TB infection (LTBI) and those unable to mount a response to any antigen, not just tuberculin, by virtue of profound immunodeficiency. These individuals may therefore be at particularly high risk of reactivation of unrecognized LTBI. Neither TST nor interferon-gamma release…

### Three months of rifapentine and isoniazid for latent tuberculosis infection [^111A37io]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Treatment of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is an essential component of tuberculosis control and elimination. The standard regimen of isoniazid for 9 months is efficacious but is limited by toxicity and low rates of treatment completion.

- **Methods**: We conducted an open-label, randomized noninferiority trial comparing 3 months of directly observed once-weekly therapy with rifapentine (900 mg) plus isoniazid (900 mg) (combination-therapy group) with 9 months of self-administered daily isoniazid (300 mg) (isoniazid-only group) in subjects at high risk for tuberculosis. Subjects were enrolled from the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Spain and followed for 33 months. The primary endpoint was confirmed tuberculosis, and the noninferiority margin was 0.75%.

- **Results**: In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, tuberculosis developed in 7 of 3986 subjects in the combination-therapy group (cumulative rate, 0.19%) and in 15 of 3745 subjects in the isoniazid-only group (cumulative rate, 0.43%), for a difference of 0.24 percentage points. Rates of treatment completion were 82.1% in the combination-therapy group and 69.0% in the isoniazid-only group (P < 0.001). Rates of permanent drug discontinuation owing to an adverse event were 4.9% in the combination-therapy group and 3.7% in the isoniazid-only group (P = 0.009). Rates of investigator-assessed drug-related hepatotoxicity were 0.4% and 2.7%, respectively (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: The use of rifapentine plus isoniazid for 3 months was as effective as 9 months of isoniazid alone in preventing tuberculosis.

### Immunomodulatory agents combat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis by improving antimicrobial immunity [^112FYZnx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Major strengths of this study are that we infected human primary macrophages with clinical isolates obtained from patients, ranging from drug-susceptible to MDR tuberculosis strains with different drug resistance profiles, and compared the results with those of the laboratory H37Rv strain. The clinical isolates represented all major genetic M. tuberculosis lineages, while the selected strains were from the same lineage. However, the experimental setup had limitations on how many donors, strains, conditions, and doses could be included in each experiment. Therefore, we did not study the individual effects of vitamin D (vitD) or phenylbutyrate (PBA) in combination with rifampicin (RIF) or isoniazid (INH). Instead, we focused on unraveling the interactions between vitD+PBA and the primary drugs. We confirmed that the immunomodulatory compounds and the antibacterial drugs use different and complementary mechanisms to reduce intracellular M. tuberculosis growth.

### Tb or not TB: That is no longer the question [^117WamrK]. Science Translational Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a devastating infectious disease and, with the emergence of multidrug-resistant forms, represents a major global threat. Much of our understanding of pathogenic and immunologic mechanisms in TB has derived from studies in experimental animals. However, it is becoming increasingly clear in TB, as well as in other inflammatory diseases, that there are substantial differences in the immunological responses of humans not found or predicted by animal studies. Thus, it is critically important to understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis and immunological protection in humans. In this review, we will address the key immunological question: What are the necessary and sufficient immune responses required for protection against TB infection and disease in people, specifically protection against infection, protection against the establishment of latency or persistence, and protection against transitioning from latent infection to active disease?

### Isoniazid [^112cvNVq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

For preventive therapy of tuberculous infection and treatment of tuberculosis, it is recommended that physicians be familiar with the following publications: (1) the recommendations of the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, published in the MMWR: vol 42; RR-4, 1993 and (2) Treatment of Tuberculosis and Tuberculosis Infection in Adults and Children, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine: vol 149; 1359–1374, 1994.

Isoniazid Injection USP is used in conjunction with other effective antituberculous agents.

- **For treatment of tuberculosis**: Drug susceptibility testing should be performed on the organism initially isolated from all patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis. If the bacilli becomes resistant, therapy must be changed to agents to which the bacilli are susceptible.

- **Adults**: 5 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or 15 mg/kg up to 900 mg/day, two or three times a week.

- **Children**: 10 to 15 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or 20 to 40 mg/kg up to 900 mg/day, two or three times a week.

### Annual tuberculosis preventive therapy for persons with HIV infection: A randomized trial [^112ncUZY]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Tuberculosis preventive therapy for persons with HIV infection is effective, but its long-term durability is uncertain.

- **Objective**: To compare treatment completion rates of weekly isoniazid-rifapentine for 3 months versus daily isoniazid for 6 months, as well as the effectiveness of the 3-month rifapentine-isoniazid regimen given annually for 2 years versus once.

- **Design**: Randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02980016).

- **Setting**: South Africa, Ethiopia, and Mozambique.

- **Participants**: Persons with HIV infection who were receiving antiretroviral therapy, were aged 2 years or older, and did not have active tuberculosis.

- **Intervention**: Participants were randomly assigned to receive weekly rifapentine-isoniazid for 3 months, administered either annually for 2 years or once, or daily isoniazid for 6 months. Participants were screened for tuberculosis symptoms at months 0 to 3 and month 12 of each study year and at months 12 and 24 using chest radiography and sputum culture.

- **Measurements**: Treatment completion was assessed using pill counts. Tuberculosis incidence was measured over 24 months.

- **Results**: Between November 2016 and November 2017, 4,027 participants were enrolled; 4,014 were included in the analyses (median age, 41 years; 69.5% women; all using antiretroviral therapy). Treatment completion in the first year for the combined rifapentine-isoniazid groups (n = 3,610) was 90.4% versus 50.5% for the isoniazid group (n = 404) (risk ratio, 1.78 [95% CI, 1.61 to 1.95]). Tuberculosis incidence among participants receiving the rifapentine-isoniazid regimen twice (n = 1,808) or once was not completed.

### Biologic effects and basic science of a novel immune-modulation therapy [^112GHdgp]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The immune system maintains a dynamic equilibrium, with inflammatory responses (mediated by T helper type 1 cells, interleukin [IL]-1beta, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]) balanced by anti-inflammatory responses (mediated by T regulatory type 1 cells, T helper type 3 cells, IL-4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor-beta). Thus, neutralizing inappropriate inflammatory cytokines is a therapeutic strategy that has been attempted in many chronic inflammatory conditions. This approach mostly targets TNF-alpha using either monoclonal antibodies or modified receptor proteins, such as etanercept.

However, there is functional redundancy among inflammatory cytokines. For example, in addition to TNF-alpha, both IL-1beta and IL-6 are elevated in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), indicating that neutralizing TNF-alpha alone may be an inadequate strategy for these patients. Immune-modulation therapy (IMT) results in the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine levels and the upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines. This alteration in the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be more appropriate than targeting a single cytokine in conditions such as CHF.

Several animal studies have investigated the effect of IMT in inflammatory conditions, including allergic contact hypersensitivity, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and atherogenesis. These studies are reviewed in this context.

### Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in children [^111YaVn5]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2013). Low credibility.

The treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is an effective method for preventing future cases of tuberculosis disease. We review pediatric and adult studies of LTBI treatment, including isoniazid and rifampin monotherapy, isoniazid plus rifampin, isoniazid plus rifapentine, and rifampin plus pyrazinamide. Based on this review and our pediatric experience, we offer recommendations for routine (isoniazid) and alternative courses of therapy.

### Inhibition of host PARP1 contributes to the anti-inflammatory and antitubercular activity of pyrazinamide [^115bUxCZ]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (M.tb) is a highly successful human pathogen that can establish lifelong infections despite powerful inflammatory immune responses. M.tb is initially encountered by airway-resident myeloid cells, which recruit and activate immune cells by initiating transcription factor signaling, notably NF-κB, to produce critical chemo- and cytokines, including TNFα, IL-12, and IL-1β. TNFα and IL-12 stimulate the antimicrobial activity of macrophages, CD4+ Th1 cell differentiation, and production of the type 2 interferon IFNγ. As M.tb antigen-specific CD4+ T cells accumulate, the host effectively restricts M.tb proliferation but is unable to clear the infection, resorting instead to surrounding infected foci with granulomatous structures to prevent further dissemination. However, granulomas are associated with TB transmission, lung damage, poor drug penetration, and high antibiotic tolerance, making persistent bacilli difficult to kill. Thus, inflammatory TB immune responses act as a double-edged sword that contain but fail to eliminate the infection, resulting in tissue damage and impaired treatment responses.

Pyrazinamide (PZA) has been a cornerstone of TB therapy for nearly 70 years, yet its mechanism of action remains incompletely understood. Standard TB therapy consists of two months of PZA, ethambutol, isoniazid (INH), and rifampin (RIF), followed by an additional four months of INH and RIF. This combination of bactericidal (INH, ethambutol, RIF) and sterilizing (PZA, RIF) TB antibiotics is key for preventing drug resistance and treatment failures.

### A semimechanistic model of the bactericidal activity of high-dose isoniazid against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: Results from a randomized clinical trial [^111mYSSV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

There is accumulating evidence that higher-than-standard doses of isoniazid are effective against low-to-intermediate-level isoniazid-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but the optimal dose remains unknown. The objective of this study was to characterize the association between isoniazid pharmacokinetics (standard or high dose) and early bactericidal activity against M. tuberculosis (drug-sensitive and inhA mutated) and N-acetyltransferase 2 status.

- **Methods**: ACTG (AIDS Clinical Trial Group) A5312/INHindsight is a 7-day early bactericidal activity study with isoniazid at a normal dose (5 mg/kg) for patients with drug-sensitive strains and 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg doses for patients with inhA mutants. Participants with pulmonary tuberculosis received daily isoniazid monotherapy and collected sputum daily. Colony-forming units (cfu) on solid culture and time to positivity in liquid culture were jointly analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling.

- **Measurements and main results**: Fifty-nine adults were included in this analysis. A decline in sputum cfu was described by a one-compartment model, whereas an exponential bacterial growth model was used to interpret time-to-positivity data. The model found that bacterial kill is modulated by isoniazid concentration using an effect compartment and a sigmoidal Emax relationship, which links the drug concentration to the observed effect. The model predicted lower potency but similar maximum kill of isoniazid against inhA-mutated compared with drug-sensitive isolates.

Based on simulations from the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamic model, these findings indicate the potential for optimizing isoniazid dosing strategies to improve treatment outcomes for MDR-TB, particularly in cases involving inhA mutations.

### Protection versus pathology in tuberculosis: recent insights [^114jrQrV]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Recent studies have revisited the roles of prime players in the immune response to tuberculosis (TB) and have highlighted novel functions of these players. Specifically, immunoregulatory mechanisms mediated by IFNγ have been delineated, as well as a novel role for neutrophils in promoting antigen presentation. New insights into the interaction between the bacterium and phagocyte indicate that the bacterium actively promotes phagocyte necrosis rather than apoptosis, impacting the generation of the acquired response. There are also many new examples of how the phagocyte responds to the bacteria and how it mediates control. The phenotype of protective T cells is also being re-examined. These developments provide promise for improved vaccine design and highlight the complexity of this disease.

### Limited antimycobacterial efficacy of epitope peptide administration despite enhanced antigen-specific CD4 T-cell activation [^1111xHZj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is associated with inconsistent and incomplete elimination of the bacteria, despite the development of antigen-specific T-cell responses. One mechanism used by M. tuberculosis is to limit the availability of antigen for activation of CD4 T cells.

- **Methods**: We examined the utility of systemic administration of epitope peptides to activate pre-existing T cells in mice infected with M. tuberculosis.

- **Results**: We found that systemic peptide administration (1) selectively activates T cells specific for the epitope peptide, (2) loads major histocompatibility complex class II on lung macrophages and dendritic cells, (3) activates CD4 T cells in the lung parenchyma, and (4) has little antimycobacterial activity.

- **Conclusions**: Further studies revealed that CD4 T cells in lung lesions are distant from the infected cells, suggesting that even if they can be activated, the positioning of CD4 T cells and their direct interactions with infected cells may be limiting determinants of immunity in tuberculosis.

### Isoniazid preventive therapy and risk for resistant tuberculosis [^11533ok4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

In the context of tuberculosis (TB) resurgence, isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is increasingly promoted; however, concerns about the risk of developing isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis may hinder its widespread implementation. We conducted a systematic review of data published since 1951 to assess the effect of primary IPT on the risk of isoniazid-resistant TB. Different definitions of isoniazid resistance were used, which affected summary effect estimates; we report the most consistent results. When all 13 studies (N = 18,095 persons in isoniazid groups and N = 17,985 persons in control groups) were combined, the summary relative risk for resistance was 1.45 (95% confidence interval 0.85–2.47). Results were similar when studies of HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected persons were considered separately. Analyses were limited by small numbers and incomplete testing of isolates, but findings do not exclude an increased risk for isoniazid-resistant TB after IPT. The diagnosis of active TB should be excluded before IPT, and continued surveillance for isoniazid resistance is essential.

### Isoniazid for preventing tuberculosis in HIV-infected children [^117NcBwH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**

In HIV‐positive children not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), isoniazid prophylaxis may reduce active TB disease, and death (low certainty evidence). In HIV‐positive children without known exposure to a TB source case, and on ART, isoniazid prophylaxis conferred neither benefit nor harm for active TB (very low certainty evidence) or death (very low certainty evidence). HIV treatment may modify the effect of TB preventive treatment.

Clinical adverse events were similar between the isoniazid prophylaxis and placebo groups, both in children not on ART and those on ART. Laboratory adverse events were similar between the isoniazid prophylaxis and placebo groups, both in children not on ART and those on ART. In a secondary analysis of Zar 2007 data, Le Roux 2013 showed that 16 (5.4%) out of 297 children developed severe liver injury while receiving isoniazid, but only 1.7% of these cases were related to isoniazid prophylaxis.

- **Overall completeness and applicability of evidence**

Isoniazid preventive therapy is currently recommended for preventing TB infection in HIV‐positive children. We included three trials (n = 991) in this review, which enrolled both young and older HIV‐positive children, living in areas of high TB prevalence. Most of the data were from South Africa, limiting the generalizability of the review findings to other settings, given the variation in isoniazid resistance globally. The trials were underpowered to detect clinically important effects of isoniazid prophylaxis on active TB and death.

### Immunological mechanisms of human resistance to persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [^112WLEUb]. Nature Reviews Immunology (2018). High credibility.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a leading cause of mortality worldwide and establishes a long-lived latent infection in a substantial proportion of the human population. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that some individuals are resistant to latent M. tuberculosis infection despite long-term and intense exposure, and we term these individuals 'resisters'. In this review, we discuss the epidemiological and genetic data that support the existence of resisters and propose criteria to optimally define and characterize the resister phenotype. We review recent insights into the immune mechanisms of M. tuberculosis clearance, including responses mediated by macrophages, T cells, and B cells. Understanding the cellular mechanisms that underlie resistance to M. tuberculosis infection may reveal immune correlates of protection that could be utilized for improved diagnostics, vaccine development, and novel host-directed therapeutic strategies.

### Adaptive immunity to mycobacteria [^113Ta8UR]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Advances are now being made in understanding both the initiation of the adaptive or acquired response to tuberculosis infection and its interface with elements of the innate response. Furthermore, much later events related to the chronic disease state, where reactivation can potentially occur, are being studied. Despite these advancements, several elements of the adaptive response remain poorly understood.

### Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^116v4Ey4]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

This review describes major developments in the rationale for treating latent tuberculosis infection, new approaches to identifying persons with latent infection who are most likely to progress to active disease, and the development of novel short-course regimens for treatment of latent tuberculosis.

As many as one-third of the world's population has latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Models demonstrate that tuberculosis will not be eliminated without large-scale treatment of persons with latent TB. Tools for identifying persons at risk for active tuberculosis disease include TST and IGRA, which have poor positive predictive values. Newer approaches using gene expression profiling show promise and are being studied in ongoing trials. The development of short-course regimens is a major advance in the treatment of latent TB. Three months of rifapentine with isoniazid, four months of rifampin, and one month of rifapentine with isoniazid have been found to be noninferior to the standard nine months of isoniazid.

Progress towards TB elimination can be accelerated by instituting public health measures that take into account new developments in identifying and treating persons with latent tuberculosis infection who are most likely to progress to active disease.

### Tuberculosis in systemic lupus erythematosus in an endemic area and the role of isoniazid prophylaxis during corticosteroid therapy [^113gWt2B]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

The efficacy of isoniazid (INAH) prophylaxis against tuberculosis (TB) in patients taking corticosteroids remains controversial. Hong Kong is an endemic area for TB, with an annual risk of 0.11/100 in the general population. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have an increased susceptibility to TB because of their intrinsic immunocompromised state and the use of corticosteroid therapy. We examined the usefulness of INAH in the prevention of recurrences of TB in patients with SLE receiving high-dose corticosteroid therapy.

- **Methods**: Medical records of a cohort of patients with SLE were reviewed. Patients with a history of TB who had previously been adequately treated were retrospectively examined for subsequent recurrence of TB. A comparison was performed based on the use of INAH at the discretion of the attending physician in some patients (INAH group) but not others (non-INAH group) during lupus exacerbation that required the use of prednisolone ≥ 15 mg/day or equivalent.

- **Results**: A total of 91 episodes of TB from 76 individuals in a cohort of 652 SLE patients with a duration of follow-up of 13.9 ± 7.5 years were identified (prevalence of 1.06/100 patient-years). Forty-three episodes were given INAH while 48 were not. There were 18 recurrences of TB (recurrence rate of 1.66/100 patient-years). Recurrence rates in the INAH and non-INAH groups were 1.59 and 1.74 per 100 patient-years (p = 0.72). However, patients in the INAH group had more lupus exacerbations. Further, extrapulmonary TB was also found to have a higher recurrence rate than pulmonary TB.

### Isoniazid for preventing tuberculosis in HIV-infected children [^111Dn1nz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Preventing TB infection and disease in HIV‐positive children is potentially an important public health intervention. Isoniazid has been used successfully as a preventive treatment in HIV‐negative children following TB exposure, and in HIV‐infected adults with a positive tuberculin skin test, where treatment reduced TB disease by 62%. This benefit was found for all preventive drug regimens: isoniazid alone, isoniazid with rifampicin, rifampicin with pyrazinamide and isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. No reduction in death was found. Isoniazid offers a further 40% reduction in active TB among HIV‐positive adults on ART. Studies showed that IPT reduces active TB at the community and population level. However, the strategy may be compromised by low adherence over the many months necessary to complete a single course of IPT, a problem worsened in HIV‐TB co‐infected individuals for whom IPT durations are prolonged.

In contrast to adults, preventive treatment in children is aimed at preventing primary infection rather than reactivation of disease. In settings of high TB prevalence, the rate of TB re‐infection is high, and short‐course prophylaxis is potentially inadequate. Longer‐term prophylaxis or repeat courses may be necessary. Preventive treatment can lead to adverse events, mostly liver toxicity, although this is uncommon and rarely requires cessation of antimycobacterial medication in HIV‐positive children.

### Regulatory T cells subvert mycobacterial containment in patients failing extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment [^116bqynW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The advent of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) and totally drug-resistant TB, with limited or no treatment options, has facilitated renewed interest in host-directed immunotherapy, particularly for therapeutically destitute patients. However, the selection and utility of such approaches depend on understanding the host immune response in XDR-TB, which remain unexplored.

- **Objectives**: To determine the host immunological profile in patients with XDR-TB compared with drug-sensitive TB (DS-TB), using peripheral blood and explanted lung tissue.

- **Methods**: Blood and explanted lung tissue were obtained from patients with XDR-TB (n = 31), DS-TB (n = 20), and presumed latent TB infection (n = 20). T-cell phenotype (T-helper cell type 1 [Th1]/Th2/Th17/regulatory T cells [Tregs]) was evaluated in all patient groups. Treg function was assessed in XDR-TB nonresponders by coculturing PPD-preprimed effector T cells with H37Rv-infected monocyte-derived macrophages, with or without autologous Tregs. Mycobacterial containment was evaluated by counting colony-forming units.

- **Measurements and main results**: Patients failing XDR-TB treatment had an altered immunophenotype characterized by a substantial increase in the frequency (median; interquartile range) of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Tregs (11.5%; 5.9–15.2%) compared with DS-TB (3.4%; 1.6–5.73%; P < 0.001) and presumed latent TB infection (1.8%; 1.2–2.3%; P < 0.001). This increase was unrelated to disease duration. Tregs isolated from patients with XDR-TB suppressed T-cell proliferation (up to 90%) and subverted containment.

### Effect of isoniazid therapy for latent TB infection on QuantiFERON-TB gold in-tube responses in adults with positive tuberculin skin test results in a high TB incidence area: a controlled study [^1161xUUX]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

T-cell interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are used in the diagnosis of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection and could be useful biomarkers of response to treatment of latent TB infection for clinical trials, infection control units, and TB programs.

- **Methods**: This investigation was a prospective, controlled substudy of IGRA responses in 82 healthy South African adults with HIV seronegative and positive tuberculin skin test results. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment with 6 months of daily isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) or observation before Bacillus Calmette-Guérin revaccination in a clinical trial. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay was used to measure interferon-γ (IFN-γ) response to mycobacterial antigens at baseline and after IPT or observation.

- **Results**: IFN-γ levels declined between baseline and the end of IPT (signed rank test P ≤ .0001) and between baseline and a similar period of observation without IPT (signed rank test P = .03). The rate of decrease in IFN-γ responses over time did not differ between the groups (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test P = .31). QFT-GIT test results in two subjects (5%) in the IPT group and two subjects (5%) in the observation group reverted from positive to negative during follow-up. No significant difference was found between the groups with respect to baseline positivity or the proportion of patients whose tests reverted to negative.

- **Conclusions**: IPT had no effect on changes in QFT-GIT readouts during short-term follow-up of adults with positive tuberculin skin tests in a high TB incidence setting. QFT-GIT is unlikely to be an effective marker for this purpose in such contexts.

### Isoniazid and rifapentine treatment eradicates persistentin macaques [^115haSNr]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Direct evidence for persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) during asymptomatic latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in humans is currently lacking. Although a 12-week regimen of once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine (3HP) is recommended by the CDC as treatment for LTBI, experimental evidence of 3HP-mediated clearance of persistent Mtb infection in human lungs has not been established.

Using a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of TB, we sought to assess 3HP treatment-mediated clearance of Mtb infection in latently infected macaques. Sixteen NHPs were infected via inhalation with approximately 10 cfu of Mtb CDC1551, after which asymptomatic animals were either treated with 3HP or left untreated. Pharmacokinetics of the 3HP regimen were measured. Following treatment, animals were coinfected with simian immunodeficiency virus to assess reactivation of LTBI and development of active TB disease.

Fourteen NHPs remained free of clinical signs or microbiological evidence of active TB following infection with Mtb and were subsequently either treated with 3HP (n = 7) or left untreated (n = 7). Untreated NHPs were asymptomatic for 7 months but harbored persistent Mtb infection, evidenced by reactivation of latent infection following simian immunodeficiency virus coinfection. However, none of the treated animals developed TB reactivation disease, and they remained without clinical or microbiological evidence of persistent bacilli, suggesting treatment-mediated clearance of bacteria.

### Antiretrovirals and isoniazid preventive therapy in the prevention of HIV-associated tuberculosis in settings with limited health-care resources [^115LdRqa]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2010). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy and isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) are both effective interventions to prevent HIV-associated tuberculosis, but work via different mechanisms. We propose that these two interventions might best be used as complementary strategies at different stages of HIV progression. At relatively high CD4-cell counts, IPT reduces tuberculosis risk by 64% (95% CI 39–78%) in patients with positive tuberculin skin tests and is the key tuberculosis preventive intervention before patients are eligible for antiretroviral therapy. However, at low CD4-cell counts, reliable exclusion of active tuberculosis is difficult, fewer patients are eligible for IPT, and waning immune function might limit the durability of its effect. In such patients, antiretroviral therapy is the primary intervention needed, reducing tuberculosis incidence by 67% (95% CI 61–73%). However, tuberculosis risk during long-term antiretroviral therapy remains several times higher than background, especially in those with poor immune recovery. Patients might therefore derive additional benefit from combined use of IPT and antiretroviral therapy to simultaneously treat mycobacterial infection and restore tuberculosis-specific immune function. For those first presenting with advanced immunodeficiency, we propose that IPT might best be delayed until completion of the first few months of antiretroviral therapy, when active tuberculosis can be more reliably excluded. Data from randomized controlled trials are needed to underpin further development of public-health policy.

### Benefits of continuous isoniazid preventive therapy may outweigh resistance risks in a declining tuberculosis/HIV coepidemic [^1147xhkP]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

Extending the duration of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) may improve its effectiveness at both individual and population levels but could also increase selective pressure in favor of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis (TB) strains. The objective of this study was to determine the relative importance of these two effects.

- **Methods**: Transmission dynamic model.

- **Design**: We created a mathematical model of TB transmission incorporating HIV incidence and treatment, mixed strain latent TB infections, and four different phenotypes of TB drug resistance (pan-susceptible, isoniazid monoresistant, rifampicin monoresistant, and multidrug-resistant). We used this model to project the effects of IPT duration on the incidence of isoniazid-sensitive and isoniazid-resistant TB as well as mortality among PLHIV. We evaluated the sensitivity of our baseline model, which was calibrated at the time of writing from Botswana, to different assumptions about the future trajectory of the TB epidemic.

- **Results**: Our model suggests that, in the context of a declining TB epidemic such as that currently observed in Botswana, the incidence and mortality benefits of continuous IPT for PLHIV are likely to outweigh the potential resistance risks associated with long-duration IPT. However, should TB epidemics fail to remain in control, as was observed during the initial emergence of HIV, the selective pressure imposed by widespread use of continuous IPT on isoniazid-resistant TB incidence may erode its initial benefits.

### How can immunology contribute to the control of tuberculosis [^111WHRC9]. Nature Reviews Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis poses a significant threat to mankind. Multidrug-resistant strains are on the rise, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is often associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Satisfactory control of tuberculosis can only be achieved using a highly efficacious vaccine. Tuberculosis is particularly challenging for the immune system. The intracellular location of the pathogen shields it from antibodies, and a variety of T-cell subpopulations must be activated to challenge the bacterium's resistance to antibacterial defense mechanisms. A clear understanding of the immune responses that control the pathogen will be important for achieving optimal immunity, and information provided by functional genome analysis of M. tuberculosis will be vital in the design of a future vaccine.

### Revisiting the timetable of tuberculosis [^111tHEJv]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

In light of the findings that the risk of TB drops precipitously after the first couple of years and continues to drop further, we revisited the assertion that a quarter of the world's population is latently infected with M tuberculosis. This statistic is derived from the finding that about a quarter of the world's population exhibits immunoreactivity to TB, as shown by a positive TST or interferon gamma release assay.

The basis of adaptive immunity is that a memory response does not require the inciting pathogen to remain present. Therefore, TB reactivity must encompass both past and present infections. But is there evidence that TB reactivity persists after M tuberculosis is cleared? Several papers suggest so. Atuk and Hunt examined the persistence of TST positivity at the end of one year of isoniazid treatment of asymptomatic, TST positive hospital employees. Among recent converters (less than one year), only five of 20 people remained TST positive to the same extent; the rest became TST negative or positive to a smaller extent. By contrast, all 17 people who had been asymptomatically TST positive for more than a year remained so after the year of isoniazid treatment. A study in naval officers had virtually identical findings. Almost all people who had been TST positive for only a few weeks at the start of isoniazid treatment reverted within three months; all who had been positive for more than one year remained positive at the end of the year's treatment. These findings are consistent with TB immunoreactivity.

### Isoniazid preventive therapy and risk for resistant tuberculosis [^1136EYAF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Study quality and review methods may have affected the results in other ways. For example, inadequate random assignment of HIV-infected persons could result in more advanced immunosuppression among those in the isoniazid group and thus a higher probability of resistance. However, when reported, the method of randomization in trials of HIV-infected persons appeared adequate. Differences in loss to follow-up between comparison groups could affect results if those who were lost to follow-up had a different probability of resistance than those not lost. In 6 of the 11 RCTs with information, less than 20% were lost to follow-up in both groups, but the loss was noticeably higher in the isoniazid group than for controls in 2 studies of HIV-infected persons. Publication bias could affect the results if studies finding increased resistance among persons receiving isoniazid were more likely to be published. However, the aim of all the studies was to investigate the effectiveness of IPT, not to ascertain the development of resistance, and our analyses suggest that publication bias did not affect the summary estimate.

The methods used to test for isoniazid resistance are now relatively standardized and based on the proportion method in which resistance is defined as growth on medium containing 0.2 μg/mL isoniazid that exceeds 1% of the growth on control medium. In older studies, methods were less standardized and were based on absolute numbers of colonies growing on media with various concentrations of antituberculous drugs. In the Greenland study, results for resistance were presented using two different methods.

### Is infection life long [^116oZspm]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

This finding was validated by two studies that provided mechanistic insights. Among hospital employees, Atuk and Hunt showed that patients who had positive results on TSTs for more than a year before treatment remained so after treatment, whereas 50% of those who had been positive for less than a year became negative or had smaller TST induration size. Houk and colleagues' study of US Navy sailors treated with isoniazid for TB infection provided more granularity. All who were immunoreactive for more than a year before treatment remained so after treatment; among the remainder, those who were immunoreactive the longest were most likely to remain so after isoniazid treatment. These findings are consistent with the development of a lasting immunological memory that becomes more robust with longer exposure to antigen. Finally, the finding that TB immunoreactivity outlasts infection holds in the context of active TB — people remain immunoreactive after completing treatment with highly effective multidrug regimens.

So TB immunoreactivity is not a marker for the presence of continued TB infection. Rather, it serves as a sign of having been infected with TB but does not reflect the outcome — bacterial clearance versus persistence.

### Isoniazid for preventing tuberculosis in HIV-infected children [^115vbdcn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

This study aims to summarize the effects of tuberculosis preventive treatment compared to placebo in HIV-positive children who have no known contact with active tuberculosis. The focus is on the impact of this treatment on active tuberculosis development, mortality rates, and reported adverse events associated with the treatment.

### Recent findings in immunology give tuberculosis vaccines a new boost [^1123DqUQ]. Trends in Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis remains a major health threat, unresolved by either chemotherapy or the BCG vaccine. Although a new generation of vaccine candidates is ready for field trials, further improvements will be required. A successful vaccination regime must stimulate memory T cells while avoiding exhaustion of memory and suppression by regulatory mechanisms. The most probable scenario involves priming with one vaccine candidate followed by boosting with another vaccine candidate. For clinical trials, biomarkers need to be defined, with T cells alternating between the lung and periphery as prime indicator cells.

### Inflammation and tuberculosis: Host-directed therapies [^112YPmGd]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne infectious disease that kills almost two million individuals every year. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB is caused by strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, the backbone of first-line antitubercular treatment. MDR TB affects an estimated 500,000 new patients annually. Genetic analysis of drug-resistant MDR-TB showed that airborne transmission of undetected and untreated strains played a major role in disease outbreaks. The need for new TB vaccines and faster diagnostics, as well as the development of new drugs, has recently been highlighted. The major problem in terms of TB research and clinical demands is the increasing number of cases of extensively drug-resistant and 'treatment-refractory' TB.

An emerging scenario of adjunct host-directed therapies is intended to target pulmonary TB where inflammatory processes can be deleterious and lead to immune exhaustion. 'Target-organ-saving' strategies may be warranted to prevent damage to infected tissues and achieve focused, clinically relevant, and long-lasting anti-M. tb cellular immune responses. Candidates for such interventions may be biological agents or already approved drugs that can be 're-purposed' to interfere with biologically relevant cellular checkpoints. Here, we review concepts of inflammation in TB disease and discuss candidate pathways for host-directed therapies to achieve better clinical outcomes.
