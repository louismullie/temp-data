## Question

Pain medication in esrd patient.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pain medication management in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pain burden and why ESRD complicates analgesia. Then, I should verify the overarching principles of a biopsychosocial, stepped-care approach. Next, I will examine nonpharmacologic options, followed by nonopioid pharmacologics, and then opioids with careful pharmacokinetic considerations. After that, I should review special populations like calciphylaxis and older adults, and finally synthesize a practical algorithm and monitoring plan with attention to dialysis effects and deprescribing triggers [^115GaDbJ] [^114vTRHn].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and magnitude of the problem. Pain is highly prevalent in ESRD, with estimates around 50–80% and a substantial proportion reporting moderate to severe pain, which impairs quality of life, dialysis adherence, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality; importantly, evidence for effective analgesic strategies is limited and prescribing patterns often deviate from best practices, so I need to ensure my approach is cautious and evidence-aligned [^115GaDbJ] [^113tBmmN] [^112P19vk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about opioids; I should anchor the approach in a biopsychosocial, stepped-care model that prioritizes function over pain scores, starts with nonpharmacologic strategies, and escalates to pharmacotherapy only when necessary, with shared decision-making and individualized risk–benefit discussions given polypharmacy and comorbidities in ESRD [^114vTRHn] [^114jNDUj].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic interventions because they are first-line and often underused. Exercise and physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based approaches, and acupuncture can reduce pain and improve function; I need to check feasibility within dialysis schedules and consider virtual delivery when access is limited, and I should remember that acupuncture is feasible and acceptable in hemodialysis settings, though more robust pain-specific RCTs are needed [^114vTRHn] [^114R7fog].

> I will now examine nonopioid pharmacologic options, starting with acetaminophen as the preferred first-line agent for mild pain because it is generally safe at reduced doses in ESRD; wait, let me verify the ceiling and interval — many nephrology sources cap at 650 mg and extend the interval to q8h when GFR is below 30 mL/min, which aligns with conservative dosing in CKD guidance, so I should stick to that and avoid exceeding 3 g/day [^1158fgCQ] [^112P19vk].

> For topical therapies, I should confirm that capsaicin and lidocaine patches are reasonable because systemic exposure is minimal; however, I need to be cautious with topical NSAIDs given potential systemic absorption and the general NSAID risk profile in CKD, so if used, it should be short-term and monitored closely [^1158fgCQ] [^1137WjKP].

> Now, gabapentinoids for neuropathic pain — let me think about dosing in dialysis. Both gabapentin and pregabalin are renally cleared and dialyzable, so I should start very low and give post-dialysis supplemental doses; typical starting points are gabapentin 100 mg post-dialysis or pregabalin 25 mg post-dialysis, with careful titration and monitoring for somnolence and dizziness, acknowledging that efficacy data in ESRD are limited and largely extrapolated from pharmacokinetics [^116V9Gqg] [^115FPc53] [^117GhQU4].

> For SNRIs, I initially thought duloxetine might be reasonable, but wait, I should double-check renal dosing — exposure increases substantially as kidney function declines, and VA/DoD guidance advises avoiding duloxetine when GFR is below 30 mL/min, so I should not use it in ESRD; if an SNRI is needed, I would consider alternatives with more favorable profiles, recognizing the evidence gap in dialysis populations [^1158fgCQ] [^116V9Gqg].

> TCAs like nortriptyline can be considered for neuropathic pain at low doses, but I need to ensure ECG review for QT risk and monitor for anticholinergic effects; given polypharmacy and falls risk in ESRD, I should use the lowest effective dose and reassess frequently [^112P19vk].

> NSAIDs require special caution; I should confirm that routine NSAID use is discouraged in advanced CKD and ESRD due to risks of AKI, hyperkalemia, fluid retention, and loss of residual renal function, so if considered at all, it should be short-term, at the lowest dose, with PPI gastroprotection and close monitoring of kidney function and volume status, and only after discussing tradeoffs with the patient [^1158BK29] [^1137WjKP] [^111xnHqa].

> When pain remains moderate to severe despite optimized nonopioid therapy, I need to ensure opioid selection favors agents with minimal active renally cleared metabolites; fentanyl, methadone, buprenorphine, hydromorphone, and oxycodone are generally preferred, whereas morphine, codeine, and tramadol should be avoided due to accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites like M3G and M6G or unpredictable pharmacokinetics; I should also remember that methadone requires ECG monitoring for QT prolongation and should be initiated by experienced clinicians [^111EfdGe] [^116kmvFz] [^113S4ncv] [^114Pk82k].

> Let me verify buprenorphine's role because it is increasingly emphasized. Buprenorphine's partial agonism and hepatic metabolism make it attractive in ESRD; it is not dialyzed, has lower respiratory depression risk, and can be used for both pain and OUD without a waiver, so it is a reasonable first opioid in CKD/ESRD when opioids are indicated, with transdermal or sublingual formulations available [^116NKYFv] [^115GaDbJ].

> For dosing and titration, I should start low, go slow, and reassess frequently; for example, hydromorphone 1–2 mg orally every 4–6 hours with 50% dose reductions in severe renal impairment, or transdermal buprenorphine 5–10 mcg/hour with cautious titration, and I should plan for naloxone co-prescribing and overdose education given class risks even with partial agonists in multimorbid patients [^115GaDbJ] [^116NKYFv].

> I need to ensure I account for dialysis effects on drug clearance. Highly protein-bound, lipophilic, or large molecular weight drugs are less likely to be removed by dialysis, whereas water-soluble, low protein-bound agents like gabapentinoids are readily dialyzed and may require post-dialysis supplementation; this means I should coordinate timing of doses with the dialysis schedule and anticipate interdialytic accumulation for certain agents [^116fYBjp] [^116V9Gqg].

> But wait, what if the pain is procedure-related or breakthrough in nature, such as during calciphylaxis dressing changes. Short-acting transmucosal fentanyl can be effective for predictable incident pain if the patient is already opioid-tolerant, with careful selection and specialist oversight; if not available or contraindicated, subcutaneous fentanyl or alfentanil offer rapid onset and offset, and for refractory cases, escalation to monitored sedation may be necessary in specialized settings [^115CX6MD] [^1133xnWv].

> For calciphylaxis specifically, I should confirm that multimodal, specialist-led care is essential given the severity and complexity; opioids are often required but neurotoxicity is common, so background pain may be managed with transdermal fentanyl or buprenorphine, breakthrough with small doses of hydromorphone or oxycodone, and adjuvant gabapentinoids for neuropathic components, alongside aggressive wound care and early palliative care involvement and advance care planning given high mortality [^1133xnWv] [^117ECnZU].

> In older adults with ESRD, I should double-check fall risk, cognitive effects, and constipation when using opioids or sedatives; transdermal buprenorphine or fentanyl may be better tolerated, and any opioid initiation should trigger a falls risk assessment, bowel regimen, and medication reconciliation to minimize drug–drug interactions and delirium risk [^112P19vk] [^114vTRHn].

> I should also remember that some non-analgesic medications can precipitate neurotoxicity in ESRD; for example, baclofen can cause profound encephalopathy after even a single dose due to renal clearance dependence, so I need to avoid it and educate teams about alternatives for spasticity or hiccups when kidney function is minimal [^115j4BES].

> Next, I should review monitoring and deprescribing triggers. Functional goals should guide therapy, with reassessment every 2–4 weeks initially, then every 3 months; if there is no meaningful improvement in function or pain after a defined trial, I should taper and stop opioids, and throughout I should monitor for sedation, confusion, constipation, respiratory depression, and misuse, using clinical assessment and, when needed, serum levels if urine testing is not feasible in anuric patients [^114vTRHn] [^116dFBej].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying. Start with education and nonpharmacologic measures; for mild pain, use acetaminophen at conservative doses; for neuropathic pain, add a gabapentinoid with post-dialysis dosing; for moderate pain unresponsive to these, consider buprenorphine as the preferred opioid; for severe pain, use transdermal fentanyl or carefully titrated hydromorphone or oxycodone with close monitoring; throughout, layer topical agents, TCAs or other adjuvants as indicated, and escalate to specialist palliative care for complex or refractory pain syndromes [^112P19vk] [^115GaDbJ] [^114vTRHn].

> Finally, I should confirm alignment with guidelines and note evidence gaps. KDIGO and VA/DoD emphasize patient-centered, multidisciplinary care, conservative options, and judicious pharmacotherapy tailored to kidney function, while acknowledging that high-quality RCTs in ESRD pain are sparse; shared decision-making, advance care planning, and routine symptom assessment should be embedded in care, and clinicians should be transparent about uncertainties when proposing off-label or extrapolated strategies [^116KVGaM] [^114vTRHn] [^113YBNhE].

Pain management in ESRD requires a **stepwise, multimodal approach** that prioritizes nonpharmacologic strategies and non-opioid agents, reserving opioids for refractory cases with careful selection and dosing [^114vTRHn] [^112P19vk]. Acetaminophen is **first-line** for mild pain; topical NSAIDs may be used short term if benefits outweigh risks [^112P19vk]. Gabapentinoids are effective for neuropathic pain but require dose adjustment and post-dialysis supplementation [^116V9Gqg]. Preferred opioids include buprenorphine, fentanyl, methadone, hydromorphone, and oxycodone; avoid morphine, codeine, tramadol, and meperidine due to neurotoxic metabolites [^111EfdGe] [^116kmvFz]. Monitor closely for sedation, respiratory depression, and drug interactions, and coordinate with nephrology and palliative care for complex cases [^114vTRHn] [^113tBmmN].

## Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic therapies are **foundational** and should be optimized alongside pharmacologic treatment:

- **Physical therapy**: Improves function and reduces pain [^notfound].
- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Reduces pain and improves coping [^notfound].
- **Acupuncture**: Safe and feasible in dialysis patients [^114R7fog].
- **Exercise**: Regular activity improves pain and quality of life [^notfound].

## Non-opioid pharmacologic options

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Dosing considerations in esrd** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acetaminophen | Mild pain | 650 mg q6h (GFR < 60); 650 mg q8h (GFR < 30) | Avoid > 3 g/day; monitor LFTs [^notfound] |
| Topical NSAIDs | Localized pain | Short-term use only | Risk of AKI, fluid retention, GI bleeding [^1158fgCQ] |
| Gabapentin | Neuropathic pain | 100–300 mg post-dialysis | Adjust dose; monitor for CNS effects [^116V9Gqg] |
| Pregabalin | Neuropathic pain | 25–75 mg post-dialysis | Adjust dose; monitor for CNS effects [^116V9Gqg] |
| Duloxetine | Neuropathic pain | Avoid if GFR < 30 | Increased exposure; use caution [^1158fgCQ] |
| Topical lidocaine | Localized neuropathic pain | No adjustment | Minimal systemic absorption [^notfound] |

---

## Opioid analgesics

Opioids are indicated for **moderate-to-severe pain unresponsive to non-opioid therapy**. Selection and dosing must account for altered pharmacokinetics and active metabolites in ESRD [^115GaDbJ].

---

### Preferred opioids

- **Buprenorphine**: Partial agonist; no renal adjustment; not dialyzed; lower respiratory risk [^116NKYFv].
- **Fentanyl**: Hepatic metabolism; no active metabolites; safe in ESRD [^116uhML9].
- **Methadone**: Hepatic metabolism; no renal adjustment; monitor QTc [^113S4ncv].
- **Hydromorphone**: Use cautiously; reduce dose; monitor for accumulation [^111EfdGe].
- **Oxycodone**: Use cautiously; reduce dose; monitor for accumulation [^111EfdGe].

---

### Opioids to avoid

- **Morphine**: Active metabolites (M3G, M6G) accumulate, causing neurotoxicity [^1133xnWv].
- **Codeine**: Requires renal excretion; neurotoxicity risk [^1133xnWv].
- **Tramadol**: Serotonin syndrome and seizure risk; avoid in ESRD [^111EfdGe].
- **Meperidine**: Neurotoxic metabolites accumulate; avoid in ESRD [^111EfdGe].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

Regular monitoring is **essential** to balance analgesia with safety:

- **Pain and function**: Reassess regularly; prioritize functional outcomes [^114vTRHn].
- **Sedation and respiratory depression**: Monitor closely, especially with opioids [^116dFBej].
- **Drug interactions**: Review medications for CYP interactions and QT prolongation [^113S4ncv].
- **Constipation**: Prophylactic laxatives with opioids [^notfound].
- **Naloxone**: Prescribe for overdose risk, especially with high-dose opioids [^116NKYFv].

---

## Special considerations

- **Dialysis timing**: Coordinate dosing around dialysis sessions to avoid accumulation or underdosing [^116V9Gqg].
- **Calciphylaxis**: Severe pain requires specialist input; consider buprenorphine or fentanyl [^117ECnZU].
- **Palliative care**: Engage early for complex pain or limited prognosis [^notfound].

---

Pain management in ESRD demands a **stepwise, multimodal strategy** that emphasizes nonpharmacologic and non-opioid options, with opioids reserved for refractory pain and selected/dosed with renal considerations. Close monitoring and multidisciplinary coordination are essential to optimize analgesia and minimize harm [^114vTRHn].

### When ESKD complicates the management of pain [^113tBmmN]. Seminars in Dialysis (2020). Medium credibility.

Pain is one of the most common symptoms reported by patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and negatively impacts their health-related quality of life (HRQOL), dialysis adherence, healthcare utilization, and mortality. There are a number of patient-related and health system-related barriers that make it very challenging to treat pain in these patients. Moreover, the limited availability of efficacious and safe nonopiate analgesic options has led to over-use of opioids in this population. We propose a framework for pain assessment and tailored treatment using nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches to optimize pain management and opioid use. Additionally, we recommend system-level changes to improve care coordination and pain management in ESKD patients.

Purpose Of Review

This review evaluates current recommendations for pain management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with a specific focus on evidence for opioid analgesia, including the partial agonist, buprenorphine.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence supports the use of physical activity and other nonpharmacologic therapies, either alone or with pharmacological therapies, for pain management. Nonopioid analgesics, including acetaminophen, topical analgesics, gabapentinoids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and TCA may be considered based on pain cause and type, with careful dose considerations in kidney disease. NSAIDs may be used in CKD and ESKD for short durations with careful monitoring. Opioid use should be minimized and reserved for patients who have failed other therapies. Opioids have been associated with increased adverse events in this population, and thus should be used cautiously after risk/benefit discussion with the patient. Opioids that are safer to use in kidney disease include oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine. Buprenorphine appears to be a promising and safer option due to its partial agonism at the mu opioid receptor.

Summary

Pain is poorly managed in patients with kidney disease. Nonpharmacological and nonopioid analgesics should be first-line approaches for pain management. Opioid use should be minimized with careful monitoring and dose adjustment.

### An approach to pain management in end stage renal disease: considerations for general management and intradialytic symptoms [^115FFPCH]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

The prevalence and severity of symptoms in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease is higher than those of the general population and comparable to those with other chronic and serious medical conditions. Despite the prevalence and severity in this population, symptoms continue to be under-recognized and inadequately managed. The recognition of specific intradialytic pain syndromes such as pain related to arteriovenous access, headaches, muscle cramps or generalized pain by providers may aid in improving patient compliance and quality of life. The approach to pain management in end stage renal disease patients follows that of the general population with specific considerations regarding clearance and potential side effects guiding selection of agents. Overall, evidence is limited regarding the pharmacology of many medications in this population.

### End-stage renal disease: symptom management and advance care planning [^116uhML9]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

The prevalence of end-stage renal disease continues to increase, and dialysis is offered to older and more medically complex patients. Pain is problematic in up to one-half of patients receiving dialysis and may result from renal and nonrenal etiologies. Opioids can be prescribed safely, but the patient's renal function must be considered when selecting a drug and when determining the dosage. Fentanyl and methadone are considered the safest opioids for use in patients with end-stage renal disease. Nonpain symptoms are common and affect quality of life. Phosphate binders, ondansetron, and naltrexone can be helpful for pruritus. Fatigue can be managed with treatment of anemia and optimization of dialysis, but persistent fatigue should prompt screening for depression. Ondansetron, metoclopramide, and haloperidol are effective for uremia-associated nausea. Nondialytic management may be preferable to dialysis initiation in older patients and in those with additional life-limiting illnesses, and may not significantly decrease life expectancy. Delaying dialysis initiation is also an option. Patients with end-stage renal disease should have advance directives, including documentation of situations in which they would no longer want dialysis.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^114JUPfa]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, there is wide variation in the current management of pain in calciphylaxis, amongst renal and palliative care physicians. The rarity of the condition and severity of pain are particularly challenging for non-pain specialists who have a tendency to revert to familiar drugs such as opioids. Moreover, there are no published guidelines or recommendations to support clinicians with decision-making.

### Clinical pharmacology considerations in pain management in patients with advanced kidney failure [^111ZdH3A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pain is common and poorly managed in patients with advanced CKD, likely due to both under and over prescription of appropriate analgesics. Poorly managed pain contributes to patients' poor quality of life and excessive health care use. There is tremendous variability within and between countries in prescribing patterns of analgesics, suggesting that factors other than patient characteristics account for these differences. This article discusses the pharmacologic management of acute and chronic pain in patients with advanced CKD, and the role analgesics, including opioids, play in the overall approach to pain management.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^115CzLht]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Calciphylaxis is a rare condition usually seen in patients with end-stage renal disease. Pain is a hallmark of this condition and can be extremely difficult to control. Anecdotal data suggests that pain management in calciphylaxis is challenging with variable approaches across the United Kingdom (UK) and internationally. A knowledge and practice survey was conducted to establish current practice in the management of pain in patients with calciphylaxis, in the UK. Based on the results and clinical experience the authors suggest a clinical practice guideline.

Methods

An online questionnaire was circulated among physicians (renal and palliative care) involved in the management of pain in calciphylaxis. The questionnaire included a mix of open-ended questions and questions with drop down options.

Results

One hundred and six clinicians responded to the survey of which 60 (57%) respondents were from palliative medicine; the remaining 46 (43%) were from renal medicine. 31 (30%) respondents across both specialties had not encountered any patients with a diagnosis of calciphylaxis (renal-2, palliative care-29). A referral to the palliative care team was undertaken by 18% of renal physicians, 32% referred to the pain team and 50% referred to both. Only 3% of the palliative medicine respondents indicated that they had received a referral from the renal team at the time of diagnosis. Opioids were the preferred initial drug of choice for the management of all types of pain. Paracetamol was universally selected as the preferred first-choice adjuvant agent for management of all types of pain. The importance of advance care planning was highlighted with 72% undertaking advanced care planning discussions often or most of the time.

Conclusion

There was wide variation in the current practice of pain management in patients with calciphylaxis, with variation between renal specialists and palliative care specialists. Referral to specialists in pain management is not universal despite the severe nature of the pain experienced by patients with calciphylaxis. The data generated has facilitated the development of a clinical practice guideline to support complex pain management in a group of patients with multiple comorbidities.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^114jNDUj]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic pain management in CKD — biopsychosocial approach and care challenges: The VA/DoD endorses a biopsychosocial stepped-care model of pain management, where the overarching primary focus is restoration of function important to the patient, rather than reductions in pain scores, and KDIGO suggests that the "choice of management should be based on shared decision making and should be individualized according to comorbid health conditions, existing medications, patient preferences, availability and accessibility, and other relevant factors". Management is challenging because in general populations most biomedical treatments for chronic pain are only modestly beneficial and benefits often do not persist; patients may be reluctant to engage in behavioral or physical treatments due to burden of appointments; pharmacologic options are limited due to concern for toxicity and side effects since many medications undergo renal elimination and there is limited safety data available for the CKD population; PCPs may lack familiarity with dosing and safety in advanced CKD or ESKD, while nephology providers may feel less comfortable with the management of pain; and high pill burden and polypharmacy may lead to (appropriate) reluctance to add medications.

### Analgesia in patients with ESRD: a review of available evidence [^113WXBcF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Moderate to severe pain frequently accompanies chronic diseases in general and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in particular. Several analgesic agents and associated metabolites show altered pharmacokinetics in the presence of reduced glomerular filtration rate. Drug-related side effects may exacerbate symptoms frequently observed in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD; eg, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and constipation) or those often attributed to hemodialysis therapy (eg, orthostatic hypotension and impaired cognition). Persons with advanced CKD and ESRD are at increased risk for adverse effects of analgesic agents because of enhanced drug sensitivity, comorbid conditions, and concurrent medication use. Dose adjustment and avoidance of certain analgesics may be required in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD. We review the available evidence on pharmacokinetics and adverse drug effects of various analgesic agents commonly used in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD. Determining an optimal approach to the control of pain in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD will require additional research.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1177ySTL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive conservative management — Conservative management should be an option in people who choose not to pursue RRT and this should be supported by a comprehensive management program (Not Graded). All CKD programs and care providers should be able to deliver advance care planning for people with a recognized need for end-of-life care, including those people undergoing conservative kidney care (Not Graded). Coordinated end-of-life care should be available to people and families through either primary care or specialist care as local circumstances dictate (Not Graded). The comprehensive conservative management program should include protocols for symptom and pain management, psychological care, spiritual care, and culturally sensitive care for the dying patient and their family (whether at home, in a hospice or a hospital setting), followed by the provision of culturally appropriate bereavement support (Not Graded).

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^115Bz55H]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

An online questionnaire was circulated among renal physicians and palliative medicine physicians in the UK and Ireland to conduct a qualitative survey. The survey was distributed to the palliative care physicians through the Association of Palliative Medicine, the only membership organisation in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The National Registry of Rare Kidney Diseases (RaDaR) distributed the survey to the renal physicians. A reminder was sent out once via both organisations. Questions included a mix of open-ended questions and questions with drop down options (Additional file 1). The questionnaire was formulated to elucidate perceptions and practice in the management all three types of pain in calciphylaxis: background, breakthrough and procedure related pain. In addition, questions were framed to capture practice regarding the type and the route of analgesia used. All free text comments were reviewed by the four authors but given the lack of uniformity they did not contribute any additional value to the survey, so they were not added to the survey (Additional file 2). The data was transferred to a Microsoft excel workbook and analysed. This project was assessed by the Research & Innovation team at the Northern Care Alliance NHS Group, against the relevant guidelines, and did not require an ethical review.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^111EHeVq]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Full-agonist opioids in CKD — The 2022 VA/DoD CPG for the Use of Opioids in the Management of Chronic Pain noted the evidence of ill effects of long-term full agonist opioid use, including opioid use disorder (OUD), overdose, and death, and concurs with CDC guidance that opioids should not be considered routine therapy for chronic pain outside of active cancer, palliative, and end-of-life care. The guideline recommends against the initiation of opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain, particularly in younger patients; in CKD, observational studies associate full-agonist opioid use with kidney failure progression, hospitalization, and mortality. Non-pharmacologic options and optimization of non-opioid analgesics should usually be considered prior to opioid prescribing, although closely monitored opioid therapy may be warranted in select patients after careful consideration of risks and benefits. When initiating opioids, a short duration prescription with reevaluation at 30 days or sooner to assess improvements in pain and functional status and adverse effects, is recommended, and the lowest effective dose of opioids as indicated by patient-specific risks and benefits is recommended.

Recommendations

Clinical practice recommendations for the management of calciphylaxis associated pain

Pain caused by calciphylaxis is nociceptive, neuropathic and inflammatory in nature as it is a result of metastatic microcalcification and tissue necrosis. Choice of analgesia in patients with calciphylaxis is further complicated by ESRD and renal replacement therapy. The authors are not aware of any published guidance on pain management in this group. Therefore, the following guidance extrapolates from first principles and existing literature pertaining to the management of pain in patients with severe and end stage renal impairment but taking into account the unique challenge that calciphylaxis presents in terms of the severity of the pain as described by the physicians surveyed in this paper and the potential for opioid toxicity described by survey respondents as well as the expert opinion of the authors who are palliative medicine physicians (one working in renal palliative care) and renal physicians (one with an expertise in calciphylaxis).

The authors suggest the following pragmatic approach in this population.
Always refer to either the local palliative medicine team and / or pain team when calciphylaxis is suspected. This is because it is often a diagnosis of exclusion and pain control is difficult in this group and needs a specialist approach from the outset because of the additional morbidity associated with the use of inappropriate analgesia.
Tissue viability service/wound care specialist referral is essential and daily serial medical photography with consent is advised.
Ideally admit the patient to a renal unit or to a hospice for symptom control.
Where the patient has capacity, start advance care planning conversations. If the patient does not have capacity and that capacity cannot be enabled, start planning care using the principles of best interests. This is because of the high mortality associated with this condition. It is important to discuss the considerable risk of dying and poor prognosis with the patient and their family.
Consider enrolment in a clinical trial.

### Pain management in older adults [^112mqZbs]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pain is prevalent among older adults but is underrecognized and undertreated. The approach to pain assessment and management in older adults requires an understanding of the physiology of aging, validated assessment tools, and common pain presentations among older adults.

Objective

To identify the overall principles of pain management in older adults with a specific focus on common painful conditions and approaches to pharmacologic treatment.

Methods

We searched PubMed for common pain presentations in older adults with heart failure, end-stage renal disease, dementia, frailty, and cancer. We also reviewed guidelines for pain management. Our review encompassed 2 guidelines, 10 original studies, and 22 review articles published from 2000 to the present. This review does not discuss nonpharmacologic treatments of pain.

Results

Clinical guidelines support the use of opioids in persistent nonmalignant pain. Opioids should be used in patients with moderate or severe pain or pain not otherwise controlled but with careful attention to potential toxic effects and half-life. In addition, clinical practice guidelines recommend use of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with extreme caution and for defined, limited periods.

Conclusion

An understanding of the basics of pain pathophysiology, assessment, pharmacologic management, and a familiarity with common pain presentations will allow clinicians to effectively manage pain for older adults.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^116fYBjp]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

In hemodialysis (HD) patients, the prevalence of chronic pain can be up to 92%. A survey of HD patients found 55% reported a severe pain episode in the previous 24 hours. Furthermore, ~75% of HD patients report inadequate pain management. Despite these shocking statistics there is no universally accepted guideline for the treatment of pain in HD patients. Nevertheless, poorly managed pain in HD patients promulgates psychological disturbances, impaired sleep, decreased dialysis compliance, and an overall decline in quality of life.

Providers may be hesitant to prescribe analgesics to patients on HD due to the significant differences in pharmacokinetics compared with their healthy counterparts. Pharmacokinetic variations of most drugs are generally well studied in "healthy" patients; however, physiochemical attributes in HD patients are fraught with uncertainty.

Due to decreased renal elimination of medications and metabolites, a common assumption in patients with renal disease is that estimated renal function is the main, and sometimes only, factor to consider when making dose adjustments. Although not entirely false, other physiologic changes must be considered when selecting medications and commensurate dosing. Table 1 demonstrates the various changes that occur to absorption, volume of distribution, and elimination that must be accounted for in this patient population.

The dialysis machine itself must also be considered among the many changes that HD patients undergo when selecting pharmacotherapy. Certain characteristics impact the removal of a drug by dialysis, including molecular weight, protein binding, volume of distribution, and water solubility. The least likely drugs to be removed by dialysis are those with large molecular weights that are highly protein bound, that have high volume of distribution, and with poor water solubility. Given the aforementioned complexities of selecting appropriate medications for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the potential for adverse events with inappropriate dosing, it is no wonder why providers are so uncomfortable prescribing analgesic therapy to patients with advanced CKD. Nonpharmacologic approaches should be optimized and used in conjunction with any chronic pain patient. If pharmacotherapy is required for adequate pain management, opioids are frequently thought to be first-line therapy when comparing toxicities to alternatives such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

### Narcotic use for acute postoperative pain management in mohs micrographic surgery patients with end stage renal disease: a review of the literature [^1152yhTt]. Dermatologic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncontrolled acute postoperative pain presents a significant management challenge when opioids are used in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Currently, there is a lack of quality pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data regarding opioid medication use in ESRD patients to optimize safe and effective management.

Objective

To review the published literature on pharmacologic evidence for and against the use of opioid medications for acute postoperative pain following Mohs micrographic surgery in ESRD patients.

Methods

A search of PubMed was conducted to identify articles on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of opioid pain medications in ESRD patients through March 1, 2020.

Results

Seventy-five articles were reviewed. Limited data exist on opioids safe for use in ESRD and are mostly confined to small case series. Studies suggest tramadol and hydromorphone could be considered when indicated. Methadone may be a safe option, but should be reserved for treatment coordinated by a trained pain subspecialist.

Conclusion

Randomized clinical trials are lacking. Studies that are available are not sufficient to perform a quantitative methodologic approach. Evidence supports the judicious use of postoperative opioid medications in ESRD patients at the lowest possible dose to achieve clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^116dFBej]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

There are two basic scenarios a provider will encounter with the treatment of opioids in CKD patients: inheriting the established opioid patient or initiating chronic opioid therapy. Inherited opioid patients should be assessed for risks versus benefits, with an "escape route" in mind if improvement is suboptimal or aberrancy is observed and confirmed.

Due to the risk of respiratory depression and abuse associated with opioids, patients need to be thoroughly evaluated before starting therapy and closely monitored for the duration of treatment. Therapeutic monitoring is complicated by little to no urine output that precludes the ability to perform urine drug monitoring. This should not allow the patient a "free pass" to avoid opioid compliance monitoring. Instead obtaining random serum blood levels should become the standard of care. The Risk Index for Overdose or Serious Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (RIOSORD) could be used to assess patients for opioid-induced respiratory depression and qualify these patients for "take home naloxone".

An obvious barrier for prescribing opioids in this population is the lack of guidance from major pain management organizations, for nearly all aspects of pain management in patients with CKD, which is directly attributable to the lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines. Recommendations published in 2007 by Murtagh et al suggested fentanyl, methadone, and tramadol as opioids to be used in advanced CKD patients managed without dialysis. Although these opioids have favorable pharmacokinetic profiles when used in those with renal dysfunction, they still carry their own heightened risks. Methadone can prolong the QTc interval and increase risk of torsades de pointes; fentanyl has extremely variable absorption characteristics, which lead to variable serum concentrations that are not easily controlled; and both tramadol and methadone are ubiquitously fraught with toxicities and polymorphic variabilities associated with phase I cytochrome metabolism.

### The ethics of end-of-life care for patients with ESRD [^115kUWyB]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with ESRD have extensive and unique palliative care needs, often for years before death. The vast majority of patients, however, dies in acute care facilities without accessing palliative care services. High mortality rates along with a substantial burden of physical, psychosocial, and spiritual symptoms and an increasing prevalence of decisions to withhold and stop dialysis all highlight the importance of integrating palliative care into the comprehensive management of ESRD patients. The focus of renal care would then extend to controlling symptoms, communicating prognosis, establishing goals of care, and determining end-of-life care preferences. Regretfully, training in palliative care for nephrology trainees is inadequate. This article will provide a conceptual framework for renal palliative care and describe opportunities for enhancing palliative care for ESRD patients, including improved chronic pain management and advance care planning and a new model for delivering high-quality palliative care that includes appropriate consultation with specialist palliative care.

Procedure related pain control (during dressing changes and incident volitional breakthrough pain e.g. walking)

Short-acting transmucosal fentanyl preparations have a quick onset and offset of action, which makes them a potentially useful option for dressing changes in patients with calciphylaxis. However, in the UK they are licenced for breakthrough cancer pain and contra-indicated in patients who are opioid naïve. They should be used with caution and with careful patient selection and under the guidance of local pain or palliative medicine teams. An alternative to transmucosal fentanyl, is subcutaneous fentanyl or alfentanil, which have short duration of action. There is a mismatch between the time-action relationship of oral opioids and the time course of breakthrough pain such as that precipitated by dressing changes – the patient may be sleepy for some hours after the procedure.

For dressing changes, use a stepwise approach as follows:
Step1. Short-acting fentanyl preparation (these are available in nasal, sublingual and buccal formulations and it is important to follow the manufacturer's guidance).
Step 2. SC fentanyl or alfentanil (short duration of action).
Step 3. SC opioid and sedation with subcutaneous midazolam.
Step 4. Anaesthesia with propofol and fentanyl under anaesthetic supervision in theatre.

The use of a pain tool to record patient reported outcome measures is recommended. The integrated palliative care outcome scale (IPOS) renal is a useful tool though not validated for use in calciphylaxis.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^1133xnWv]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Avoid morphine, oxycodone, tramadol or codeine as background analgesia as they can rarely be titrated to effect in this population without opioid-induced neurotoxicity. Once pain is stable, transdermal fentanyl or buprenorphine may be used in place of opioids by continuous subcutaneous infusion. If the lesions heal and pain resolves it is important to reduce the opioids step by step and aim to withdraw them fully.

To address the neuropathic element of pain secondary to calciphylaxis, gabapentin 100 mg after each haemodialysis session or pregabalin 25 mg after each haemodialysis session may be used in conjunction with opioids. If the patient is not on haemodialysis, start with a dose of 100 mg of gabapentin on alternate days or 25 mg of pregabalin on alternate days. Caution is needed as gabapentinoids accumulate in ESRD though they are removed by dialysis.

Discuss the use of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with the nephrology team as they are very effective for the management of the inflammatory aspect of pain secondary to calciphylaxis. If residual renal function is not important, use an oral or parenteral NSAID (e.g. ketorolac) by continuous subcutaneous infusion for pain that is not controlled with the measures outlined above. Cover with a proton pump inhibitor is recommended. In general, NSAIDs are best used at the minimally effective dose and for a short duration but their harms are weighed against their opioid sparing effect.

If background pain remains problematic or dose-limiting toxicity is encountered, consider the addition of methadone as a co-analgesic or rotation to methadone from the current opioid. This step may require hospice inpatient care and should only be undertaken with specialist palliative care guidance.

Breakthrough pain control

Even when background pain control is achieved, the patient may continue to experience spontaneous breakthrough pain. Oxycodone 1–2 mg may be used by oral or by subcutaneous injection on a four hourly to 6 hourly basis. In countries where hydromorphone is available, 0.5 mg of hydromorphone sublingually four hourly is useful.

### Palliative care in end-stage renal disease: focus on advance care planning, hospice referral, and bereavement [^113n8A7T]. Seminars in Dialysis (2005). Low credibility.

The components of palliative care in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) include pain and symptom management, advance care planning, psychosocial and spiritual support, and ethical issues in dialysis. End-of-life care is not synonymous with, but rather a subset of palliative care. Advance care planning occurs within the patient-family relationship and is a dynamic process that prepares for death, strengthens interpersonal relationships, and allows a patient to achieve control over his or her life. It is incumbent upon dialysis care providers to include advance care planning in overall care plans for their patients. Factors contributing to the failure of advance care planning in ESRD patients will be discussed, as will hospice and ESRD, and opportunities for bereavement programs.

### Pain management in CKD: a guide for nephrology providers [^111Y2m1v]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Although pain is one of the most commonly experienced symptoms by patients with chronic kidney disease, it is under-recognized, the severity is underestimated, and the treatment is inadequate. Pain management is one of the general primary palliative care competencies for medical providers. This review provides nephrology providers with basic skills for pain management. These skills include recognition of types of pain (nociceptive and neuropathic) syndromes and appropriate history-taking skills. Through this history, providers can identify clinical circumstances in which specialist referral is beneficial, including those who are at high risk for addiction, at risk for adverse effects to medications, and those with complicated care needs such as patients with a limited prognosis. Management of pain begins with the development of a shared treatment plan, identification of appropriate medications, and continual follow-up and assessment of efficacy and adverse effects. Through adequate pain management, providers can positively affect the health of individual patients and the performance of health care systems.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^112NDrMa]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Other anticonvulsants commonly used for neuropathic pain include carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, and topiramate. Carbamazepine, a voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor, is the only anticonvulsant that has a labeled indication for trigeminal neuralgia. The high side effect profile and required laboratory monitoring make it a more burdensome therapeutic option. Carbamazepine is highly protein bound, therefore, little is removed during HD.CYP3A4 is responsible for metabolism to the active metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide. Carbamazepine is also a potent CYP450 inducer; therefore, caution must be exercised for many drug–drug interactions. Concomitant use of valproic acid with carbamazepine can cause a dangerous elevation in the serum 10,11-epoxide levels. Serum elevation of this active metabolite could be missed if only monitoring for plasma levels of the parent drug. Oxcarbazepine the keto-analog of carbamazepine also inhibits sodium channels, can be used as an alternative when carbamazepine is contraindicated, not tolerated, or off label for refractory trigeminal neuralgia. As the keto-analog, oxcarbazepine is a safer option as it does not involve the CYP system and is not metabolized to the 10,11-epoxide. As a result, it does not have as many drug–drug interactions nor require frequent monitoring. Package labeling recommends initiating oxcarbazepine at half the normal starting dose for a CrCl < 30 mL/min; however, there are no specific HD recommendations.

With the high prevalence of pain in CKD patients undergoing HD, providers must not be idle in the care of these patients, with resultant poor pain management outcomes. Undoubtedly, pain management in this population is complicated and requires the assessment of many components including alterations in pharmacokinetics, specific drug properties, comorbid disease states, physical impact of dialysis on the drug administered, and drug–drug interactions. Utilization of drugs metabolized through hepatic phase II metabolism may offer a much safer option; however, clinical trials are lacking. In the absence of evidence-based guidelines, one must use the known pharmacology to design the safest and most efficacious patient-centered treatment plan.

### Opioid management in CKD [^11291DrG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience a high pain and symptom burden. Concurrently, opioid prescription and use in patients with CKD continues to increase, leading to concern for opioid-related risks. Nephrologists increasingly face challenging clinical situations requiring further evaluation and treatment of pain, for which opioid use may be indicated. However, nephrologists are not commonly trained in pain management and may find it difficult to compile the necessary information and tools to effectively assess and treat potentially multidimensional pain. In these situations, they may benefit from using an evidence-based stepwise approach proposed in this article. We address current approaches to opioid use for pain management in CKD and offer a stepwise approach to individualized opioid assessment, focusing on kidney-specific concerns. This includes thorough evaluation of the pain experience, opioid use history, and treatment goals. We subsequently discuss considerations when initiating opioid therapy, strategies to reduce opioid-related risks, and recommended best practices for opioid stewardship in CKD. Using this sequential approach to opioid management, nephrologists can thereby gain a broad overview of key patient considerations, the foundation for understanding implications of opioid use, and a patient-tailored plan for opioid therapy.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^114vTRHn]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Table N-1 — conceptual approach to chronic pain management in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) emphasizes focusing on function, non-pharmacologic options, careful pharmacologic use tailored to kidney function, and selective referral. Opioids are prescribed to patients with CKD/ESKD at rates several-fold higher than the general population (20% CKD, 30% dialysis vs. 4–7% general U.S. Population), and use of opioids engenders its own risks. Focus on function includes to "Emphasize functional outcomes (rather than pain scores) when assessing therapeutic interventions". Address co-occurring conditions by "Treat co-occurring mental health conditions… - pain may improve… " and to "Identify OUD or physiologic opioid dependence and treat with MOUD (e.g., buprenorphine, or referral for methadone)" while encouraging meaningful functional activities. Try non-pharmacologic interventions by "Add psychosocial or behavioral interventions… based on availability and patient preference if self-management strategies are insufficient", and "Consider acupuncture and chiropractic care if available and indicated", with familiarity with local resources. For medications, "Select medications based on risk of nephrotoxicity, side effects, overdose and potential drug interactions", "Adjust dose… using eGFR or using manufacturer's dose guidance", and "Consider starting at lower dose and titrating slowly to mitigate risks"; "Use analgesics judiciously, short-term", "De-prescribe if no benefit is observed in the near-term (e.g., 3 months)", and "Consider patient-directed deprescribing… stabilized (e.g., 9–12 months)". Also "Assess risk of fall and fracture… and use caution when co-prescribing sedating medications". Refer to pain specialists as needed: "Consider referral when there is diagnostic uncertainty… ", "Employ multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary approach… ", and "Offer virtual options… when available".

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^112s2muc]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Calciphylaxis is a rare and life-threatening condition associated with a significant impact on quality of life; pain is a major contributor to this. Due to the rarity and high mortality associated with this condition, randomised control trial evidence on management has been a challenge and there is no uniform strategy for the management of calciphylaxis associated pain.

Our survey demonstrated a wide variation in the management of pain in patients with Calciphylaxis. Notably the choice of medication varied depending on the speciality of the physician, indicating that familiarity with drugs and confidence in their use may be a factor in determining drug choice rather than an approach based on determining the nature of the pain and selecting the best choice of drug. Reported evidence in the literature on the management of pain in calciphylaxis is limited and variable. In a case series of three patients with Calciphylaxis, a cocktail approach of opioids, benzodiazepines and ketamine was used to manage refractory pain. Similarly, a multistep approach including antidepressants, opioids and benzodiazepines was used with the involvement of palliative care in the management of a case of penile calciphylaxis. Neurolytic lumbar sympathetic blockade has been used for the treatment of pain associated with calciphylaxis in ESRD patients. In addition to analgesics, treatments that may improve the underlying lesion itself are also likely to improve pain. To date, there is no approved treatment for calciphylaxis, and management is largely based on case reports and uncontrolled studies, although prospective clinical trials are under way. The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, vitamin K and wound debridement are examples of management strategies that been reported to improve wound healing and therefore may also improve pain.

Paracetamol was the preferred first-choice adjuvant agent for management of all types of pain, more so by renal physicians (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Five out of 75 respondents (6.6%) undertook other procedures such as epidural analgesia and nerve blocks to manage pain. Most of the respondents (83%) felt the presence of infection impacted on the effectiveness of analgesia.

The perceived types of pain experienced by patients with calciphylaxis are illustrated in Fig. 4. The majority of respondents (72%), irrespective of speciality undertook advance care planning discussions often or most of the time. 28% of respondents used a pain scale, the most commonly used tool was the pain analogue scale (0–10) used by nine of the 20 respondents who used a tool (seven renal and two palliative care physicians).

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^114bFZcN]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

One hundred and six physicians responded to the survey, which is around 10% of the total distributed members. Of the total respondents, 60 (57%) were palliative medicine physicians and the remainder 46 (43%) were renal physicians. The respondents were predominantly (77%) working in acute care settings. Thirty percent of the respondents had not encountered any patients with calciphylaxis in the preceding 10 years, whilst 11 (10%) had managed more than 10 patients (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Number of patients with a diagnosis of calciphylaxis managed in past 10 years

The 31 (30%) who had no experience of managing patients with calciphylaxis were excluded from the subsequent analysis. Results presented are from 75 respondents (palliative medicine n = 31 and renal medicine n = 44). For the management of pain in patients with calciphylaxis, 8 (18%) of renal physicians refer to the palliative care team, 14 (32%) refer to the pain team and 22 (50%) refer to both specialties. Palliative care physicians almost universally (97%) described late referral patterns whereby referrals were made when the renal team were struggling to manage pain or when a patient was approaching end of life; only 3% received a referral at the time of diagnosis.

Opioids were the preferred drug of choice to manage pain. Oxycodone was the preferred (first choice) opioid for all types of pain (background, breakthrough and procedure related) with alfentanil and fentanyl being other popular choices (Table 1). Oxycodone was preferred by renal physicians whereas alfentanil and fentanyl were popular with palliative care physicians (Fig. 2). Most of the respondents (94%) report having diagnosed neurocognitive adverse effects when opioid analgesics were used.

Table 1

Fig. 2
Opioid preference based on speciality

Both renal and palliative care physicians reported that modified release oral medications (73%) and continuous subcutaneous infusions of medications (51%) using a syringe driver were their preferred approaches to managing background pain. There was no clear drug preference for the management of breakthrough and procedure related pain with oral analgesia, subcutaneous analgesia or immediate release fentanyl preparations (lozenge, sublingual or nasal) being equally popular.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^113dTXV6]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, older adults with advanced CKD are likely to die from non-renal failure related conditions before they are faced with a decision concerning dialysis. Exceptions to this scenario are patients who lose renal function rapidly and have limited comorbidities. In the US, older adults initiate dialysis early (at eGFR > 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2) and have a high comorbidity burden. Other countries, including Canada and New Zealand, have much lower rates of renal replacement therapy for older adults compared to the US. Although dialysis initiation guidelines emphasize the presence of renal failure symptoms as justification to start dialysis, many older adults start dialysis preemptively, in the face of non-specific, often comorbidity related symptoms. These new dialysis patients are generally not informed about non-dialysis, conservative management options. To remedy this situation, an interdisciplinary team effort by health care providers, should consist of early and repeated discussions with patients and their families regarding a patient's preferences and goals in the context of the potential benefits and harms of dialysis initiation. Conservative management may be a reasonable choice for patients whose primary goal is to maintain their independence and to avoid the time, pain, and discomfort related to dialysis, as well as for patients with poor functional status and a predicted post dialysis initiation projected survival of less than three months. Future studies should examine knowledge, attitudes and decision support interventions that could benefit older adults and their providers when making decisions regarding management of advanced CKD. As well, more data is needed on outcomes of conservative and dialytic management and characteristics of older adults who would benefit from each of these approaches.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^1122vu4s]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Calcaemic uremic arteriolopathy or calciphylaxis is a rare but life-threatening condition usually seen in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The reported incidence in haemodialysis patients is variable and largely reliant on registry data with reported incidences of 0.04% in Germany and 0.35% in the United States. The mortality rate can be as high as 60–80%. It is characterised by the onset of a painful violaceous rash which progresses to ischaemic necrotic ulcers. The lesions are predominantly centrally distributed in areas of high adiposity (e.g. abdomen and thighs).

Pain is a hallmark of this disease and can be extremely difficult to control. Pain resulting from calciphylaxis is classically an acute ischaemic pain resulting from tissue damage as a consequence of arteriolar occlusion causing hypoperfusion, ischaemia and infarction of tissues. As with all acute pain the severity and characteristics of the pain will vary from patient to patient. The acute pain may be a continuous background pain or evoked by movement or procedures. In addition to the background level of pain there may be episodes of unprovoked exacerbations of breakthrough pain. Opioids have been a key component in managing pain.

Current management of calciphylaxis involves a multimodal approach including medical (stopping medications which have been associated with increased risk e.g. calcium-based phosphate binders, vitamin D analogues, vitamin K antagonists, and starting new medication e.g. sodium thiosulphate, cinacalcet, and antibiotics), surgical (e.g. parathyroidectomy, wound debridement, and amputation) and modification of dialysis regimens such as varying dialysate calcium concentrations and increasing dialysis frequency.

Available evidence suggests that pain management in calciphylaxis is unsatisfactory with differing practice across the United Kingdom (UK) and internationally. A knowledge and practice survey was conducted to obtain information on physicians current practice of the management of pain in patients with calciphylaxis in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The aim of the data collection was to describe practice patterns and in light of this data develop a practice guideline for pain management in patients with calciphylaxis. The guidelines described are the first step in developing a rationale for managing complex pain in a group of frail patients with multiple comorbidities.

### End-of-life care preferences and needs: perceptions of patients with chronic kidney disease [^112rnV4W]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Despite high mortality rates, surprisingly little research has been done to study chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients' preferences for end-of-life care. The objective of this study was to evaluate end-of-life care preferences of CKD patients to help identify gaps between current end-of-life care practice and patients' preferences and to help prioritize and guide future innovation in end-of-life care policy.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A total of 584 stage 4 and stage 5 CKD patients were surveyed as they presented to dialysis, transplantation, or predialysis clinics in a Canadian, university-based renal program between January and April 2008.

Results

Participants reported relying on the nephrology staff for extensive end-of- life care needs not currently systematically integrated into their renal care, such as pain and symptom management, advance care planning, and psychosocial and spiritual support. Participants also had poor self-reported knowledge of palliative care options and of their illness trajectory. A total of 61% of patients regretted their decision to start dialysis. More patients wanted to die at home (36.1%) or in an inpatient hospice (28.8%) compared with in a hospital (27.4%). Less than 10% of patients reported having had a discussion about end-of-life care issues with their nephrologist in the past 12 months.

Conclusions

Current end-of-life clinical practices do not meet the needs of patients with advanced CKD.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^111xnHqa]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Atkinson et al thoroughly reviewed literature on commonly used opioids in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) setting and ultimately hypothesized that opioids primarily undergoing hepatic phase II metabolism that yields inactive metabolites (such as tapentadol) are highly protein bound, have larger molecular weights, and have higher lipophilicity (to avoid being dialyzed), should be considered first in this population of patients.

NSAIDs have well-documented renal toxicities that can cause acute kidney injury and influence progression of CKD.–They have been shown to increase sodium retention and edema, cause hyperkalemia through decreased delivery of potassium to the distal tubule, cause acute renal failure through disruption of the renal hemodynamic balance, cause nephrotic syndrome by increasing lymphocyte recruitment and activation, and cause acute and chronic renal papillary necrosis through direct toxicity. Nonrenal toxicities include increased blood pressure, decreased antihypertensive effects of several medications, and increased gastrointestinal (GI) bleed risk.

The totality of these toxicities led the American Society of Nephrology to recommend that all patients with hypertension, heart failure, or CKD of all causes avoid NSAID use, in their "Choosing Wisely" campaign published in 2012. This recommendation should further be extended to patients on dialysis. Residual renal function has proven to be important even after commencement of dialysis, because of its implication on dialysis adequacy.NSAIDs have been shown to negatively impact residual renal function, and dialysis patients are more susceptible to fluid and electrolyte changes, have blood pressures that are more difficult to control, and are at higher risk for GI bleeds; thus dialysis patients may be at an even greater risk of harm from NSAID use than the general population.,

Acetaminophen is most commonly used to alleviate mild pain symptoms such as headaches, toothaches, or backaches. The mechanism in which acetaminophen provides analgesia remains unclear; however, it is thought to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the hypothalamus and possibly the spinal cord, with minimal effects on the kidneys. The majority of data supports its renal safety when used in lower, intermittent doses, and only few cases have reported acute renal toxicity after ingestion of larger doses. Chronic high-dose acetaminophen may cause renal function decline (decrease in glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL/min) and has been reported in women who consumed > 3,000 g of acetaminophen over 11 years and has also been associated with tubular necrosis with long-term use (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.28–3.24).

### Recommendations on palliative care aspects in intensive care medicine [^117CK7yC]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Palliative care aspects in patients with terminal renal diseases (dialysis requirement)

Up to one third of patients who require dialysis during their intensive care stay are dependent on renal substitution procedures at discharge. Increasingly, chronic dialysis patients and patients with End Stage Renal Disease are also receiving acute medical treatment. These patients may be at increased risk of increased mortality, reduced quality of life and less likely to be discharged home.

As an alternative to machine renal replacement therapy, concepts for maximal conservative and palliative therapy have therefore been developed and investigated in recent years.

Due to the high physical symptom burden, palliative care is becoming increasingly important in ESRD patients. The palliative approach is patient- and relative-centered, with a focus on reducing symptom burden and suffering and improving quality of life and well-being. Thus, consensual avoidance of dialysis treatment and discontinuation of dialysis can become alternatives in this phase. Conservative management and symptom relief replace renal substitution procedures in the sense of a change of therapy goal.

Discontinuation should be discussed for patients who have a severely limited life expectancy, low quality of life, refractory pain or progressive deterioration due to an untreatable disease. This should take place in the sense of shared-decision-making in open and empathetic discussions.

At the end of dialysis, symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, dyspnoea, anxiety, pruritus and xerostomia, among others, should be controlled.

### Novel conservative management of chronic kidney disease via dialysis-free interventions [^115maptd]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with progressive uremia, dialysis has traditionally been the dominant treatment paradigm. However, there is increasing interest in conservative and preservative management of kidney function as alternative patient-centered treatment approaches in this population.

Recent Findings

The primary objectives of conservative nondialytic management include optimization of quality of life and treating symptoms of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Dietetic-nutritional therapy can be a cornerstone in the conservative management of CKD by reducing glomerular hyperfiltration, uremic toxin generation, metabolic acidosis, and phosphorus burden. Given the high symptom burden of advanced CKD patients, routine symptom assessment using validated tools should be an integral component of their treatment. As dialysis has variable effects in ameliorating symptoms, palliative care may be needed to manage symptoms such as pain, fatigue/lethargy, anorexia, and anxiety/depression. There are also emerging treatments that utilize intestinal (e.g., diarrhea induction, colonic dialysis, oral sorbents, gut microbiota modulation) and dermatologic pathways (e.g., perspiration reduction) to reduce uremic toxin burden.

Summary

As dialysis may not confer better survival nor improved patient-centered outcomes in certain patients, conservative management is a viable treatment option in the advanced CKD population.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^113dXbe5]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic pain management in CKD — definitions and prevalence: Acute and subacute pain (e.g., < 3 months duration) should be evaluated and treated as clinically indicated and is distinct from chronic primary pain, with more than 90% of people seeking care for chronic pain having chronic primary pain where pain is a disease of its own rather than a symptom of tissue pathology or a physical disorder. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines chronic primary pain as pain that has persisted for longer than 3 months, not better accounted for by another diagnosis, and associated with significant emotional distress and/or interference in activities of daily life and participation in social roles, and chronic primary pain is driven by biopsychosocial etiologies that often do not respond well to treatments that reduce nociceptive signal generation or conduction. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), available research shows patients with any stage of CKD report strikingly higher prevalences of chronic pain than the general population, with pain prevalence estimated at 60%, and co-occurring depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance are more common in advanced CKD and ESKD than in the general population, contributing to dysesthetic experiences; additionally, post-traumatic stress disorder and substance use are common and can both exacerbate pain perception and complicate management.

### Revised dialysis clinical practice guideline promotes more informed decision-making [^113xPdp6]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Over a decade ago, the Renal Physicians Association and the American Society of Nephrology published the clinical practice guideline, Shared Decision-Making in the Appropriate Initiation of and Withdrawal from Dialysis, to assist nephrologists, patients, and families in making decisions to initiate and withdraw dialysis. Since then, researchers have extensively studied dialysis decision-making, and there is a substantial body of new evidence with regard to 1) the poor prognosis of some elderly stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease patients, many of whom are likely to die before initiation of dialysis or for whom dialysis may not provide a survival advantage over medical management without dialysis; 2) the prevalence of cognitive impairment in dialysis patients and the need to periodically assess them for decision-making capacity; 3) the under-recognition and undertreatment of pain and other symptoms in dialysis patients; 4) the underutilization of hospice in dialysis patients; and 5) the distinctly different treatment goals of ESRD patients based on their overall condition and personal preferences. The Renal Physicians Association developed this second edition of the guideline to provide clinicians, patients, and families with 1) the most current evidence about the benefits and burdens of dialysis for patients with diverse conditions; 2) recommendations for quality in decision-making about treatment of patients with acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and ESRD; and 3) practical strategies to help clinicians implement the guideline recommendations.

Data Evaluation and Discussion

Opioids for Cancer Pain

Prior to evaluating best practices for interventional methods of pain relief in the cancer patient it is valuable to review the current evidence for commonly used non-invasive options.

As pain can be moderate to severe in up to 50% of all individuals with cancer, opioids are commonly used in this patient population. The WHO developed a three step "Ladder" for treatment of cancer pain that recommends non-opioid medications first, followed by mild opioids, and lastly by strong opioids until the patient has achieved pain control. Adjuvant medications may be initiated at any step in the treatment process. Methadone has numerous clinical and pharmacological considerations differentiating it from other opioids and is addressed separately below.

Opioid agent selection should be individualized to account for the variance in pain presentations and co-existing medical comorbidities. Morphine and codeine should be avoided in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD); hydromorphone or oxycodone can be used with caution, while methadone and fentanyl appear to be safe to use. Similarly, liver function plays a key role in the activation, transformation, and metabolism of opioid medications. Opioid selection and dosing schedule should be carefully reviewed in patients with liver dysfunction. Methadone, meperidine, and codeine should be avoided in patients with liver dysfunction, while dose adjustments might be required with morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, and tramadol. Certain long-acting opioids with known immunosuppressive properties (ie, morphine, fentanyl, methadone) have been found to have increased incidence of infections compared to those without immunosuppressive properties (ie, oxycodone, oxymorphone, tramadol), and this must be carefully considered given the cancer-induced immunocompromised state in this patient population. Ultimately, the choice of opioid might be limited by the insurance coverage. Codeine, morphine, fentanyl, and methadone are the opioids listed on the WHO essential drug list and might be more accessible compared to some of the newer opioids, such as buprenorphine.

### NSAIDs in CKD: are they safe? [^1137WjKP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of pain in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging for many reasons. These patients have increased susceptibility to adverse drug effects due to altered drug metabolism and excretion, and there are limited safety data for use in this population despite a high pain burden. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been regarded as dangerous for use in patients with CKD because of their risk for nephrotoxicity and thus alternative classes of analgesics, including opioids, have become more commonly used for pain control in this population. Given the well-established risks that opioids and other analgesics pose, further characterization of the risk posed by NSAIDs in patients with CKD is warranted. NSAID use has been associated with acute kidney injury, progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate in CKD, electrolyte derangements, and hypervolemia with worsening of heart failure and hypertension. The risk for these nephrotoxicity syndromes is modified by many comorbid conditions, risk factors, and characteristics of use, and in patients with CKD, the risk differs between levels of glomerular filtration rate. In this review, we offer recommendations for the cautious use of NSAIDs in the CKD population after careful consideration of these risk factors on an individualized basis.

### Opioids for chronic pain management in patients with dialysis-dependent kidney failure [^115GaDbJ]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

Chronic pain is highly prevalent among adults treated with maintenance haemodialysis (HD) and has profound negative effects. Over four decades, research has demonstrated that 50–80% of adult patients treated with HD report having pain. Half of patients with HD-dependent kidney failure (HDKF) have chronic moderate-to-severe pain, which is similar to the burden of pain in patients with cancer. However, pain management in patients with HDKF is often ineffective as most patients report that their pain is inadequately treated. Opioid analgesics are prescribed more frequently for patients receiving HD than for individuals in the general population with chronic pain, and are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and health-care resource use. Furthermore, current opioid prescribing patterns are frequently inconsistent with guideline-recommended care. Evidence for the effectiveness of opioids in pain management in general, and in patients with HDKF specifically, is lacking. Nonetheless, long-term opioid therapy has a role in the treatment of some patients when used selectively, carefully and combined with an ongoing assessment of risks and benefits. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the use of opioid therapy in patients with HDKF and chronic pain, including a discussion of buprenorphine, which has potential as an analgesic option for patients receiving HD owing to its unique pharmacological properties.

### The prepare for kidney care study: prepare for renal dialysis versus responsive management in advanced chronic kidney disease [^112n5Zkj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Defining conservative care

Treatment of kidney failure without dialysis — conservative care — can be divided into three types: comprehensive conservative care, where treatment is chosen or medically advised; choice-restricted conservative care, where resource constraints limit access to KRT; and unrecognized Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD). The first of these, comprehensive conservative care, is most relevant to this review and is defined as 'planned holistic patient-centred care for patients with stage 5 CKD and including a full range of treatment and support, but not dialysis'.

So, if comprehensive conservative care is patient-centred, we must consider what matters to patients approaching the end of their lives. In a European, seven-country, telephone survey of > 9000 people (median age 50 years, interquartile rage 40–62), most prioritized quality of life over survival (from 57% in Italy to 81% in Spain), including those with advanced illness. In this study, only 2–6% of patients in countries said that extending life was most important, and this did not vary according to the respondent's health status. More specifically, a systematic review of the literature by Parker et al. found that while survival does matter to those with advanced life-limiting illness, equally and sometimes more important are: improved quality of life; control of pain and other symptoms; family support; knowing what to expect and having time to prepare; knowing that — if their disease is not curable and is deteriorating — the professionals are comfortable talking about death and dying; and continuity and co-ordination of care.

To help patients make shared decisions as they approach kidney failure, it is therefore important to have data on a wide range of these outcomes — survival, quality of life and symptoms, and more — and tailor the information provided to the priorities of the individual. Comparing experiences on dialysis versus conservative care brings unique challenges, however, and these must be appreciated when providing information to patients. Studies tend to be small, retrospective and observational, with all the associated biases. Particular challenges are biased between the groups compared (where there are unmeasured factors that determine which treatment the patient receives, i.e. confounding by indication), and lead-time bias (where it is hard to identify when dialysis would have been started in patients on a conservative care pathway).

### Pain in chronic kidney disease: a scoping review [^114pyrtG]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

There is increasing international attention in efforts to integrate palliative care principles, including pain and symptom management, into the care of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). The purpose of this scoping review was to determine the extent, range, and nature of research activity around pain in CKD with the goal of (i) identifying gaps in current research knowledge; (ii) guiding future research; and (iii) creating a rich database of literature to serve as a foundation of more detailed reviews in areas where the data are sufficient. This review will specifically address the epidemiology of pain in CKD, analgesic use, pharmacokinetic data of analgesics, and the management of pain in CKD. It will also capture the aspects that pertain to specific pain syndromes in CKD such as peripheral neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, joint pain, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^115heYoE]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that there has been substantial use of opioids and prescription NSAIDs among older patients with CKD in the US with a clear increasing trend until recently, with early suggestion of decreasing use, perhaps due to the recent heightened awareness of the opioid epidemic in the US. Clinicians must continue evaluating benefits and risks of using opioids and NSAIDs in this and other patient populations. Specifically, clear clinical guidelines for chronic pain management among patients aged 65 years and older with CKD may be warranted to address potentially suboptimal pain management in this patient population.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^1111wzBU]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Table 2
Potential advantages and disadvantages of choosing dialysis versus conservative management

For some patients, the goals of starting dialysis may be to obtain relief of renal failure related symptoms and other quality of life issues [Table 2] Dialysis may facilitate treatment of intractable volume overload, improve physical symptoms such as a shortness of breath and decreased appetite, and can facilitate management of elevated potassium [Table 2]. The social interactions with staff and other patients during dialysis may significantly improve a patient's quality of life. On the other hand, these purported benefits of dialysis may be less important than the patient's desire to avoid the pain and discomfort associated with dialysis therapy. Older adults often require repeated painful vascular access procedures and some may die before the access is used. Central venous catheter dialysis access has been suggested as a way to mitigate some of the vascular access related discomfort, especially for patients with high comorbidity and a short predicted survival. Home peritoneal dialysis is another option for some patients whose primary goal is freedom from pain. Other than pain, potential adverse quality of life issues related to the dialysis choice include accelerated functional and cognitive declines as well as post dialysis fatigue and the feeling of being "washed out" after a dialysis treatment. Another relevant consideration is the time commitment required for dialysis. Some patients may be willing to sacrifice several months of longevity to gain more personal freedom, especially when considering that a large segment of their remaining life will be spent on dialysis and with dialysis related complications.

Problem

Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major issue for heath care systems both clinically and financially. There are currently over a million patients worldwide on dialysis, with the number increasing by ~7% yearly, particularly in the elderly, many of whom have significant extra-renal comorbidities and will do poorly on dialysis. Furthermore, dialysis is expensive costing ~£30,000 per patient per year in the UK. Given dialysis may not prolong life and may indeed impair quality of life alternative options for these patients such as conservative care are urgently needed.

### The nephrologist's guide to cannabis and cannabinoids [^111fUVwT]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE

Over 1.5 million people with advanced CKD and about 750 000 people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) live in the United States. One-quarter to one-half of patients with CKD experience chronic symptoms such as pain, nausea, anorexia, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression, several of which are approved indications for medical cannabis. In addition, anxiety, depression, and insomnia are the most common psychiatric conditions that people self-treat with cannabis. Evidence supports the use of cannabis in patient populations without CKD for treating several of these symptoms including chronic pain, nausea, and loss of appetite. The rationale for its use in patients with CKD and ESRD has been previously reviewed by myself and others.

Pain prevalence among patients with CKD and ESRD is as high as 50%. Pain attributed to kidney disease occurs from polycystic kidney disease, renal colic from nephrolithiasis, renal osteodystrophy, or uremic neuropathy. Historically, cannabis has been recommended for a wide range of ailments including as a spasmolytic for cases of renal colic and to facilitate the excretion of small kidney stones.

Over 60% of dialysis patients receive at least one opioid prescription annually and approximately 20% of them take prescription opioids chronically. Both short-term and chronic use of prescription opioids are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cannabis could have a therapeutic role in pain management that deserves clinical consideration and further clinical trial investigation. Access to medical cannabis has been associated with decreased opioid prescriptions and dose reductions. The National Academies concluded that substantial evidence exists for the use of cannabis and cannabinoids to treat chronic pain while meta-analyses and systematic reviews of cannabis use, including prescription cannabinoids, have given mixed results for treating chronic pain.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^111jYsuo]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pain is one of most common symptoms experienced by patients with kidney disease. More than 70% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) report experiencing pain. Pain has been associated with lower quality of life, high symptom burden, and greater risk of developing kidney disease, its progression, and mortality. Thus, management of pain is a vital component of comprehensive care for patients with CKD.

The already high medication burden makes pain management even more complex in patients with CKD. There are no well-established guidelines for pain management specific to those individuals with kidney disease. Special precautions are needed to manage treatment of patients with reduced kidney function, who may be more prone to experiencing drug toxic effects, adverse effects, greater dose adjustment requirements, and drug interactions. Opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly used analgesics. Opioids may have extended half-life in patients with advanced CKD, with substantial effects on the central nervous system, resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, and addiction. Long-term opioid use is a risk factor for opioid abuse and dependence. Use of NSAIDs in patients with CKD may result in nephrotoxicity, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, hypertension, and other complications. Therefore, patients with CKD may be especially at risk of receiving suboptimal pain control and inappropriate use of prescription analgesics.

The opioid epidemic has recently received considerable attention from clinicians, policy makers, and the public. However, to our knowledge, few studies have assessed use of analgesics and outcomes in patients with reduced kidney function, particularly with regard to the long-term effects. The present study sought first to examine trends from 2006 to 2015 in the use of opioids and prescription NSAIDs among older (age ≥ 65 years) patients with CKD in the US, and then to explore factors associated with opioid and NSAID use, as well as outcomes associated with their use, including development of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and death. We hypothesized that prescription analgesic use would be higher in patients with CKD compared with the general population. Furthermore, we postulated that use of prescription NSAIDs would be associated with more rapid kidney disease progression to ESKD and opioid use with both higher mortality and advanced-stage or progressive kidney disease.

Key Points

Question

Is prescription analgesic use higher among Medicare patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared with the general population?

Findings

In this cohort study of more than 6 million Medicare Part D beneficiaries, use of both opioids and prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increased substantially among patients with CKD aged 65 years or older from 2006 to 2015. Patients with CKD used significantly more opioids but less NSAIDs compared with the non-CKD population.

Meaning

Results of this study suggest that optimization of pain management in CKD is warranted.

### Effect of acupuncture intervention on chronic musculoskeletal pain in hemodialysis-dependent kidney failure patients: study protocol for a randomized controlled clinical trial [^114R7fog]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A systematic review revealed a significant prevalence of pain in individuals undergoing hemodialysis (HD), yet this pain often goes unnoticed and is inadequately addressed. Barriers to effective pain management in end-stage kidney disease patients include limited awareness of the issue, insufficient medical education, concerns about potential drug-related side effects, and widespread misconceptions about the inevitability of pain. Pain management in patients with chronic kidney disease is challenging. Non-opioid analgesia is preferred using acetaminophen, topical analgesics, and gabapentin analogues, but does not provide much pain relief. Acupuncture, compared to medication, holds the potential to emerge as a novel, straightforward, safe, and cost-effective treatment option for managing chronic pain associated with kidney disease. It can also slow the progression of renal dysfunction and alleviate patients' symptoms. Recent advancements in understanding the analgesic mechanisms of acupuncture have been significant. A previous study has shed light on the mechanisms of acupuncture's action on inflammatory pain, which can be categorized into two levels: peripheral and central. In the peripheral nervous system, the Purinergic pathway, immune cells and neurons, cannabinoid receptors, nociceptive ion channels, and the endogenous opioid peptide system play crucial roles. In the central nervous system, glial cells, TRPV1, glutamate and its receptors, GABAergic interneurons, and signaling molecules are key components. Extensive research has provided evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for pain management across diverse populations. Additionally, the integration of acupuncture and moxibustion within dialysis centers is viewed as a viable and well-received approach by patients, physicians, and nurses involved in HD treatment. Earlier investigationshave established the feasibility and safety of acupuncture for symptom management in HD patients, showcasing its potential to enhance their health-related quality of life. Nonetheless, these studies have predominantly addressed non-pain-related aspects, and there is a need for more standardized research and clinical evidence in the realm of pain management in HD patients.

### Global access and quality of conservative kidney management [^116jBDjX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Conservative kidney management (CKM) describes supportive care for people living with kidney failure who choose not to receive or are unable to access kidney replacement therapy (KRT). This study captured the global availability of CKM services and funding.

Methods

Data came from the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health survey conducted between June and September 2022. Availability of CKM, infrastructure, guidelines, medications and training were evaluated.

Results

CKM was available in some form in 61% of the 165 responding countries. CKM chosen through shared decision-making was available in 53%. Choice-restricted CKM-for those unable to access KRT-was available in 39%. Infrastructure to provide CKM chosen through shared decision-making was associated with national income level, reported as being "generally available" in most healthcare settings for 71% of high-income countries, 50% of upper-middle-income countries, 33% of lower-middle-income countries and 42% of low-income countries. For choice-restricted CKM, these figures were 29%, 50%, 67% and 58%, respectively. Essential medications for pain and palliative care were available in just over half of the countries, highly dependent upon income setting. Training for caregivers in symptom management in CKM was available in approximately a third of countries.

Conclusions

Most countries report some capacity for CKM. However, there is considerable variability in terms of how CKM is defined, as well as what and how much care is provided. Poor access to CKM perpetuates unmet palliative care needs, and must be addressed, particularly in low-resource settings where death from untreated kidney failure is common.

Conclusions

This survey revealed substantial variation in management approaches to specific symptoms that significantly impact quality of life in people with CKD; insomnia, RLS, cramps, and pain. While some of this variation is explained by differing treatment availability, much of the variation is unjustified by available evidence. Systematic review and summary of the evidence for symptom management, such as that conducted by the recently released International Society of Nephrology Kidney Supportive Care and Conservative Kidney Management Curriculum may help to inform clinicians but ultimately further randomised studies are required to guide treatment.

### Perioperative pharmacologic management of patients with end stage renal disease [^116zVQqV]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of numerous medications used in the perioperative period are altered in patients with end-stage renal disease. Clearance of drugs, or their metabolites, that are normally excreted by the kidney is markedly reduced in ESRD. In addition, patients with ESRD may also have alterations in gastrointestinal absorption, volume of distribution, protein binding, and metabolic clearance of pharmacologic agents. Finally, drug removal may be augmented during dialysis. All of these factors contribute to the need for dose adjustment of medications, including analgesics, anesthetics, neuromuscular blockers, and antimicrobial agents, which may be used in the perioperative management of the ESRD patient.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^116V9Gqg]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Both milnacipran and levomilnacipran, two additional SNRIs, have also shown a prolonged half-life in patients with altered renal function, as 55% of milnacipran and 58% of levomilnacipran are excreted unchanged renally. Both medications are primarily metabolized through conjugation, avoiding the Cytochrome P450 system, and only levomilnacipran yields an active metabolite (N-desethyl levomilnacipran) that is excreted in the urine.

Anticonvulsants play a role in alleviating neuropathic pain largely through the mediation of spontaneous electrical discharge. The two most commonly used are gabapentin and pregabalin, which bind to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, resulting in an increase of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) without direct activity on GABA itself. The gabapentinoids are generally well tolerated with a relatively low side effect profile and few drug–drug interactions. They both are eliminated renally and excreted largely unchanged. Dosing in CKD is reduced based on creatinine clearance to avoid dangerous accumulation. Once a patient with ESRD begins HD, supplemental doses are recommended following each dialysis session as both gabapentin and pregabalin are readily dialyzed.

Nonopioid pharmacological therapy for acute sickle cell disease (SCD) pain — For adults and children presenting with acute pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests a short course (5 to 7 days) of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in addition to opioids for acute pain management (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). NSAIDs are defined broadly to include selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, and patient-specific assessment of harms should guide use and drug/class selection; patients at increased risk of renal toxicity should be identified, and if comorbidities confer significant risk, the mild potential benefit may not outweigh the risk. It is good practice to provide patient-centered education and surveillance related to NSAID toxicity, especially in patients with end-organ comorbidities, given limited long-term safety data and potential vascular, bleeding, and renal risks.

### Recommendations for the care of patients receiving conservative kidney management: focus on management of CKD and symptoms [^111qpKJ1]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conservative kidney management is increasingly accepted as an appropriate treatment option for patients with eGFR category 5 CKD who are unlikely to benefit from dialysis and/or who choose a nondialysis care option. However, there remains great variation in the delivery of their care. As part of the development of a conservative kidney management pathway that is undergoing evaluation, a set of recommendations specific to conservative kidney management for managing the complications of CKD and common symptoms was developed. These recommendations focus on the patient's values and preferences and aim to optimize comfort and quality of life. Explanations for the interventions are provided to support the shared decision-making process between health care professionals, patients, and family members. The recommendations generally emphasize the preservation of function (cognitive, physical, and kidney) and address symptom burden, acknowledging that management priorities can change over time. The recommendations should be used in conjunction with other key elements of conservative kidney management, including clear communication and shared decision making for choosing conservative kidney management, advance care planning, and psychosocial support. Although there are limitations to the existing evidence specific to conservative kidney management, these recommendations are intended as a starting point toward reaching consensus and generating further evidence.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^113S4ncv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Methadone — initiation, dosing principles, and monitoring: Methadone should be initiated and adjusted by, or in consultation with, a practitioner who has the relevant knowledge and expertise; if a provider with clinical experience is not available, then another long-acting opioid may be used until such consultation is obtained. Dose titration should occur after at least 5–7 days on a designated dose (in the large majority of cases), and careful consideration must be given to potential drug interactions and to the potential for QT prolongation. Methadone is considered to be safe in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment but should be used with caution in end-stage disease cases of these conditions. There are a number of methods available that use conversion ratios to initiate or titrate methadone; no single method is considered superior to others, and titration should be based on patient response and not solely based on equianalgesic dosing tables. Monitoring ECG for QTc interval prolongation is recommended based upon certain clinical scenarios.

OPTIMAL MODELS OF CARE

The components of an optimal care model for patients with CKD includes timely referral and evaluation of such patients by a specialized healthcare team, recognition and addressing of CKD-related signs and symptoms promptly, improving access to healthcare systems, optimizing best available therapeutic options and providing supportive care. The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline is significant in pointing out the need for special attention to optimize models of care based on assessment of risk and local contexts/work force capacity. Early referral is most important as when followed by appropriate management it leads to slower progression of CKD, better blood pressure control, higher likelihood of receiving permanent vascular access before KRT, pre-emptive transplantation, fewer healthcare-related costs, shorter hospital stays and lower mortality rates. Physicians should focus more on underrecognized uraemia-related symptoms of CKD which may impact quality of life and exacerbate morbidity, including bone and/or joint pain, restricted mobility, fatigue, poor sleep quality, pruritus, sexual dysfunction and decreased appetite including screening tools for malnutrition. Although nephrologists are at the centre of specialized care for such patients, multidisciplinary care teams consisting of nurses, social workers, pharmacists, nutritional specialists, endocrinology and cardiology specialists, and psychologists have led to superior outcomes.

### Self-management interventions for adult haemodialysis patients: a scoping review of randomized controlled trials [^114rtDp8]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately eight million people, 0.1% of the world's population, are estimated to have kidney failure. Kidney failure, formerly named end-stage kidney disease, means that kidney function has declined so severely that renal replacement therapy is necessary to sustain life. Based on a global median prevalence of 397 per million people, approximately 3.18 million individuals worldwide are estimated to be undergoing chronic dialysis, the most commonly used form of renal replacement therapy. Haemodialysis, the most frequent form of dialysis, is a medical procedure that filters waste, toxins, excess fluids, and electrolytes from the blood by diverting it via a vascular access through a machine with a specialized filter, thereby partially replicating kidney function.

When starting dialysis, patients encounter new challenges, requiring to restructure their daily routines and acquire new skills. During conservative chronic kidney disease treatment without renal replacement therapy, patients must manage a comprehensive therapeutic regimen including diet and fluid restrictions. After transitioning to dialysis, they must manage additional aspects such as vascular access care and strict dialysis schedule adherence to prevent complications. Patients describe haemodialysis as a demanding treatment regimen, typically requiring three or more sessions per week or more, each lasting four to five hours. While essential for survival, this intensive schedule affects patients' daily lives including financial status, social roles and perceived quality of life and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. Patients can experience side effects and symptoms such as fatigue (67–78%), bone and joint pain (70.9%), anxiety (28%) and/or sadness or depressive symptoms (30–49%).

### Rational dosing of gabapentin and pregabalin in chronic kidney disease [^115FPc53]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Gabapentin and pregabalin are commonly used for neuropathic pain in CKD patients but are not fully understood as this population remains excluded from efficacy and safety trials. Renal adjustments for the gabapentinoids are prodigiously recommended in the literature. However, current guidance is based on pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies, but studies confirming efficacy of these dosing strategies are lacking. Considering their widespread use for numerous neuropathic pain conditions, studies evaluating their efficacy at recommended doses in renal impairment should be a priority for future research.

### The case for cautious consumption: NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease [^113gVCqZ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Strong epidemiological and pathologic evidence associates NSAIDs with kidney disease, both acute and chronic. Hence, the usage of NSAIDs has decreased in patients with, or at risk for, chronic kidney disease (CKD). Coupled with this has been a rise in use of opioids and other non-NSAID alternatives, which do come with significant, and underrecognized, risk of nonrenal adverse events. We review the literature to understand if this shift is appropriate or deleterious.

Recent Findings

NSAIDs do have a low but tangible risk in causing acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and increasing blood pressure. However, their role in causing progressive kidney disease is due to long-term usage in high cumulative dosages, and the use of NSAIDs in combination with other agents. Alternatives such as opioids, tramadol, gabapentin and baclofen have weak evidence to support their use and strong evidence to show their harm in patients with CKD.

Summary

Tradeoffs are inherent in using active pharmaceuticals, and NSAIDs are no exception. Balancing potential benefits with possible adverse effects around pain management should be a part of every conversation for patients with kidney disease.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^116NKYFv]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD CKD — opioid selection and buprenorphine use in chronic pain and opioid use disorder (OUD) emphasizes that concomitant use of other sedating medications should be avoided, and that use of opioids whose metabolites are less dependent on kidney function, such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine, is preferred; patients should be provided with overdose education as well as a prescription for naloxone. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist available in several different formulations (e.g., patch, buccal, sublingual), which has a beneficial effect on pain intensity in the general population; due to its partial agonism, it has lower risk for respiratory sedation and overdose, and it is metabolized in the liver, requires no dose adjustment in CKD, and is not dialyzed. In patients with CKD who have an indication for opioid initiation or are already on full agonist opioids, Buprenorphine may provide a safer alternative for pain management, and sublingual (but not buccal or transdermal) buprenorphine is also indicated for the treatment of OUD; the 2022 VA/DoD CPG for the Use of Opioids in the Management of Chronic Pain suggests the use of buprenorphine instead of full agonist opioids due to lower risk of overdose and misuse, and a waiver is no longer required for prescribing any formulation of buprenorphine.

Regarding specific circumstances for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to patients with renal/hepatic impairment, ASCO 2022 guidelines recommend to consider switching to methadone, if not contraindicated, in patients with renal impairment currently treated with an opioid. Titrate opioids primarily eliminated in the urine, such as fentanyl, oxycodone, and hydromorphone, and obtain frequent monitoring for risk or accumulation of the parent drug or active metabolites. Avoid using morphine, meperidine, codeine, and tramadol in these patients, unless there are no alternatives.

### We offer renal replacement therapy to patients who are not benefitted by It [^115gPKZL]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Nephrologists offer renal replacement therapy (RRT) to patients who are unlikely to benefit in part because of our discomfort discussing goals of care in the setting of an uncertain prognosis for a given individual. Permanent neurological impairment, terminal illness (life expectancy < 6 months), medical conditions precluding the safe delivery of dialysis, elderly patients with poor prognosis, and those who begin "early" RRT are categories of patients for whom dialysis may not be beneficial. Successful use of time-limited trials of dialysis may reduce the number of patients who are started on RRT without significant benefit. However, clear achievable milestones and goals need to be incorporated into plans for time-limited trials to ensure that continuing RRT beyond the trial period is appropriate. The lack of information on outcomes and symptom management using a "palliative approach" to dialysis suggests this should not be a clinical option until additional study is done and efficacy data available. Clinical practice guidelines are available to assist nephrologists in the appropriate withholding of RRT.

CKD-specific PROs

Currently, patients living with CKD can be managed with medication, but this will not restore their kidney function. The main goal of CKD management is to slow down the progression to advanced CKD and prevent end-stage kidney disease.

Although patients in CKD advanced stages exhibit a significant burden of symptoms and impaired HRQoL and may require kidney replacement therapy such as hemodialysis or kidney transplantation for survival, those in the initial stages of the disorder are frequently asymptomatic and remain undiagnosed. Screening for CKD in risk populations by determining the estimated glomerular filtration rate and the urine albumin-creatinine ratio is recommended. Assessment of PROs for CKD patients has not been prioritized but could play an important role not only for monitoring a patient's HRQoL but also for providing complementary information regarding symptom prevalence and severity.

Based on a systematic literature review, the ICHOM CKD Working Group selected six PRO domains relevant for CKD: general HRQoL, pain, fatigue, physical function, depression and daily activity. The working group focused mainly on outcomes relevant to patients with very high-risk CKD, but even in this population, patient-reported burden can vary, depending on the intervention. Patients who receive a kidney transplant generally experience fewer and less severe symptoms than patients receiving dialysis and have an improved HRQoL. These symptoms include muscle weakness, fatigue, poor sleep, itching, decreased appetite, depression, dry mouth and poor mobility. In particular, fatigue, pruritus, sleep problems and muscle cramps were found to be associated with reduced work productivity and activity limitation in patients with advanced CKD compared with patients with early CKD. However, many of these symptoms can be mitigated by changes in clinical management which underlines the importance of collecting PROs in CKD in routine clinical care.

As a disease-specific measurement tool, the Kidney Disease Quality of Life 36-item short form survey (KDQOL-36) can be used. Recently, a PRO scale (chronic kidney disease-person-reported outcome, CKD-PRO) has been developed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of CKD patients.

### Opioid management in older adults with chronic kidney disease: a review [^112oAEvE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain, a common comorbidity of chronic kidney disease, is consistently under-recognized and difficult to treat in older adults with nondialysis chronic kidney disease. Given the decreased kidney function associated with aging and chronic kidney disease, these patients are at increased risk for drug accumulation and adverse events. Emerging research has demonstrated the efficacy of opioids in chronic kidney disease patients, but research specifically focusing on older, nondialysis chronic kidney disease patients is scarce. The primary objective of this review is to determine which oral and transdermal opioids are the safest for older, nondialysis chronic kidney disease patients. We discuss the limited existing evidence on opioid prescription in older, nondialysis chronic kidney disease patients and provide recommendations for the management of oral and transdermal opioids in this patient population. Specifically, transdermal buprenorphine, transdermal fentanyl, and oral hydromorphone are the most tolerable opioids in these patients; hydrocodone, oxycodone, and methadone are useful but require careful monitoring; and tramadol, codeine, morphine, and meperidine should be avoided due to risk of accumulation and adverse events. Because older adults with nondialysis chronic kidney disease are at increased risk for adverse events, vigilant monitoring of opioid prescription is critical. Lastly, collaboration among an interprofessional clinical team can ensure safe prescription of opioids in older adults with nondialysis chronic kidney disease.

### Sleepiness, sleeplessness, and pain in end-stage renal disease: distressing symptoms for patients [^114DqEEY]. Seminars in Dialysis (2005). Low credibility.

Symptoms are increasingly recognized as problematic for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated with dialysis. Sleep disorders are common in ESRD patients treated with dialysis and are associated with patients' perceptions of quality of life, assessed by diverse measures, as well as depressive affect. Sleep disorders appear to be equally prevalent in peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients. Treatment for sleep disorders in dialysis patients depends on establishing the diagnosis, often in a sleep laboratory, using polysomnography. Reversing coexistent medical and psychological disorders is important. The sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) can be treated with continuous positive airway pressure in dialysis patients, but conventional hemodialytic techniques have little effect on its severity. In contrast, nocturnal HD and transplantation appear to have important beneficial effects on sleep disordered breathing in ESRD patients. Although pain has been appreciated as a problem for ESRD patients for more than 20 years, few studies exist on this subject. Pain appears to be an underappreciated problem for ESRD patients. More research must be performed on the problem of pain in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

### Recommendations for the screening and management of patients with chronic kidney disease [^117CbiNA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major health problem associated with considerable increase in morbidity and mortality and with decreased quality of life. To slow the progression of kidney failure, to prevent the consequences of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to decrease cardiovascular mortality associated with CKD, it is crucial to detect patients with CKD early and to optimize their care. To assist physicians in patient management, members of a working party for the management of CKD have identified several recommendations for the screening of patients at risk of CKD and for the management of patients with established CKD.

### Patient-centred approaches for the management of unpleasant symptoms in kidney disease [^112LxEE6]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently experience unpleasant symptoms. These can be gastrointestinal (constipation, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), psychological (anxiety and sadness), neurological (lightheadedness, headache and numbness), cardiopulmonary (shortness of breath and oedema), dermatological (pruritus and dry skin), painful (muscle cramps, chest pain and abdominal pain) or involve sexual dysfunction, sleep disorders and fatigue. These symptoms often occur in clusters, with one of them as the lead symptom and others as secondary symptoms. Uraemic toxins (also called uremic toxins) are often considered to be the main cause of CKD-associated symptom burden, but treatment of uraemia by dialysis often fails to resolve them and can engender additional symptoms. Indeed, symptoms can be exacerbated by comorbid conditions, pharmacotherapies, lifestyle and dietary regimens, kidney replacement therapy and ageing. Patients with kidney disease, including those who depend on dialysis or transplantation, should feel actively supported in their symptom management through the identification and targeting of unpleasant symptoms via a tailored palliative care approach. Such an approach may help minimize the burden and consequences of kidney disease, and lead to improved patient outcomes including health-related quality of life and better life participation.

### Analgesic use and associated adverse events in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ELWoL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Treating pain in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging because of altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with an increased risk of toxicity and drug adverse events in this population. The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to assess the prevalence of analgesic use and establish the risk of analgesics-related adverse events, in patients with CKD.

Methods

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL were searched until January 2021. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression were conducted to pool and summarise prevalence data and measures of association between analgesic use and adverse events.

Results

Sixty-two studies relevant to the prevalence of analgesic use and 33 to analgesic-related adverse events were included, combining data on 2.3 and 3 million individuals, respectively. Pooled analyses found that 41% (95% confidence interval, 35–48) of the CKD population regularly use analgesia. The annual period prevalence was estimated at 50% for opioids and 21% for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Overall, 20% and 7% of patients with CKD are on chronic opioid or NSAID therapy, respectively. Opioid use was associated with an increased risk of death (1.61; 95% CI, 1.12–2.31; n = 7, I² = 91%), hospitalisation (1.38; 95% CI, 1.32–1.45; n = 2, I² = 0%), and fractures (1.51; 95% CI, 1.16–1.96; n = 3, I² = 54%).

Conclusion

High levels of analgesic consumption and related serious adverse outcomes were found in patients with CKD. Consideration needs to be given to how these patients are assessed and managed in order to minimise harms and improve outcomes.

Therapeutic dosing targets

Therapeutic dosing targets of both medications have been established in clinical trials for neuropathic pain (gabapentin 1800–3600 mg/day; pregabalin 150–600 mg/day). However, patients with renal impairment were often excluded from these studies.–The aforementioned renal dose adjustments were mainly based on pharmacokinetic studies, some of which were conducted in healthy individuals. To date, no study has evaluated the impact of recommended dosing strategies on clinical efficacy in the management of neuropathic pain for patients with renal dysfunction.

### Opioid and benzodiazepine use in end-stage renal disease: a systematic review [^116fzQej]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Chronic pain and psychiatric disorders are common in dialysis patients, but the extent to which opioids and benzodiazepines are used is unclear. We conducted a systematic review to determine the: (1) prevalence of opioid and benzodiazepine use among dialysis patients; (2) reasons for use; (3) effectiveness of symptom control; and (4) incidence of adverse events.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Two authors reviewed all relevant citations in MEDLINE/EMBASE/CINAHL/BIOSIS Previews/Cochrane and hand-searched bibliographies. Studies after 1990 reporting prevalence estimates for opioid and/or benzodiazepine use in ≥ 50 dialysis patients were included.

Results

We identified 15 studies from 12 countries over 1995 to 2006. Sample size ranged from 75 to 12,782. Prevalence of opioid and benzodiazepine use was variable, ranging from 5 to 36% (95% CI, 4.1 to 45.5%; n = 10) and 8 to 26% (95% CI, 7.1 to 27.3%; n = 9), respectively. Prevalence was positively correlated with years on dialysis. Five studies reported on the same cohorts but gave different prevalence estimates. One study verified medication use through patient interviews. Reasons for use were reported in one study. Effectiveness of pain control varied from 17 to 38%, and 72 to 84% of patients with significant pain had no analgesia (n = 2). No study rigorously examined for adverse events.

Conclusions

The prevalence of opioid and benzodiazepine use in dialysis patients is highly variable between centers. Further information is needed regarding the appropriateness of these prescriptions, adequacy of symptom control, and incidence of adverse effects in this population.

### Single-dose baclofen-induced neurotoxicity in a patient with end stage renal disease: case report [^115j4BES]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Baclofen is a centrally acting GABA B receptor agonist and it is used widely for the treatment of spasticity, persistent hiccups and multiple sclerosis. The renal system is the main route of excretion, thus people with suboptimal renal function are prone to baclofen intoxication. Multiple doses of baclofen have been associated with toxicity, but it is very unusual that single dose can do so.

Case presentation

A 47 year old female patient with end stage renal disease (ESRD) presented with a sudden onset of altered mental status and state of unconsciousness after the ingestion of one tablet of baclofen 25 mg. All other possible causes were ruled out and a diagnosis of baclofen toxicity was considered. The patient showed dramatic improvement after an extra two sessions of hemodialysis.

Conclusions

We highly recommend that more educational efforts are made for health care professionals about the possible risk of baclofen toxicity among kidney-impaired patients. We also recommend avoiding baclofen use if evidence of chronic renal disease is present and to seek other alternatives for pain management.
