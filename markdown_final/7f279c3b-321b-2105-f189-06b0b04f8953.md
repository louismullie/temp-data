## Question

What are the risk factors for developing geographic atrophy in patients with AMD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risk factors for developing geographic atrophy in patients with age-related macular degeneration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing nonmodifiable from modifiable risk factors. Then, I should verify ocular phenotype features that predict GA development. Next, I will examine genetic contributors and reconcile conflicting data. After that, I need to consider disease-stage nuances, including the distinction between incidence and expansion. Finally, I will integrate these into a practical, clinically actionable summary and note uncertainties and exceptions that could change practice as evidence evolves.

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework: GA risk reflects a combination of nonmodifiable factors such as age and genetics, modifiable factors such as smoking and diet, and ocular phenotype features such as drusen characteristics and reticular pseudodrusen. I should double-check that this triad is consistently supported across high-quality sources, which it is in AAO guidance and contemporary reviews, with the caveat that observational associations are not proof of causation and should be interpreted carefully [^0cae35ef] [^0c610005].

> I will now examine nonmodifiable demographic and genetic risks, starting with age, because I need to ensure I'm precise about magnitude. Age is the strongest risk factor, with GA prevalence rising exponentially from about 0.7% at age 70 to 2.9% at 80 and 11.3% at 90 in populations of European ancestry, and meta-analytic data show a roughly fourfold increase per decade after age 50, which aligns with population-based cohorts and guideline summaries [^d59d0ecb] [^d2658a55] [^0cae35ef].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about genetics; I should verify which loci consistently associate with GA development versus those that influence GA expansion once present. Common variants at CFH and ARMS2/HTRA1 are strongly associated with risk of late AMD and GA incidence, whereas ARMS2/HTRA1 also associates with faster GA enlargement, whereas CFH variants generally do not alter expansion rate; this distinction between incidence and expansion is important and repeatedly observed in AREDS2 analyses and synthetic reviews, though I should acknowledge that some genetic data are post hoc and not all findings are uniformly replicated across cohorts [^51ca6415] [^6bbad305] [^fbf68f43].

> Wait, let me verify the heritability figures before I cite them. I initially recalled heritability of late AMD around 46–71%, but I should confirm the exact estimates. Large cohorts and reviews estimate approximately 46% for disease development and up to 71% for disease severity, which supports a substantial genetic contribution to AMD and GA risk, while still noting that routine clinical genetic testing is not currently recommended by AAO pending prospective validation of utility [^74db6c9f] [^bc453ff8].

> Next, I should review modifiable environmental and lifestyle factors, and I need to ensure I separate strong from weak or inconsistent signals. Cigarette smoking is the most consistently identified modifiable risk factor for AMD and GA, with dose–response effects and higher risk with current smoking; pooled analyses and guideline statements converge on this point, and smoking cessation counseling is a key intervention in care plans [^cf7eb268] [^0cae35ef] [^4c3935f7].

> Let me consider diet next, and I should double-check that the protective signal is specific to GA rather than just late AMD broadly. Closer adherence to a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern is associated with lower risk of progression to late AMD, particularly GA, and in some analyses with slower GA enlargement; this is supported in AREDS/AREDS2-era cohorts and summarized in recent reviews, though confounding remains possible in observational designs [^4cd9bb12] [^0c610005].

> I need to check other modifiable factors carefully. Higher BMI and obesity have been associated with increased risk of progression to advanced AMD, including GA, in some cohorts such as AREDS, but the strength and consistency vary across studies; hypertension and cardiovascular disease show associations in some analyses, yet findings are less uniform, so I should present these as probable but not definitive risks pending replication [^579ea420] [^a11ce894] [^0cae35ef].

> Now, I will examine ocular phenotype features that predict GA development, and I should confirm which are most robust. Larger drusen area, soft indistinct drusen, and retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities including depigmentation and hyperpigmentation substantially increase GA risk; the Blue Mountains Eye Study reported markedly elevated odds for soft indistinct drusen and pigmentary changes, and CAPT analyses similarly identified drusen area and pigment abnormalities as strong predictors, reinforcing the primacy of macular phenotype over demographics alone [^30d9b9ff] [^bb8945fe].

> But wait, what if newer imaging biomarkers refine risk beyond color photography; I should review OCT-derived features. Reticular pseudodrusen, also called subretinal drusenoid deposits, are consistently associated with higher risk of progression to GA and faster GA expansion; AREDS2 updated the simplified severity scale to incorporate RPD, reflecting their prognostic value, and expert consensus on multimodal imaging highlights RPD and hyperreflective foci as key risk features for atrophy development [^8bbcaca3] [^c14620ba] [^0c610005].

> I should confirm the role of nascent GA and incomplete RORA on OCT, because these may represent immediate precursors. Nascent GA on OCT is a very strong predictor of imminent GA on color fundus photography, with extremely high hazard ratios in prospective cohorts, whereas incomplete RORA also predicts GA but appears less specific once nGA is accounted for; these OCT biomarkers are promising for early risk stratification and trial enrichment [^15726264] [^ee036f77].

> Hold on, I should verify the distinction between risk for GA incidence versus GA expansion, because conflating these can mislead counseling. Age strongly predicts incident GA but does not consistently predict faster GA enlargement once GA is present, whereas ARMS2/HTRA1 risk alleles influence both incidence and expansion; smoking appears to increase risk at both stages, and Mediterranean diet may slow progression at both stages, underscoring partially distinct but overlapping biology and the need to tailor prognostication to disease phase [^d59d0ecb] [^fbf68f43] [^4cd9bb12].

> I need to ensure I address treatment-related contexts that patients often ask about. In neovascular AMD treated with anti-VEGF therapy, macular atrophy is common and increases over time; while some studies suggest higher atrophy rates with certain agents or dosing regimens, expert reviews conclude that causality is uncertain and that undertreatment of exudation poses a greater threat to vision; thus, anti-VEGF should not be withheld solely due to atrophy risk, though clinicians should monitor for atrophy and discuss risk–benefit explicitly [^4da1fb0e] [^4634dd45] [^0a46483f].

> Let me reconsider any apparent contradictions before concluding. Some cohorts show faster GA progression with certain anti-VEGF regimens, yet natural history data in untreated nAMD also show substantial atrophy incidence, indicating multifactorial drivers; this means I should avoid overattributing atrophy to therapy alone and instead frame it within the broader context of disease biology and individualized risk [^0a46483f] [^4da1fb0e].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical hierarchy for clinicians, while reminding myself not to overstate causality. Nonmodifiable risks include advancing age and genetic susceptibility at CFH and ARMS2/HTRA1, which meaningfully elevate baseline risk; modifiable risks with the strongest evidence include cigarette smoking and adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet; ocular phenotype risks with the strongest predictive value include large drusen area, soft indistinct drusen, RPE depigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and reticular pseudodrusen, with OCT features such as nascent GA offering additional short-term risk stratification; integrating these domains yields the most informative risk profile for counseling and trial consideration [^0cae35ef] [^0c610005] [^8bbcaca3] [^15726264].

---

Geographic atrophy (GA) in AMD is driven by a combination of **non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors**. The strongest non-modifiable risks are **older age** [^d59d0ecb], **Northern European ancestry** [^4c3935f7], and **genetic variants** in CFH, ARMS2/HTRA1, C3, and CFI [^6bbad305] [^fa6a835a]. The most consistent modifiable risk is **cigarette smoking** [^cf7eb268] [^4c3935f7], with additional contributions from hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and a Western diet [^0ee7f891] [^4cd9bb12]. Ocular features such as large soft drusen, reticular pseudodrusen, RPE depigmentation, hyperpigmentation, and GA in the fellow eye also increase risk [^30d9b9ff] [^8bbcaca3] [^8f6c8908]. These factors collectively inform risk stratification and counseling, but **causality should be interpreted cautiously** given the observational nature of most data [^4c3935f7].

## Non-modifiable risk factors

### Age

Prevalence increases exponentially with age, from 0.7% at 70 years to 2.9% at 80 years and 11.3% at 90 years in populations of European ancestry [^d59d0ecb]. Incidence also rises with age, quadrupling per decade after 50 years [^d2658a55].

---

### Genetics

- **Complement pathway**: CFH, C3, CFI, and CFB variants increase GA risk [^6bbad305] [^0caeceac].
- **ARMS2/HTRA1**: Strongly associated with GA incidence and faster expansion [^6bbad305] [^51ca6415].
- **Heritability**: Late AMD heritability is ~71%, indicating substantial genetic influence [^f74e0303].

---

### Race/ethnicity

Northern European ancestry confers higher risk, whereas African ancestry is associated with lower risk [^4c3935f7] [^f07e7aae].

---

## Modifiable risk factors

### Smoking

Current smoking increases GA risk by about 2–3-fold and shows a dose–response relationship with pack-years [^cf7eb268] [^4c3935f7]. Former smoking also carries elevated risk, though lower than current smoking [^cf7eb268].

---

### Cardiovascular risk factors

Hypertension and cardiovascular disease are associated with increased GA risk [^0ee7f891] [^a11ce894]. Obesity, particularly central adiposity, is also linked to higher risk [^579ea420] [^50d0f0cd].

---

### Diet

A Western diet (high in red meat, processed foods, and refined carbohydrates) increases risk, whereas a Mediterranean diet (rich in fish, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats) is protective [^4cd9bb12] [^658530b0].

---

### Alcohol consumption

Moderate alcohol intake may reduce risk, whereas heavy consumption increases risk, particularly in men [^5c4f145e].

---

## Ocular features

| **Ocular feature** | **Association with GA** |
|-|-|
| Large soft drusen | Strongly associated with increased risk [^30d9b9ff] [^78bd5afc] |
| Reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) | Strongly associated with increased risk and faster progression [^8bbcaca3] [^8cc08c52] |
| RPE depigmentation/hyperpigmentation | Strongly associated with increased risk [^30d9b9ff] [^bb8945fe] |
| GA in fellow eye | Increases risk of incident GA and faster progression [^8f6c8908] [^8cc08c52] |
| Baseline GA lesion size/larger area | Associated with faster progression [^51ca6415] [^8cc08c52] |

---

## Summary of key risk factors

- **Non-modifiable**: Age, genetics (CFH, ARMS2/HTRA1, C3, CFI), Northern European ancestry [^d59d0ecb] [^6bbad305] [^4c3935f7].
- **Modifiable**: Smoking, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, Western diet, heavy alcohol use [^cf7eb268] [^0ee7f891] [^4cd9bb12] [^5c4f145e].
- **Ocular**: Large soft drusen, reticular pseudodrusen, RPE depigmentation/hyperpigmentation, GA in fellow eye, larger baseline GA area [^30d9b9ff] [^8bbcaca3] [^8f6c8908] [^8cc08c52].

---

Geographic atrophy in AMD arises from a combination of non-modifiable and modifiable factors, with **age, genetics, and smoking** as the most consistent and impactful risks. Ocular features such as large soft drusen, reticular pseudodrusen, and RPE abnormalities further refine risk, while lifestyle and cardiovascular factors offer opportunities for intervention.

### Development of a risk score for geographic atrophy in complications of the age-related macular degeneration prevention trial [^b3deba4f]. Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a risk score for developing geographic atrophy (GA) involving easily obtainable information among patients with bilateral large drusen.

Design

Cohort study within a multicenter randomized clinical trial.

Participants

We included 1052 participants with ≥ 10 large (> 125 μm) drusen and visual acuity ≥ 20/40 in each eye.

Methods

In the Complications of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Prevention Trial (CAPT), 1 eye of each participant was randomly assigned to laser treatment and the contralateral eye was assigned to observation to evaluate whether laser treatment of drusen could prevent vision loss. Gradings by a reading center were used to identify: CAPT end point GA (total area of GA [> 250 μm] > 1 disc area), GA (> 175 μm) involving the foveal center (CGA), and GA of any size and location (any GA). Established risk factors (age, smoking status, hypertension, Age-related Eye Disease Study simple severity scale score), both with and without a novel risk factor (night vision score), were used in assigning risk points. The risk scores were evaluated for the ability to discriminate and calibrate GA risk.

Main Outcome Measures

Development of end point GA, CGA, and any GA.

Results

Among 942 CAPT participants who completed 5 years of follow-up and did not have any GA at baseline, 6.8% participants developed CAPT end point GA, 9.6% developed CGA, and 34.4% developed any GA. The 5-year incidence of end point GA in 1 or both eyes of a participant increased with the 15-point GA risk score, from 0.6% for < 7 points to 15% for ≥ 12 points. The 5-factor risk score predicted development of GA moderately well with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71–0.81) for end point GA; 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71–0.80) for CGA, and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.65–0.72) for any GA. Prediction from the risk score without the night vision score had lower AUCs (range, 0.67–0.72).

Conclusions

If validated in other patients, the GA risk score will be useful for identifying high-risk patients for clinical trials of prevention of GA and for clinical assessment of GA risk in early AMD patients.

### Risk factors for choroidal neovascularization and geographic atrophy in the complications of age-related macular degeneration prevention trial [^bb8945fe]. Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine risk factors for choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and of geographic atrophy (GA) in eyes with large drusen.

Design

Cohort study within a multicenter, randomized clinical trial of laser treatment for the prevention of vision loss from advanced age-related macular degeneration.

Participants

One thousand fifty-two participants with 10 or more large drusen (≥ 125 microm) and visual acuity of 20/40 or better in each eye.

Methods

At baseline, participants provided a brief medical history. Trained readers evaluated baseline color photographs for drusen characteristics and pigmentary abnormalities. One eye of each participant was assigned to laser treatment and the contralateral eye was assigned to observation. The Complications of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Prevention Trial (CAPT) Reading Center readers identified CNV and endpoint GA from color photographs and fluorescein angiograms obtained during follow-up visits scheduled for 5 or 6 years. Estimates of relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from survival analyses of observed and treated eyes, considered separately and combined.

Main Outcome Measures

Development of CNV and of endpoint GA.

Results

Choroidal neovascularization developed in 141 observed eyes and 141 treated eyes, including 57 patients affected bilaterally. Statistically significant risk factors for CNV in the multivariate model for all eyes were older age (RR, 2.81 [95% CI, 1.33–5.94] for > 79 years vs. 50–59 years), cigarette smoking (RR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.16–3.39] for current vs. never), and focal hyperpigmentation (RR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.22–2.76] for ≥ 250 microm vs. none). Among eyes free of GA at baseline, endpoint GA developed in 61 observed eyes and in 58 treated eyes, including 29 patients affected bilaterally. Statistically significant risk factors for GA in the multivariate model for all eyes were older age (RR, 6.39 [95% CI, 1.64–24.9] for > 79 years vs. 50–59 years), greater retinal area covered by drusen (RR, 5.10 [95% CI, 2.57–10.1] for ≥ 25% vs. < 10%), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) depigmentation (RR, 2.64 [95% CI, 1.26–5.53), and focal hyperpigmentation (RR, 10.4 [95% CI, 4.51–24.0] for ≥ 250 microm vs. none).

Conclusions

Among CAPT participants, increased age and focal hyperpigmentation were risk factors for the development of CNV and for GA. Cigarette smoking was significantly associated with CNV only, whereas retinal area covered by drusen and RPE depigmentation were associated significantly with GA only.

### Consideration of patient phenotypes in geographic atrophy due to age-related macular degeneration [^0c610005]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Geographic atrophy (GA) is a form of advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affecting approximately 1million people in the USA and 5million globally. In this review, retinal imaging techniques used for diagnosis and monitoring progression of GA in AMD, and the risk factors associated with the development and progression of GA are summarised. To familiarise clinicians with common phenotypes of patients with GA, the clinical and imaging features that may lead to rapid progression of GA in various phenotypes are highlighted. With the recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of new GA treatments that reduce lesion growth, understanding the risk of progression to GA and factors contributing to GA growth may aid in patient selection and guide patient-level management and treatment.

### Geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration: a tale of two stages [^e80d42bd]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

A further distinction is important: some forest fires are triggered by a single ignition event, whereas others may arise from multiple ongoing ignitions at different locations, which gradually spread and merge. A similar distinction is relevant in considering the phenomenon of GA expansion, although this difference is not captured in most natural history studies or clinical trials. Geographic atrophy expansion occurs through a combination of contiguous enlargement at the circumference of established lesions and incidence of new lesions. However, the relative contribution of these 2 factors likely differs widely between individuals (and even between different time points of the same eye). At 1 extreme, some eyes with GA may have only 1 incidence event, followed by contiguous enlargement only, such that the GA remains unifocal throughout its life cycle. At the other extreme, other eyes may have multiple incidence events early on and on an ongoing basis, such that the GA is highly multifocal in early years before lesion confluence leads to fewer foci. Importantly, the risk factors and mechanisms underlying each type of expansion may differ partially; the risk factors for ongoing incidence events seem likely to resemble more closely the risk factors for the first incidence event.

The spatiotemporal behavior of these different types will vary and, importantly, the optimum approaches to slowing expansion may vary according to these types. Therefore, models attempting personalized predictions of GA expansion rate (either globally as a mm/year rate or spatially on a pixel-by-pixel basis) should be more accurate if they are trained on data that makes this distinction. Similarly, analysis of risk factors of expansion should be more meaningful if this distinction is considered, such that risk factors are considered separately for contiguous enlargement versus the incidence of additional foci. Most importantly, studying the treatment effect of potential therapies will be more meaningful when this distinction is prespecified in the analyses.

### Clinical risk factors for age-related macular degeneration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^381082bf]. BMC Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among people aged 55 years and older in the U.S and other Western countries. Late stage AMD includes two morphological sub-types: neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy. Population studies indicate that neovascular AMD accounts for two thirds of late AMD cases, and 90% of blindness from AMD. Left untreated, neovascular AMD results in severe visual impairment with an average loss of around 4 lines of visual acuity within 2 years of disease onset. Patients with geographic atrophy also develop visual loss although this tends to be more gradual.

With the introduction of new and effective treatments for neovascular AMD, there is a strong rationale for early identification of persons at highest risk of progression to the late stages as timely treatment given at the onset of neovascular AMD will lead to better visual outcomes. In this regard, a number of major risk factors for AMD have been identified, including genetic (e.g. complement factor H polymorphisms), demographic (e.g. ethnicity), nutritional (e.g. antioxidant vitamins, dietary fats or fish), lifestyle (e.g. smoking), medical (e.g. cardiovascular risk factors), environmental (e.g. sun exposure), and ocular factors. However, the evidence and strength of association remain variable in the literature. Furthermore, a number of these risk factors (e.g. diet and genetic factors) are not easily measured in routine clinical practice. While ocular clinical signs such as drusen and pigmentary irregularities are important markers for progression to late AMD, the skills required for an appropriate retinal evaluation to be performed followed by the interpretation of the severity of the signs to make a meaningful judgement of risk observed are limited to those with retinal specialist knowledge. The impending explosion in immunomodulatory pharmacotherapies which are in currently in early phase clinical trials constitute another important reason for non-specialist clinicians and general ophthalmologists to be able to refer persons at very high risk of development of late AMD. Therefore it was our view that more precise estimates of risk for factors that could be assessed through routine history taking would be of value for appropriate counselling and referral.

### Geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration: a tale of two stages [^d59d0ecb]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Age

Higher age is an established risk factor for GA incidence. Meta-analysis of multiple studies from different countries has shown that the prevalence of GA increases exponentially with age — from 0.7% at 70 years, to 2.9% at 80 years, to 11.3% at 90 years in populations of European ancestry. By contrast, higher age is not a significant risk factor for faster GA expansion. In the AREDS2 cohort of 1616 eyes with GA (without previous neovascular AMD), age was not significantly associated with altered GA expansion rate (in multivariable analyses using the square root transformation). By analogy, conception might take longer, on average, to occur with older parental age; however, once this is attained, the subsequent rate of pregnancy does not vary according to parental age.

This may seem surprising: age represents an accumulation of multiple environmental exposures, other age-related biological changes, and even accumulated genetic and epigenetic changes. Therefore, one might imagine GA tending to progress more quickly with advanced age, perhaps owing to increased tendency to inflammation; decreased reserve in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), choriocapillaris, and photoreceptors; and to multiple other adverse consequences. One possible explanation is that some of these abnormalities may correlate more closely with AMD stage than with age alone. In this way, the degree of macular aging changes might already be captured by age of GA onset, such that age has no additional capacity to predict GA enlargement rate. We might imagine that GA develops when a particular threshold of macular aging changes is reached. This threshold could be similar between individuals; someone who developed GA at 60 years had a faster rate of macular aging changes, whereas someone who developed GA at 90 years had a slower rate of macular aging changes but to the same threshold. In this way, the degree of macular aging changes would be similar at GA onset between the 2 individuals, despite their age difference, and GA enlargement would therefore proceed at a similar rate, irrespective of age.

### Geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration: a tale of two stages [^fbf68f43]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To examine disease progression in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) at 2 distinct stages, progression to geographic atrophy (GA) versus GA expansion, by comparison of the risk and protective factors at each stage.

Design

Perspective.

Subjects

Individuals at risk of GA or with GA.

Main Outcome Measures

Progression to GA and GA expansion rate.

Methods

Critical synthesis of the literature on risk and protective factors, both environmental and genetic, for progression to GA versus GA expansion in AMD.

Results

Comparison of the risk and protective factors demonstrates partially overlapping but partially distinct risk and protective factors for progression to GA versus GA expansion. Some factors are shared (i.e., operating in the same direction at both stages), others are not shared, and others seem to operate in different directions at each stage. Risk variants at ARMS2/HTRA1 increase both risk of progression to GA and GA expansion rate, presumably through the same mechanism. By contrast, risk and protective variants at CFH/CFHR alter risk of GA but not GA expansion rate. A risk variant at C3 increases risk of GA but is associated with slower GA expansion. In environmental factors, cigarette smoking is associated with increased risk of GA and faster GA expansion, whereas increased age is associated with the former but not the latter. The Mediterranean diet is associated with decreased progression at both stages, although the food components with the largest contributions seem to differ between the 2 stages. Some phenotypic features, such as reticular pseudodrusen and hyperreflective foci, are associated with increased progression at both stages.

Conclusions

Analysis of the risk and protective factors for progression to GA and GA expansion demonstrates partially overlapping but partially distinct elements at each stage: some are shared, some are relevant to 1 stage only, and some even seem active in opposite directions at each stage. Aside from ARMS2/HTRA1, the overlap between the genetic risk factors for the 2 stages is minimal. This suggests that the biologic mechanisms differ at least partially between the 2 disease stages. This has implications for therapeutic approaches and suggests that treatment aimed at the underlying disease processes may need to be tailored by stage.

### Age-related macular degeneration: natural history revisited in geographic atrophy [^a6a1d239]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Progression of geographic atrophy varies significantly based on individual and lesion characteristics. Much research has strived to understand prognostic indicators of lesion progression over time, yet integrating findings to date may pose a challenge to clinicians. This review strives to synthesize current knowledge on genetic, behavioral, structural, and functional factors that influence geographic atrophy across the lifetime. Further, it highlights how vision-related quality of life allows for a more holistic appraisal of the impact of geographic atrophy on everyday functioning. The ultimate aim of this paper is to aid clinicians in counseling patients on medical management as well as providing accurate disease prognostication tailored to the individual patient.

### Risk of geographic atrophy in the comparison of age-related macular degeneration treatments trials [^8f6c8908]. Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe risk factors for geographic atrophy (GA) in the Comparison of Age-related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials (CATT).

Design

Cohort within a randomized clinical trial.

Participants

We analyzed 1024 CATT patients with no GA visible on color fundus photographs (CFPs) and/or fluorescein angiograms (FAs) at enrollment.

Methods

Eyes were assigned to ranibizumab (0.5 mg) or bevacizumab (1.25 mg) treatment and to a 2-year monthly or pro re nata (PRN) injection regimen, or monthly injections for 1 year and PRN for 1 year. Demographic, genetic, and baseline ocular characteristics and lesion features of CFP/FA and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were evaluated as risk factors for GA through 2 years of follow-up. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs).

Main Outcome Measures

Development of GA.

Results

By 2 years, GA developed in 187 of 1024 patients (18.3%). Baseline risk factors for GA development included baseline visual acuity (VA) ≤ 20/200 (aHR, 2.65; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43–4.93), retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP; aHR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.16–2.47), GA in the fellow eye (aHR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.40–3.08), and intraretinal fluid at the foveal center (aHR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.34–3.31). Baseline factors associated with lower risk for GA development included blocked fluorescence (aHR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29–0.82), OCT measurements of subretinal fluid thickness of > 25 μ (aHR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.35–0.78), subretinal tissue complex thickness of > 275 compared with ≤ 75 μ (aHR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.19–0.50), and vitreomacular attachment (aHR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31–0.97). Ranibizumab compared with bevacizumab had a higher risk (aHR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.06–1.93), and monthly dosing had a higher risk (aHR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.17–2.16) than PRN dosing. There were no strong associations between development of GA and the presence of risk alleles for CFH, ARMS 2, HTRA1, C3, or TLR3.

Conclusions

Approximately one fifth of CATT patients developed GA within 2 years of treatment. Independent baseline risk factors included poor VA, RAP, foveal intraretinal fluid, monthly dosing, and treatment with ranibizumab. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy may have a role in the development of GA.

### Geographic atrophy in patients with advanced dry age-related macular degeneration: current challenges and future prospects [^fe0356ec]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Atrophy of the RPE with late AMD, whether from the atrophic or neovascular forms, is a highly prevalent cause of severe vision loss worldwide. Precursor ocular characteristics provide some clues as to underlying etiology, and emerging genotypic risk factors and the study of the cell biology of AMD provide others, but in 2015, there are no proven treatments for this condition. A number of pharmacotherapeutic targets are promising, and clinical trials are in various stages of development and execution. Finding new treatments to prevent or delay the development of GA has clear public health import.

The global societal burden of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is huge due to the disabling vision loss that may ensue. A meta-analysis of the global prevalence of any stage of AMD among 129,664 individuals was 8.69% among those aged 45–85 years. Projections of the global prevalence of AMD in 2020 are as high as 196 million. AMD may be classified as early, intermediate, or late based upon features identified by examination or color photographs of the macula. Late AMD, consisting of geographic atrophy (GA) and neovascular AMD forms, had a prevalence of 0.37% rising to 0.5% among European populations. In the Beaver Dam Eye Study, 42% of subjects with GA were legally blind (visual acuity [VA] ≤ 20/200 in the worst eye). Patients with good acuity frequently have severe visual dysfunction from development of scotomas (blind spots) that interfere with visual tasks out of proportion to performance on standard VA testing. Among populations in the USand UK, the proportion of individuals with GA and neovascular AMD is about equal among late AMD patients. While the incidence of neovascular AMD is higher, GA occurs more commonly in individuals over 85 years of age. There is no exclusivity between GA and neovascular AMD, and both forms of the disease may develop in the same eye. The risk factors for development of one form or the other are not readily distinguishable, and the precise mechanisms driving the course of an individual eye toward GA versus neovascular AMD remain to be elucidated. Current thinking is that both late manifestations are initiated by common pathways that culminate in stress and damage to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), Bruch's membrane, and choroid, and can result in either RPE degeneration or choroidal neo-vascularization with subsequent RPE atrophy. With aging, gradual and cumulative damage to the retina occurs through various factors, including oxidative stress, parainflammatory dysregulation, and vascular sclerosis. Impairment of normal physiologic function of the RPE cells, including the constant degradation of lipid-rich outer photoreceptor discs, can lead to formation of intracellular (lipofuscin) and extracellular (drusen) deposition of toxic debris. Interestingly, while use of nutritional supplements significantly slowed the overall development to late AMD among participants in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), this appeared to be primarily observed due to prevention of development of neovascular AMD with no significant effect on incidence of GA.

### The progression of geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration [^9ee27c11]. Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that leads to progressive and irreversible loss of visual function. Geographic atrophy is defined by the presence of sharply demarcated atrophic lesions of the outer retina, resulting from loss of photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and underlying choriocapillaris. These lesions typically appear first in the perifoveal macula, initially sparing the foveal center, and over time often expand and coalesce to include the fovea. Although the kinetics of GA progression are highly variable among individual patients, a growing body of evidence suggests that specific characteristics may be important in predicting disease progression and outcomes. This review synthesizes current understanding of GA progression in AMD and the factors known or postulated to be relevant to GA lesion enlargement, including both affected and fellow eye characteristics. In addition, the roles of genetic, environmental, and demographic factors in GA lesion enlargement are discussed. Overall, GA progression rates reported in the literature for total study populations range from 0.53 to 2.6 mm²/year (median, ∼1.78 mm²/year), assessed primarily by color fundus photography or fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging. Several factors that could inform an individual's disease prognosis have been replicated in multiple cohorts: baseline lesion size, lesion location, multifocality, FAF patterns, and fellow eye status. Because best-corrected visual acuity does not correspond directly to GA lesion enlargement due to possible foveal sparing, alternative assessments are being explored to capture the relationship between anatomic progression and visual function decline, including microperimetry, low-luminance visual acuity, reading speed assessments, and patient-reported outcomes. Understanding GA progression and its individual variability is critical in the design of clinical studies, in the interpretation and application of clinical trial results, and for counseling patients on how disease progression may affect their individual prognosis.

### Consideration of patient phenotypes in geographic atrophy due to age-related macular degeneration [^d2658a55]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Geographic atrophy (GA) is a progressive form of advanced non-neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in older individuals, characterised by permanent loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, photoreceptors and choriocapillaris.GA affects approximately 1 million people in the USA and 5 million globally. The incidence of GA increases exponentially with age, and from 50 years of age, the prevalence of GA quadruples per decade increase in age.GA accounts for approximately 20% of blindness cases in North America and was implicated in 26% of certificates for severe sight impairment or blindness in a UK-based database between April 2007 and March 2008. The negative impact of GA on the quality of life of older individuals has been well documented as it interferes with daily activities such as reading, writing and facial recognition.GA also impairs mobility and the ability to drive, which results in a loss of independence. The effect of GA on patients' eligibility to drive was evaluated in a retrospective cohort study in which 67% of patients who were eligible to drive at baseline became ineligible to drive within a median of 1.6 years based on visual acuity.

Understanding the risk factors for GA development from intermediate AMD as well as for GA growth is vital for providing patients accurate prognoses, directing treatment and designing clinical trials. The natural history growth rate reported for GA lesions in the literature is variable and depends on the imaging modality used to diagnose and monitor GA as well as baseline GA characteristics such as location of GA (subfoveal or non-subfoveal), focality (unifocal or multifocal) and size. The GA growth rate in the sham arms of the phase III OAKS and DERBY studies (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT03525613 and NCT03525600, respectively) was approximately 2 mm²/year across a heterogeneous group of non-subfoveal and subfoveal GA lesions that met study inclusion criteria.GA lesions typically grow around the fovea and produce visual impairment symptoms, with permanent reduction of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) once the centre of the fovea region is affected. In the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) evaluation of patients progressing to central GA, the mean visual acuity was 63.6 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters at the visit prior to diagnosis of central GA; this decreased by 3.7 letters when central GA was initially documented, and further decreased by 21.7 letters (mean: 41.9 letters) 5 years later.

Literature review search strategies in PubMed

For this review, PubMed searches were performed between 13 and 21 July 2023 to identify key characteristics (eg, risk factors for rapid lesion growth, imaging approaches, GA location) of the selected patient phenotypes. No date limitation was added, and the following search terms were used: "geographic atrophy" in combination with "risk factors", "OCT", "optical coherence tomography", "fundus autofluorescence", "imaging", "growth rate" and "progression". Primary research articles were referred to whenever possible. Additional articles were identified from the bibliographies of the articles identified in the PubMed searches. Only English-language articles were included, and case reports and case series were excluded.

### Clinical risk factors for age-related macular degeneration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ef74af11]. BMC Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

Selection of Risk factors

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of a selection of risk factors for late AMD (neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy). Initially, we scrutinized in detail the literature on late AMD to identify all possible risk factors. The initial search yielded 73 possible risk factors (Table 1). Following review by an expert panel (UC, AF, PM, TYW), 16 factors that were considered to be readily measured in nonspecialist settings were selected for the full systematic review. We did not address ocular or genetic risk factors as these require either specialist skills to conduct the retinal examination or access to laboratory resources and genetic expertise. We also excluded nutrition as an estimation of the nutrition status through dietary questionnaires is also a specialised field.

### The pathophysiology of geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration and the complement pathway as a therapeutic target [^924b5da3]. Retina (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced, vision-threatening form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affecting approximately five million individuals worldwide. To date, there are no approved therapeutics for GA treatment; however, several are in clinical trials. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of GA, particularly the role of complement cascade dysregulation and emerging therapies targeting the complement cascade.

Methods

Primary literature search on PubMed for GA, complement cascade in age-related macular degeneration. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for natural history studies in GA and clinical trials of drugs targeting the complement cascade for GA.

Results

Cumulative damage to the retina by aging, environmental stress, and other factors triggers inflammation via multiple pathways, including the complement cascade. When regulatory components in these pathways are compromised, as with several GA-linked genetic risk factors in the complement cascade, chronic inflammation can ultimately lead to the retinal cell death characteristic of GA. Complement inhibition has been identified as a key candidate for therapeutic intervention, and drugs targeting the complement pathway are currently in clinical trials.

Conclusion

The complement cascade is a strategic target for GA therapy. Further research, including on natural history and genetics, is crucial to expand the understanding of GA pathophysiology and identify effective therapeutic targets.

### Clinical risk factors for age-related macular degeneration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a165bbbd]. BMC Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Studies and Participants

Prospective cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies, were included if they incorporated an estimate of association [odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR)] between late AMD and at least one of the 16 risk factors. Non-English language articles were not included because, after a preliminary assessment, we did not identify any that fitted our inclusion criteria. Abstracts and unpublished studies were also not included.

For articles that passed initial screen, additional criteria were applied for inclusion in the meta-analysis: 1) estimates for association with neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy were excluded when concomitantly presented as late AMD to avoid double counting; 2) for three epidemiological studies that examined the risk of late AMD (i.e. Beaver Dam, Blue Mountains, and Rotterdam) both the original estimates and pooled estimates of the three studies exist. Therefore, to avoid double counting of these studies, only the pooled estimate was retained. We did not include studies that reported only the unadjusted results (i.e. crude ORs). All studies included adjusted for age; when studies reported more than one adjusted estimate, the multivariate adjusted estimate was selected (i.e. if a study reported either age adjusted or age, gender and smoking adjusted results, the latter was chosen).

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was late AMD, or each type of late AMD if the overall results for late AMD were not presented.

### Five-year incidence, progression, and risk factors for age-related macular degeneration: the age, gene / environment susceptibility study [^272e5478]. Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the incidence and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and associated risk factors.

Design

Population-based, prospective, cohort study.

Participants

We included 2868 participants from the Age Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study with retinal data at baseline and 5-year follow-up.

Methods

Digital macular photographs were graded for presence of AMD. Participants completed a questionnaire and extensive clinical battery. Biomarkers were assessed. Risk factors for AMD were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs.

Main Outcome Measures

We assessed AMD, defined as early or late.

Results

Among 2196 participants free of AMD at baseline, 14.9% developed incident AMD. In multivariate models, incident AMD was significantly associated with age (OR per year, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.11–1.17), current smoking (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.38–3.11), former smoking (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.04–1.79), plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level (OR, 1.62 per mmol/L; 95% CI, 1.19–2.22), and body mass index (BMI; OR, 1.04 per kg/m(2); 95% CI, 1.01–1.07). Among 563 participants with early AMD at baseline, 22.7% progressed to late AMD (11.0% pure geographic atrophy [GA] and 11.7% exudative AMD). On multivariate analyses, age was significantly associated with progression to GA (OR 1.14; 95% CI, 1.07–1.21) and exudative AMD (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.14). Adjusting for age, female sex was associated with exudative AMD (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.10–3.98) and plasma HDL cholesterol with GA (OR, 2.03 per mmol/L; 95% CI, 1.02–4.05).

Conclusions

By age 85, 57.4% of participants had signs of AMD. Age, smoking, plasma HDL cholesterol, BMI, and female sex are associated with AMD. Elevated HDL cholesterol is associated with GA development.

### Emerging treatment options for geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration [^d233c9a9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial, degenerative disease associated with progressive vision loss, and is more common in developed nations but is prevalent in all countries. AMD is categorized into two major subtypes: non-neovascular (dry or non-exudative) and neovascular (wet or exudative; nAMD) form. Macular neovascularization (MNV) in the retina or choroid is a characteristic of nAMD with associated acute vision loss. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment has proven efficacious in nAMD patients as it targets neovascularization and treats associated intra- (IRF) and subretinal fluid (SRF). If untreated, MNV can induce leakage of fluid, lipids, and blood into the outer retina, resulting in irreversible vision loss.

Dry AMD can progress to an advanced degenerative stage manifesting as geographic atrophy (GA), characterized by irreversible vision loss due to loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors and choriocapillaris in the macula. Visual acuity can remain intact with spared foveal involvement in some GA patients. Enlargement of GA is associated with furthering disease progression, ultimately leading to irreversible vision morbidity. Nonmodifiable risk factors, including genetics and age, and modifiable risk factors such as smoking status, and comorbidities such as hypertension, are inherently associated with GA progression. Studies have indicated ocular benefits and delayed disease progression in conjunction with a healthy lifestyle.

Currently, there are no therapeutics approved for GA; however, numerous clinical trials are underway investigating potential therapeutics for reduction in GA lesion growth. In this review, we focus on the pathophysiology of GA, as well as current investigational therapeutics for the disease.

### Geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration: a tale of two stages [^9ee1a20c]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

"I tell thee", said madame…, "that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it is always advancing".

In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the development of geographic atrophy (GA) differs partially but fundamentally from its subsequent expansion: in its time-course, its risk factors, and its underlying mechanisms. Across the life cycle of GA, its conception and gestation differ in notable ways from its infancy and adulthood. Its birth is over 50 years in the making, whereas its expansion across the macula is typically accomplished in less than a decade; the interval from incidence of noncentral GA to central involvement is typically around 3 years.

"It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning", said Defarge. "How long", demanded madame, composedly, "does it take to make and store the lightning? Tell me".

Similarities and differences between GA incidence and GA expansion can be evaluated by comparison of genetic and environmental risk factors between the 2 stages (Table 1). This has important implications not only for potential differences in the underlying biological mechanisms but also for whether partially distinct therapeutic approaches may therefore be required at each stage.

Table 1
Partially Distinct and Partially Overlapping Risk and Protective Factors for Progression to GA (Incidence) Versus Progression of GA (Expansion)

Metaphors from other fields may be helpful: in a forest fire, factors that increase the risk of the first ignition may have some similarities but important differences from those that lead to faster spread of the fire at its leading edges. Related to this, the mechanisms responsible for the first ignition may be quite different from those responsible for subsequent spread. Importantly, therefore, different fire-fighting approaches may be required at each stage. Similarly, in large-scale uprisings like the French Revolution, factors that increase the risk of isolated insurrection may have some similarities but important differences from those that make insurrection spread more quickly. Again, therefore, partially distinct approaches may be effective in addressing uprising at each stage.

Risk factors for the development of GA de novo and GA progression findings from imaging studies

Development refers to the formation of new GA lesions while progression refers to the growth of pre-existing GA. Although some risk factors differ, several are shared for both development and progression of GA(table 2).

Table 2
Risk factors for the development and progression of GA

GA lesion growth is faster in patients who have intermediate-sized or large GA lesions, multifocal or irregularly shaped GA lesions (as opposed to circular, potentially due to their larger perimeter), non-centrally located GA, GA in the fellow eye and specific genetic factors. On FAF, eyes showing banded and diffuse, especially diffuse trickling, hyperautofluorescent patterns have faster GA progression than eyes without these patterns.RPD is a risk factor for both development and progression of GA and associated with faster GA growth and faster progression towards the central macula. Although RPD was more common in individuals with ARMS2/HTRA1 risk alleles in the AREDS2 study, the presence of RPD conferred increased risk of GA progression, independent of ARMS2/HTRA1 status. From the AREDS natural history data, the decline rate of the central residual effective radius was approximately 53% higher in patients with GA who had advanced AMD (central GA or nAMD) in their fellow eye versus those with GA without AMD in the fellow eye. Several studies demonstrated that greater GA area correlated with faster lesion progression; others found that when a square-root transformation was applied, this no longer held true. In a recent meta-analysis, however, baseline lesion area correlated with lesion growth rate regardless of whether square-root transformation was applied. Analysis of 47 eyes of 36 patients in a prospective non-interventional natural history study showed faster progression of GA towards the periphery than towards the fovea.

### Risk of age-related macular degeneration in eyes with macular drusen or hyperpigmentation… [^78bd5afc]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

This finding has also been confirmed in recent population-based cohort studies of older persons. 8–10 Eyes with indistinct soft macular drusen or retinal pigmentary abnormalities were shown in the Beaver Dam Eye Study to have a substantially higher 5-year risk of incident AMD than eyes without these lesions. 8, 9 Increasing drusen size, area of involvement, and the presence of indistinct soft drusen progressively increased the risk of AMD. 8 Larger drusen area and the presence of retinal pigmentary changes predicted 2-year incident AMD in the Rotterdam Study.
10. This report from the Blue Mountains Eye Study aims to extend findings provided in these 2 studies by quantifying 5-year AMD risk from a range of baseline macular drusen characteristics and hyperpigmentation, independent of known risk factors, such as age, sex, and smoking status. These data complement our data on the 5-year incidence of ARM lesions in the Blue Mountains population.
11.

Geographic atrophy was defined as a discrete area, at least 175 µm in diameter, of retinal depigmentation characterized by a sharp border and the presence of visible choroidal vessels. In this report, cases with signs of neovascular AMD and widespread geographic atrophy were classified as positive for both subtypes. All participants with AMD lesions at either examination were adjudicated by a retinal subspecialist, and, for the present report, eye-specific data were analyzed. Incident neovascular AMD was defined as the appearance at follow-up of any signs of neovascular AMD7 in eyes at baseline without these signs and without geographic atrophy involving the foveal center. Incident geographic atrophy was defined as the appearance at follow-up of at least one geographic atrophy area 175 µm or greater in diameter at the macula in eyes in which neither AMD lesion was present at baseline. 1500 µm radius of the foveal center, area involved by large drusen equal to at least one half that of the optic disc, and presence of retinal hyperpigmentation. Using a modified AREDS classification, 15 eyes classified as having category 3 or 4 ARM at baseline were 3. 9 times more likely to develop AMD lesions during the 5-year period, compared with eyes classified as having category 1 or 2 ARM.

### Humanistic and economic burden of geographic atrophy: a systematic literature review [^94225752]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Geographic atrophy (GA) is generally defined as the advanced or late stage of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with a circular area of atrophy of 175 μm or more. However, minimum sizes to define atrophic patches vary. In contrast to neovascular AMD, which is characterized by acute vision loss, GA is a progressive disease that can lead to irreversible blindness over time.GA interferes with daily activities such as driving, reading, writing, and recognizing faces, and in turn, negatively affects quality of life, potentially impairing mobility and independence. The incidence of GA is not well understood, as it is likely underdiagnosed and underreported. A meta-analysis of US populations of white European ancestry reported incidence rates of 1.9 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–2.8) for adults aged 50–97 years and 4.3 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 2.9–6.2) for adults aged ≥ 65 years. An estimated 12–20% of patients with GA have severe vision loss, potentially requiring caregiver help with transportation and activities of daily living.

Several nonmodifiable and modifiable risk factors are associated with development of GA and risk of disease progression. A number of genetic polymorphisms of the complement components and its regulators have been shown to be risk factors for developing AMD. Age and family history are significant risk factors for developing GA; cigarette smoking, diet pattern, physical activity level, and health conditions including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and other ophthalmic comorbidities (eg, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma) also have been reported to correlate with GA onset. No effective treatments are indicated to prevent or slow the progression of GA; consequently, it has a poor prognosis. Currently, the only potential approach to preventing GA is avoiding modifiable risk factors such as smoking and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

To describe the burden of illness of GA and identify evidence gaps in the literature, we conducted a systematic literature review focusing on the humanistic and economic burden of disease and health-care resource use. The clinical burden of GA was also evaluated in this review but is not reported here.

### Age-related macular degeneration [^ace71607]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration is a major cause of blindness worldwide. With ageing populations in many countries, more than 20% might have the disorder. Advanced age-related macular degeneration, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet) and geographic atrophy (late dry), is associated with substantial, progressive visual impairment. Major risk factors include cigarette smoking, nutritional factors, cardiovascular diseases, and genetic markers, including genes regulating complement, lipid, angiogenic, and extracellular matrix pathways. Some studies have suggested a declining prevalence of age-related macular degeneration, perhaps due to reduced exposure to modifiable risk factors. Accurate diagnosis combines clinical examination and investigations, including retinal photography, angiography, and optical coherence tomography. Dietary anti-oxidant supplementation slows progression of the disease. Treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration incorporates intraocular injections of anti-VEGF agents, occasionally combined with other modalities. Evidence suggests that two commonly used anti-VEGF therapies, ranibizumab and bevacizumab, have similar efficacy, but possible differences in systemic safety are difficult to assess. Future treatments include inhibition of other angiogenic factors, and regenerative and topical therapies.

### Validation of a prediction algorithm for progression to advanced macular degeneration subtypes [^e9973a0e]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Risk score models predicting the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to its advanced forms may be useful for targeting high-risk individuals for lifestyle changes that reduce risk for AMD progression, helping with differential diagnosis of AMD and its subtypes, identifying high-risk subjects for participation in clinical trials, and selecting appropriate therapies.

Objective

To develop and validate a predictive model for progression to advanced stages of AMD in 2 independent cohorts. DESIGN Participants in a validation cohort and an independent derivation population were classified into 5 stages of AMD based on ocular examination and fundus photographs at baseline. Progression was defined as either eye progressing from stage 1, 2, or 3 to either stage 4 or stage 5 at any follow-up visit to the end of the study. Cox proportional hazards models were used for progression analyses. Covariates included demographic and environmental factors, 6 variants in 5 genes, and baseline AMD grades in both eyes. The algorithm developed with the derivation sample was assessed for calibration and discrimination in the validation data set.

Setting

Clinic populations and referrals.

Participants

The derivation population comprised 2914 subjects with 809 progressors. The independent validation cohort comprised 980 individuals with no, early, or intermediate AMD in at least one eye at baseline, of whom 294 progressed to advanced stages of geographic atrophy or neovascular disease.

Main Outcome Measure

Progression to advanced AMD. RESULTS For the model with all nongenetic and genetic factors, the respective C statistics for progression to advanced AMD in the derivation and validation samples were 0.858 and 0.750 at 5 years and 0.884 and 0.809 at 10 years, and models also discriminated risk for progression to geographic atrophy and neovascular disease separately. For unilateral or bilateral intermediate AMD, 5-year cumulative incidence rates of progression to advanced AMD were 10% with the low-risk score and 50% with the high-risk score; for unilateral advanced disease, the progression rates were 22% and 80% for the fellow eye.

Conclusions and Relevance

The risk prediction model was validated in an independent study of progression from no, early, or intermediate stages to advanced subtypes of AMD and will be useful for research, clinical trials, and personalized medicine.

### Progression of geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration: AREDS2 report number 16 [^51ca6415]. Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To analyze the prevalence, incidence, and clinical characteristics of eyes with geographic atrophy (GA) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), including clinical and genetic factors affecting enlargement.

Design

Prospective cohort study within a controlled clinical trial.

Participants

Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) participants, aged 50–85 years.

Methods

Baseline and annual stereoscopic color fundus photographs were evaluated for GA presence and area. Analyses included GA prevalence and incidence rates, Kaplan-Meier rates, mixed-model regression, and multivariable analysis of the square root of GA, area adjusted for covariates, including clinical/imaging characteristics and genotype.

Main Outcome Measures

(1) Presence or development of GA; (2) change in the square root of GA area over time.

Results

At baseline, 517 eyes (6.2%) of 411 participants (9.8%) had pre-existing GA (without neovascular AMD), with the following characteristics: 33% central, 67% noncentral; and the following configurations: 36% small, 26% solid/unifocal, 24% multifocal, 9% horseshoe/ring, and 6% indeterminate. Of the remaining 6530 eyes at risk, 1099 eyes (17.3%) of 883 participants developed incident GA without prior neovascular disease during mean follow-up of 4.4 years. The Kaplan-Meier rate of incident GA was 19% of eyes at 5 years. In eyes with incident GA, 4-year risk of subsequent neovascular AMD was 29%. In eyes with incident noncentral GA, 4-year risk of central involvement was 57%. GA enlargement rate (following square root transformation) was similar in eyes with pre-existing GA (0.29 mm/year; 95% confidence interval 0.27–0.30) and incident GA (0.28 mm/year; 0.27–0.30). In the combined group, GA enlargement was significantly faster with noncentrality, multifocality, intermediate baseline size, and bilateral GA (P < 0.0001 for interaction in each case) but not with AREDS2 treatment assignment (P = 0.33) or smoking status (P = 0.05). Enlargement was significantly faster with ARMS2 risk (P < 0.0001), C3 non-risk (P = 0.0002), and APOE non-risk (P = 0.001) genotypes.

Conclusions

Analyses of AREDS2 data on natural history of GA provide representative data on GA evolution and enlargement. GA enlargement, which was influenced by lesion features, was relentless, resulting in rapid central vision loss. The genetic variants associated with faster enlargement were partially distinct from those associated with risk of incident GA. These findings are relevant to further investigations of GA pathogenesis and clinical trial planning.

### Geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration: a tale of two stages [^986b7ad8]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical and Imaging Factors

A comprehensive review of phenotypic or imaging factors is outside the scope of this review. However, RPD, also known as subretinal drusenoid deposits, and hyperreflective foci are worthy of discussion. In both the AREDS and AREDS2, RPD presence was associated with significantly increased risk of progression to late AMD, despite adjustment for other characteristics of AMD severity. This was particularly true for progression to GA. Similarly, in both the AREDS and AREDS2, RPD presence was also associated with significantly faster GA expansion. This is generally consistent with the results of other smaller studies. Likewise, hyperreflective foci have been reported as a significant risk factor for both progression to late AMD and faster GA expansion. Finally, GA presence in 1 eye is associated in the fellow eye with both increased risk of GA incidence (if GA is absent) and faster GA expansion (if GA is present). Hence, these phenotypic factors have associations operating in the same direction at both disease stages.

According to Occam's razor, this suggests that similar mechanisms are responsible for linking the risk feature to faster progression at both stages. Reticular pseudodrusen, for example, might represent a precursor lesion for GA at the time points of both GA incidence and GA expansion. Geographic atrophy is diagnosed on OCT by a combination of RPE loss and photoreceptor degeneration, and retinal areas affected by RPD typically show decreased RPE cell density and a thin outer retina (particularly in the outer nuclear layer). Considering RPD in this way could explain faster progression at both disease stages through local effects. Other explanations might include innate immune cell activity or choroidal abnormalities, with each believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of RPD but also with GA development and GA expansion.

### The epidemiology of age-related macular degeneration [^c8fa5106]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the epidemiology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Design

Evidence from epidemiologic data regarding the natural history of AMD and its risk factors are presented.

Results

Large, soft drusen associated with pigmentary abnormalities increase the risk of progression to advanced AMD. Large soft drusen may fade over time. Advanced AMD is more likely to be present in whites than blacks, despite the similar prevalence of soft drusen in both groups. Neovascular AMD is more frequent than geographic atrophy in most population-based studies in whites in America, Australia, and the Netherlands than in similar population-based studies in Iceland and Norway. After age and family history, there are few consistent relationships of risk factors to AMD. Of these, the relationship of smoking, hypertension, and cataract surgery to advanced AMD have been most consistent.

Conclusions

Long-term epidemiologic studies have provided information on the distribution and the natural history of AMD and its associated risk factors. It is not known what effect reduction of blood pressure and the cessation of smoking might have on the incidence and progression of AMD.

Background

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive chronic disease of the central retina and a leading cause of vision loss worldwide. It accounts for approximately 50% of all cases of central blindness among older people in western countries. Annual incidence of late AMD in Americans aged ≥ 50 years was 3.5 per 1000 (95% CI = 2.5–4.7 per 1000), incidence rates approximately quadrupled per decade in age.

Generally, AMD is divided into early AMD and late AMD according to the international classification and grading system. Early AMD is frequently described as age-related maculopathy (ARM). Late AMD can be further classified into geographic atrophy ("dry") and neovascular ("wet") types. The geographic atrophy type accounts for about 80% of all late AMD cases for few available treatment.

The causes of AMD are still not well understood. Numerous studies have been performed to identify risk factors for AMD. Many risk factors have been identified, including aging, gender, genetics, alcohol consumption, smoking, diet, and cardiovascular function. Several studies have investigated the possible associations between sunlight exposure and AMD; however, the results of those studies are inconsistent. The aim of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the association between sunlight exposure and the risk of AMD by performing a meta-analysis of all relevant studies.

### Consideration of patient phenotypes in geographic atrophy due to age-related macular degeneration [^60f7dfaf]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In 2023, FDA approvals of pegcetacoplan followed by avacincaptad pegol for GA secondary to AMD offered new treatment options that slowed GA growth. In-depth knowledge of the imaging features, risk factors for development and progression of GA, and details of the phase III trials of complement inhibitors is critical for clinicians caring for patients with GA as it may help them recognise and stratify patients to maximise treatment effect. Treatment for GA should be individualised to the patient's specific needs and preferences, taking into consideration individual patients' ocular characteristics such as GA location, lesion progression and morphologic changes in the retina.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^658530b0]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to general principles of management and follow-up, AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that according to the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS2), antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation should be considered in patients with intermediate AMD or geographic atrophy (GA) in one or both eyes and other advanced AMD in one eye. There is no evidence to support the use of these supplements for patients who have less than intermediate AMD and no evidence of any prophylactic value for family members without signs of AMD. A Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduced risk of developing AMD and of existing AMD becoming worse.

### Risk factors for incident age-related macular degeneration: pooled findings from 3 continents [^cf7eb268]. Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine risk factors for incident age-related macular degeneration (AMD) after combining data from 3 population-based cohort studies.

Design

Population-based cohort study.

Population

A population of 9523 adults (age range, 43–95 years at baseline) living in Australia, The Netherlands, and the United States who participated in a baseline examination and a follow-up examination on average 5 or 6 years later.

Methods

Similar procedures were used at all study sites. Examinations included a standardized questionnaire, pupillary dilation, and stereoscopic color fundus photography. Fundus photographs were graded for lesions associated with AMD using the Wisconsin and International Age-Related Maculopathy Grading Systems. Senior investigators from each site adjudicated all photos graded as late AMD.

Main Outcomes Measure

Incidence of late AMD.

Results

Among studies, distributions for most risk factors differed, and overall incidence rates were similar. In the Beaver Dam Eye Study, total serum cholesterol was inversely associated with incident neovascular AMD. In the Blue Mountains Eye Study, current smoking (defined as smoking at the time of the baseline examination) was associated with an increased risk of incident geographic atrophy and late AMD; increased total serum cholesterol, having diabetes, and older age at menopause were positively associated with incident geographic atrophy; and an increase in high-density lipoprotein serum cholesterol was inversely related to incident geographic atrophy. In the Rotterdam Study, current smoking was associated with an increased risk of incident geographic atrophy, neovascular AMD, and late AMD; past smoking was associated with an increased risk of incident neovascular AMD and late AMD; and an increased number of years between menarche and menopause was directly related to incident geographic atrophy. After pooling data, the only statistically significant relationships found were between smoking and total serum cholesterol and incident AMD. Current smoking was associated with an increased incidence of geographic atrophy and late AMD (odds ratios [ORs] relative to nonsmokers: 2.83 and 2.35, respectively; ORs relative to past smokers: 2.80 and 1.82, respectively), and total serum cholesterol was associated directly with incident geographic atrophy (OR: 1.08 per 10 mg/dl) and inversely with incident neovascular AMD (OR: 0.94 per 10 mg/dl).

Conclusions

Pooled data support a growing body of evidence indicating that smoking is related to an increased risk of incident AMD. Current smokers were at higher risk of incident AMD than both past smokers and those who never smoked. The relationships found in this study between total serum cholesterol and incident geographic atrophy and neovascular AMD are not readily explained.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^4c3935f7]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to risk factors (general principles), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that the main unmodifiable risk factors for the development of advanced AMD are increasing age, Northern European ancestry, and genetic factors. Although a number of modifiable risk factors have been investigated, cigarette smoking is the main one that has been consistently identified in numerous studies. Importantly, it is essential to recognize that the associations found in observational studies that analyze risk factors should not be interpreted as cause and effect. Such associations may not necessarily translate into treatment recommendations, as multiple confounding variables may not be accounted for in the studies.

### Risk factors for the incidence of advanced age-related macular degeneration in the age-related eye disease study (AREDS) AREDS report no. 19 [^579ea420]. Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the association of demographic, behavioral, medical, and nonretinal ocular factors with the incidence of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and central geographic atrophy (CGA) in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a randomized trial of antioxidants and zinc supplementation prophylaxis for development of advanced AMD.

Design

Clinic-based prospective cohort study.

Participants

Of individuals with early or intermediate AMD at baseline with a median follow-up of 6.3 years, 788 were at risk of developing advanced AMD in one eye (the fellow eye had advanced AMD), and 2506 were at risk in both eyes.

Methods

The incidence of neovascular AMD and CGA was assessed from stereoscopic color fundus photographs taken at baseline and at annual visits beginning at year 2.

Main Outcome Measures

Neovascular AMD was defined as photocoagulation for choroidal neovascularization, or photographic documentation at the reading center of any of the following: nondrusenoid retinal pigment epithelial detachment, serous or hemorrhagic retinal detachment, hemorrhage under the retina or the retinal pigment epithelium, and subretinal fibrosis. Central geographic atrophy was defined as geographic atrophy involving the center of the macula.

Results

In multivariable models, in persons at risk of advanced AMD in both eyes, while controlling for age, gender, and AREDS treatment group, the following variables were statistically significantly associated with the incidence of neovascular AMD: race (odds ratio [OR], white vs. black, 6.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24–36.9) and larger amount smoked (OR, > 10 vs. ≤ 10 pack-years [a pack-year is an average of 1 pack of cigarette smoked per day for a year], 1.55; 95% CI, 1.15–2.09). The following were statistically significantly associated with the incidence of CGA: less education (OR, high school graduate or less vs. college graduate, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.10–2.78), greater body mass index (BMI) (OR, obese vs. nonobese, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.25–2.65), larger amount smoked (OR, > 10 pack-years vs. ≤ 10 pack-years, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.25–2.65), and antacid use (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.09–0.91). In persons at risk of developing advanced AMD in one eye, the incidence of neovascular AMD was associated with diabetes (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.07–3.31), and the incidence of CGA was associated with use of antiinflammatory medications (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08–0.59).

Conclusions

Results suggest that, among persons with early or intermediate AMD, smoking and BMI are modifiable factors associated with progression to advanced AMD, and suggest other associations (e.g., use of antacids and antiinflammatory medications) that warrant further study.

### Ten-year follow-up of age-related macular degeneration in the age-related eye disease study: AREDS report no. 36 [^4f0b6221]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Providing long-term follow-up of the natural history of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and associated risk factors will facilitate future epidemiologic studies and clinical trials.

Objective

To describe 10-year progression rates to intermediate or advanced AMD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We observed the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) participants for an additional 5 years after a randomized clinical trial of antioxidant vitamins and minerals was completed. Observation occurred at 11 clinical sites of medical retinal practices from academic institutions and community medical centers. Participants aged 55 to 80 years with no AMD or AMD of varying severity (n = 4757) were followed up in the AREDS trial for a median duration of 6.5 years. When the trial ended, 3549 of the 4203 surviving participants were followed for 5 additional years.

Exposure

Treatment with antioxidant vitamins and minerals.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Development of varying stages of AMD and changes in visual acuity. The rates of progression to large drusen and advanced AMD (neovascular AMD or central geographic atrophy) were evaluated using annual fundus photographs assessed centrally. Best-corrected visual acuity was measured at annual study visits.

Results

The risk of progression to advanced AMD increased with increasing age (P = 0.01) and severity of drusen. Women (P = 0.005) and current smokers (P < .001) were at increased risk of neovascular AMD. In the oldest participants with the most severe AMD status at baseline, the risks of developing neovascular AMD and central geographic atrophy by 10 years were 48.1% and 26.0%, respectively. Similarly, rates of progression to large drusen increased with increasing severity of drusen at baseline, with 70.9% of participants with bilateral medium drusen progressing to large drusen and 13.8% to advanced AMD in 10 years. Median visual acuity at 10 years in eyes that had large drusen at baseline but never developed advanced AMD was 20/25; eyes that developed advanced AMD had a median visual acuity of 20/200.

Conclusions and Relevance

The natural history of AMD demonstrates relentless loss of vision in persons who developed advanced AMD. These progression data and the risk factor analyses may be helpful to investigators conducting research in clinic populations.

### Healthcare resource utilization and costs in patients with geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration [^fbec0943]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Geographic atrophy (GA) is a late-stage manifestation of nonexudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that affects nearly 1 million people in the United States (US) and 5 million people worldwide, and leads to significant visual function impairment and eventual blindness. Characterized by the formation of drusen, or pigmentary changes at the macula, AMD is the most common cause of irreversible central vision loss in elderly patients in the US, and consists of 2 major advanced forms that are not mutually exclusive: dry, atrophic, or nonexudative AMD and wet, neovascular, or exudative AMD. The nonexudative form is more prevalent, with nearly 85% of patients with AMD having the dry form, and involves a slow progressive degeneration of the retina, whereas the exudative form is less frequent but is responsible for 90% of acute blindness due to choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Patients with CNV may develop atrophy after a few years, and similarly, patients with atrophy can also eventually develop CNV.

Although advanced stages of AMD consisting of geographic atrophy and neovascular AMD can coexist due to common risk factors, GA occurs specifically through the loss of the retinal pigment epithelium with associated loss of thermocapillary, and scotomas, or blind spots, can develop. Strong risk factors for GA include advanced age, history of smoking, and high levels of oxidative stress damaging the macula.

Geographic atrophy can be categorized into 3 main levels of severity, in increasing order: early to intermediate AMD (EI AMD), advanced atrophic nonexudative AMD without subfoveal involvement (GAwoSF), and advanced atrophic nonexudative AMD with subfoveal involvement (GAwSF). Patients with EI AMD may progress to GAwoSF, which does not involve the center of the fovea, or GAwSF, which does involve the center of the fovea. Whereas severe visual acuity loss occurs more slowly and less commonly in patients with GA, and the fovea is spared until late in the course of the disease, GA involving the foveal center causes approximately 10% of all AMD-related visual loss. Patients whose GA does not involve the central fovea may have relatively good distance visual acuity yet manifest a substantially decreased ability to perform near visual tasks, such as reading.

### GEOGRAPHIC ATROPHY INCIDENCE AND PROGRESSION AFTER INTRAVITREAL INJECTIONS OF ANTI-VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR AGENTS FOR AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION: a meta-analysis [^4634dd45]. Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Geographic atrophy (GA) is a complication of advanced neovascular age-related macular degeneration that can lead to permanent vision loss. We sought to estimate the incidence and progression of GA after intravitreal injections of antivascular endothelial growth factor agents in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

Methods

Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched from inception to May 2020. Included studies reported on the progression or development of GA in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration after antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

Results

Thirty-one articles and 4,609 study eyes (4,501 patients) were included. Eyes received a mean of 17.7 injections over 35.2 months. The prevalence of GA at baseline was 9.7%. The pooled incidence of GA was 30.5% at the end of follow-up. There was a positive, moderate linear correlation between the mean total number of injections and GA incidence at the final follow-up (R² = 0.30; P = 0.01). Monthly treatment was associated with a significantly higher risk for GA development relative to pro re nata (relative risk = 1.40, 95% confidence interval = [1.21–1.61], P < 0.001). Risk factors for GA development included GA in the fellow eye, retinal angiomatous proliferation, drusen, and reticular pseudodrusen.

Conclusion

We found an association between the frequency and number of treatments with antivascular endothelial growth factor agents and the development of GA in neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Future studies should clarify risk factors, population characteristics, and relative contributions of treatment and disease progression on GA development in this context.

### Consideration of patient phenotypes in geographic atrophy due to age-related macular degeneration [^24b423bb]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Phenotype selection and management considerations

Commonly encountered patient phenotypes based on the experience of the authors are presented to illustrate key clinical and imaging characteristics of GA used to monitor and manage the condition. Features that may confer increased risk of GA progression should be assessed when evaluating candidates for treatment with complement inhibitors. There are currently no accepted guidelines regarding the recommended amount of time to monitor patients prior to treatment initiation with complement inhibitors. This time period may vary in slow versus fast GA progressors. However, initiating treatment early, particularly before foveal involvement, may slow GA progression and preserve visual function over time. Similarly, consideration should be given to the period of time necessary to determine the progression rate of GA prior to selecting participants for clinical trials. Given the variability in progression rates between phenotypes, such decisions should be individualised, and clinical trials should aim to stratify for different baseline morphological characteristics.

In all patients with AMD, smoking cessation is recommended. Supplementation with AREDS2 may be considered based on data demonstrating treatment with AREDS may lower the risk of developing advanced AMD in patients with intermediate AMD in the fellow eye.

The status of the fellow eye is critical to consider as it may be receiving intravitreal injections for nAMD or for bilateral GA. There may be additional ocular diseases in elderly patients, such as glaucoma, affecting an individual's visual potential. Other factors to consider include age and non-ocular medical conditions. The ability to return for follow-up is key when considering anticomplement treatment options as intervals between intravitreal injections varied across the clinical trials. In the USA, pegcetacoplan is approved with flexible dosing intervals once every 25–60 days and avacincaptad pegol is approved for monthly treatment.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^8bbcaca3]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to natural history (intermediate age-related macular degeneration), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that reticular pseudodrusen (also referred to as subretinal drusenoid deposits) may be under-recognized. They are best imaged using fundus autofluorescence, infrared reflectance, and/or spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and they appear to represent a meaningful risk factor associated with progression to GA. In 2024, the AREDS and AREDS2 research groups defined an updated simplified severity scale with two modifications: including noncentral geographic atrophy in the advanced AMD outcome (rather than as a risk factor), and incorporating the presence of reticular pseudodrusen. In patients without reticular pseudodrusen at baseline, the 5-year rates of progression to advanced AMD remained similar to those of the original simplified severity scale. However, in patients with reticular pseudodrusen at baseline, the 5-year progression rates increased to 72%, 59%, 29%, 8%, and 3% for patients with four, three, two, one, and zero risk factors, respectively.

### STATIN USE AND THE INCIDENCE OF AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION: a meta-analysis [^b39b7539]. Retina (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) shares many of the same risk factors with atherosclerosis. There is a postulated role of lipid-lowering agents in preventing AMD. This meta-analysis investigates the possible role of statins in the prevention of AMD onset and progression.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and the reference lists of included studies were systematically searched from inception to September 2020. Studies were included if they measured the risk of AMD development or progression with statin use. The primary outcomes assessed were AMD incidence and progression. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of early AMD, late AMD, choroidal neovascularization, and geographic atrophy.

Results

Twenty-one articles (1 randomized control trial and 20 observational studies) collectively reporting on 1,460,989 participants were included. The pooled risk ratios (95% confidence interval) for statin use on any, early, and late AMD incidence were 1.05 (0.85–1.29) (P = 0.44), 0.99 (0.88–1.11) (P = 0.86), and 1.15 (0.90–1.47) (P = 0.27), respectively. In patients with existing AMD, the respective risk ratios for statin use on incidence of AMD progression, choroidal neovascularization, and geographic atrophy were 1.04 (0.70–1.53) (P = 0.85), 0.99 (0.66–1.48) (P = 0.95), and 0.84 (0.58–1.22) (P = 0.36).

Conclusion

This meta-analysis found that there was no significant difference in the incidence or progression of AMD based on statin use.

### Review of age-related macular degeneration… [^f74e0303]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Observations Older age, genetic factors, and environmental factors, such as cigarette smoking, are associated with development of AMD. AMD occurs when extracellular deposits accumulate in the outer retina, ultimately leading to photoreceptor degeneration and loss of central vision. The late stages of AMD are characterized by outer retinal atrophy, termed geographic atrophy, or neovascularization associated with subretinal and/or intraretinal exudation, termed exudative neovascular AMD. The annual incidence of AMD ranges from 0. 3 per 1000 in people who are aged 55 to 59 years to
36. 7 per 1000 in people aged 90 years or older. The estimated heritability of late-stage AMD is approximately 71%. Long-term prospective cohort studies show a significantly higher AMD incidence in people who smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day compared with people who never smoked.

AMD is diagnosed primarily with clinical examination that includes a special lens that focuses light of the slit lamp through the pupil. Exudative neovascular AMD is best identified using angiography and by optical coherence tomography. Individuals with AMD who take nutritional supplements consisting of high-dose vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, and zinc have a 20% probability to progress to late-stage AMD at 5 years vs a 28% probability for those taking a placebo. In exudative neovascular AMD, 94. 6% of patients receiving monthly intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections experience less than a 15-letter visual acuity loss after 12 months compared with
62. 2% receiving sham treatment. Conclusions and Relevance The prevalence of AMD is anticipated to increase worldwide to 288 million individuals by 2040. Intravitreally administered anti-VEGF treatment is first-line therapy for exudative neovascular AMD.

### Incidence, progression and risk factors of age-related macular degeneration in 35-95-year-old individuals from three jointly designed German cohort studies [^b51aa75d]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative disorder affecting the complex of photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid in the central retina. It represents the leading cause of central vision loss in the elderly populations of industrialised countries. Due to population ageing, the number of affected individuals has been projected to increase. Epidemiological measures such as prevalence, incidence and progression are key for healthcare management and individuals' risk assessment.

While there are numerous population-based studies with one-time assessment of AMD (cross-sectional studies) estimating disease prevalence, there are only few studies with multiple AMD assessments longitudinally. A recent meta-analysis of European cohort studies had included 22 studies on AMD prevalence, but only four studies on AMD incidence. In Germany, population-based AMD incidence data are limited to the Gutenberg Health Study with 5-year follow-up.

The current gold standard in epidemiological studies to document early/intermediate and late AMD stages is the grading of colour fundus images of the central retina. On colour fundus images, early AMD is characterised by differently sized yellowish accumulations of extracellular material (drusen) between Bruch's membrane and the RPE or between the RPE and the neurosensory retina. Other features of early/intermediate AMD are RPE abnormalities, including depigmentation or increased amount of pigment. Late AMD can manifest as an atrophic form known as geographic atrophy (GA) or a macular neovascular (MNV) complication characterised by choroidal/(sub)retinal ingrowth of diseased blood vessels and bleeding.

While the definition of late AMD is fairly similar across clinical and epidemiological studies, classification systems for early AMD differ in terms of graded features and categories. When comparing the Three Continent AMD Consortium Severity Scale (3CACSS)and the Clinical Classification (CC), substantial differences in early AMD prevalence were documented (17% vs 44%, respectively). A recent assessment of the performance of several classification systems showed that each system had its merits in different settingsand that 3CACSS performed best in predicting progression to late AMD.

### Imaging features associated with progression to geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration: classification of atrophy meeting report 5 [^c14620ba]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide an image-based description of retinal features associated with risk for development of geographic atrophy (GA) in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), as visualized with multimodal imaging anchored by structural OCT.

Design

Consensus meeting.

Participants

International group that included those with expertise in imaging and AMD basic science and histology, and those with Reading Center experience in AMD clinical trials.

Methods

As part of the Classification of Atrophy Meeting program, an international group of experts analyzed and discussed retinal multimodal imaging features in eyes with AMD associated with GA, risk of progression to GA, or both. Attendees undertook premeeting grading exercises that were reviewed during the meeting sessions. Meeting presentations illustrated established and investigational multimodal imaging features and associated histologic features. Each of these different features were then discussed openly by the entire group to arrive at consensus definitions. These definitions were applied to 40 additional images that were graded independently by attendees to refine the consensus definitions and descriptions further.

Results

Consensus was reached on images with descriptors for 12 features. These features included components of outer retinal atrophy (e.g., ellipsoid zone disruption), components of complete retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and outer retinal atrophy (e.g. RPE perturbation with associated hypotransmission or hypertransmission), features frequently seen in eyes with atrophy (e.g., refractile drusen), and features conferring risk for atrophy development (e.g., hyperreflective foci, drusen, and subretinal drusenoid deposits).

Conclusions

An international consensus on terms and descriptions was reached on multimodal imaging features associated GA and with risk for GA progression in eyes with AMD. We believe this information will be useful to clinicians who manage patients with AMD, researchers who study AMD disease interventions and pathogenesis, and those who design clinical trials for therapies targeting earlier AMD stages than GA expansion.

### Incidence and progression of geographic atrophy: observations from a population-based cohort [^30d9b9ff]. Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) lesion characteristics and risk factors associated with the long-term development and progression of geographic atrophy (GA).

Design

Population-based cohort.

Participants

Of 3654 participants aged ≥ 49 years in the Blue Mountains Eye Study, 75.8%, 76.7%, and 56.1% of survivors attended the 5-, 10-, and 15-year follow-up examinations, respectively.

Methods

Retinal photographs were taken at each visit. Incident GA was confirmed using a side-by-side grading method. Computer planimetry was used to measure the area involved by GA. Fast and slow/normal progression rates were defined as GA area enlargement by ≥ 2 and < 2 mm²/year, respectively. Incident GA was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Early AMD lesion characteristics were assessed for association with GA incidence using eye-specific data and generalized estimating equation models adjusting for age, current smoking, and presence of risk alleles of the complement factor H (CFH) or age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) genes, genotyped or imputed using genome-wide scan data.

Main Outcome Measures

Incidence and progression of GA.

Results

By excluding 41 subjects with GA at baseline, of 2503 participants at risk of GA, incident pure GA (without coexisting neovascular AMD lesions) was confirmed in 57 participants, with a 15-year incidence of 3.6%. Baseline early AMD lesion characteristics associated with GA incidence included drusen type (soft indistinct: odds ratio [OR], 59.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 20.4–171.0; reticular drusen: OR, 13.9; 95% CI, 4.0–47.6); drusen location within a 500-μm radius of the fovea (OR, 15.1; 95% CI, 7.4–30.8); drusen area greater than 375 μm in diameter (OR, 10.1; 95% CI, 4.0–25.6); presence of retinal pigment epithelial depigmentation (OR, 9.0; 95% CI, 4.1–19.8); or hyperpigmentation (OR, 12.0; 95% CI, 6.1–23.5), referenced to subjects with no or hard drusen only. Fast progression was more frequent among current smokers at baseline, subjects with the CFH or ARMS2 risk genotypes, and pseudophakic eyes.

Conclusions

Early AMD lesion characteristics (type, location, area involved) were strongly associated with higher long-term risk of developing GA independent of age, smoking, and AMD genetic susceptibility from the CFH or ARMS2 genes. Known AMD risk factors also were more frequently present among quickly progressing GA cases.

### Prognostic value of intermediate age-related macular degeneration phenotypes for geographic atrophy progression [^631d83f0]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

GA represents a huge unmet medical need. To date, despite a few promising phase II clinical trials, efficacy has not been shown in phase III studies. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of AMD progression and GA development with its phenotypic variations are neither yet fully understood nor completely reflected in evidence-based clinical AMD classification systems. Better understanding of the underlying risk profiles, especially of constant factors across follow-up and disease stages, may facilitate genotype–phenotype correlation studies, stratification of patients and may provide the opportunity for earlier intervention.

In this study, we demonstrate that structural features in eyes with iAMD are of prognostic value for the subsequent GA progression (p = 0.0018). In particular, post hoc analysis revealed that this association was driven by RPD, demonstrating that iAMD eyes with RPD exhibit a significantly higher enlargement rate of subsequent GA compared with eyes with other iAMD precursors. Although many studies have highlighted the need for a refined phenotypic iAMD characterisation regarding risk assessment for disease conversion, up to now, there had been no studies which determined the intraeye relevance of iAMD phenotyping for subsequent characterisation of GA progression.

Previous reports showed that GA progression is complex and depends on several factors including patient's genotype as well as lesion features. Out of those, the perilesional FAF pattern was revealed to be a strong indicator for lesion progression with the most rapid progression in eyes presenting the diffuse-trickling pattern. Of note, this pattern is strongly characterised by the presence of RPD; however, in our study, only 50% of the eyes with development of GA spatially confined to RPD (phenotype 2) were considered to develop eventually the diffuse-trickling pattern; at least for the median observational period of 2.5 ± 2.3 (± SD; range 0.9–7.7 (min–max)) years after first GA detection.

In recent years, several studies have focused on RPD differentiating them structurally and functionally from 'typical' sub-RPE drusen. In determining the natural history of different iAMD structural high-risk features beyond disease conversion into late-stage AMD, the results of our study might support the assumption of RPD being a distinct entity currently still subsumed in the complex spectrum of AMD.

### Geographic atrophy multifocality in the age-related eye disease study 2 [^7f3f9e9b]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Geographic atrophy (GA) progression represents the combination of contiguous expansion and new lesion addition. Multifocal GA is associated with faster area-based progression and has been linked to faster decline in visual acuity, but the natural history and risk factors for new lesion addition are unknown.

Objective

To examine, in eyes with preexisting GA, the natural history of new GA lesion incidence and identify risk factors for faster incidence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a post hoc analysis of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2), which was a multicenter study based in retinal specialty clinics in the US. Included in the analysis were eyes with incident GA considered in 2 cohorts: (1) any-focality GA (eyes with unifocal or multifocal GA at incidence) and (2) unifocal GA (eyes with unifocal GA at incidence). Study data were analyzed from January to May 2025.

Exposures

Demographic and dietary characteristics, genotype, GA characteristics, and macular features.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was new GA lesion incidence rate, after GA incidence. Annual fundus photographs were graded for GA presence and characteristics and macular features. After GA incidence, new GA lesion incidence events were recorded. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed by generalized estimating equations regression, with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression for variable screening.

Results

A total of 689 eyes with incident GA of 570 participants (mean [SD] age, 74.5 [6.9] years; 332 female [58.2%]) were included in this study. Eyes constituted 2 main cohorts: (1) any-focality GA (ie, 689 eyes with unifocal or multifocal GA at incidence) and (2) unifocal GA (ie, 386 eyes with unifocal GA at incidence). Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 2.1 (0.9) years, the mean (SD) GA lesion incidence rate was 0.25 (0.50) lesions per year (range, 0–3 lesions per year) and 0.40 (0.70) lesions per year (range, 0–5 lesions per year) in the unifocal and any-focality cohorts, respectively. For the unifocal cohort, the multivariable model comprised 4 risk factors: reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), noncentral GA, lower nut intake, and higher calorie intake. For the any-focality cohort, the model comprised 7 risk factors: GA lesion number, noncentral GA, greater GA proximity to central macula, RPD, age, lower fish intake, and higher calorie intake.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this post hoc analysis of the AREDS2 trial data, the natural history data and multivariable models may be helpful in clinical practice and trials. The models included a combination of GA characteristics and RPD status; the risk factors for first GA occurrence, subsequent lesion incidence rate, and area-based progression overlapped only partially. Their mechanisms may, therefore, be partially distinct, which has implications for therapeutic approaches.

### Risk factors for 15-letter visual acuity loss from geographic atrophy progression over 1 year in the age-related eye disease study 2 [^064baa76]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

A change of ≥ 15 letters in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is typically defined as clinically significant by regulatory agencies, but risk factors for rapid 15-letter loss in geographic atrophy (GA) are poorly understood. The purpose was to identify independent risk factors for 15-letter loss within one year in eyes with GA.

Design

Post hoc analysis of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2.

Participants

961 eyes (743 participants).

Methods

Annual fundus photographs were graded for GA presence/morphology. BCVA was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart. Multivariable analyses comprised logistic regression for 15-letter loss within one year, based on (i) baseline variables (demographic, BCVA, and GA morphology variables, defined at first time-point with GA), (ii) genetic variables (CFH Y402H and ARMS2), and (iii) GA enlargement rate (from first time-point with GA).

Main Outcome Measures

15-letter loss in BCVA within one year.

Results

During 1-year follow-up, BCVA declined by ≥ 15 letters in 53 eyes (5.5%). In a model with baseline variables, the risk factors were: age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.14, p = 0.0005), closer GA proximity to fovea (aOR 0.90 per 0.1 mm increase, 95% CI 0.84–0.97, p = 0.005), current smoking (aOR 3.85, 1.49–9.97, p = 0.005), and BCVA < 20/40 (aOR 2.09, 95% CI 1.17–3.74; p = 0.013). In a model with baseline variables and genotype, CFH was a risk factor (aOR 4.63, 1.27–16.9, p = 0.020, 2 vs 0 risk alleles), while ARMS2 was not. In a model with baseline variables and GA enlargement rate, faster enlargement was a risk factor (aOR 1.12 per 0.1 mm/year increase, 95% CI 1.07–1.18, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

We identified multiple independent risk factors for rapid, clinically significant BCVA loss in GA. We also developed clinically relevant models for different scenarios. These can guide the design and interpretation of interventional trials aimed at decreasing vision loss in GA and provide prognostic information in clinical practice. The risk factors for BCVA loss and faster GA enlargement overlap only partially, so that trial inclusion criteria, power calculations, and covariate adjustment should differ according to the choice of a functional versus structural measure as the primary endpoint.

Genetic risk factors

AMD is a complex and multifaceted disease involving contributions from both genetic and environmental influences. AMD may be classified as early, intermediate, or late based upon features identified by examination or color photographs of the macula. The late AMD phenotypes are time-dependent variables because they develop from intermediate stages. Therefore, age-matched control populations must be carefully selected for genotypic comparison. Previous work exploring the genetic contributions of AMD has implicated numerous genomic regions and a variety of candidate genes as modulators of AMD susceptibility. Common variants explain approximately 50%–70% of the heritability of AMD. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of genes involved in the complement activation cascade have consistently been implicated in AMD pathogenesis with CFH, C3, CFB, and C2 the most prominent.–There is less association for the involvement of pathways related to extracellular matrix remodeling and lipid metabolism. For most AMD-associated risk loci, the true causative risk variants as well as the affected genes are unknown. Mechanisms other than those related to common single nucleotide polymorphisms found with genomic studies, such as rare variants, copy number variations, epigenetics, and mitochondrial inheritance may contribute to the missing heritability. These factors are relatively unexplored and difficult to study.

Some groups have sought genetic polymorphisms that particularly predispose individuals to drusen-associated GA versus neovascular AMD. The common susceptibility loci found in many studies are general risk factors for both subtypes. Using AREDS data, the homozygosity of allelic polymorphism LOC387715/ARMS2/HTRA1 genotype had a nominal association with GA progression. A subsequent study pooling participants in the AREDS with the Fundus Autofluorescence in Age-related Macular Degeneration Study, a multicenter study conducted in Germany, confirmed this association with what is now known as the ARMS2_rs10490924 risk allele and also indicated an independent association with C3_rs2230199. A small case-control study suggested that some CFH alleles appeared to be associated with GA and that CFB-32Gln might be associated with a more aggressive GA phenotype. Overall, there has been little discriminatory value thus far for genotypic risk factors specific to GA manifestations.

### Progression from early / intermediate to advanced forms of age-related macular degeneration in a large UK cohort: rates and risk factors [^a11ce894]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To estimate rates and risk factors for progression to geographic atrophy (GA) or choroidal neovascularization (CNV) among eyes diagnosed with early or intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in clinical practice.

Design

Retrospective cohort analysis of a multicenter electronic medical record (EMR) database from the United Kingdom.

Participants

Patients aged 50 years or more with diagnosis of early/intermediate AMD in at least 1 eye (the study eye) and no evidence of CNV or GA in the study eye, from 10 clinical sites using the EMR.

Methods

Anonymized data for 40 543 patients with a diagnosis of early/intermediate AMD were extracted between October 2000 and February 2016 from EMR database records held in the 10 sites. A sample of records randomly selected from each center was used to validate disease definitions. Records were analyzed by subgroup, based on the AMD status of the fellow eye. Multivariate Cox regression models identified other predictors of disease progression.

Main Outcome Measures

Progression rate (per 100 person-years) to GA or CNV in study eyes with early/intermediate AMD by fellow eye status and identified risk factors for progression.

Results

Study eyes with early/intermediate AMD and a diagnosis of CNV in the fellow eye progressed to CNV fastest (at a rate of 15.2 per 100 person-years), and those with a diagnosis of GA in the fellow eye progressed to GA fastest (11.2 per 100 person-years), compared with the rates per 100 person-years of progression to CNV (3.2–11.9) or GA (2.0–7.8) in the other subgroups. In individuals with bilateral early/intermediate AMD, rates of progression to GA or CNV were 2.0 and 3.2 per 100 person-years, respectively. In the multivariate model, age, female sex, and cardiovascular disease were associated with an increased risk for progression to advanced AMD, whereas diabetes and glaucoma were associated with a decreased rate of progression (hazard ratios, 0.45 and 0.64, respectively).

Conclusions

Progression to GA or CNV was observed frequently in eyes with early/intermediate AMD, with the status of the fellow eye affecting the rate of progression. Novel associations with risk factors were observed and require replication in other cohorts.

### Geographic atrophy in patients with advanced dry age-related macular degeneration: current challenges and future prospects [^e19698f4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Ocular risk factors

The pathology of AMD is characterized by thinning of the photoreceptor layer of the retina, variable atrophy and other changes of the RPE, thickening of Bruch's membrane, drusen formation, and decreased density of the choriocapillaris layer. There is considerable phenotypic variability of the disease, related no doubt to the diverse genotypic contributions, stage of the disease, and environmental influences. In most cases of drusen-associated GA, there is a gradual fading or collapse of large drusen with overlying loss of pigmentation of the RPE as well as pigment migration into the neuroretina. This intraretinal pigment is likely from RPE cells dissociated from Bruch's membrane. There is gradual thinning of the photoreceptor layers, manifesting first as shortening of the outer segments, followed eventually by cell death and subsequent thinning of the outer nuclear layer of the retina. Finally, loss of the RPE occurs which, congruent with photoreceptor layer atrophy, may lead to the appearance of the outer plexiform layer against Bruch's membrane. Detailed pathological examination shows that the choriocapillary vessels become thinner and the layer becomes less dense along with atrophy of the neuroretinal tissue and RPE. The photo-receptors, RPE, Bruch's membrane, and choriocapillaris have together been described as a functionally integrated complex with a "mutualistic symbiotic relationship". These layers are so interdependent anatomically and functionally that there can be no damage to one layer without corresponding dysfunction and disruption of the other layers. Consequently, there may be no primary insult leading to atrophy but rather a concerted deterioration affecting the entire complex. There is discussion as to the relative contributions of choriocapillary and choroidal sclerosis, Bruch's membrane thickening by basal linear deposits, drusen formation/basal laminar deposits, subretinal drusenoid material, and dysfunction of the photoreceptor outer segments.

### Geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration: a tale of two stages [^8ab7a900]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

The genetic factors described earlier have been considered in terms of associations with global GA expansion rates. However, 2 additional factors have important influences on visual acuity and prognosis: (1) GA location at the point of incidence and (2) preferential GA expansion locally. The location most commonly affected by GA at incidence is the parafoveal region. In the AREDS2 cohort of eyes with incident GA, 67% of cases did not involve the central macular zone at the time of incidence, whereas the remaining 33% did. In the same cohort, the mean proximity of GA to the central macula (i.e. the shortest distance from the nearest pixel with GA to the macular center point) was 459 μm. In analyses of potential associations between AMD genotype (specifically 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms at 9 loci strongly associated with risk of late AMD) and risk of central involvement at GA incidence, no significant association was observed. Few other studies have analyzed potential associations between genotype and GA location. Hence, although the location of GA at the point of incidence is important for visual acuity and prognosis, this characteristic does not seem to be strongly genetically determined. The predilection for the parafoveal region may relate more strongly to anatomical factors, such as the presence of high-risk lesions (particularly soft drusen and basal linear deposits) in both the fovea and parafoveal regions, but the relative absence of protective xanthophyll carotenoid pigment and Müller glia cells in the parafoveal area. Indeed, dark adaptation studies and histological analyses show that, in AMD, rod photoreceptor degeneration is prominent in a parafoveal ring surrounding the fovea long before GA occurs.

### Growth of geographic atrophy in the comparison of age-related macular degeneration treatments trials [^e8418106]. Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the growth of geographic atrophy (GA) during anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy.

Design

Cohort within a clinical trial.

Participants

Patients included in the Comparison of Age-related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials (CATT).

Methods

Participants were randomly assigned to injections of ranibizumab or bevacizumab and to a 2-year dosing regimen of monthly or pro re nata (PRN) or to monthly for 1 year and PRN the following year. Digital color photographs and fluorescein angiograms at baseline and 1 and 2 years were evaluated for GA, and the total area of GA was measured by 2 graders masked to treatment; differences were adjudicated. Multivariate linear mixed models of the annual change in the square root of the area included baseline demographic, treatment, and ocular characteristics on imaging as candidate risk factors.

Main Outcome Measures

Geographic atrophy growth rate.

Results

Among 1185 participants, 86 (7.3%) had GA at baseline, 120 (10.1%) developed GA during year 1, and 36 (3.0%) developed GA during year 2. Among 194 eyes evaluable for growth, the rate was 0.43 mm/yr (standard error [SE], ± 0.03 mm/year). In multivariate analysis, the growth rate was 0.37 mm/year in eyes receiving bevacizumab and 0.49 mm/year in eyes receiving ranibizumab (difference, 0.11 mm/yr; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01–0.22; P = 0.03). Growth rate did not differ between eyes treated monthly and PRN (P = 0.85). Eyes with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesions had a lower growth rate than eyes with nonsubfoveal CNV lesions (difference, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.01–0.22; P = 0.03). Eyes with GA farther from the fovea had higher growth rates by 0.14 (95% CI, 0.01–27) mm/year for every millimeter farther from the fovea. The growth rate was 0.58 mm/year for eyes with predominantly classic lesions, 0.41 mm/year for eyes with minimally classic lesions, and 0.30 mm/year for eyes with occult only lesions (P < 0.01). The growth rate in eyes having a fellow eye with GA was higher by 0.13 mm/year (95% CI, 0.01–0.24; P = 0.03) than in eyes without GA in the fellow eye. Eyes with epiretinal membrane had a higher growth rate than eyes without epiretinal membrane (difference, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03–0.30; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Geographic atrophy growth depends on several ocular factors. Ranibizumab may accelerate GA growth.

### Geographic atrophy in patients with advanced dry age-related macular degeneration: current challenges and future prospects [^26e60e91]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Geographic atrophy (GA) of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a devastating complication of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). GA may be classified as drusen-related (drusen-associated GA) or neovascularization-related (neovascular-associated GA). Drusen-related GA remains a large public health concern due to the burden of blindness it produces, but pathophysiology of the condition is obscure and there are no proven treatment options. Genotyping, cell biology, and clinical imaging point to upregulation of parainflammatory pathways, oxidative stress, and choroidal sclerosis as contributors, among other factors. Onset and monitoring of progression is accomplished through clinical imaging instrumentation such as optical coherence tomography, photography, and autofluorescence, which are the tools most helpful in determining end points for clinical trials at present. A number of treatment approaches with diverse targets are in development at this time, some of which are in human clinical trials. Neovascular-associated GA is a consequence of RPE loss after development of neovascular AMD. The neovascular process leads to a plethora of cellular stresses such as ischemia, inflammation, and dramatic changes in cell environment that further taxes RPE cells already dysfunctional from drusen-associated changes. GA may therefore develop secondary to the neovascular process de novo or preexisting drusen-associated GA may continue to worsen with the development of neovascular AMD. Neovascular-associated GA is a prominent cause of continued vision loss in patients with otherwise successfully treated neovascular AMD. Clearly, treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors early in the course of the neovascular disease is of great clinical benefit. However, there is a rationale and some suggestive evidence that anti-VEGF agents themselves could be toxic to RPE and enhance neovascular-associated GA. The increasing prevalence of legal blindness from this condition due to the aging of the general population lends urgency to the search for a therapy to ameliorate GA.

Enlargement of GA area with time

Most patients with drusen-associated GA develop small parafoveal patches as the earliest manifestation of the condition. At these loci, the lesions are preceded by extensive confluent drusen or a drusenoid pigment epithelial detachment with pigmentary abnormalities and/or refractile drusen. As noted, the presence of subretinal drusenoid deposits (reticular pseudodrusen) and abnormal autofluorescence signals are additional risk factors. Approximately 15%–20% of cases begin with subfoveal involvement, and some patients develop GA without notable precursor lesions. Of those without central involvement at first detection, the median time to foveal atrophy is approximately 2 years. Risk factors for continued GA expansion include hyperauto-fluorescence of the junctional zone surrounding regions of GA, the number of foci of GA and shape configuration of the GA regions, and the total perimeter of RPE at risk surrounding areas of GA. There appears to be no additional risk conferred by smoking or body mass index.

Longitudinal studies show wide variability in the growth rates of GA lesions between individuals, although the growth rates of lesions in patients with bilateral involvement tend to be similar between eyes of the same individual. In the Beaver Dam Eye Study, the mean enlargement of area of GA was 6.4 mm² over 5 years. In the AREDS, patients with GA had growth of 1.78 mm² per year over 5 years, but growth was greater in larger lesions compared to smaller ones, as has been noted in other studies. Growth rates of 1.52 mm²/yr,2.2 mm²/yr, and 1.61 mm²/yrhave been reported from other cohort studies. By using the en face OCT projection image, estimated GA growth rate was 1.2 mm² in a relatively small cohort.

The AREDS Research Group supported a linear model of GA growth over a quadratic model, in agreement with a prior study. However, adjustment for the differential growth rate by baseline area could be an additional source of variability in clinical trial analysis. A square root transformation of baseline GA area appears to ameliorate the effect of baseline area on GA progression, which could simplify clinical trial enrollment and analysis. Additionally, a classification based on the extent to which GA lesions in an eye depart from circularity based upon measurement of area and total perimeter of the junctional zone shows association with growth rates by providing a measure of the relative border of RPE at risk for further dropout at the margins of GA.

### Evolution of geographic atrophy in participants treated with ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration [^667ad071]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the risk factors, incidence, and rate of progression of geographic atrophy (GA) in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) treated with ranibizumab.

Design

Post-hoc analysis of a prospective clinical study.

Participants

69 participants with nAMD in at least one eye.

Methods

Participants were prospectively treated in the study eye with 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab. Study eyes received 4 monthly injections followed by pro re nata injections until a fluid-free macula was achieved on optical coherence tomography. Risk factors assessed included baseline demographics, treatment, and ocular characteristics on imaging. Eyes were evaluated on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) for GA. The rate of GA area growth in study and fellow eyes was analyzed by linear regression of square-root transformed areas.

Main Outcome Measures

Development of new-onset GA and rate of GA area growth measured on ocular imaging, including FAF images of the study eyes.

Results

Sixty-nine participants (mean age 78.8 ± 7.8 years) with an average of 40.0 ± 13.6 months of follow-up were analyzed. Twenty-two of 69 study eyes (32%) were treatment naïve. During their first year of the study, participants received an average of 9.2 ± 3.3 injections in the study eye. Of 63 study eyes with quality baseline images, 22 (35%) had pre-existing GA. Of the remaining 41 eyes, 7 (17%) developed new-onset GA during study follow-up. Those who developed new GA were older (all ≥ 79 years old) and had received fewer study injections on average (6.9 vs. 10.4 injections at 1 year) compared to those who did not develop new GA. Of the 12 treatment naïve study eyes without GA at baseline, 1 (8.3%) developed new GA during the study. In 21 study eyes with quantifiable GA area, eyes with GA present at baseline (16/21) enlarged by 0.34 ± 0.26 mm/year, compared to 0.19 ± 0.12 mm/year in eyes developing new-onset GA (5/21).

Conclusions

While 17% of study eyes without GA present at baseline receiving ranibizumab developed new GA, the role of ranibizumab in the development of GA is unclear. Further prospective longitudinal studies are required to determine the eyes most at risk of developing GA in the setting of anti-VEGF treatment.

### Geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration: a tale of two stages [^6bbad305]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Genetic Factors

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted separately for late AMD prevalence and GA expansion. Interestingly, the results do not overlap at all. A large GWAS of late AMD identified 52 independently associated genetic variants across 34 loci. These loci relate to genes involved in biological pathways, including the complement system, lipid metabolism and transport, extracellular matrix maintenance and remodeling, angiogenesis, and cell survival. By contrast, a GWAS of GA expansion revealed only 2 loci with genome-wide significance (likely related to the genes PRMT6 and LSS), neither of which was observed in the GWAS of late AMD.

For late AMD prevalence, of the 34 loci, the 2 with highest population attributable risk are at CFH and ARMS2/HTRA1. Of these 2, 1 appears to be associated with faster GA expansion, whereas the other does not. For ARMS2/HTRA1, the minor allele at rs10490924, which is highly associated with increased risk of GA incidence, is also highly associated with faster GA expansion in most studies. In multivariable analyses of the AREDS2 cohort of 771 eyes with GA and genetic data, ARMS2/HTRA1 risk alleles were very strongly associated with faster GA expansion. However, the relative contribution of the 2 types of expansion described earlier is unknown here. By contrast, for CFH, none of the common risk or protective haplotypes appear to confer altered risk of faster or slower GA expansion. In the AREDS2, CFH genotype was not even nominally associated with altered GA expansion rate. Hence, the minor allele at ARMS2/HTRA1 increases both the risk of GA development and of that GA, once present, expanding faster — presumably through the same mechanism, according to Occam's razor. By contrast, CFH haplotypes increase or decrease the risk of developing GA but do not alter the subsequent expansion rate.

### Generational differences in the 5-year incidence of age-related macular degeneration [^247c5d01]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Whether a reported decline in the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD) continued for people born during the Baby Boom years (1946–1964) or later is unknown. These data are important to plan for ocular health care needs in the 21st century.

Objectives

To determine whether the 5-year risk for AMD declined by generation and to identify factors that contributed to improvement in risk.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Data came from the longitudinal cohort Beaver Dam Eye Study (March 1, 1988, through September 15, 1990, and March 1, 1993, through June 15, 1995) and the Beaver Dam Offspring Study (June 8, 2005, through August 4, 2008, and July 12, 2010, through March 21, 2013). These population-based studies examined residents of Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, aged 43 to 84 years in 1987 through 1988 and their adult offspring aged 21 to 84 years in 2005 through 2008. A total of 4819 participants were at risk for developing AMD based on fundus images obtained at baseline visits. Data were analyzed from February 18, 2016, through June 22, 2017, with additional analyses ending September 22, 2017.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Fundus images were graded for AMD using the Wisconsin Age-related Maculopathy Grading System. The incidence of AMD was defined as the presence at the 5-year follow-up examination of pure geographic atrophy or exudative macular degeneration, any type of drusen with pigmentary abnormalities, or soft indistinct drusen without pigmentary abnormalities.

Results

Among the 4819 participants, the mean (SD) baseline age of the cohort was 54 (11) years; 2117 were men (43.9%) and 2702 were women (56.1%). The 5-year age- and sex-adjusted incidence of AMD was 8.8% in the Greatest Generation (born during 1901–1924), 3.0% in the Silent Generation (born during 1925–1945), 1.0% in the Baby Boom Generation (born during 1946–1964), and 0.3% in Generation X (born during 1965–1984). Adjusting for age and sex, each generation was more than 60% less likely to develop AMD than the previous generation (relative risk, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.24–0.46). The generational association (relative risk, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.57) remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, educational attainment, exercise, levels of non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and multivitamins.

Conclusions and Relevance

The 5-year risk for AMD declined by birth cohorts throughout the 20th century. Factors that explain this decline in risk are not known. However, this pattern is consistent with reported declines in risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia, suggesting that aging Baby Boomers may experience better retinal health at older ages than did previous generations.

### Risk factors for age-related macular degeneration: pooled findings from three continents [^b3270341]. Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the prevalence and potential risk factors for late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in three racially similar populations from North America, Europe, and AUSTRALIA:

Design

Combined analysis of population-based eye disease prevalence data.

Participants

There were 14,752 participants with gradable photographs from the Beaver Dam Eye Study (n = 4756), Rotterdam Study (n = 6411), and Blue Mountains Eye Study (n = 3585).

Main Outcome Measures

AMD diagnosis was made from masked grading of stereo macular photographs. Final classification of AMD cases was agreed by consensus between study investigators.

Results

AMD prevalence was strongly age related. Overall, AMD was present in 0.2% of the combined population aged 55 to 64 years, rising to 13% of the population older than 85 years. Prevalence of neovascular AMD (NV) increased from 0.17% among subjects aged 55 to 64 years to 5.8% for those older than 85 years. Prevalence of pure geographic atrophy (GA) increased from 0.04% to 4.2% for these age groups. There were no significant gender differences in the prevalence of NV or GA. Subjects in the Rotterdam population had a significantly lower age-adjusted and smoking-adjusted risk of NV than subjects in the Beaver Dam and Blue Mountains populations. Apart from age, tobacco smoking was the only risk factor consistently associated with any form of AMD in all sites separately and in pooled analyses over the three sites.

Conclusions

These combined data from racially similar communities across three continents provide strong and consistent evidence that tobacco smoking is the principal known preventable exposure associated with any form of AMD.

### Risk assessment model for development of advanced age… [^fa6a835a]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Table 1 illustrates the univariate association of baseline factors with progression to advanced AMD. These included age, cigarette smoking, family history, BMI, education, simple scale score, very large drusen, unilateral AMD, and variants in the genes CFH, ARMS2, C3, and CFI. Of these individuals, the initial occurrence of advanced AMD was GA in 36 cases and NV in 10 cases. Of those with NV in 1 eye at baseline, 176 developed advanced AMD in the fellow eye. Of these individuals, the initial occurrence of advanced AMD was NV in 136 cases and GA in 40 cases. There was no predictive value for either genotype in differentiating progression to GA or to NV after correction for multiple testing. We constructed a predictive model for development of advanced AMD comprising demographic and environmental, phenotypic, and genetic risk factors.

Risk models have been developed for several multifactorial diseases, including cardiovascular disease, 41–44 diabetes, 45–49 and cancer. 50–53 Risk models for ophthalmic diseases have been reported for primary open-angle glaucoma54-56 and proliferative vitreoretinopathy. 57 With regard to AMD, several articles have discussed the potential value of genetic testing alone or in combination with other factors for predicting development of advanced AMD, 9, 58–62 and predictive models have recently been presented. 16, 17, 63. The prediction model for advanced AMD described by Seddon et al16 was derived from the AREDS population and included demographic, environmental, and genetic risk factors along with baseline ocular phenotypic features using the AREDS categorical scale. A second model described by Zanke et al17 included age, cigarette smoking, and a panel of genetic risk variants that provided a lifetime risk estimate for developing advanced AMD.

A risk score for development of GA was recently presented, comprising age, ocular phenotype, smoking status, hypertension, and night vision score in CAPT participants.
63. If genetic information were available, his 5-year risk for advanced AMD would be 13%, 25%, or 34% depending on his CFH and ARMS2 genotypes. This additional information might be of more benefit in the future as new and more effective preventive measures and treatments at earlier stages of AMD become available.

### Geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration: a tale of two stages [^4cd9bb12]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Environmental Factors

"I am not old, but my young way was never the way to age".

Cigarette smoking has consistently been demonstrated as a strong risk factor for the development of late AMD, including GA. Evidence for altered GA expansion rate according to smoking status has been less consistent. However, in 1 of the largest studies, multivariable analyses of the AREDS2 cohort of 1616 eyes with GA revealed a nominally significant association between smoking status (current vs. former vs. never) and faster GA expansion. Similarly, in longitudinal phenotypic cluster analyses of the same cohort, positive smoking status and faster GA expansion rate characterized a prominent cluster division. Hence, this factor appears to be active and operating in the same direction at both disease stages, perhaps like heat in the context of forest fire initiation and spread.

"La destinée des nations dépend de la manière dont elles se nourrissent "

Like smoking, dietary pattern has consistently been identified as a strong risk or protective factor for the development of late AMD and particularly GA. Comprehensive longitudinal analyses using detailed data on diet, genetics, and AMD status have been conducted in the AREDS and AREDS2. In both cohorts, closer adherence to a Mediterranean-like dietary pattern was very strongly associated with decreased risk of progression to late AMD; this was particularly true for GA. Similarly, regarding GA expansion, multivariable analyses of an AREDS2 cohort of 1155 eyes with GA showed that closer adherence to a Mediterranean-like dietary pattern was strongly associated with slower GA enlargement. Therefore, like smoking, this environmental factor appears to be active and operating in the same direction at both disease stages (Table 1).

### Risk characteristics of the combined geographic atrophy and choroidal neovascularisation phenotype in age-related macular degeneration [^017a5c7b]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate the risk characteristics of the combined geographic atrophy (GA) and choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) phenotype of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) compared to GA or CNV.

Methods

Patients with advanced AMD were identified and divided into three groups using multimodal imaging: patients with GA in at least one eye, patients with CNV in at least one eye, and patients with simultaneous GA and CNV in at least one eye. Epidemiologic and clinical factors were gathered from patient questionnaires. Genotypes for age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) and complement factor H (CFH) were determined.

Results

42 patients with GA or CNV, and 16 patients with combined GA/CNV were identified. Patients with the combined phenotype were older (86.4 vs 81.8years, p = 0.049), and had a higher prevalence of advanced AMD in the fellow eye (81.3% vs 31.0%, p < 0.001). CFH and ARMS2 risk alleles were not associated with the combined phenotype.

Conclusions

The combined GA/CNV phenotype has similar epidemiologic, clinical, and genetic features as GA and CNV, but occurs at an older age and is more associated with advanced AMD in the fellow eye, suggesting that all these phenotypes are part of the same spectrum of disease and that the combined phenotype represents an even more advanced form of AMD than either GA or CNV.

### Comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation preferred practice pattern ® [^dca6f3cb]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) — epidemiology, risks, and management — remains a major U.S. burden and is a leading cause of severe vision impairment among white Americans; in 2004 approximately 1.75 million people aged 40 years or older had neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy and 7.3 million had high-risk features such as large drusen (≥ 125 μm). Prevalence estimates show 6.5% in 2005–2008 versus 9.4% in 1988–1994 with a decreasing incidence, and prevalence in white females rises from 0.3% at ages 60 to 64 to 16.4% in those 80 and older. AREDS defined a role for nutritional supplements, and the AREDS2 formulation (vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, copper, lutein, zeaxanthin) has been shown to have preventive efficacy in higher-risk patients; an estimated 8 million persons at least 55 years old with monocular or binocular intermediate AMD or monocular advanced AMD should be considered to be at high risk for progression of advanced AMD and are the population for whom the AREDS2 formulation should be considered, with more than 300,000 potentially delaying disease progression and associated vision loss if given supplements. Cigarette smoking is a risk factor whose effect increases with pack-years, and smoking-cessation counseling may influence patients to stop smoking, reducing the risk of AMD progression. Early treatment is associated with a more favorable prognosis; in non-Hispanic white patients, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment given within 2 years after diagnosis has been shown to reduce legal blindness and visual impairment, and the standard of care is to treat neovascular AMD as soon as diagnosis has been made.

### The role of nutritional factors in transitioning between early, mid, and late stages of age-related macular degeneration: prospective longitudinal analysis [^3d71edaa]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial disease causing vision loss in an estimated 20 million people living in the United States, of which there are 18 million people affected with early and intermediate non-advanced AMD. Across the globe, prevalence of AMD is expected to surge to 288 million in 2040, and with the recent increase in life expectancies, this chronic neurodegenerative disease heavily impacts vision loss and quality of life in industrialized nations. Therefore, prevention is of utmost importance.

AMD is usually initially diagnosed by the presence of drusen abnormalities under the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) or retina. Even before noticeable visual acuity changes, other visual disturbances such as loss of dark adaptation owing to photoreceptor loss and RPE dysfunction are often seen with earlier non-advanced stages of AMD. As the disease advances from early and intermediate non-advanced stages to later advanced stages of geographic atrophy (GA) and neovascularization (NV), individuals experience central vision loss, making it harder to see faces, read, or drive. Because earlier non-advanced stages precede advanced end points of GA with limited therapeutic options and NV with a high burden of intravitreal injections, there is a growing need for prevention to decrease the rate of progression to both non-advanced and advanced stages of macular degeneration.

### Mechanisms of age-related macular degeneration and therapeutic opportunities [^0a611a3b]. The Journal of Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

As the age of the population increases in many nations, age-related degenerative diseases pose significant socioeconomic challenges. One of the key degenerative diseases that compromise quality of life is age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is a multi-faceted condition that affects the central retina, which ultimately leads to blindness in millions of people worldwide. The pathophysiology and risk factors for AMD are complex, and the symptoms manifest in multiple related but distinct forms. The ability to develop effective treatments for AMD will depend on a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, risk factors, and driver molecular pathways, as well as the ability to develop useful animal models. This review provides an overview of the aforementioned aspects in AMD.

### MACULAR ATROPHY INCIDENCE IN ANTI-VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR-TREATED NEOVASCULAR AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION: risk factor evaluation for individualized treatment need of ranibizumab or aflibercept according to an observe-and-plan regimen [^1c924c68]. Retina (2019). Medium credibility.

In the industrial world, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe visual loss in people older than 50 yearsbecause of neovascular AMD (nAMD) and geographic atrophy (GA). The current standard of care for nAMD consists of repeated intravitreal injections of anti–vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGF). These are drugs that inhibit the actions of vascular endothelial growth factor, and they have demonstrated similar improved visual outcomes with ranibizumab, aflibercept, and bevacizumab. The introduction of anti-VEGF treatment has profoundly changed the visual prognosis of nAMD. However, concerns have been raised about progressive loss of the benefit in the long-term results, which has been linked to progressive appearance of atrophy in eyes treated with anti-VEGF for nAMD. Atrophy is cited as the primary reason for visual acuity loss in patients with nAMD receiving anti-VEGF treatment.

Macular atrophy (MA) is a term encompassing GA and atrophy, which forms in association with regressed neovascularization. To date, it is not entirely clear to what degree the atrophic changes in treated nAMD are due to the underlying degenerative process of AMD, are induced by the neovascular complex, or result from the anti-VEGF treatment. Reports showing higher MA incidence under ranibizumab compared with bevacizumaband under monthly retreatment compared with pro re nata have raised concerns. While a range of ocular baseline factors have been shown to be associated with MA incidence, – the role of anti-VEGF treatment in MA development remains controversial, both in terms of treatment frequency and treatment agent. In addition, the effect of aflibercept regarding MA development has not yet been investigated. Although the consensus remains that undertreatment — not overtreatment — poses the greater danger to vision in nAMD, better understanding of the role of anti-VEGF in the development of MA is necessary. The aim of this study was to investigate treatment factors, along with ocular and systemic factors for their association with MA incidence in eyes with nAMD treated with anti-VEGF aflibercept or ranibizumab according to their individualized need.

### Alcohol consumption and risk of age-related macular degeneration and geographic atrophy progression: age-related eye diseases study 2 report 34 [^5c4f145e]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To examine potential relationships between alcohol consumption and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) progression, including progression to late AMD and geographic atrophy (GA) enlargement rate.

Design

Post hoc analysis of cohorts within the Age-Related Eye Diseases Study 2.

Participants

A total of 6670 eyes (of 3673 participants) with no late AMD at baseline; 1143 eyes (of 841 participants) with GA at ≥ 2 consecutive visits.

Methods

Color fundus photographs were collected at annual study visits and graded centrally for late AMD, GA area, and GA proximity. Alcohol consumption was calculated by food frequency questionnaire. Regression analyses of disease progression were performed according to alcohol consumption.

Main Outcome Measures

Progression to late AMD and its subtypes; GA area-based progression; GA proximity-based progression.

Results

Over a mean follow-up of 4.5 years, 40.2% of eyes progressed to late AMD. In men, with alcohol tertile 1 (no regular consumption) as reference, hazard ratios for progression to late AMD were 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55–0.87; P = 0.0015) for tertile 2 and 0.85 (0.71–1.02; P = 0.079) for tertile 3. In women, hazard ratios were 1.12 (0.95–1.31, P = 0.17) and 0.85 (0.72–1.00, P = 0.046), respectively. Over a mean follow-up of 3.1 years, GA area-based progression was significantly faster in women than men, at 0.295 (95% CI, 0.278–0.311) and 0.260 mm/year (95% CI, 0.241–0.279), respectively (P = 0.007). In men, area-based progression differed significantly by alcohol tertile (P = 0.0001), at 0.275 (95% CI, 0.248–0.303), 0.183 (95% CI, 0.143–0.223), and 0.280 mm/year (0.254–0.306) in tertiles 1 to 3, respectively. In women, the area-based rate did not differ significantly by alcohol tertile (P = 0.11). In men only, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-defined heavy drinking was associated with faster progression (P = 0.024), at 0.306 (95% CI, 0.262–0.349) versus 0.252 mm/year (95% CI, 0.233–0.270). In 808 eyes with noncentral GA, GA proximity-based progression did not differ significantly by alcohol tertile (P = 0.55).

Conclusions

Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with decreased risk of progression to late AMD in men. Geographic atrophy progression is faster in women, but its relationship with alcohol consumption is much stronger in men. In men, moderate consumption is associated with slower GA progression and higher consumption with faster progression. Although some of these associations may also relate to confounding, they might suggest that individuals with GA should avoid high alcohol consumption.

### Evaluating a causal relationship between complement factor I protein level and advanced age-related macular degeneration using mendelian randomization [^74db6c9f]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible central vision loss among elderly Western populations. Age-related macular degeneration is a progressive retinal disease in which the early stages are characterized by drusen and pigmentary changes, causing mild visual impairment. Many patients progress to advanced AMD (AAMD), which has 2 subtypes: exudative AMD, involving angiogenesis in the choroid and macular neovascularization (MNV), and nonexudative AMD, involving degeneration or geographic atrophy (GA) of the retinal pigment epithelium. The prevalence of AAMD in European individuals 65 to 69 years of age is approximately 0.5%, rising to 9.8% in those 85 years of age or older.

Antiangiogenic agents are effective at controlling MNV; however, treated patients still have residual visual disability because of varying levels of retinal tissue disruption and atrophy, and monthly intravitreal injections are invasive and costly, with increased risk of intraocular infection. Antioxidant and mineral supplementation can reduce the progression of nonexudative AMD to exudative AMD; however, to date, no effective treatment exists for nonexudative AMD.

The natural history of AMD has been studied extensively, and despite much effort invested in the identification of different biomarkers to identify high-risk individuals to guide screening, monitoring, and treatment options and outcomes, these remain confined to research settings and have not yet moved into clinical practice. Advances in retinal imaging techniques have improved diagnosis and guide disease management, and efforts continue to refine disease characterization and selection of anatomic features that may be used as end points in future clinical trials to improve chances of success.

Understanding the cause of nonexudative AMD has been limited partly because of lack of relevant animal disease models. Age-related macular degeneration development is influenced by advancing age, lifestyle factors like smoking and a high body mass index, and a positive family history of the disease. Compared with other complex traits, AMD has a strong genetic influence: heritability is estimated to be approximately 46% for disease development and for 71% disease severity. Study of human genetic variation can help to improve our biological understanding of causal pathways for disease, and this in turn has the potential to translate into improved clinical diagnostics and drug target selection. For AMD, several hypotheses for disease development and progression have focused on the underlying pathogenic pathways related to genetic predisposition.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^bc453ff8]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to risk factors (genetic factors), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that currently, only post hoc analysis data are available, and results are conflicting. One or more prospective clinical trials will need to demonstrate the value of genetic testing in AMD. Thus, the routine use of genetic testing is not supported by the existing literature and is not recommended at this time. Other variants are being studied, but there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations at this time.

Study Selection

Searches were completed by 28 February 2007 and yielded 295 references. The abstracts of these articles were independently reviewed by two researchers (LP and CE) and relevant data (e.g. study design, risk factor, type of AMD) was recorded on a study-specific abstraction form. Full-text articles were then obtained based on the initial screening of abstracts and the data extraction form was completed. Any disagreements between the two reviewers in the abstract review or following selection of articles for full text review were resolved by discussion. The bibliographies of the full text articles that were reviewed were searched for relevant references.

In all, 128 unduplicated references were initially identified as being of potential relevance (the search was repeated in November 2008 and seven additional articles published in 2008 were included), with 12 additional articles retrieved from the reference lists. From the total of 147 articles, 70 fulfilled all eligibility criteria and were selected for meta-analysis. One study was excluded since the outcome was determined by clinical criteria rather than retinal photography. In addition, 24 articles were excluded since authors reported progression for early AMD as well as late AMD. In the final pool, 45 articles were retained for the meta-analyses including articles with results from 18 prospective studies, and cross-sectional studies, and 8 case control studies (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Study selection process.

Data Synthesis

We used Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2 for all meta-analyses. An overall meta-analysis was performed for each risk factor if there were two or more risk estimates irrespective of study design. In addition, since the study design could influence the risk estimate, meta-analyses were performed for each major type of study within each risk factor. We conducted fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analyses to combine these outcomes across included studies by study design, estimating overall raw point estimates of each risk factor and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). The selection of fixed-effects vs. random-effects models was based on the reported I-squared value and associated p-value. If the p-value was < 0.10 then random-effects was chosen, otherwise fixed-effects was selected, except when there was clear heterogeneity based on individual study results and in these instances the more conservative random-effects was selected. Forest plots were used to graphically present the significant findings. Funnel plots were produced to explore the potential for publication bias.

### Colorado AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION REGISTRY: design and clinical risk factors of the cohort [^f07e7aae]. Retina (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To study new and existing risk factors related to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) phenotypes in a Colorado cohort.

Methods

Age-related macular degeneration was categorized into early, intermediate, or advanced forms. Controls (n = 180) were patients with cataract and no AMD. Demographic and clinical data were gathered by patient interview and verified by chart review. Image data were reviewed by vitreoretinal specialists. Statistical analysis included univariable and multivariate logistic regression analysis (P < 0.05).

Results

Among the 456 patients with AMD, 157 (34.4%), 80 (17.6%), and 219 (48.0%) had the early/intermediate, geographic atrophy, and neovascular forms of the disease, respectively. Adjusted for age, African-American race was associated with a reduced risk of early/intermediate (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.08, confidence interval [CI] = 0.01–0.67) and neovascular AMD (AOR = 0.15, CI = 0.03–0.72). A family history of AMD was a risk factor for early/intermediate (AOR = 4.08, CI = 2.30–7.25), geographic atrophy (AOR = 8.62, CI = 3.77–19.7), and neovascular AMD (AOR = 3.76, CI = 2.16–6.56). A history of asthma was related to the early/intermediate form of AMD (AOR = 2.34, CI = 1.22–4.46).

Conclusion

Studying AMD in specific populations may reveal novel risk factors such as our finding of a relationship between asthma history and AMD.

### Night vision symptoms and progression of age-related macular degeneration in the complications of age-related macular degeneration prevention trial [^b124a535]. Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe baseline night vision symptoms and their association with ≥ 3-lines loss in visual acuity (VA), choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and geographic atrophy (GA).

Design

Cohort study within a multicenter randomized clinical trial.

Participants

A total of 1052 participants with ≥ 10 large (> 125 mu) drusen and VA ≥ 20/40 in each eye.

Methods

At baseline, participants self-administered a 10-item Night Vision Questionnaire (NVQ-10). VA testing was performed at baseline, 6 months, and annually. One eye of each participant was randomly assigned to laser treatment, and the contralateral eye was assigned to observation. During follow-up, trained readers identified CNV on the basis of fluorescein angiograms and end point GA, defined as > 1 disc area of new GA, based on color photographs. Evaluation was performed by repeated-measures logistic regression for NVQ-10 score as a risk factor for ≥ 3-lines loss in VA and by survival analysis for CNV and GA, with and without adjustment for participant and ocular characteristics. Evaluations were based on observed eyes and treated eyes, considered separately and combined.

Main Outcome Measures

A ≥ 3-lines loss in VA, development of CNV and end point GA.

Results

At baseline, NVQ-10 scores ranged from 3 to 100 with a mean of 70 (100 corresponds to no night vision symptoms). Compared with participants with the best night vision (fourth quartile of scores), participants with the worst night vision (first quartile of scores) were at increased risk of ≥ 3-lines loss in VA in both observed and treated eyes; odds ratios (95% confidence interval) were 2.85 (1.85–4.39) and 2.00 (1.27–3.14), respectively. The relative risk for the first quartile versus the fourth quartile for development of GA was 4.18 (1.80–9.68) in observed eyes and 2.59 (1.13–5.95) in treated eyes. The relative risk for CNV incidence was 1.99 (1.12–3.54) in observed eyes and 1.33 (0.81–2.19) in treated eyes. These relationships were maintained after adjustment for baseline participant and ocular characteristics.

Conclusions

Participants who perceived the most problems in their night vision at baseline had an increased risk of ≥ 3-lines loss in VA, CNV, and GA. These associations are independent of established risk factors.

### Geographic atrophy in patients with advanced dry age-related macular degeneration: current challenges and future prospects [^b3fc584d]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Drusen-associated GA

Drusen-associated GA can result in severe irreversible central vision loss due to the formation of dense scotomas resulting in deficits in reading and many other visual tasks common in daily life. The decline in vision may be minor in early stages if the fovea is spared, but later becomes severe with central involvement. Often, the GA will begin with one or more regions of RPE dropout that are near but not in the fovea (Figure 1). Patients with GA, even in late stages, may maintain good central vision over some time, but visual dysfunction is underestimated until the disease progression involves the central fovea and there is acuity loss. The peripheral spread is typically faster than toward the center for unknown reasons. There is loss of measurable retinal sensitivity in regions of GA, and patients may notice paracentral scotomas development. Expansion of the atrophic regions inevitably occurs, sometimes with multiple regions merging together and eventually invading the fovea (Figure 2). VA as measured on eye charts does not correlate well with GA lesions or progression, prompting the development of alternative end points for clinical research to test therapeutic agents.

Clinically and by color fundus photography, the development of GA mirrors the appearance of the lesions pathologically. The photographic definition of GA is at least two out of three of the following characteristics: sharp demarcation, round or ovoid shape, visibility of the choroidal vessels (Figure 1). Typically, large confluent drusen eventually develop overlying pigment clumping with fading of the drusen, accompanying loss of RPE pigment to eventually produce a region of pigment loss with relatively sharp margins, revealing the underlying choroidal vessels.–In the AREDS, the time from drusen confluence to GA averaged 5.9 years, and the time from development of hyperpigmentation was 2.5 years. The prediction of development of GA is much greater based upon local ocular features, such as drusen area, hypopigmentation of the RPE, and pigment clumps rather than genetic and demographic risk factors. Quantification of AMD fundus photographic features has been proposed by the AREDS group based upon risk of progression to late AMD outcome. This scale is based upon reading center grading of fundus photographs as a research tool and is far too detailed for clinical use, but does appear to have predictive value in other research populations. The risk of progression to central GA over 5 years ranges from 12% to 20% among eyes with drusen area more than half disc area (1.27 mm²) and depigmentation more than questionably present. Progression from noncentral to central GA occurs in 45% of eyes over 5 years. An alternate, highly simplified version for use by clinicians has also been developed by the AREDS groupand appears to have good utility and demonstrates predictive value in other study populations. A feature not taken into account by the AREDS scales is the presence of what has been variably called reticular pseudodrusen and subretinal drusenoid deposits. These have the appearance of drusen-like dots and ribbons that may coalesce into a continuous sheet. There is evidence that subretinal drusenoid deposits, which differ from typical drusen in that their location is between the RPE and photoreceptor layers, may have a strong association with development of late AMD, particularly with GA.–A spatiotemporal relationship between these deposit and GA has been suggested, which also suggests that these deposits may typify at least one pathway that leads to GA. A two-compartment model whereby these deposits are related to disturbed outer segment lipid homeostasis has been proposed. Subretinal drusenoid deposits have also been suggested to be a marker for choroidal and choriocapillary atrophy and may be related to the vascular component of degenerative changes associated with GA.

### Clinical classification of age-related macular degeneration [^1017f735]. Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a clinical classification system for age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Design

Evidence-based investigation, using a modified Delphi process.

Participants

Twenty-six AMD experts, 1 neuro-ophthalmologist, 2 committee chairmen, and 1 methodologist.

Methods

Each committee member completed an online assessment of statements summarizing current AMD classification criteria, indicating agreement or disagreement with each statement on a 9-step scale. The group met, reviewed the survey results, discussed the important components of a clinical classification system, and defined new data analyses needed to refine a classification system. After the meeting, additional data analyses from large studies were provided to the committee to provide risk estimates related to the presence of various AMD lesions.

Main Outcome Measures

Delphi review of the 9-item set of statements resulting from the meeting.

Results

Consensus was achieved in generating a basic clinical classification system based on fundus lesions assessed within 2 disc diameters of the fovea in persons older than 55 years. The committee agreed that a single term, age-related macular degeneration, should be used for the disease. Persons with no visible drusen or pigmentary abnormalities should be considered to have no signs of AMD. Persons with small drusen (< 63 μm), also termed drupelets, should be considered to have normal aging changes with no clinically relevant increased risk of late AMD developing. Persons with medium drusen (≥ 63- < 125 μm), but without pigmentary abnormalities thought to be related to AMD, should be considered to have early AMD. Persons with large drusen or with pigmentary abnormalities associated with at least medium drusen should be considered to have intermediate AMD. Persons with lesions associated with neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy should be considered to have late AMD. Five-year risks of progressing to late AMD are estimated to increase approximately 100 fold, ranging from a 0.5% 5-year risk for normal aging changes to a 50% risk for the highest intermediate AMD risk group.

Conclusions

The proposed basic clinical classification scale seems to be of value in predicting the risk of late AMD. Incorporating consistent nomenclature into the practice patterns of all eye care providers may improve communication and patient care.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^926e3d81]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Geographic atrophy (GA) in age-related macular degeneration — burden and progression metrics: Geographic atrophy involving the foveal center causes approximately 10% of all AMD-related visual loss of 20/200 or worse, and the presence of GA in the central 1-mm zone of the macula correlates with reduced VA, whereas total geographic atrophy area correlates poorly to VA. Reported GA growth rates range from 1.28 to 2.60 mm² per year. In the Proxima A and B studies, conversion to GA or CNV in the fellow eye was reported in 30% and 6.7% of patients, respectively, at 12 months with GA or CNV in one eye.

### COMPLETE RETINAL PIgMENT EPITHELIAL AND OUTER RETINAL ATROPHY IN AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION: a longitudinal evaluation [^b75df030]. Retina (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There is a need for robust earlier biomarkers of atrophic age-related macular degeneration that could act as surrogate endpoints for geographic atrophy (GA) in early interventional trials. This study sought to examine the risk of progression of complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) to the traditional atrophic endpoint of GA on color fundus photography. This study also compared the risk of progression for cRORA to that associated with the specific optical coherence tomography features that define nascent GA (nGA), a strong predictor of GA development.

Methods

One hundred forty participants with bilateral large drusen at baseline underwent optical coherence tomography imaging and color fundus photography at 6-month intervals for up to 36 months. Optical coherence tomography volume scans were graded for the presence of cRORA and nGA, and color fundus photographs were graded for the presence of GA. The association and rate of progression to GA for cRORA and nGA were examined.

Results

Both cRORA and nGA were significantly associated with GA development (adjusted hazard ratio, 65.7 and 76.8 respectively; both P < 0.001). The probability of progression of cRORA to GA over 24 months (26%) was significantly lower than the probability of progression of nGA (38%; P = 0.039).

Conclusion

This study confirmed that cRORA was a significant risk factor for developing GA, although its rate of progression was slightly lower compared with nGA. While requiring replication in future studies, these findings suggest that the specific features of photoreceptor degeneration used to define nGA appear important when assessing the risk of progression.

### Incidence of macular atrophy after untreated neovascular age-related macular degeneration: age-related eye disease study report 40 [^0a46483f]. Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To report the natural history of untreated neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) regarding subsequent macular atrophy.

Design

Prospective cohort within a randomized, controlled trial of oral micronutrient supplements.

Participants

Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) participants (55–80 years) who demonstrated nAMD during follow-up (1992–2005), prior to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy.

Methods

Color fundus photographs were collected at annual study visits and graded centrally for late age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Incident macular atrophy after nAMD was examined by Kaplan-Meier analysis and proportional hazards regression.

Main Outcome Measures

Incident macular atrophy after nAMD.

Results

Of the 4757 AREDS participants, 708 eyes (627 participants) demonstrated nAMD during follow-up and were eligible. The cumulative risks of incident macular atrophy after untreated nAMD were 9.6% (standard error, 1.2%), 31.4% (standard error, 2.2%), 43.1% (standard error, 2.6%), and 61.5% (standard error, 4.3%) at 2, 5, 7, and 10 years, respectively. This corresponded to a linear risk of 6.5% per year. The cumulative risk of central involvement was 30.4% (standard error, 3.2%), 43.4% (standard error, 3.8%), and 57.0% (standard error, 4.8%) at first appearance of atrophy, 2 years, and 5 years, respectively. Geographic atrophy (GA) in the fellow eye was associated with increased risk of macular atrophy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17–2.49; P = 0.006). However, higher 52-single nucleotide polymorphism AMD genetic risk score was not associated with increased risk of macular atrophy (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.90–1.17; P = 0.67). Similarly, no significant differences were observed according to SNPs at CFH, ARMS2, or C3.

Conclusions

The rate of incident macular atrophy after untreated nAMD is relatively high, increasing linearly over time and affecting half of eyes by 8 years. Hence, factors other than anti-VEGF therapy are involved in atrophy development, including natural progression to GA. Comparison with studies of treated nAMD suggests it may not be necessary to invoke a large effect of anti-VEGF therapy on inciting macular atrophy, although a contribution remains possible. Central involvement is present in one third of eyes at the outset (similar to pure GA) and increases linearly to half at 3 years.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor use and atrophy in neovascular age-related macular degeneration: systematic literature review and expert opinion [^4da1fb0e]. Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Topic

To summarize the rates of atrophy, risk factors, and atrophy-associated visual outcomes in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) who received anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment for macular neovascularization (MNV).

Clinical Relevance

Age-related macular degeneration is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, and VEGF inhibitors are the primary treatment for nAMD. However, atrophy is observed frequently in eyes treated with anti-VEGF therapy, prompting questions regarding a causative role for these therapies in atrophy development.

Methods

PubMed was searched for articles published in the past 5 years (January 1, 2014, through January 10, 2019). Studies including atrophy outcome(s) in patients with age-related macular degeneration who received anti-VEGF treatment were included. Review articles, retrospective studies, case reports or studies, preclinical studies, prevalence data reports, and non-English studies were excluded. Randomization was not required.

Results

Overall, 145 studies were identified; 29 publications were included, with cohorts ranging from 8 to 1185 eyes. Imaging methods used to assess atrophy varied across studies. All studies confirmed the occurrence of atrophy, and when available, longitudinal data from the included studies demonstrated an increase in atrophy incidence over time. Key risk factors or phenotypes associated with atrophy were fellow eye atrophy, reticular pseudodrusen, increased injections, and type 3 lesion. In addition, visual acuity loss was noted with foveal atrophy.

Discussion

All studies demonstrated that atrophy occurs in the context of MNV treated with anti-VEGF therapy; however, it is not clear whether anti-VEGF treatment is causative of atrophy versus being associated with atrophy development. The included studies were not designed or powered to assess atrophy as a primary outcome. In addition, it is difficult to determine whether prognostic factors directly affect atrophy. Furthermore, patient populations in clinical trials do not necessarily represent real-world patients. Although phenotypes and risk factors may help to identify those at greater risk of atrophy developing, it is important to recognize that adequately treating exudative MNV remains the best option to optimize vision outcomes in patients with nAMD, particularly given the risk of vision loss with undertreatment observed in the real world.

### Risk models for progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration using demographic, environmental, genetic, and ocular factors [^8b72b982]. Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To expand our predictive models for progression to advanced stages of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) based on demographic, environmental, genetic, and ocular factors, using longer follow-up, time varying analyses, calculation of absolute risks, adjustment for competing risks, and detailed baseline AMD and drusen status.

Design

Prospective, longitudinal study.

Participants

We included 2937 individuals in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study, of which 819 subjects progressed to advanced AMD during 12 years of follow-up.

Methods

Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to calculate hazard ratios for progression. Covariates included demographic and environmental factors, 6 variants in 5 genes, baseline macular drusen size, and presence and type of advanced AMD in 1 eye at baseline. To assess the ability of risk scores based on all covariates to discriminate between progressors and nonprogressors, an algorithm was developed and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated. To validate the overall model, the total sample was randomly subdivided into derivation and test samples. Another model was built based on the derivation sample and assessed for calibration and discrimination in the test sample. Sample sizes needed for testing new treatments in clinical trials were estimated based on models with and without genetic variables.

Main Outcome Measures

Progression to advanced AMD, including geographic atrophy and neovascular disease.

Results

In multivariate models, age, smoking, body mass index, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CFH, ARMS2/HTRA1, C3, C2, and CFB genes, as well as presence of advanced AMD in 1 eye and drusen size in both eyes were all independently associated with progression. The AUC for progression at 10 years in the model with genetic factors, drusen size, and environmental covariates was 0.915 in the total sample. In the test sample, based on a model estimated from the derivation sample, the AUC was 0.908. The sample sizes needed for clinical trials were estimated to be lower when genetic susceptibility was considered.

Conclusions

Factors reflective of nature and nurture were incorporated into an expanded algorithm for risk prediction, which performed very well in both derivation and test samples. Risk scores and predicted progression rates will be useful for AMD surveillance and for designing clinical trials.

### Age-related macular degeneration [^3a660029]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration is an increasingly important public health issue due to ageing populations and increased longevity. Age-related macular degeneration affects individuals older than 55 years and threatens high-acuity central vision required for important tasks such as reading, driving, and recognising faces. Advances in retinal imaging have identified biomarkers of progression to late age-related macular degeneration. New treatments for neovascular age-related macular degeneration offer potentially longer-lasting effects, and progress is being made towards a treatment for atrophic late age-related macular degeneration. An effective intervention to slow progression in the earlier stages of disease, or to prevent late age-related macular degeneration development remains elusive, and our understanding of underlying mechanistic pathways continues to evolve.

### Local complement inhibition for geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration: prospects, challenges, and unanswered questions [^f8a2300f]. Ophthalmology Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Potential Challenges

However, several challenges present themselves. This degree of slower enlargement will be meaningful clinically over long periods only. This makes the risk-to-benefit balance more nuanced for each patient. Delivery requires intravitreal injection, and monthly dosing seems to be required. Because GA typically is bilateral, many patients will need 2 injections per month.

One important risk-to-benefit consideration is the increased risk of neovascular AMD (nAMD). In both trials, treatment caused a dose-dependent increase in exudative disease (17-fold with monthly C3 inhibition and 3-fold with monthly C5 inhibition). The eligibility criteria may explain this variation partially: in FILLY, but not in GATHER 1, fellow-eye nAMD was permitted (comprising 39%). In FILLY, with monthly treatment, the rate of nAMD was 33% in those with fellow-eye neovascularization, but 12% in those without (i.e. similar to the GATHER 1 rate of 9%–10%). Overall, the highest nAMD rates seem to occur with the combination of propensity (fellow-eye nAMD) and stimulus (higher dose or frequency). Some patients therefore might be discouraged from treatment for this reason.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to risk factors (other factors), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that an increased waist/hip ratio for men is associated with an increased risk of both early and late AMD. Markers of inflammation, such as CRP, may be associated with a higher risk of AMD progression. Other possible factors with inconclusive findings include: hormonal status; sunlight exposure; alcohol use; vitamins B and D status. A Cochrane systematic review in 2016 concluded insufficient evidence to define a role of statins in AMD onset or progression.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^33cbac82]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to natural history (advanced age-related macular degeneration, geographic atrophy), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that the phenotype of GA, the advanced form of non-neovascular AMD, will have one or more zones of well-demarcated RPE and/or choriocapillaris atrophy. Drusen and other pigmentary abnormalities may surround the atrophic areas. Severe VA loss occurs more slowly in patients with GA than in patients with neovascular AMD. Geographic atrophy involving the foveal center causes approximately 10% of all AMD-related visual loss of 20/200 or worse. The presence of GA in the central 1-mm zone of the macula correlates with reduced VA, whereas total geographic atrophy area correlates poorly to VA. Eyes with GA outside the fovea maintain relatively good VA, yet patients' QoL can be affected because the inner left subfield is associated with reading and the inner lower subfield is associated with distance vision activities. Several different studies have published GA growth rates that range from 1.28 to 2.6 mm² per year. In the Proxima A and B studies, conversion to GA or CNV in the fellow eye was reported in 30% and 6.7% of patients, respectively, at 12 months with GA or CNV in one eye. Growth rates of multifocal areas of GA increase over time faster than monofocal areas of GA. Extrafoveal lesions increase at a faster rate compared to foveal lesions. Larger areas of GA have greater rates of enlargement compared with smaller areas of GA. In cases of bilateral GA, the enlargement rates of the two eyes have high concordance. Neovascular AMD also may occur in eyes with GA.

Age-related macular degeneration — early AMD management and nutritional interventions: There is no evidence-based treatment for early AMD. According to the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS2), antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation should be considered in patients with intermediate AMD or geographic atrophy (GA) in one or both eyes and other advanced AMD in one eye. There is no evidence to support the use of these supplements for patients who have less than intermediate AMD and no evidence of any prophylactic value for family members without signs of AMD. A Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduced risk of developing AMD and of existing AMD becoming worse.

### Review: age-related macular degeneration… [^9404ec8b]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Review: Age-Related Macular Degeneration The VEHSS team conducted a review of published literature on examination-based population studies reporting the prevalence of age-related macular degeneration. Age-related macular degeneration is a disorder of the macula that may cause severe loss of central vision. There are three stages of AMD: Early, intermediate, and advanced/late. Although some variation in stage classification exists, in general early stage AMD is described as having numerous small drusen and fewer medium drusen under the retina, or mild hypo- or hyperpigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium in at least one eye. Intermediate AMD is distinguished by large drusen, retinal pigment changes, or geographic atrophy of the RPE not in the center of the fovea. AMD with the presence of drusen is also known as dry AMD.

The Age-related Eye Disease Study simple classification system defined four stages of early/intermediate AMD, on the basis of the cumulative number of risk factors evident across both eyes. Download the full report: Published Examination-Based Prevalence of Major Eye Disorders. There are two types of advanced or late stage AMD, thatare the vision-threatening stages of AMD: neovascular/exudative AMD and pure geographic atrophy. Neovascular/exudative AMD is indicated by the development of choroidal neovascularization. CNV is the growth of new blood veins under the macula that could potentially leak. Pure geographic atrophy is the degeneration of the RPE in the foveal center, causing scars in the foveal area and a loss of central vision. AMD is generally diagnosed through fundus photography.

The photographs image the retina and optic nerves and can be examined for signs of AMD and other eye conditions. Age-Related Macular Degeneration Literature Review Results There were 23 studies published between 1993 and 2016 that examined the prevalence of AMD:

### Prospective longitudinal evaluation of nascent geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration [^15726264]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Nascent geographic atrophy (nGA) describes features on OCT imaging previously observed to precede the development of atrophy. This study sought to prospectively evaluate the predictive ability of nGA for the conventional clinical endpoint of geographic atrophy (GA) as defined on color fundus photography (CFP).

Design

Prospective, longitudinal, observational study.

Participants

A total of 284 eyes from 142 participants with bilateral large drusen and without nGA nor late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) at baseline were included.

Methods

OCT volume scans and CFP images were obtained from all participants at baseline and then at 6-month intervals for up to 36 months. OCT and CFP images were graded independently for the presence of nGA and GA, respectively. Eyes that developed neovascular AMD were censored at the day of its detection.

Main Outcome Measures

Time to development of GA.

Results

A total 12 eyes from 10 participants progressed to GA over 36 months of follow-up, and nGA was detected in 10 of these eyes (83%) at a preceding visit (median, 13 months prior; interquartile range, 6–25 months). A total of 40 eyes from 28 participants developed nGA or GA over 36 months of follow-up, and the probability of progression to nGA and GA after 36 months was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 14%-28%) and 9% (95% CI, 6%-13%), respectively. After the detection of nGA, the probability of progression to GA was 38% (95% CI, 15%-55%) after 24 months. The development of nGA was associated with a markedly increased risk of progression to GA compared with when it did not develop (adjusted hazard ratio, 78.1; 95% CI, 13.6–448.0; P < 0.001), and the development of nGA explained 91% of the variance in the time to GA development.

Conclusions

This study prospectively demonstrated that nGA was a strong predictor for the development of GA, providing supportive evidence of the potential value of nGA as a surrogate endpoint in future intervention trials for the early stages of AMD to improve their feasibility substantially.

### Incidence, progression and risk factors of age-related macular degeneration in 35-95-year-old individuals from three jointly designed German cohort studies [^30c4e727]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Defining four types of events

All participants with AMD status assessed at baseline and follow-up were included in the present analysis. For each participant, we defined four types of 'events' based on the observed transition from baseline to follow-up AMD status: (1) 'incident early AMD' when the person had 'no AMD' at baseline and 'early AMD' at follow-up, (2) 'incident late AMD (definition-1)' for 'no AMD' at baseline and 'late AMD' at follow-up, (3) 'incident late AMD (definition 2)' for 'no AMD' or 'early AMD' at baseline and 'late AMD' at follow-up and (4) 'progression from early to late AMD' for 'early AMD' at baseline and 'late AMD' at follow-up. Analyses were restricted to the respective 'persons at risk': (1) individuals without AMD at baseline for incident early AMD or incident late AMD (definition 1), (2) individuals with no or early AMD at baseline for incident late AMD (definition 2), (3) individuals with baseline early AMD for progression.

### Lamellar macular holes in the presence of age-related macular degeneration [^beba3193]. Retina (2020). Medium credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of irreversible blindness that affects more than eight million individuals in the United States, is an intricate disease with genetic and environmental risk factors. Several classifications and grading systems for AMD have been proposed. – Ferris et alsuggested a basic clinical classification 5-point scale including the risk of progression. Age-related macular degeneration begins with the presence of small drusen, which gradually becomes larger and finally coalesce to form confluent drusen, accompanied by retinal hyperpigmentation. At that crucial point, the disease can progress to the advanced stages characterized by choroidal neovascularization and/or geographic atrophy resulting in severe vision loss. The advanced form of the disease affects more than 1.75 million individuals. Recently, Segal et alhave focused on LMH associated with end-stage exudative AMD. The mutualistic symbiotic relationship between the components of the photoreceptor, RPE, Bruch membrane, and choriocapillaris complex is altered in AMD. Age-related macular degeneration causes apoptosis of RPE cells and loss of the outer retina that could lead to disruption of cell-to-cell adhesions and foveal destabilization, thereby rendering the fovea more susceptible to LMH formation.

We hypothesize that the structural retinal changes seen in AMD are a predisposition for the development of LMH. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence and anatomical characteristics of LMH in presence of AMD.

### Optical coherence tomography predictors of risk for progression to non-neovascular atrophic age-related macular degeneration [^7178cd5d]. Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Appearance of geographic atrophy (GA) on color photography (CP) is preceded by specific features on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT). We aimed to build SD OCT-based risk assessment models for 5-year new onset of GA and central GA on CP.

Design

Prospective, longitudinal study.

Participants

Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 Ancillary SD OCT study participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with bilateral large drusen or noncentral GA and at least 1 eye without advanced disease (n = 317).

Methods

For 1 eye per participant, qualitative and quantitative SD OCT variables were derived from standardized grading and semiautomated segmentation, respectively, at baseline. Up to 7 years later, annual outcomes were extracted and analyzed to fit multivariate logistic regression models and build a risk calculator.

Main Outcome Measures

New onset of CP-visible GA and central GA.

Results

Over a follow-up median of 4.0 years and among 292 AMD eyes (without advanced disease at baseline) with complete outcome data, 46 (15.8%) developed central GA. Among 265 eyes without any GA on baseline CP, 70 (26.4%) developed CP-visible GA. Final multivariate models were adjusted for age. In the model for GA, the independent predicting SD OCT factors (P < 0.001–0.03) were: hyperreflective foci and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer atrophy or absence, followed by choroid thickness in absence of subretinal drusenoid deposits, photoreceptor outer segment loss, RPE drusen complex volume, and RPE drusen complex abnormal thinning volume. For central GA, the factors (P < 0.001) were RPE drusen complex abnormal thinning volume, intraretinal fluid or cystoid spaces, hyperreflective foci, and RPE layer atrophy or absence. The models yielded a calculator that computes the probabilities of CP-visible, new-onset GA and central GA after 1 to 5 years.

Conclusions

For AMD eyes with large drusen and no advanced disease, we built a novel risk assessment model-based on age and SD OCT segmentation, drusen characteristics, and retinal pathology-for progression to CP-visible GA over up to 5 years. This calculator may simplify SD OCT grading and with future validation has a promising role as a clinical prognostic tool.

### Association between genetic variation of complement C3 and the susceptibility to advanced age-related macular degeneration: a meta-analysis [^5cc247b5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex and progressive retinal disorder influenced by family history, aging, race, smoking and diet, which caused irreversible visual impairment in a growing number of elderly persons. The early stage of AMD is characterized by pigmentary abnormalities of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and extracellular deposits called drusen under the retina. As the condition progresses, two advanced forms of this disease are developed: extensive pigment epithelium atrophy (geographic atrophy or dry AMD) or subretinal choroidal neovascular membrane (exudative or wet AMD). Although constituting only 10–15% of all AMD cases, advanced forms account for nearly 80% of AMD-related blindness in western countries. It has been reported that the prevalence of advanced AMD is estimated at 3% in people aged > 65 years old, rising to 11% in those > 85 years old in developed world. While, the pooled prevalence of advanced AMD is 0.56% among aged 40–79 years in Asian countries.

### Complement cascade inhibition in geographic atrophy: a review [^fe5932a2]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for GA

Several prognostic factors influence GA risk including age, genetics, and various external factors such as smoking. Age is the most common predictor of GA, with multiple studies confirming that GA severity increases with age. GA is generally not common in individuals under age 50 years and, compared to individuals between ages 65 and 74, the risk of GA development increases more than threefold for those over age 75 years. In the USA, more than 30% of people over 85 years of age develop GA.

Various biological pathways play roles in AMD and progression to GA, with genetic factors a key determinant. Several genome-wide association studies indicate two main genetic loci with links to AMD and GA formation: 1q31 and 10q26, which correspond to the complement pathway and high-temperature requirement A serine peptidase 1/age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (HtrA1/ARMS2) gene polymorphisms, respectively. HtrA1 is a serine protease ubiquitously secreted by the RPE, and studies have shown that overexpression of HtrA1 increased defects in both the RPE and Bruch's membrane as well as increased risk for CNV. In this review, our main focus is the complement pathway, which comprises a cascade of enzymatic functions within the immune system response. In dry macular degeneration, complements C3 and C5 play a critical role. There are also rare mutations in complement factor H (CFH) and complement factor I (CFI), which potentially dysregulate the cellular pathway leading to AMD as well.

### Incomplete retinal pigment epithelial and outer retinal atrophy: longitudinal evaluation in age-related macular degeneration [^ee036f77]. Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To examine the association between incomplete retinal pigment epithelial and outer retinal atrophy (iRORA) on OCT imaging and the subsequent risk of developing geographic atrophy (GA) defined on conventional color fundus photography (CFP) and to compare this with the specific features that define nascent GA (nGA).

Design

Retrospective analysis of data from a longitudinal study.

Participants

A total of 280 eyes from 140 participants with bilateral large drusen without specific nGA-defining features or late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) at baseline.

Methods

OCT imaging and CFP were performed at baseline and then at 6-month intervals for up to 36 months. Eyes that developed neovascular AMD were censored on the day it was detected. OCT volume scans were graded for the presence of iRORA and nGA separately, and CFP images were graded for the presence of GA.

Main Outcome Measures

Association with and variance explained in time to GA development.

Results

A total of 58 eyes (21%) from 46 participants (33%) had iRORA at baseline, and a further 87 eyes (31%) developed iRORA over the follow-up period. Time-to-event analyses demonstrated that prevalent or incident iRORA was associated with an increased rate of GA development (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 12.1; P = 0.021), as was incident nGA (adjusted HR, 78.6; P < 0.001). However, only the specific nGA features (adjusted P < 0.001), and not iRORA (adjusted P = 0.520), were associated with an increased rate of GA development when both features were included in the same multivariable model. The proportion of variance explained in the time to GA development by iRORA itself (R² = 43%) was significantly lower than explained by nGA alone (R² = 91%; P = 0.010).

Conclusions

In this cohort, iRORA is a significant risk factor for GA development, but its association with GA development appears to be accounted for by the development of the specific features that define nGA. Although requiring replication, these findings provide useful guidance on the relative utility of nGA and iRORA as risk factors for GA and as potential surrogate end points for future interventional studies in the early stages of AMD.

### A proteogenomic signature of age-related macular degeneration in blood [^0caeceac]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

AMD is a progressive late-onset disease that primarily affects the macular area of the retina and is a common cause of permanent loss of vision in the elderly population. The clinical hallmark of early AMD is an accumulation of extracellular protein and lipid-containing deposits between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Bruch´s membrane, termed drusen. Advanced AMD can be either neovascular (nAMD) associated with blood vessel growth and leakage, or geographic atrophy (GA/dry AMD) characterized by patches of RPE cell and photoreceptor cell loss in the macula. Anti-VEGF therapy is highly effective in controlling the abnormal vessel growth and leakage in nAMD, however, the disease nevertheless progresses and by seven years, 98% of nAMD patients have atrophy. Patients with GA have marked visual disability with relentless visual deterioration and progression to legal blindness. There are currently no approved therapies for GA or early AMD. Elucidation of AMD pathobiology and identification of modifiable targets are critical for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers and designing therapeutics.

The first common genetic risk factor reported for AMD was the missense variant rs1061170 in CFH on chromosome 1q31.3 –. Many genes encoding other proteins involved in the complement cascade reside within the 1q31.3 region, including complement factors H related to 1 to 5 (CFHR1-5). Two independent variants at 1q31.3, rs1061170 and intronic variant rs1410996, account for 17% of AMD risk. In the most recent GWAS examining 16,144 patients with advanced AMD, 52 independent variants were found at 34 different genomic loci explaining 46.7% of the variability in AMD risk. The risk variants with the largest difference between late AMD patients and healthy controls reside within the CFH genomic region and the ARMS2/HTRA1 locus on chromosome 10q26, although for most variants, the effect size was small. While some recognized AMD causal candidates are found at these genomic risk locations, the vast majority are yet to be identified.

### Detection of geographic atrophy guided by optical coherence tomography sub-RPE illumination analysis in patients with intermediate age-related macular degeneration [^622ea9ca]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To evaluate the prevalence of geographic atrophy (GA) lesions in patients with a diagnosis of intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD). Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed of patients with an International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, diagnosis of iAMD. The primary outcome was the percentage of eyes diagnosed with iAMD with an undocumented GA lesion identified on imaging. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for atrophic lesions in patients with iAMD. Results: The study included 690 eyes of 428 patients with a diagnosis of iAMD. The mean age was 79.4 ± 8.4 years, and 66.3% of patients were women. Forty-nine eyes (7.1%) were graded as having GA lesions, and 34% of these eyes had foveal involvement. The mean visual acuity (VA) was better in patients without GA lesions than in patients with GA lesions (72.9 ± 12.9 letters vs 66.4 ± 13.8 letters; P = 0.001). No systemic comorbidity was associated with an increased risk of GA lesions in this cohort. Conclusions: A notable proportion of eyes diagnosed with iAMD by eye care providers had underlying GA lesions in this real-world cohort. The use of optical coherence tomography as an adjunctive tool helped increase the detection of early GA in these patients.
