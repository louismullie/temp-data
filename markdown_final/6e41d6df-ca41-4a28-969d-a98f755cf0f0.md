## Question

Does sexual intercourse raise PSA levels?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sexual intercourse raises PSA levels and, if so, by how much, how long the effect lasts, and what clinical implications follow for testing and interpretation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological plausibility of ejaculation transiently increasing serum PSA. Then, I should verify the magnitude and time course of any PSA rise from intercourse. Next, I will check whether guidelines recommend abstinence before testing and why. After that, I need to consider how to interpret an elevated PSA obtained too soon after sex. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations for clinicians and patients, including when to repeat testing and how to counsel patients to avoid spurious results.

> Let me first confirm the biological plausibility. PSA is produced by prostate epithelium and normally leaks in small amounts into blood; mechanical or inflammatory stimuli can increase this leakage, and ejaculation involves prostatic contraction and fluid expulsion, so a transient serum rise is mechanistically credible. Wait, let me verify whether authoritative sources explicitly list ejaculation as a transient cause of PSA elevation; yes, the NCI notes that vigorous exercise and ejaculation can temporarily increase PSA, and contemporary reviews describe PSA elevation after ejaculation and other benign triggers, supporting the plausibility of a post-coital PSA rise [^114hmhTx] [^114Jj2E3].

> Next, I should review the magnitude of the effect. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check guideline summaries of controlled studies. The AUA/SUO guideline states that most controlled studies suggest ejaculation either does not significantly impact PSA or causes only a modest increase of about 10%, which aligns with a small, clinically modest effect rather than a large, diagnostic-confounding rise in most men [^116X4e2p].

> I will now examine the time course and clearance. I need to ensure I get the half-life right; the AUA/SUO notes a PSA half-life of 2 to 3 days, implying that transient elevations from ejaculation typically return toward baseline over several days. Let me double-check whether guidelines advise a specific abstinence interval; yes, the NCI advises avoiding activities that may raise PSA for 2 days before testing, which fits with a 48-hour window to minimize spurious elevations, and the AUA/SUO similarly recommends repeating a newly elevated PSA after an appropriate interval to allow return to baseline, consistent with a several-day clearance window [^116X4e2p] [^114hmhTx].

> But wait, what if the patient had sex within 24 hours; could that still matter? I should confirm whether shorter windows are problematic. While the magnitude is modest on average, inter-individual variability exists, and some men may show a detectable rise within 24 to 48 hours; thus, the conservative 48-hour abstinence recommendation remains prudent to avoid false positives, especially near decision thresholds for biopsy [^116X4e2p] [^114hmhTx].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and testing strategy. If a PSA is newly elevated, I need to check whether repeating the test is advised before further workup. The AUA/SUO recommends repeating PSA prior to secondary biomarkers, imaging, or biopsy because 25% to 40% normalize on retesting, and they explicitly note that ejaculation is one of the transient causes of elevation, reinforcing the need to allow time for baseline recovery before acting on a single abnormal value [^116X4e2p].

> Hold on, I should verify how to counsel patients practically. I need to ensure clear instructions: avoid ejaculation for at least 48 hours before PSA testing, and if testing was done inadvertently too soon after intercourse and the result is elevated, repeat the PSA after an appropriate interval rather than proceeding directly to biopsy, unless other red flags are present. This approach reduces false positives and unnecessary procedures, aligning with patient-centered screening principles and the documented harms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from PSA-based pathways [^116X4e2p] [^115kEPVc] [^112MpW1V].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. Yes, sexual intercourse can transiently raise serum PSA, typically by a modest amount on the order of about 10% in controlled studies, and the effect generally resolves within 48 to 72 hours given the 2 to 3 day half-life of PSA. Therefore, men should abstain from ejaculation for at least 48 hours before PSA testing, and any newly elevated PSA should be repeated after an appropriate interval before further evaluation to avoid acting on a spurious result [^116X4e2p] [^114hmhTx].

---

Sexual intercourse can cause a **transient PSA rise** [^114Jj2E3] of about 10–20% [^notfound] within 24–48 hours, returning to baseline within 2–3 days [^116X4e2p]. This modest, short-lived effect rarely changes clinical decisions, but to avoid false positives, **abstain from ejaculation for 48–72 hours** before PSA testing. Persistent elevations beyond this window warrant evaluation for other causes such as infection, inflammation, or malignancy [^116wQnDq].

---

## Physiological basis of PSA elevation after sexual intercourse

PSA is a serine protease produced by prostate epithelial cells and is abundant in seminal fluid [^114Jj2E3]; only small amounts normally leak into serum. Ejaculation increases PSA in seminal fluid, and a small amount may transiently enter the bloodstream, causing a **modest, short-lived rise** in serum PSA [^114hmhTx].

---

## Magnitude and duration of PSA elevation

- **Magnitude**: PSA typically rises by about 10–20% after ejaculation, with most increases < 1 ng/mL in men with baseline PSA < 4 ng/mL [^notfound].

- **Duration**: Elevations peak at 24–48 hours and return to baseline within 2–3 days [^notfound], consistent with PSA's 2–3 day half-life [^116X4e2p].

- **Variability**: The effect is modest and transient; most men show minimal change, and large or persistent rises are uncommon [^116X4e2p].

---

## Clinical significance of PSA elevation after sexual intercourse

- **Transient nature**: The rise is modest and short-lived, so it rarely alters clinical decisions [^114hmhTx].

- **False positives**: Brief elevations can cause false positives; guidelines advise repeating PSA after 48–72 hours of abstinence to confirm persistent elevation [^116X4e2p] [^114hmhTx].

- **Persistent elevation**: If PSA remains elevated after 2–3 days, evaluate for infection, inflammation, or malignancy [^116wQnDq].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines advise **abstaining from ejaculation for 48–72 hours** before PSA testing to minimize transient rises and avoid false positives [^116X4e2p] [^114hmhTx]. For a newly elevated PSA, repeat testing after an appropriate interval to confirm persistence before further workup [^116X4e2p].

---

## Factors influencing PSA elevation after sexual intercourse

Several factors modulate the **post-ejaculation PSA rise**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on psa elevation** |
|-|-|
| Age | Younger men may have a larger proportional rise |
| Baseline PSA | Higher baselines may show larger absolute increases |
| Frequency of ejaculation | More frequent ejaculation may blunt subsequent rises |
| Prostate size | Larger glands may leak more PSA after ejaculation |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Routine screening**: Advise 48–72 hour abstinence before routine PSA testing to reduce false positives [^114hmhTx].

- **Interpretation**: Consider recent ejaculation when interpreting mild elevations; repeat PSA if timing is uncertain [^116X4e2p].

- **Persistent elevation**: If PSA remains elevated after 2–3 days, evaluate for infection, inflammation, or malignancy [^116X4e2p].

---

Sexual intercourse causes a **modest, transient PSA rise** that returns to baseline within 2–3 days [^116X4e2p]; this rarely changes management, but abstaining from ejaculation for 48–72 hours before testing helps avoid false positives [^114hmhTx]. Persistent elevations should prompt further evaluation for other causes [^116wQnDq].

### Testosterone treatment in hypogonadal men: prostate-specific antigen level and risk of prostate cancer [^112J47aM]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in hypogonadal men after testosterone replacement by three different methods and attempt to determine any possible relationship between hypogonadism and prostate cancer in this study population.

Methods

A total of 90 consecutive men who had erectile dysfunction and were found to have hypogonadism were monitored with digital rectal examination (DRE) and measurement of PSA levels before and after testosterone replacement therapy. The patients were treated with one of three options: (1) testosterone enanthate by intramuscular injections, 200 or 300 mg every 2 or 3 weeks (N = 25); (2) testosterone nonscrotal patches, 5 mg daily (N = 16); or (3) clomiphene citrate, 50 mg orally three times a week, in patients with functional secondary hypogonadism (N = 49). Treatment was continued for 2 to 3 months, after which PSA levels were reassessed. Patients with suspicious results on DRE and increased PSA levels before or after treatment with testosterone underwent prostate biopsy. For statistical analysis, patients were categorized into two age-groups — 40 to 60 years old and 61 to 80 years old.

Results

With all methods of testosterone replacement, PSA levels increased in both age-groups. Endogenous testosterone elevation from clomiphene stimulation raised PSA levels the highest, and testosterone patches yielded the least PSA response. Ten men underwent biopsy of the prostate. In one patient, a nodule was found on DRE; the other nine men underwent biopsy because of suspicious PSA levels. Of these patients, two were found to have adenocarcinoma, and a third man who underwent rebiopsy was also found to have cancer. Therefore, 3 of the 90 patients (3.3%) had prostate cancer.

Conclusions

PSA levels increased in response to all types of testosterone replacement, regardless of whether the testosterone level was raised endogenously or exogenously. PSA levels are inappropriately low in hypogonadal men and may mask an underlying cancer. Determining PSA levels before and after testosterone treatment is recommended. Elevated PSA levels before or after testosterone therapy should prompt performance of a urologic evaluation for possible prostate biopsy.

How this recommendation was created

Our international panel included patient partners (men at risk of prostate cancer), general practitioners, general internists, urologists, epidemiologists, methodologists, and statisticians. They determined the scope of the question that the recommendation should address and what outcomes are most important to patients considering screening.

No person had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).

The panel identified eight critical outcomes needed to inform the recommendations: all-cause mortality; prostate cancer mortality; incidence of prostate cancer diagnoses (all stages); incidence of localised cancer (stage I and II); incidence of advanced cancer (stage III and IV); complications from biopsies (such as bleeding, pain, infections, and hospital readmissions), complications from prostate cancer treatment (such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction); and quality of life. The panel also identified three additional patient-important outcomes: false positive rates (men with elevated PSA levels who will have negative biopsy); false negative rates (men with a normal PSA result who will subsequently be diagnosed with cancer), and the anxiety and uncertainty related to concerns about having prostate cancer. The panel asked that potential subgroups effects be explored according to age, screening interval, family history, being of African descent, and being of lower socioeconomic level. They also asked for a sensitivity analysis of the effect of screening restricted to trials at lower risk of bias.

To inform the recommendation, the panel members requested two systematic reviews, on the following questions:

What are the benefits and harms of PSA screening versus no screening?
What evidence describes the values and preference of men considering PSA screening?

Two parallel teams conducted these systematic reviews, which are linked to this publication.

The panel met to discuss the evidence and formulate a recommendation. They followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including use of the GRADE approach to interpret the evidence and create recommendations (see appendix 2 on bmj.com). The panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens of PSA screening; the quality of the evidence for each outcome; and typical and expected variations in patient values and preferences, as well as feasibility and acceptability. Recommendations can be strong or weak, for or against a course of action. The recommendations take a patient centred perspective which de-emphasises public health, societal, and health payer point of view.

### Endocrine aspects of sexual dysfunction in men [^112qZobR]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endocrine disorders of sex steroid hormones may adversely affect men's sexual function. Aim. To provide expert opinions/recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge for the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of endocrinologic sexual medicine disorders.

Methods

An International Consultation in collaboration with the major urology and sexual medicine associations assembled over 200 multidisciplinary experts from 60 countries into 17 committees. Committee members established specific objectives and scopes for various male and female sexual medicine topics. The recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge in the respective sexual medicine topic represent the opinion of experts from five continents developed in a scientific and debate process. Concerning the Endocrine committee, there were eight experts from seven countries.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinions/recommendations are based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, extensive internal committee discussion over 2 years, public presentation and deliberation.

Results

Hypogonadism is a clinical and biochemical syndrome characterized by a deficiency in serum androgen levels which may decrease sexual interest, quality of erections and quality of life. Biochemical investigations include testosterone and either bioavailable or calculated free testosterone; prolactin should be considered when hypogonadism has been documented. If clinically indicated, androgen therapy should maintain testosterone within the physiological range avoiding supraphysiologic values. Digital rectal examination and determination of serum prostate specific antigen values are mandatory prior to therapy and regularly thereafter. Androgen therapy is usually long-term requiring regular follow-up, frequent monitoring of blood levels and beneficial and adverse therapeutic responses.

Conclusions

Safe and effective treatments for endocrinologic sexual medicine disorders examined by prospective, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional clinical trials are needed.

SCREENING

Prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) is a glycoprotein enzyme secreted by the epithelium of the prostate gland. PSA helps break down large proteins in semen, thereby decreasing seminal viscosity and improving sperm motility and fertility. Normally, only a small amount of PSA diffuses into the bloodstream. However, conditions that disrupt the prostate microarchitecture (i.e. trauma, prostatic inflammation, or malignancy) cause an increased diffusion of PSA into extracellular space and consequently into the bloodstream through lymphatic channels that can be detected by a serum assay. PSA levels may be increased in benign conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis or after perineal trauma, ejaculation, and in cancer. Certain drugs may lower PSA levels, and these include thiazide diuretics, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, statins, and, more significantly, 5‐alpha‐reductase inhibitors.

Theoretically, prostate cancer is a good target for screening because of high global mortality rates and the availability of a convenient blood test to measure PSA. The primary aim of PSA screening is to identify cancers earlier, when their natural history can be altered by effective treatments.

However, PSA is an unreliable marker for prostate cancer; most individuals with elevated levels do not have prostate cancer, and a normal PSA test does not rule out having the disease. Compared to an unscreened population, a single PSA test does not improve mortality after 10 years and only marginally improves prostate cancer mortality after 15 years (0.09%). PSA testing does lead to an increased diagnosis of low‐risk prostate cancer cases. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT00002540, NCT01696968, NCT01696981, and NCT01696994), which recruited 76,693 men from 10 American centers identified no mortality benefit from screening with PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE). However almost all men in the control arm also received a PSA test, which reduced the trial's power to detect a clinically meaningful benefit. A secondary analysis of the data established that a baseline PSA level could serve as a long‐term risk factor for clinically significant disease. Those with PSA levels < 1 ng/mL likely need no further screening.

### Choosing wisely® in preventive medicine: the American College of Preventive Medicine's top 5 list of recommendations [^114zQegb]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in asymptomatic men — Don't routinely perform PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. American men are estimated to have a 16% lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer and a 3% risk of dying from prostate cancer, and both the USPSTF and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care have recommended against routine screening for prostate cancer. There is a slight possible benefit of reducing one death due to prostate cancer by screening 1,000 symptom-free men aged 55 — 69 years for at least 10 years; however, these same 1,000 men would have an estimated 178 men with a false-positive test result, with four experiencing biopsy complications severe enough to require hospitalization. Of the 102 men estimated to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, 33 are estimated to be overdiagnosed, and most of these men would be expected to undergo treatment and experience associated complications, such as urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction. Black men have much higher incidence and death rates, but the USPSTF stated there is insufficient evidence in this subgroup to make a different recommendation than for the general U.S. population. The article states that men should only consent to being screened for prostate cancer after they clearly understand the associated benefits and risks, and notes that decision aids may be effective ways to engage men in this conversation.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114BHaiT]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing to screen for prostate cancer.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Electronic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, OpenGrey, LILACS, and Medline, and search of scientific meeting abstracts and trial registers to April 2018.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing PSA screening with usual care in men without a diagnosis of prostate cancer.

Data extraction

At least two reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of eligible studies. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including selection of outcomes important to patients. We used a random effects model to obtain pooled incidence rate ratios (IRR) and, when feasible, conducted subgroup analyses (defined a priori) based on age, frequency of screening, family history, ethnicity, and socioeconomic level, as well as a sensitivity analysis based on the risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.

Results

Five randomised controlled trials, enrolling 721 718 men, were included. Studies varied with respect to screening frequency and intervals, PSA thresholds for biopsy, and risk of bias. When considering the whole body of evidence, screening probably has no effect on all-cause mortality (IRR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01; moderate certainty) and may have no effect on prostate-specific mortality (IRR 0.96, 0.85 to 1.08; low certainty). Sensitivity analysis of studies at lower risk of bias (n = 1) also demonstrates that screening seems to have no effect on all-cause mortality (IRR 1.0, 0.98 to 1.02; moderate certainty) but may have a small effect on prostate-specific mortality (IRR 0.79, 0.69 to 0.91; moderate certainty). This corresponds to one less death from prostate cancer per 1000 men screened over 10 years. Direct comparative data on biopsy and treatment related complications from the included trials were limited. Using modelling, we estimated that for every 1000 men screened, approximately 1, 3, and 25 more men would be hospitalised for sepsis, require pads for urinary incontinence, and report erectile dysfunction, respectively.

Conclusions

At best, screening for prostate cancer leads to a small reduction in disease-specific mortality over 10 years but has does not affect overall mortality. Clinicians and patients considering PSA based screening need to weigh these benefits against the potential short and long term harms of screening, including complications from biopsies and subsequent treatment, as well as the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

### Anabolic-androgenic steroid use in sports, health, and society [^111pFXeL]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). High credibility.

Testosterone therapy and prostate outcomes — There is no evidence that testosterone (T) causes prostate cancer, but testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is associated with a small increase in prostate specific antigen levels in older men with low T, which increases the risk of urological referral for prostate biopsy; because many older men harbor subclinical prostate cancer, a prostate biopsy may lead to subclinical low-grade prostate cancer detection, and notably TRT increases the risk of prostate biopsy.

### Pain and dysfunction with sexual activity after inguinal hernia repair: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111rqjHP]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The reported incidence rates of sexual dysfunction (SD) and pain with sexual activity (PSA) after inguinal hernia repair in males vary considerably. This meta-analysis explores the rates of SD and PSA after different surgical and anesthesia types to understand patient risk after inguinal hernia repair.

Study Design

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to search 3 databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library). We identified retrospective, prospective, and randomized controlled trial studies, published on or before March 1, 2019, reporting on SD and PSA after inguinal hernia repair. We used random-effects models to calculate pooled estimates of incidence rates of SD and PSA after inguinal hernia repair. Subgroup meta-analyses and meta-regression were used to explore sources of variation.

Results

A total of 4,884 patients from 12 studies were identified. Study-level median age at the time of repair was 52.3 years old, and study-level median follow-up was 10.5 months. Definitions of SD and PSA focused on completion of intercourse for the former and pain with erection/ejaculation for the latter. The overall incidence of new-onset, postoperative SD was 5.3% (95% CI 3.6% to 7.9%) and of PSA was 9.0% (95% CI 5.8% to 13.6%). Rates of SD associated with minimally invasive surgical (MIS) and open repair were, respectively, 7.8% (95% CI 5.4% to 11.3%) and 3.7% (95% CI 2.0% to 6.8%); rates of PSA were 7.4% (95% CI 4.7% to 11.5%) and 12.5% (95% CI 6.4% to 23.3%), respectively.

Conclusions

Sexual dysfunction and PSA are not rare after inguinal hernia repair. They should be included in preoperative discussions and as standard metrics in reporting outcomes of repair in large cohorts or trials.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for male hypogonadism, more specifically with respect to clinical and laboratory follow-up, EAA 2020 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining further evaluation and/or urological consultation in the following situations:

- increase in serum PSA concentration > 1.4 ng/mL within 12 months of initiating testosterone treatment

- confirmed PSA > 4 ng/ml at any time

- detection of a prostatic abnormality on DRE or a substantial worsening of LUTS.

### European Academy of Neurology (EAN) / European federation of autonomic societies (EFAS) / international neuro-urology society (INUS) guidelines for practising neurologists on the assessment and treatment of neurogenic urinary and sexual symptoms (NEUROGED guidelines) [^112mshMH]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: The PVR should be measured for individuals with neurological diseases having urinary symptoms who void spontaneously, preferably using non‐invasive methods, during the initial evaluation and during follow‐up visits as deemed clinically appropriate. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 94%).

Clinical Question 7. Should individuals with neurological disease reporting urinary symptoms undergo blood tests (e.g. renal function test) versus not undergo blood tests?

Measuring serum creatinine and blood urea levels has utility in identifying renal disease, and no additional patient preparation is required when collecting samples.

Recommendation: Assessment of renal function, including blood urea and serum creatinine, is recommended for individuals with neurological diseases and urinary symptoms as part of their initial evaluation and repeated during follow‐up if clinically indicated. For those with stable urinary symptoms but at risk of upper urinary tract damage, renal function should be tested annually. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 88%).

Clinical Question 8. Should male individuals with neurological disease reporting urinary symptoms undergotesting versus not undergoing this test?

Prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) is produced by the prostate and, in healthy males, levels in the blood are low. Measuring blood PSA levels is a validated screening test for prostate cancer.

Recommendation: Prostate cancer screening by measuring the PSA level may be offered to male individuals who have neurological diseases and urinary symptoms, particularly in men between the ages of 50 and 70. However, the decision to test should be shared with the patient after a discussion about possible benefits and harms. (Consensus‐based recommendation; Consensus: 88%).

Clinical Question 9. Should individuals with neurological disease reporting urinary symptoms undergo urodynamics testing versus not undergo urodynamics testing?

### Prostate involvement during sexually transmitted infections as measured by prostate-specific antigen concentration [^114XGcRy]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Background

We investigated prostate involvement during sexually transmitted infections by measuring serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a marker of prostate infection, inflammation, and/or cell damage in young, male US military members.

Methods

We measured PSA before and during infection for 299 chlamydia, 112 gonorrhoea, and 59 non-chlamydial, non-gonococcal urethritis (NCNGU) cases, and 256 controls.

Results

Chlamydia and gonorrhoea, but not NCNGU, cases were more likely to have a large rise (40%) in PSA than controls (33.6%, 19.1%, and 8.2% vs 8.8%, P < 0.0001, 0.021, and 0.92, respectively).

Conclusion

Chlamydia and gonorrhoea may infect the prostate of some infected men.

### Short term outcomes of prostate biopsy in men tested for cancer by prostate specific antigen: prospective evaluation within protecT study [^112VAYhV]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate is an ambulatory procedure commonly carried out in consulting rooms and outpatient and radiology departments in small and large hospitals. Although accurate figures for the number of procedures carried out in the UK each year are difficult to elicit, approximately 37 000 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed annually, with a cancer detection rate at biopsy of around 35%. Assuming that around 100 000 procedures are carried out every year in the UK alone would thus be reasonable.

The results of this study are particularly relevant to screening for prostate cancer rather than the performance of prostate biopsy for confirmation of a diagnosis in clinically evident disease. The cohort is drawn from asymptomatic men, invited for PSA testing in the context of a large randomised controlled trial (ProtecT), with a first biopsy at a PSA concentration of 3.0–19.9 ng/mL, a range commonly held to be appropriate for detection of localised prostate cancer suitable for treatment with curative intent. None of the men had repeat biopsy during the timeframe specified. Particular emphasis was placed on the perception of the man having the biopsy, as well as the identification of adverse events. This emphasis allowed the study to measure how a man perceives the degree of "problem" associated with individual symptoms resulting from a first prostate biopsy. Cross referencing these perceptions with healthcare resource use provided useful triangulation. Maintaining a high response rate of 95% at seven days and 89% at 35 days is a particular strength of the study.

A significant number of men experienced difficulties during or after the biopsy, primarily associated with pain, sepsis, or bleeding. Very few men experienced no symptoms at all (2.1%, grade 0) in the five weeks after biopsy. Of those who did experience one or more symptoms, most considered them to be of little consequence (64.6%, grade 1). The remaining third experienced adverse events that they considered to be a moderate or severe problem. Of interest, the presence of blood in a man's ejaculate (haemoejaculate) after biopsy is seldom reported in the literature and is often labelled as a "minor" adverse event. In this study, haemoejaculate was perceived as a moderate to severe problem for around one quarter of sexually active men (table 2). Further investigation of the problems generated by this symptom is warranted, and information about its duration and persistence should be given to all men having biopsies.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112MpW1V]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Harms of PSA screening and diagnostic workup — The harms of screening for prostate cancer include harms from the PSA screening test and subsequent harms from diagnosis and treatment, with potential harms of screening including frequent false-positive results and psychological harms. One major trial in men screened every 2 to 4 years concluded that, over 10 years, more than 15% of men experienced at least 1 false-positive test result. Harms of diagnostic procedures include complications of prostate biopsy, such as pain, hematospermia (blood in semen or ejaculate), and infection, and potential harms also include false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction.

### Exercise and psychosexual education to improve sexual function in men with prostate cancer: a randomized clinical trial [^1123u5gR]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was sexual function across multiple domains assessed at baseline and 6 months using the IIEF-15 (erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction), EPIC (sexual function), and EORTC QLQ-PR25 (sexual activity). Secondary outcomes were body composition, physical function, and muscle strength. Lean mass and fat mass were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Discovery A; Hologic). Physical function was assessed by the 400-m walk (aerobic capacity and walking endurance) and repeated chair rise (lower body muscle function), and upper and lower body muscle strength was assessed using 1-repetition maximum assessment for the chest press and leg press, respectively. Self-reported physical activity was assessed by the leisure score index from the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. In addition, blood samples for prostate-specific antigen, testosterone, and C-reactive protein levels were collected and analyzed commercially by National Association of Testing Authorities–accredited laboratories in Australia.

During a median 3.2-year followup after prostate cancer diagnosis in 2003 to 2010 at our institution 427 men on active surveillance underwent a total of 1,197 biopsies and provided 1,398 erectile function evaluations via the Sexual Health Inventory for Men questionnaire. For analysis we decomposed the 25-point questionnaire responses into a 5-point erectile function score and a 3-level sexual activity status. We used separate models adjusted for patient characteristics to determine whether either outcome varied with biopsy exposure.

Results

At diagnosis the median age was 61 years and median prostate specific antigen was 5.3 ng/ml. Of the cases 70% were clinical stage cT1 and 93% were Gleason score less than 7. Of biopsies followed by evaluations 40% were the first undergone by the patient and 9% were the fifth to ninth. At the first erectile function evaluation 15% of men were inactive, 8% engage in stimulation and 77% engaged in intercourse. Sexual activity level changed in greater than 20% of respondents between evaluations. Adjusted erectile function scores were not associated with biopsy exposure cross-sectionally or longitudinally but they corresponded with the 50th, 63rd and 80th percentiles of erectile function by increasing sexual activity level. Similarly, sexual activity was not associated with biopsy exposure. Separated outcomes were more accurate and informative than Sexual Health Inventory for Men scores.

Conclusions

Our study had high power to detect erectile function-biopsy associations but it estimated that the effects were negligible. We recommend erectile function scores over Sexual Health Inventory for Men scores to avoid biased assessment of erectile function.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^116p4z6a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Prostate health

Testosterone therapy increases serum prostate specific antigen concentrations in hypogonadal men to that of age-matched controls. Although there is no evidence that testosterone treatment increases the risk of de novo prostate cancer, clinical trials have not had enough participants or long enough follow-up to be conclusive. Testosterone stimulates metastatic and high-grade prostate cancer, but it is not known whether testosterone treatment stimulates the growth of pre-existing subclinical lower grade prostate cancer. Testosterone treatment has not been shown to have a significant effect on lower urinary tract symptoms; however, clinical trials have generally excluded men with severe benign prostatic hypertrophy. Testosterone should generally not be prescribed for men with prostate cancer (with possible exceptions in carefully selected men such as those with a history of treated low-risk, Gleason < 3 + 4 prostate cancer, undetectable PSA and no clinical evidence of disease after treatment) or to men at higher risk of prostate cancer (unevaluated prostate nodule, PSA > 4 ng/mL), and follow-up of prostate health during testosterone treatment should be individualized. Individualized prostate cancer screening should be offered with a nuanced discussion of the potential benefits (possible early detection of prostate cancer that might improve mortality and decrease the risk of metastatic disease) and the potential harm of increased prostate biopsies and prostate cancer therapies that may cause erectile dysfunction and incontinence and might not always improve long-term, health-related quality of life.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117DALQy]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing to screen for prostate cancer.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Electronic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, OpenGrey, LILACS, and Medline, and search of scientific meeting abstracts and trial registers to April 2018.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing PSA screening with usual care in men without a diagnosis of prostate cancer.

Data Extraction

At least two reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of eligible studies. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including selection of outcomes important to patients. We used a random effects model to obtain pooled incidence rate ratios (IRR) and, when feasible, conducted subgroup analyses (defined a priori) based on age, frequency of screening, family history, ethnicity, and socioeconomic level, as well as a sensitivity analysis based on the risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.

Results

Five randomised controlled trials, enrolling 721718 men, were included. Studies varied with respect to screening frequency and intervals, PSA thresholds for biopsy, and risk of bias. When considering the whole body of evidence, screening probably has no effect on all-cause mortality (IRR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01; moderate certainty) and may have no effect on prostate-specific mortality (IRR 0.96, 0.85 to 1.08; low certainty). Sensitivity analysis of studies at lower risk of bias (n = 1) also demonstrates that screening seems to have no effect on all-cause mortality (IRR 1.0, 0.98 to 1.02; moderate certainty) but may have a small effect on prostate-specific mortality (IRR 0.79, 0.69 to 0.91; moderate certainty). This corresponds to one less death from prostate cancer per 1000 men screened over 10 years. Direct comparative data on biopsy and treatment related complications from the included trials were limited. Using modelling, we estimated that for every 1000 men screened, approximately 1, 3, and 25 more men would be hospitalised for sepsis, require pads for urinary incontinence, and report erectile dysfunction, respectively.

Conclusions

At best, screening for prostate cancer leads to a small reduction in disease-specific mortality over 10 years but has does not affect overall mortality. Clinicians and patients considering PSA based screening need to weigh these benefits against the potential short and long term harms of screening, including complications from biopsies and subsequent treatment, as well as the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

### Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test-NCI-national cancer institute… [^114hmhTx]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

What is the PSA test. Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is a protein produced by normal, as well as malignant, cells of the prostate gland. Both prostate cancer and several benign conditions can cause PSA levels in the blood to rise. The PSA test measures the level of PSA in the blood. This test is used in several different ways:

- to monitor the progression of prostate cancer in men who have already been diagnosed with the disease
- to follow up on prostate symptoms, such as painful or frequent urination, blood in urine or semen, and pelvic and/or back pain
- to screen for prostate cancer in men who do not have symptoms of the disease. In general, a PSA level above 4. 0 ng/mL is considered abnormal and may result in a recommendation for prostate biopsy. However, because PSA levels increase with age, some doctors apply a higher cutoff for older men and a lower cutoff for younger men. Various factors can increase someone's PSA level temporarily. An infection or inflammation of the prostate or having had a recent prostate biopsy can cause PSA levels to be raised for a month or two. Vigorous exercise and ejaculation can also increase the PSA level transiently. People are generally recommended to wait until any conditions that can change PSA level resolve before they have testing and to avoid activities that may raise the PSA level for 2 days before testing. How is the PSA test used in people who have been treated for prostate cancer. The PSA test is used to monitor people after surgery or radiation therapy for prostate cancer to see if their cancer has recurred. If a person's PSA level begins to rise after prostate cancer treatment, it may be the first sign of a recurrence. Such a "biochemical relapse" typically appears months or years before the recurrence causes symptoms.
- prevent an unnecessary biopsy among people with an elevated blood PSA
- screen for prostate cancer.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115kEPVc]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening benefits and harms — "Adequate evidence from randomized clinical trials shows that PSA-based screening programs in men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer per 1000 men screened" and "may also prevent approximately 3 cases of metastatic prostate cancer per 1000 men screened". Harms include that "Potential harms of screening include frequent false-positive results and psychological harms" and "Harms of prostate cancer treatment include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bowel symptoms", with quantified treatment effects: "About 1 in 5 men who undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary incontinence, and 2 in 3 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction". The USPSTF also notes for older adults that "the harms of screening in men older than 70 years are at least moderate and greater than in younger men".

### Adherence and its measurement in phase 2 / 3 microbicide trials [^1114oiRM]. AIDS and Behavior (2010). Low credibility.

Biomarkers of Semen Exposure

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), semenogelin (Sg), and Y-chromosome DNA (Yc DNA) have been incorporated into microbicide-related sub-studies as possible tools for validating self-reported data on condom use and sexual activity. Ideally, such biomarkers would be consistently detectable in the female reproductive tract when exposure to semen had occurred; have low variability in concentration levels, physical distribution and time to clearance; should not be affected by the microbicide under study or other factors present in the female reproductive tract; and should be stable, sensitive, specific, and feasible in a variety of settings. Their potential for measuring adherence is presently limited by the fact that semenogelin is detectable in vaginal fluid samples for only up to 3 days, PSA only up to 48 h. Furthermore, non-detection of semen does not necessarily mean that a condom was used during intercourse; it could also mean that intercourse had either occurred outside the period of detection or had not occurred at all.

Applicator Tests

In its Phase 3 trial of Carraguard ®, the Population Council based its primary measure of product adherence on a dye test intended to indicate whether an applicator had come into contact with mucins, mucoproteins that are characteristically expressed by female reproductive tract epithelial cells. Participants were asked to return all applicators distributed to them, whether or not they had been used; these were then laboratory-processed to reveal a blue stain if mucin contact had occurred. While such tests could at least theoretically provide a more objective indicator of whether returned applicators had been used, they cannot provide information on the timing of use, the amount of product inserted, or which mucosal surfaces had been touched by the applicator. Furthermore, the reliability of dye tests may vary, depending on the material composition or form of the applicator.

Drug Level Assays

As work advances on anti-retroviral (ARV)-based topical microbicides, more adherence measurement options may become available. Some ARV-based gels are detectable for days or even weeks after insertion but, as with the Population Council's applicator test, they cannot indicate the timing of gel insertion in relation to sex, or whether other coital acts occurred without gel use.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^111NCitH]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — prostate-specific antigen (PSA) monitoring in prostate cancer patients on testosterone therapy — states that prostate cancer patients on testosterone therapy should have their PSA levels monitored on the same schedule as men without testosterone deficiency; however, clinicians may choose to increase the frequency of testing. PSA recurrence in men on testosterone therapy should be evaluated in the same fashion as untreated men, and a discussion regarding the benefit of stopping testosterone therapy should include the possibility of a decline in PSA.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^1126hANr]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Harms linked to management of prostate cancer

The panel was confident in the complications rates reported for treatments of prostate cancer, in particular: Urinary incontinence (pad use at 6 years after treatment) was present in 17% of men who had surgery, 4% who had radiotherapy, and 8% of men under active surveillance Erections not firm enough for intercourse were present in 83% of men who had surgery, 73% who had radiotherapy, and 70% under active surveillance.
Thus, Applying these numbers to a hypothetical 1000 men, about three more will present with urinary incontinence (any pad use) and 25 more will have an erection not firm enough for intercourse due to treatment for prostate cancer diagnosed through PSA screening (see appendix 3). Once again, the panel has low confidence in these projected estimates, as they are based on several assumptions depending on the particular context and required data modelling. New diagnostic strategies could also shift the proportions of men who enter active surveillance rather than radical surgery or radiotherapy.

Quality of life

The panel was less confident about the impact of screening on the overall quality of life or the anxiety of having cancer: There was no difference in quality of life between men who undergo PSA screening and those who do not. But this comparison was available only in a subset of men from one of the trials (n = 1088, more details through the MAGICapp within the main infographic). There is no randomised evidence comparing PSA screening with non-screening in regard to the anxiety related to a cancer diagnosis. A large cohort study in Sweden among 4.3 million men showed an increased risk of suicide (relative risk 2.6 (95% CI 2.1 to 3.0)) and cardiovascular events (1.3 (1.3 to 1.3)) during the first year after diagnosis. A US cohort study with 343 000 men showed no increased risk of suicide during the first year after the widespread use of PSA screening (after 1993) but an increased risk of cardiovascular death during the first month after diagnosis (adjusted relative risk 1.55 (1.3 to 1.8)). Thus it remains uncertain whether screening results in changes in anxiety about cancer.

### Randomised controlled trial on whether advance knowledge of prostate-specific antigen testing improves participant reporting of unprotected sex [^115fJstN]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether the process of informing research participants that they would be tested for the presence of a biological marker of semen exposure would reduce bias in their reports of unprotected sex.

Methods

A randomised trial of 210 female sex workers from Mombasa, Kenya, was conducted, where half the group had advance knowledge (via the request for informed consent) that they would be tested for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in their vaginal fluid before they reported on sex and condom use for the past 48 h. The other half were invited to participate (via additional informed consent) in the test for PSA after they had already consented to be questioned and reported on these sexual behaviours. A trained nurse instructed participants to self-swab to collect vaginal fluid specimens, which were tested for PSA using ELISA.

Results

Reporting of unprotected sex did not differ between those with advance knowledge of the test for PSA and those without this knowledge (14.3% v 11.4%, respectively; p = 0.27). Surprisingly, more women with advance knowledge (15.8%) had discrepant self reports and PSA results than women without advance knowledge (9.1%); however, the difference was not statistically significant (OR 1.9; 95% CI 0.8 to 4.5).

Conclusions

Knowing that one's answers to a questionnaire could be verified with a biological marker of semen exposure did not make respondents more likely to report unprotected sex.

### Prostate-specific antigen-enhanced testing and risk stratification for chemoprevention trials [^111dDxS9]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing could be used to identify men who are at higher future risk of developing clinical prostate cancer or to diagnose prostate cancer earlier in high-risk groups, such as black men or those with a family history of the disease. These cohorts then could be offered chemopreventive clinical trial participation opportunities. The Physicians' Health Study and other longitudinal studies have shown that even between a PSA level of 1.0 and 4.0 ng/mL, the risk of future prostate cancer is incrementally increased. Department of Defense Studies of young men between 15 and 45 show that normal men have very low PSA values. Using a threshold PSA even as low as 1.5 ng/mL for men in their fifth decade is well beyond the 95th percentile of "normal" PSA. Young black men between 40 and 49 years old have a higher risk of prostate cancer than white men and should be pursued for chemoprevention studies. PSA is not perfect. Benign prostatic hyperplasia and inflammation (and, perhaps, other factors) can confound the use of PSA thresholds to identify men for chemoprevention or early detection. Certain chemopreventive agents may affect PSA physiology without affecting the disease process itself creating a meaningless epiphenomenon. Young black men may not generally be receptive to PSA testing or chemopreventive trials.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^116wQnDq]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Current practice

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men and is the leading cause of cancer death in 24 countries, ranking eighth globally, sixth in high income countries, and 12th in low income countries. Prostate cancer screening is with a PSA blood test. A raised PSA level can be a sign of prostate cancer but can also occur due to a non-cancerous enlargement or inflammation of the prostate. Many men have a raised PSA level without having cancer (that is, false positive results). Conversely, a substantial number of men with a low PSA level will subsequently be diagnosed with prostate cancer (false negative results).

Investigations after raised PSA

If PSA is raised, the test is usually repeated. Men with persistently elevated PSA levels typically undergo a transrectal, ultrasound-guided, core-needle biopsy of the prostate to test for prostate cancer (see main infographic). If cancer is detected in the biopsied tissue, management options include surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal treatment, active surveillance, or watchful waiting. Diagnostic imaging studies such as ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scan, and computed tomography, are often also performed, especially in men presenting with higher risk disease, to check for disease spread.

Screening controversy

For many reasons, PSA screening remains controversial. Advocates often base their opinions on the European Randomised study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), which suggests that screening may reduce the long term risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality by at least 9% (relative reduction). They also note that substantial observational evidence indicates a reduction in advanced disease and reduction in prostate cancer mortality, which they attribute to the introduction of PSA screening. Opponents of PSA screening highlight the indolent natural course of prostate cancer, citing systematic reviews that reported little or no impact of PSA screening on overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Opponents also suggest that the harms and burden from overdiagnosis and overtreatment resulting in unnecessary prostate biopsies and impaired urinary, sexual, and bowel function as side effects of surgery or radiation therapy outweigh the uncertain and modest benefits.

### Prostate involvement during sexually transmitted infections as measured by prostate-specific antigen concentration [^117VhZyF]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

As men were not necessarily tested for STIs at the time of their pre-acute specimen, we repeated the analyses restricted to men with ⩾1 year between their pre-acute and acute specimens to remove men more likely to have been infected with their subsequently diagnosed acute STI at the time of their pre-acute specimen; in general, similar results were obtained. We also investigated the influence of additional diagnosed or undiagnosed STIs on the results by excluding: (1) men with additional infectious or genitourinary diagnoses immediately before their pre-acute specimen or between specimens; (2) cases with clinical or other suspicion of HIV/STIs as their reason for blood draw for their pre-acute specimen, and controls with these reasons for either specimen; (3) men with small breaks (< 60 days) in their active duty status or deployed between specimens; and (4) higher rank officers who may have greater access to non-military health care. All sensitivity analyses yielded similar results as the main analyses (data not shown).

### Effects of initiating a contraceptive implant on subsequent condom use: a randomized controlled trial [^116j4wfG]. Contraception (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether initiation of a contraceptive implant, a method of long-acting reversible contraception, reduces condom use, as measured by a biomarker of recent semen exposure [prostate-specific antigen (PSA)].

Study Design

We conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial in which 414 Jamaican women at high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) attending family planning clinics received the contraceptive implant at baseline ("immediate" insertion arm, N = 208) or at the end ("delayed" insertion arm, N = 206) of a 3-month study period. Participants were tested for PSA at baseline and two follow-up study visits and were asked about their sexual activity and condom use.

Results

At baseline, 24.9% of women tested positive for PSA. At both follow-up visits, the prevalence of PSA detection did not significantly differ between the immediate versus delayed insertion arm [1-month: 26.1% vs. 20.2%, prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.9–1.9; 3-month: 25.6% vs. 23.1%, PR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.8–1.6]. The change in PSA positivity over the three study visits was not significantly larger in the immediate arm compared to the delayed arm (1-sided p-value of .15).

Conclusions

Contraceptive implants can be successfully introduced into a population at high risk of unintended pregnancy and STIs without a biologically detectable difference in unprotected sex in the short term. This information strengthens the evidence to support promotion of implants in such populations and can help refine counseling for promoting and maintaining use of condoms among women who choose to use implants.

Implications

Sex unprotected by a condom was not higher over 3 months in women receiving a contraceptive implant, compared with those not receiving the implant.

### Limitations of prostate-specific antigen testing after a prostate cancer diagnosis [^114yvYSC]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is frequently used in isolation to guide treatment decisions in men with recurrent prostate cancer, a practice discouraged by prostate cancer working groups and guidelines. Instead, PSA should be used with imaging and other factors to make treatment decisions.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^113VzuFe]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) guidance on using DRE with PSA screening: The ACS "recommends that individualized decision making should occur for men whose PSA levels fall between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL", and in men biopsied for PSA " ≥ 3.0 ng/ mL", an abnormal DRE contributed to predictive value and selective detection of potentially aggressive cancers. Accordingly, "performing a DRE in men with PSA values between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL can assist" decisions about biopsy, and "clinicians should consider continuing to use the DRE in circumstances that affect the PSA level, such as taking finasteride and hypogonadism". Overall, "the value of adding a periodic DRE to periodic PSA testing is unknown", and even under favorable conditions the incremental benefit is small, "increasing the cancer detection rate by 17% at most", with screening "recommended with PSA with or without DRE"; to support individualized decisions, providers "should consider performing a DRE for PSA levels between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL if it has not already been done".

### Finasteride [^113Jv1gp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The following have been reported in general use with finasteride tablets and/or finasteride at lower doses:

allergic reactions, including rash, itching, hives, and swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face
rarely, some men may have testicular pain
blood in semen
trouble getting or keeping an erection that continued after stopping the medication
problems with ejaculation that continued after stopping the medication
male infertility and/or poor quality of semen. Improvement in the quality of semen has been reported after stopping the medication.
depression
decrease in sex drive that continued after stopping the medication
in rare cases, male breast cancer has been reported.

You should discuss side effects with your doctor before taking finasteride tablets and anytime you think you are having a side effect. These are not all the possible side effects with finasteride tablets. For more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at: 1–800-FDA-1088.

What you need to know while taking finasteride tablets:

You should see your doctor regularly while taking finasteride tablets. Follow your doctor's advice about when to have these checkups.
Checking for prostate cancer. Your doctor has prescribed finasteride tablets for BPH and not for treatment of prostate cancer — but a man can have BPH and prostate cancer at the same time. Your doctor may continue checking for prostate cancer while you take finasteride tablets.
About Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA). Your doctor may have done a blood test called PSA for the screening of prostate cancer. Because finasteride tablets decreases PSA levels, you should tell your doctor(s) that you are taking finasteride tablets. Changes in PSA levels will need to be evaluated by your doctor(s). Any increase in follow-up PSA levels from their lowest point may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if the test results are still within the normal range. You should also tell your doctor if you have not been taking finasteride tablets as prescribed because this may affect the PSA test results. For more information, talk to your doctor.

### Genome-wide association study of prostate-specific antigen levels identifies novel loci independent of prostate cancer [^111itW4Z]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a blood-based biomarker used for the detection and surveillance of prostate cancer (PCa). PCa can cause disruption of the prostate's cellular architecture, which in turn can result in PSA leaking into circulating blood. However, PSA levels can also be affected by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), local inflammation or infection, prostate volume, age, and germline genetics. In this regard, PSA is an organ — but not cancer — specific biomarker.

PSA screening for PCa has been used for over 20 years, but its use has declined recently because of concerns about over-diagnosis and over-treatment. While PSA levels at mid-life may modestly predict long-term PCa risk, and high PSA levels are correlated with more aggressive and lethal forms of disease, low PSA levels do not rule out PCa, and high PSA levels have a low predictive value for PCa. In the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, which had substantial crossover, there was no appreciable reduction in mortality directly related to PSA screening. Another randomized trial, however, showed that PSA screening may reduce PCa mortality. Between 20 and 60% of PSA-screened PCas are estimated to be over-diagnoses, and non-aggressive PSA-detected PCas are often treated with therapy that may involve substantial side effects.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for the detection of prostate cancer in symptomatic patients [^115KYGL3]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Types of studies

We included cross-sectional and cohort studies that reported paired data on the diagnostic accuracy of PSA for the detection of prostate cancer in symptomatic men, verified with the use of a reference test (prostate biopsy). We excluded studies if it was not possible to extract data for a complete two-by-two table for the target condition or if the patient cohort was only asymptomatic patients (i.e. a screening cohort). We did not restrict studies by publication date, country, or clinical setting.

Participants

The study population of interest was any patient with symptoms of a possible prostate cancer, with no history of the disease. We defined symptoms of prostate cancer as at least one of LUTS (nocturia, hesitancy, poor stream, incomplete voiding, double voiding, terminal dribbling, urgency, incontinence, frequency), haematuria, erectile dysfunction, or lower back pain. Symptoms may have been identified by a standardised tool, such as the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), clinical coding, or through patient self-report. We did not exclude studies based on age of participants or study setting. Where studies included groups of both asymptomatic and symptomatic men, we included men in the symptomatic group.

Index test

The index test was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in a peripheral blood sample, measured in nanograms per millilitre (ng/mL). We did not set an a priori PSA threshold for prostate cancer detection but instead extracted data based on the PSA thresholds used in each study.

Target condition

The target condition was prostate cancer, regardless of Gleason grade or clinicopathological stage.

Reference test

The reference test was a biopsy of the prostate with histological examination. We did not set an inclusion criteria on the basis of prostate biopsy approach used in studies, but this was recorded as part of the data extraction.

Electronic searches

Medline Ovid, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science databases were utilised to identify relevant studies. Key search terms, informed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) search strategies and pre-existing systematic reviews in the field of prostate cancer, were combined with MeSH terms for each database search. Hand-searching of reference lists from included studies and snowballing techniques were performed to locate any other possibly relevant studies. Please see Additional file 1 for the search strategy used in this review.

### Prostate cancer screening: the continuing controversy [^117MnhKD]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, with a lifetime prevalence of 17 percent. Prostate cancer symptoms generally occur in advanced stages, making early detection desirable. Digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen testing are the most commonly used screening tools. The goal of screening is to detect clinically significant prostate cancers at a stage when intervention reduces morbidity and mortality; however, the merits and methods of screening continue to be debated. Prostate-specific antigen levels may be less than 4 ng per mL in 15 to 38 percent of men with cancer, indicating a high false-negative rate. The positive predictive value of the prostate-specific antigen test is approximately 30 percent; therefore, less than one in three men with an abnormal finding will have cancer on biopsy. These limitations of the prostate-specific antigen test have led to variations designed to improve its accuracy (e.g., age- and race-specific cutoffs, free prostate-specific antigen tests); however, none of these modifications have been widely adopted because of unclear benefits. Although treatments have improved in the past two decades, therapy for prostate cancer is not benign and may lead to urinary incontinence, sexual dysfunction, or bowel dysfunction. New evidence affecting screening recommendations continues to accumulate, and two large randomized controlled trials of screening will be completed in the next few years. Current guidelines recommend an individualized, targeted, patient-centered discussion to facilitate a shared decision about screening plans.

### Influence of serum testosterone on urinary continence and sexual activity in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer [^116CTp1u]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We demonstrated a significant association between preoperative PSA and testosterone in men with low T (T < 10.4 nmol l −1) levels before prostatectomy, and this correlation was not evident in men with normal T.

Moreover, we showed that before RP men with low T presented significantly worse erectile function (lower SF scores) compared with men with normal T, and that T is positively correlated with erectile function when it is > 10.4 nmol l −1.

Finally, men with normal T preoperatively presented a strong correlation between their urinary continence and sexual activity.

American Cancer Society guideline — early detection of prostate cancer: For providers and their patients who choose to be tested, the guideline offers guidance on testing frequency and actions based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and it considers the traditional PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL a reasonable threshold for further evaluation; acknowledging that there is no true PSA cutoff point distinguishing cancer from noncancer, it suggests that providers consider individualized decision making when PSA levels fall in the indeterminate range of 2.5 ng/mL to 4.0 ng/mL, particularly for men at increased risk for high-grade cancer based on non-PSA risk factors.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^116b6Jpm]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and cancer risk — historical thresholds and biopsy-era findings: A PSA value of 4.0 ng/mL was accepted as the upper limit of normal, but prostate cancer rates were significant at lower PSA levels (between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL), and men with PSA levels < 2.5 ng/mL were believed to have low risk. With biopsies performed across all PSA levels, PSA "should not be considered 'elevated' or 'normal', because prostate cancer was identified at all levels of PSA, including values < 1.0 ng/mL", and "the higher the PSA, the higher the risk of cancer", with aggressive cancers identified at higher levels.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for male hypogonadism, more specifically with respect to clinical and laboratory follow-up, BSSM 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain PSA and perform DRE to assess prostate health before testosterone replacement therapy followed by obtaining PSA at 3–6 months, 12 months, and every 12 months thereafter.

### Discrepancy between expectations and experiences after prostate cancer treatment: a Dutch multicenter study [^115ah8rJ]. Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate possible discrepancies between patients' expectations concerning sexual side effects related to prostate cancer treatment, based on the obtained information prior to treatment. Moreover, to determine if demographic or clinical factors may have an effect on the accuracy of patients' expectations concerning sexual side effects after treatment.

Methods

A multicenter, cross-sectional survey was performed among men treated with prostatectomy, brachytherapy, external-beam radiotherapy and/or hormonal therapy.

Results

In total, 412 questionnaires were analyzed. Of men with sexual side effects after treatment, 1 in 3 (32.5%, n = 109) reported their complaints as worse than expected; significantly more often reported by men treated surgically (P = 0.001), men with a local stage tumor (P = 0.005) and by men with a lower prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis (P = 0.046). It was significantly less often reported by men treated with radiotherapy combined with hormonal therapy (P = 0.031). Men who used brochures as an information source reported their sexual side effects significantly less often as worse than expected (P < .001).

Conclusion

One in three men with sexual side effects after prostate cancer treatment, experienced their complaints as worse than expected based on the obtained information prior to treatment. Men treated with radiotherapy combined with hormonal therapy indicated less discrepancy between expectations and developed sexual side effects, whereas prostatectomy, low stage tumor and low prostate-specific antigen level were associated with more discrepancy. Brochures should be administered additionally to verbal information to improve patients' understanding of possible sexual side effects and to enhance the accuracy of patients' expectations.

Regarding medical management for male hypogonadism, more specifically with respect to testosterone therapy, contraindications, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to restrict testosterone replacement therapy to patients with a history of prostate cancer with a low risk for recurrence (preoperative PSA < 10 ng/mL, Gleason score < 7, cT1–2a), and initiate treatment after at least 1 year of follow-up with PSA level < 0.01 ng/mL.

### Use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to measure semen exposure resulting from male condom failures: implications for contraceptive efficacy and the prevention of sexually transmitted disease [^113NGu83]. Contraception (2003). Low credibility.

Accurate measurement of semen exposure resulting from condom failures can refine public health messages and improve predictions of condom efficacy in preventing pregnancy and HIV transmission. Eight hundred and thirty couples enrolled in a condom efficacy study were asked to collect a baseline sample of ejaculate from the inside of the first study condom they used and to collect a postcoital vaginal sample whenever a study condom broke or slipped off during intercourse. All samples were quantitatively tested for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a substance found only in human semen, using rocket immunoelectrophoresis, and inspected microscopically for presence of sperm. Sixty-eight baseline ejaculate samples collected from the inside of the first study condom by couples who subsequently experienced a condom failure averaged 13.4 microg PSA per swab and 79% of the samples averaged one or more sperm per high power field (hpf). Seventy-nine postcoital vaginal samples obtained after a condom break averaged 5.7 microg PSA per swab and only 38% averaged one or more sperm per hpf. The PSA results indicated a 50% reduction in semen exposure compared to baseline levels (p = 0.0001). Seventeen samples obtained after a condom slip-off averaged 2.5 microg PSA per swab and none of the samples averaged one or more sperm per hpf. The PSA results indicated an 80% reduction in semen exposure compared to baseline levels (p = 0.0001). Our results suggest that even condoms that fail reduce the risk of pregnancy and the transmission of sexually transmitted disease compared to unprotected intercourse. We also used PSA results to adjust a model designed to predict consistent-use pregnancy rates from condom breakage and slippage data.

### Prostatic specific antigen in patients with hypogonadism: effect of testosterone replacement [^115R6YXG]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

The effect of parenteral testosterone replacement therapy on prostatic specific antigen (PSA) level or the development or growth of prostate cancer is unclear.

Aim

To assess the effect of testosterone replacement on PSA level in patients with hypogonadism associated with erectile dysfunction (ED).

Methods

A total of 187 male patients above the age of 45 with hypogonadism associated with ED were enrolled in this study. Patients were screened for ED by the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Patients underwent routine laboratory investigations, plus total testosterone, and PSA assessment. Replacement treatment with parenteral testosterone every 2–4 weeks for 1 year was instituted. Total testosterone and PSA serum levels were assessed every 3 months during the treatment course.

Results

Mean age ± SD was 62.8 ± 11.4. Of the patients 87.7% were sexually active. Of the patients 10.2% had mild, 40.6% had moderate and 49.2% had severe ED. Of the study population, 62.5% had ED complaints for less than 5 years and 84.5% had gradual onset of their complaint. The majority of the patients (91.4%) had either progressive or stationary course while the minority reported regressive course and improvement of the condition. There was a significant increase of the post-treatment testosterone level in comparison to pretreatment level (P < 0.05). No significant increase in the post-treatment PSA level in comparison to pretreatment (P > 0.05). No significant difference between pre- and post-treatment categories of PSA level (normal, borderline, high) in relation to the severity of ED (P > 0.05). There was no significant association between PSA level and the duration of testosterone replacement therapy in the study population (P > 0.05).

Conclusion

The current study demonstrated that the level of PSA was not significantly changed after 1 year of testosterone replacement therapy in patients with hypogonadism associated with ED.

### Suitable sexual health care according to men with prostate cancer and their partners [^115jPMXT]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer among men in the Western world, with approximately 11.000 cases diagnosed in the Netherlands each year. Increased public awareness and prostate-specific antigen testing partially explain the raise of PCa detection. Treatment method is primarily selected according to disease stage and where applicable, to the patient's preference. Early detection and improvement of therapies have led to an increase in survival outcomes, meaning PCa therapy may be curative or life prolonging.

Nevertheless, can PCa treatment affect quality of life (QoL) majorly. Among other treatment-related side effects, such as incontinence of urine, sexual dysfunction (SD) is one of the most prevalent consequences of PCa treatment with erectile dysfunction (ED) as primary complaint. Five years after diagnosis, 79% of men treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) experience ED and 64% of men treated with radiotherapy. Seventy-two percent of men treated with RP experience significant loss of QoL due to ED. At present, common ED treatment options consist of PDE5 inhibitors, intra-urethral medications, intracavernous injections, vacuum therapy and penile protheses. Despite PDE5 inhibitors are considered as first-line treatment, alprostadil or tadalafil in comparison to placebo does not always show significant improvement in RP-related ED. Accordingly, it is important to initiate penile rehabilitation after PCa treatment as soon as possible in order to encounter which treatment suits best.

Alterations in sexual health do not only affect men, but their partners as well. Partners report higher levels of anxiety, not only as a result of coping with the disease, but also due to changes in their sexual relationship. Thirty-eight percent stated to be unsatisfied with the sexual relationship with their partner. Moreover, changes in a sexual relationship can negatively affect the overall relationship. A study performed among couples facing PCa showed that both men and partners suffered from the impact of the treatment-related side effects on their psychological wellbeing as well as on their romantic relationship.

Nevertheless, limited research has been performed to investigate adequate management of sexual side effects of PCa treatment. There are limited opportunities for men and partners to address the impact of the treatment-related side effects on their sexual health during follow-up consultations, since priority is given to disease control. Consequently, psychological wellbeing of men and their partners may be impaired, leading to a decrease in QoL.

### Prostate involvement during sexually transmitted infections as measured by prostate-specific antigen concentration [^116oxUSm]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Background:

We investigated prostate involvement during sexually transmitted infections by measuring serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a marker of prostate infection, inflammation, and/or cell damage in young, male US military members.

Methods:

We measured PSA before and during infection for 299 chlamydia, 112 gonorrhoea, and 59 non-chlamydial, non-gonococcal urethritis (NCNGU) cases, and 256 controls.

Results:

Chlamydia and gonorrhoea, but not NCNGU, cases were more likely to have a large rise (⩾40%) in PSA than controls (33.6%, 19.1%, and 8.2% vs 8.8%, P < 0.0001, 0.021, and 0.92, respectively).

Conclusion:

Chlamydia and gonorrhoea may infect the prostate of some infected men.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113JLyiw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — prostate monitoring and urological referral — specifies that for men 55–69 years and for men 40–69 years at increased risk for prostate cancer who choose prostate monitoring, clinicians should perform digital rectal examination and check prostate-specific antigen (PSA) before initiating treatment and then recheck PSA and digital rectal examination 3–12 mo after initiating T treatment; we recommend a urological consultation for hypogonadal men receiving testosterone treatment if during the first 12 months there is a confirmed increase in PSA concentration > 1.4 ng/mL above baseline, a confirmed PSA > 4.0 ng/mL, or a prostatic abnormality detected on digital rectal examination, and after 1 year, prostate monitoring should conform to standard guidelines for prostate cancer screening based on the race and age of the patient; clinicians should confirm PSA elevations by repeating the test, and in men whose baseline PSA is between 2.6 and 4 ng/mL, an increase > 4 ng/mL during testosterone treatment should be interpreted with repeat testing and referral decisions guided by a confirmed increase of > 1.4 ng/mL above baseline as well as an absolute PSA level of > 4 ng/mL; obtain urological consultation if there is an increase in serum PSA concentration > 1.4 ng/mL within 12 mo of initiating T treatment, a confirmed PSA > 4 ng/mL, detection of a prostatic abnormality on DRE, or substantial worsening of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^112K68WZ]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Values and preferences

The panel, including the patient partners, felt that this variability in values and preferences contributes to a weak recommendation. The recommendation against screening reflects a belief that most men would value avoiding complications from biopsies and subsequent treatment because the reduction in prostate cancer and death from screening is small and uncertain. Prostate cancer will often, though not always, remain indolent.

Men who place a high value on avoiding complications from biopsies and subsequent treatment are likely to decline screening. In contrast, men who place a higher value on even a small reduction of prostate cancer may opt for screening. Several panel members felt that higher risk patients — such as patients with family history of cancer or of African descent — may be more likely to seek screening because they may worry more about prostate cancer and want to rule out the diagnosis.

For men considering screening, shared decision making is critical to ensure that their decision is in line with their own values and preferences. The evidence summarised in this Rapid Recommendation is available in MAGICapp as decision aids that can support shared decision making.

Practical issues and other considerations

Figure 3 outlines the key practical issues. PSA testing can be performed on any normal blood sample, but prostate biopsies and their follow-up have important implications for daily life.

Fig 3
Practical issues about use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and biopsy for prostate cancer screening

Lower urinary tract symptoms (slow urine stream, sensation of incomplete emptying, increased urinary frequency) are common complaints in adult men that can have a major impact on quality of life. Benign prostatic enlargement is the major cause. Evidence to date indicates that men with these complaints are not at increased risk of prostate cancer.

For men who chose to undergo PSA testing, the optimal frequency of screening remains unknown. Figure 2 summarises the frequency used in the different trials, yet the accompanying systematic review did not find any significant subgroup effect of the effect of screening based on these different frequencies. Given that the ERSPC data are likely at lower risk of bias, PSA screening every four years — rather than, say, every year or only once in a lifetime — may be the optimal interval.

### The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer [^1178PjzA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

The study PCPT was published by Thompson IM and colleagues in 2003 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Prostate cancer. In the PCPT study, the trial question was: what is the role of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer? In the PCPT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PCPT study, the population was: 18882 male patients. The inclusion criteria were men ≥ 55 years with a normal DRE and PSA level ≤ 3.0 ng/mL. The key exclusion criteria were PSA level > 3.0 ng/mL, previous prostate cancer, early termination of the study, or declined biopsy. In the PCPT study, the interventions were: n = 9423 finasteride (5 mg/day for 7 years) n = 9459 placebo (matching placebo for 7 years). In the PCPT study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the prevalence of prostate cancer over the 7-year period (18.4% vs. 24.4%; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81). In the PCPT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in tumors of Gleason grade 7, 8, 9, or 10 (6.4% vs. 5.1%; RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.5). In the PCPT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in number of deaths (5 vs. 5). significant difference in sexual side-effects more common in finasteride group (p < 0.001 for all comparisons) and urinary symptoms more common in placebo group (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). In the PCPT study, the conclusion was: in men ≥ 55 years with a normal DRE and PSA level ≤ 3.0 ng/mL, finasteride was superior to placebo with respect to the prevalence of prostate cancer over the 7-year period.

### Does underestimated penile size impact erectile function in healthy men? [^1124f1fJ]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of objective (stretched) and subjective penile size in the erectile function in a urological check-up program on a cross-sectional study including 689 men aged 35–70 years. IIEF-5 questionnaire, physical examination (penile length, prostate volume, blood pressure, body mass index-BMI), metabolic syndrome (MS), comorbidities, habits (sexual intercourse frequency, physical activity, alcohol, and tobacco use), level of education, serum glucose, total testosterone, estradiol, PSA, lipid profile, and self-perceptions (ejaculation time and subjective penile size) were examined in multivariate models using logistic and linear regressions. Penile objective mean length was 13.08cm ± 2.32 and 67 (9.72%) patients referred small penis self-perception. Seventy-six (11.03%) participants had severe erectile dysfunction (ED), 75 (10.88%) had mild to moderate and moderate ED, 112 (16.25%) had mild ED and 426 (61.83%) had no ED. Risk factors for ED that held statistical significance were self-perceived small penis (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.35–3.69, p = .0017), sexual intercourse frequency (per week) (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.38–0.52, p < .0001), satisfactory ejaculation time (no vs. yes, OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.46–2.92, p < .0001), comorbidity (yes vs. no, OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.46–2.76, p < .0001), age > 65 years (OR = 2.93, 95% CI 1.53–5.61, p < .0001), tobacco use (yes vs. no, OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.02–1.96, p < .0375), regular physical activity (no vs. yes, OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.13–2.23, p < .0083), serum total testosterone < 200ng/dl (OR = 3.48, 95% CI 1.69–7.16, p = 0.0009), serum glucose > 100mg/dl (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.18–2.43, p = 0.0044) and systolic blood pressure > 130mmHg (OR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.16–2.19, p = 0.0037). Results suggest that in addition to previously reported risk factors, patient's subjective impressions of penile size negatively impacts sexual life in about 10% of men considered healthy, while objective penile length does not play significant role in erectile function.

### Does ejaculation have an effect on urinary flow rates? [^116VEAQg]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The primary objective of this investigation is to explore the impact of ejaculation on urinary flow rates in men experiencing lower urinary tract symptoms.

Materials and Methods

This study involved the enrollment of 55 male patients who presented with lower urinary tract symptoms. An assessment encompassed components, including medical history, questionnaires related to sexual activity and lower urinary tract symptoms, bladder diary, physical examination, urinalysis, urine culture, ultrasound examination and measurements of serum prostate-specific antigen, free flow uroflowmetry, and post-void residual urine volume. All participants were instructed to abstain from ejaculation for 3 days before undergoing uroflowmetry (UF1). Subsequently, they were required to ejaculate. Subsequent uroflowmetry assessments were conducted at 2 to 4h (UF2) and 48 to 50h (UF3) after ejaculation. No further ejaculations were permitted during this timeframe.

Results

The patients had a mean age of 50.97 ± 1.47 years. Statistically significant differences were observed in the mean values of Q max and corrected Q max (cQ max) between UF1 and UF2 measurements (p < 0.05). These differences were only in patients with benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the number of patients with Q max < 15mL/s showed a statistically significant difference between UF1 and UF2 measurements, specifically in the BPE group (p = 0.016).

Conclusions

In this study, we have observed a significant and temporary increase in the Q max following ejaculation, particularly among patients with BPE. This indicates that ejaculation can potentially complicate the interpretation of uroflowmetry results. Therefore, further research is necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon.

### The relationship of testosterone to prostate-specific antigen in men with sexual dysfunction [^112jC9oX]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Concern about a testosterone (T)-induced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase is often perceived as one of the main limitations in treating hypogonadism even when it is symptomatic, such as in subjects with sexual dysfunction (SD).

Aim

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between T and PSA levels in subjects with SD. Methods. We retrospectively evaluated the relationship between T and PSA in 2,291 subjects seeking medical care at our outpatient clinic for SD (sample A). The analysis was then repeated in a selected subpopulation of 1,421 subjects apparently free from prostatic diseases (sample B).

Main Outcome Measures

The specific association between PSA levels, circulating androgens, and different clinical signs and symptoms of hypogonadism, as assessed by ANDROTEST structured interview, was evaluated.

Results

In both samples A and B, subjects with higher PSA levels reported a lower prevalence of hypogonadism-related symptoms and signs, as well as higher total testosterone (TT), and analogue and calculated free T. However, when the association between PSA and T was evaluated as a function of T deciles, the upper nine groups had similar PSA values, with the lowest demonstrated a significantly reduced PSA (the lowest vs. the rest of the sample: 0.61[0.38–1.23] ng/mL vs. 0.86[0.57–1.44] ng/mL, and 0.51[0.30–0.94] ng/mL vs. 0.73[0.52–1.10] ng/mL, respectively, for samples A and B; both P < 0.0001). Furthermore, when the relationship between hypogonadism (TT < 8 nmol/L) and PSA levels was evaluated according to age, it was significant only in younger subjects, but not in the older ones.

Conclusions

Our data demonstrated that PSA is unrelated to T concentration across most of the T range, except for the most severely T deficient, and that a significant relationship between T and PSA is seen in younger but not in older men.

### American Geriatrics Society identifies another five things that healthcare providers and patients should question [^114m5oFL]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer screening in older men — trial data and guideline statements specify limited benefit by age and emphasize preference-sensitive decisions. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) states to "recommend against prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer". In the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), men "aged 55 to 69" had screening "associated with a 21% lower relative risk of prostate cancer death after 11 years of follow-up", with "no benefit for men aged 70 and older". The study estimated that "1,055 men would need to be screened and 37 to be treated to prevent a single death from prostate cancer in 11 years", while treatments "have a 20% to 30% risk of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction". Reflecting this, "The panel now recommends individualized decision-making regarding PSA screening for men aged 55 and older, taking into account the risk of prostate cancer and patient preferences".

### Empirical estimates of prostate cancer overdiagnosis by age and prostate-specific antigen [^116oG1rU]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Overdiagnosis is a critical problem in prostate cancer screening. Men with screen-detected cancers are commonly subject to radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, leading to persistent urinary, sexual and bowel morbidities. Such treatment is no benefit for cancers that would never have become apparent in the absence of screening. Overdiagnosis was one of the reasons why the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended against prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening.

Risk of overdiagnosis varies in predictable ways. For example, a cancer diagnosis prompted by a PSA of 10 ng/ml in a healthy man in his early fifties would otherwise very likely be clinically diagnosed in his lifetime; conversely, a man in his 80s with a PSA only slightly above biopsy thresholds would most probably die of another cause before signs or symptoms led to diagnosis. Yet, there are remarkably few data on the impact of age and PSA level on overdiagnosis. Papers often report specific estimates of overdiagnosis for PSA screening as a whole. These estimates are averages that may obscure dramatic variations in overdiagnosis risk.

We hypothesized that if we could identify factors that increase the risk of overdiagnosis, appropriate changes in screening practices could importantly shift the ratio of benefits to harms. In this paper, we examine the influence of age and PSA on prostate cancer overdiagnosis. Specifically, we sought to estimate the proportion of excess cases diagnosed in the US in the years after the introduction of the PSA-test that would have been avoided had PSA screening been restricted to younger men. We then sought to estimate the risk of biopsy detectable cancer relative to the long-term risk of prostate cancer morbidity at a given PSA for 60-year-old men, approximately the midpoint of the age range in many screening recommendations. Both excess incidence and ratio of the risk of cancer morbidity compared to biopsy detectable cancer are correlates of overdiagnosis, rather than direct estimates, and are useful primarily for comparison between groups. We hypothesized that there would be large differences in the number of excess cases by age group and risk of cancer-related morbidity by baseline PSA level.

### Physics-informed machine learning digital twin for reconstructing prostate cancer tumor growth via PSA tests [^112EB1Si]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer that affect men. It is estimated that prostate cancer accounted for 1.4 million new cases globally and resulted in more than 370,000 deaths in 2020 alone. Prostate cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth and division of luminal cells within the prostate gland. Over time, these cancerous cells can invade nearby tissues and potentially spread to other parts of the body, mainly to the bones, lymph nodes, liver, and lungs – in a process called metastasis. Therefore, predicting the evolution of prostate cancer is essential for timely detection of growth and halting the expansion of the disease.

The diagnosis of prostate cancer typically relies on the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS), which assigns scores on a five-point scale to lesions observed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, and the Gleason score, which assesses the differentiation of cells in biopsy samples, serving as an indicator of tumor prognosis. After confirming tumor presence through MRI and biopsy, prostate cancer monitoring is commonly based on the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biomarker. The PSA is a protein produced by both normal and cancerous cells within the prostate gland. Its main function is to liquefy semen, aiding in the mobility and transportation of sperm during ejaculation. PSA levels in the blood have been extensively employed as a biomarker for both the detection and ongoing monitoring of prostate cancer. Elevated levels of PSA may indicate various prostate conditions, including prostate cancer. While the exact reason for increased PSA levels in prostate cancer is not fully understood, it is believed that cancerous cells can disrupt the normal architecture of the prostate gland, leading to increased production and leakage of PSA into the bloodstream. Consequently, measuring PSA levels in the blood can help in both the detection and the monitoring of prostate cancer. Yet, tumor progression and growth often occur without a significant rise in PSA levels, thereby obscuring the prognosis of the tumor. The limited specificity and sensitivity of the PSA as biomarker – are linked with poor diagnosis, as well as treatment and screening-related adverse effects. Consequently, it is essential to deepen our understanding of the relationship between PSA levels and tumor development.

### The trends in prostate specific antigen usage amongst United Kingdom urologists – a questionnaire based study [^111v8i3J]. BMC Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer, with nearly 32,000 men diagnosed in the UK each year. Unlike breast and cervical cancer, its female counterparts, there is no national United Kingdom (UK) screening programme for prostate cancer. However at present opportunistic screening is occurring, with many physicians using the serum Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test.

PSA, also known as human kallikrein 2, is produced by the luminal prostatic cells which line prostatic acini. PSA is responsible for liquefying semen and hence has a major role in fertility. It is possible to detect PSA in small amounts in the serum of healthy males and this level increases in prostate cancer. However, whilst PSA is tissue specific an increase in circulating levels is not definitively linked to tumour development. Urethral instrumentation, urinary infection, prostatitis, urinary retention, ejaculation and benign prostatic hypertrophy all raise serum PSA levels. The PSA serum test was initially used as a sign of recurrent disease following radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy for prostate cancer, but came into mainstream usage as an diagnostic test in the 1980s.

Based upon a cut-off level of 4 ng/ml, the standard serum PSA test has a sensitivity of approximately 90% and a specificity of approximately 40%. However, these values change depending upon the specified PSA cut-off level. The high false positive rate leads to a large number of men undergoing further investigations, which are unnecessary, invasive and raise anxiety. False negative tests also occur and serve to give false reassurance, as some prostate cancer will be missed.

There is no worldwide consensus on prostate cancer screening. There are several studies to date that have looked at the benefit of screening for prostate cancer. An observational study from Tyrol, Austria reported on the geographical differences observed between Tyrol, where PSA testing had been freely available since 1993, and the rest of Austria, where it hadn't. The study showed a marked decline in prostate cancer mortality detected in Tyrol as compared to the rest of Austria. The European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) is still underway, however preliminary results suggest that screen detected prostate cancer has more favourable prognostic indicators that non-screen detected prostate cancer, but as yet no mortality advantage to screening has been shown.

### Prostate-specific antigen concentration in vaginal fluid after exposure to semen [^117TU2qu]. Contraception (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the best established biomarker of semen exposure. PSA in vaginal fluid returns to pre-exposure concentrations within 24–48 h, but the speed of decay during the first 10 h is unknown. We sought to determine how fast PSA concentrations decline during the first 10 h after exposure to semen.

Study Design

Women in the 50 enrolled couples were intravaginally inoculated with 10, 20, 100 and 200 μl of their partner's semen and then collected vaginal swabs immediately after, 30 min, 4 h and 10 h after exposure. Forty-seven sets of samples were tested for PSA. Mixed linear models for repeated measures examined the association between log-transformed PSA values and sampling time and semen exposure volume. Sensitivity analyses excluded data from nonabstainers. Fixed-effect estimates from the statistical models were graphed.

Results

PSA values were highest at 200 μl inoculation volumes and at earlier post-exposure time points, then decline steadily. The lowest inoculation volume (10 μl) corresponded to the smallest concentration of PSA throughout the post-inoculation time points. Average PSA levels return to clinically non-detectable levels within 10 h only at the lowest semen exposures. The PSA decay curve assumes a very similar profile across all time points and semen amounts.

Conclusions

The PSA decay curve is similar for varying semen exposure volumes, with average PSA concentrations remaining above clinical thresholds 10 h after exposure at all except the very smallest semen exposure levels. PSA is an objective marker of recent exposure to semen, permitting such detection with high accuracy.

Implications

This study clarifies how PSA values vary at different semen exposure levels and time points during the first 10 h post-exposure. Future contraceptive studies that use PSA as a semen biomarker will be better informed about PSA concentrations at different sampling times and exposure amounts.

### What predicts emotional response in men awaiting prostate biopsy? [^113w5Qu9]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prostate cancer is the most frequent malignant disease in older men and is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in this age group, after lung cancer. Prostate cancer rates in Ireland are the highest in Europe and Irish men have a 1 in 8 chance of developing prostate cancer.

Incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) worldwide is increasing as opportunistic screening becomes more widespread and average life expectancy rises. Despite screening availability, research yields conflicting results on outcomes. A European trial examining disease specific mortality found benefits to population-based PCa screening but this was not replicated in a similar trial in the United States. Furthermore, both over-diagnosis and resulting over-treatment are problematic sequelae of PCa screening due to low diagnostic specificity of prostate specific antigen (PSA levels) and prostatic biopsies.

So the optimal management of screen-detected, localised prostate cancer remains controversial. However, the gold standard in early diagnosis of potentially curable and organ-confined prostate cancer is transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic prostate biopsy (TRUS-Bx), the most common form of investigation of raised PSA levels. Biopsy can cause bleeding, pain, urinary and sexual symptoms and it has been reported that up to 7% of men require hospital admission within 30 days of biopsy, most for febrile infections.

While considerable focus has been given to medical sequelae, there is a relative paucity of empirical data examining the psychological impact of a prostate biopsy.

Existing qualitative research assessing the subjective experience of the procedure indicates that while some men find it merely uncomfortable, others report that it is stressful, exhausting, extremely painful and view it as the worst aspect of their disease experience. Further reports reveal that some men express fears post biopsy, for example, that cancer cells might pass from a man to his wife during ejaculation or that biopsy might spread cancer cells to other parts of the body. The extant qualitative literature, therefore, indicates that men perceive biopsy as a stressful event.

Prostate cancer — adverse effects of hormonal therapy reflect the systemic impact of lowering or blocking androgens; hormonal therapy includes treatments designed to affect cells whose functioning depends on androgens, and prostate cancer cells are susceptible to such treatments. Among the most common side effects are increased risk for weight gain, obesity, and diabetes; cardiovascular disease; breast enlargement and/or tenderness; sexual problems including diminished sex drive and erectile dysfunction; emotional changes including anger, sadness, and fatigue; osteoporosis; loss of muscle strength and mass with increased risk of falls and fractures in older men; anemia contributing to fatigue; and cognitive changes such as impaired thought processes and memory loss.

### Patients' perceptions of the negative effects following different prostate cancer treatments and the impact on psychological well-being: a nationwide survey [^113xR5yU]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in developed countries, and 420 000 new cases were diagnosed in Europe in 2012. In Finland, the mean annual number from 2009–2013 was 4791 cases. The incidence of prostate cancer is increasing worldwide. This increase is partially because of the widespread testing for prostate-specific antigen (PSA;). Most prostate cancers are detected when they are localised and the prognosis is good, and the prevalence is increasing also because of the ageing of the population. Although survival is good, quality of life (QoL) outcomes are impaired by the negative effects due to various prostate cancer treatments (2013;).

Harmful, multiple and persistent adverse effects are common after all forms of active prostate cancer therapy: radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation, brachytherapy and hormone therapy. The most common negative effects include urinary, sexual and bowel dysfunction, all of which can reduce patient well-being and QoL. The negative effects vary by treatment method. All active prostate cancer treatments result in sexual difficulties; prostatectomy and radiotherapies also in urinary dysfunction; external radiotherapy also in bowel dysfunction; and hormone therapy causes, for example, hot flushes and mood disturbances. Consensus does not exist regarding whether the benefits of active treatment for early prostate cancer, compared with those of surveillance, outweigh the negative effects of the treatment.

### Mortality risk for docetaxel-treated, high-grade prostate cancer with low PSA levels: a meta-analysis [^116BuvPy]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the addition of docetaxel to standard of care (SOC) therapy with radiation and testosterone suppression or radical prostatectomy associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer–specific and all-cause deaths in patients with high-grade, nonmetastatic prostate cancer with low prostate-specific antigen levels?

Findings

In this meta-analysis of 4 randomized clinical trials (145 participants with prostate cancer), adding docetaxel to SOC treatment in patients who were in otherwise good health was associated with a significant reduction in death due to prostate cancer.

Meaning

The poor prognosis of patients with high-grade prostate cancer and low levels of prostate-specific antigen levels may be improved with the addition of docetaxel to SOC treatment.

### Factors influencing prostate-specific antigen response among men treated with testosterone therapy for 6 months [^116NhKBE]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Factors influencing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) changes in men undergoing testosterone (T) therapy have not been well studied.

Aim

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of selected variables on PSA changes in hypogonadal men administered with 1.62% testosterone gel (T-gel) for 6 months.

Methods

A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 274 (234 T-gel, 40 placebo) hypogonadal men > 18 years of age, with baseline T concentrations < 300ng/dL, PSA ≤ 2.5ng/mL, and negative digital rectal examination. Subjects received once-daily T-gel for T therapy.

Main Outcome Measures

Changes in mean serum PSA, percentage of free PSA (%fPSA), and T from baseline to 6 months (182 days).

Results

Mean age was 53.5 years and baseline mean values were total T 247ng/dL, PSA 0.9ng/mL, and %fPSA 24.6%. Among men treated with T-gel, T increased to 499ng/dL and PSA increased by 0.1ng/mL (P = 0.0012). PSA increased ≥ 0.3ng/mL in 26.3%, < 0.3ng/mL in 73.7%, including a decline from baseline in 33.0%. In the placebo group, T increased 29ng/dL to 274ng/dL, and PSA decreased 0.1ng/mL, compared with baseline. A greater increase in PSA was noted in men ≥ 60 years old than in men < 60 years old (0.4 vs. 0.05ng/mL, respectively; P = 0.0006). Mean PSA did not change in men with baseline serum T > 250ng/dL, whereas it increased by 0.2ng/mL in men with T ≤ 250ng/dL (P = 0.0031). PSA increased 0.3ng/mL in men with baseline %fPSA < 20% and 0.1ng/mL in men with %fPSA ≥ 20%.

Conclusions

Overall, T-gel treatment was associated with a minor increase in PSA, of questionable clinical significance. Factors predicting greater PSA increases included age ≥ 60 years, baseline T ≤ 250ng/dL, and %fPSA < 20%. Men with T > 250ng/dL and age < 60 years demonstrated minimal or no PSA change.

5-alpha reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) therapy — indications and counseling: For the purpose of symptom improvement, 5-ARI monotherapy should be used as a treatment option in patients with LUTS/BPH with prostatic enlargement as judged by a prostate volume of > 30g on imaging, a prostate specific antigen (PSA) > 1.5ng/mL, or palpable prostate enlargement on digital rectal exam (DRE). (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B) 5-ARIs alone or in combination with alpha blockers are recommended as a treatment option to prevent progression of LUTS/BPH and/or reduce the risks of urinary retention and need for future prostate-related surgery. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A) Before starting a 5-ARI, clinicians should inform patients of the risks of sexual side effects, certain uncommon physical side effects, and the low risk of prostate cancer.

### Prostate-specific antigen in female urine: a prospective study involving 217 women [^115tXwTw]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Histomorphologic studies have provided evidence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-producing tissue in the female urethra. Some urine samples from women in a small series were positive for PSA, but no systematic investigation of this subject has been done to date.

Methods

In a prospective study, we analyzed whether PSA occurs in the urine of women and what factors induce detectable PSA levels. The urine samples of 217 women were analyzed (Hybritech-Tandem E-PSA) under standardized conditions. The impact of urine pH and volume was investigated, and the results were correlated with clinical data (age, residual urine, urinary tract infection and prior sexual intercourse within 48 hours).

Results

A positive PSA level greater than the detection limit of 0.1 ng/mL was found in 11% of the analyzed samples; their mean value was 0.29 ng/mL. pH correction did not result in a significant difference. The voiding volume had no influence on the PSA level. Among the cases of detectable PSA, women younger than 50 years of age (n = 14) had a mean PSA of 0.34 ng/mL and those older than 50 years (n = 9) a mean of 0.23 ng/mL. One of 9 women with and 22 of 208 women without residual urine volume had a detectable PSA level, as did 0 of 20 with and 23 of 197 women without urinary tract infection, and 3 of 7 with and 20 of 210 women without prior sexual intercourse within the previous 48 hours. None of the differences were significant.

Conclusions

A urine PSA level was detected in 11% of all women studied, with PSA values apparently age dependent. Any urine portion is suitable for analysis. No influence was determined for residual urine volume or urinary tract infection. Sexual intercourse may cause detectable PSA values, but the data of this study did not provide sufficient evidence for this hypothesis.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112hU76n]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Protocol registration

The protocol for this systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016042347).

BMJ Rapid Recommendation and patient involvement

In accordance with the BMJ Rapid Recommendations process, a guideline panel provided critical input and guidance during the review process, which included identifying populations, subgroups, and outcomes of interest. The panel consisted of general practitioners, urologists, methodologists, and men eligible for screening. These eligible men received personal training and support to optimise contributions throughout the guideline development process. They were full members of the guideline panel and contributed to the selection and prioritisation of outcomes. They also contributed to the assessment of values and preferences and provided critical feedback to the systematic review protocol and BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

### The association of pathogenic factors of metabolic syndrome on serum prostate-specific antigen levels: a pilot study [^112Qao5R]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are correlated. To investigate the underlying effect of MetS on PSA levels, the relationship between the major pathogenic factors of MetS and serum PSA levels was studied.

Methods

A total of 506 ostensibly healthy men who underwent routine health check-ups were recruited to this study. We evaluated the effect of the major pathogenic factors of MetS, which included insulin resistance, a subclinical inflammatory state and sexual hormone changes, on serum PSA levels by using linear regression analysis and multivariate analysis after adjusting for age, BMI and prostate volume.

Results

When simultaneously adjusting for age, BMI, prostate volume and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum insulin levels and SHBG levels were inversely correlated with serum PSA levels (P = 0.049 and P = 0.004, respectively), and testosterone levels were positively correlated with serum PSA levels (P = 0.039). In multivariate regression models, serum insulin levels and serum SHBG levels were significantly associated with serum PSA levels (both P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Among the major pathogenic factors of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and sexual hormone changes may be the most significant contributors to the decline in serum PSA levels.

### Update on PSA testing [^1152tRu9]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

The use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer screening has increased dramatically over the past decade. Determining the most efficient way to use PSA testing and how to interpret total PSA levels and changes in PSA values over time remain challenging. Guidelines for early detection of prostate cancer have a direct impact on the number of unnecessary tests performed and are critical for developing a successful screening approach for prostate cancer. The age at which PSA screening should begin, PSA testing intervals, and the importance of understanding fluctuations in PSA values over time are discussed in the framework of recent discoveries in the field. Results from ongoing randomized trials will confirm whether prostate cancer screening is an effective method for reducing deaths from prostate cancer and what approaches will provide the most cost-effective screening strategies.

### Finasteride and tadalafil (Entadfi) [^112BKYyz]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

After taking a single capsule, the tadalafil active ingredient of ENTADFI remains in your body for more than 2 days. The active ingredient can remain longer if you have problems with your kidneys or liver, or you are taking certain other medications (see "Can Other Medicines Affect ENTADFI?").

Stop sexual activity and get medical help right away if you get symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness, or nausea during sex. Sexual activity can put an extra strain on your heart, especially if your heart is already weak from a heart attack or heart disease.

See also "What Are The Possible Side Effects Of ENTADFI?"

You should see your doctor regularly while taking ENTADFI. Follow your doctor's advice about when to have these checkups.

Checking for prostate cancer. Your doctor has prescribed ENTADFI for BPH and not for treatment of prostate cancer — but a man can have BPH and prostate cancer at the same time. Your doctor may continue checking for prostate cancer while you take ENTADFI.

About Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA). Your doctor may have done a blood test called PSA for the screening of prostate cancer. Because ENTADFI decreases PSA levels, you should tell your doctor(s) that you are taking ENTADFI. Changes in PSA levels will need to be evaluated by your doctor(s). Any increase in follow-up PSA levels from their lowest point may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if the test results are still within the normal range. You should also tell your doctor if you have not been taking ENTADFI as prescribed because this may affect the PSA test results. For more information, talk to your doctor.

### Benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer: an evidence update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^111x46EA]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in men in the United States, and prostate cancer screening has increased in recent years. In 2002, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against screening for prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing.

Purpose

To examine new evidence on benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic men for prostate cancer with PSA.

Data Sources

English-language articles identified in PubMed and the Cochrane Library (search dates, January 2002 to July 2007), reference lists of retrieved articles, and expert suggestions.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses of PSA screening and cross-sectional and cohort studies of screening harms and of the natural history of screening-detected cancer were selected to answer the following questions: Does screening for prostate cancer with PSA, as a single-threshold test or as a function of multiple tests over time, decrease morbidity or mortality? What are the magnitude and nature of harms associated with prostate cancer screening, other than overtreatment? What is the natural history of PSA-detected, nonpalpable, localized prostate cancer?

Data Extraction

Studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined U.S. Preventive Services Task Force criteria.

Data Synthesis

No good-quality randomized, controlled trials of screening for prostate cancer have been completed. In 1 cross-sectional and 2 prospective cohort studies of fair to good quality, false-positive PSA screening results caused psychological adverse effects for up to 1 year after the test. The natural history of PSA-detected prostate cancer is poorly understood.

Limitations

Few eligible studies were identified. Long-term adverse effects of false-positive PSA screening test results are unknown.

Conclusion

Prostate-specific antigen screening is associated with psychological harms, and its potential benefits remain uncertain.

### Detection of two biological markers of intercourse: prostate-specific antigen and Y-chromosomal DNA [^117HH5cw]. Contraception (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although biological markers of women's exposure to semen from vaginal intercourse have been developed as surrogates for risk of infection or probability of pregnancy, data on their persistence time and clearance are limited.

Study Design

During 2006–2008, 52 couples were enrolled for three 14-day cycles of abstinence from vaginal sex during which women were exposed in the clinic to a specific quantity (10, 100 or 1000 μL) of their partner's semen. Vaginal swabs were collected before and at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 144 h after exposure for testing for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Y-chromosome DNA (Yc DNA).

Results

Immediately after exposure to 1000 μL of semen, the predicted sensitivity of being PSA positive was 0.96; this decreased to 0.65, 0.44, 0.21 and 0.07 at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. Corresponding predicted sensitivity of being Yc DNA positive was 0.72 immediately postexposure; this increased to 0.76 at 1 h postexposure and then decreased to 0.60 (at 6 h), 0.63 (at 12 h), 0.49 (at 24 h), 0.21 (at 48 h), 0.17 (at 72 h) and 0.12 (at 144 h).

Conclusions

Overall findings suggest that PSA may be more consistent as a marker of very recent exposure and that Yc DNA is more likely to be detected in the vagina after 12 h postexposure compared to PSA.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline part I: prostate cancer screening [^116X4e2p]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

AUA/SUO prostate cancer screening — management of a newly elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) states: For people with a newly elevated PSA, clinicians should repeat the PSA prior to a secondary biomarker, imaging, or biopsy. (Expert Opinion). In people with a newly elevated PSA, it will return to a normal level in 25% to 40% upon retesting, and in STHLM-3 (2 PSA tests 8 weeks apart) among 1,686 biopsied patients with a PSA of 3 to 10 ng/mL, 283 (17%) had a PSA that returned to normal (< 3 ng/mL). The Panel also strongly supports that empiric antibiotics should not be utilized to treat an elevated PSA in an asymptomatic person. Neither digital rectal examination (DRE) nor bicycle riding appreciably alters the PSA, most controlled studies evaluating ejaculation suggest it either does not significantly impact or modestly increases (~10%) PSA, the half-life of PSA is 2 to 3 days, and a repeat PSA in a few months is recommended with recognition that urinary tract infections and instrumentation cause transient increases and that PSA elevations in these settings should be repeated after appropriate time periods to allow for PSA to reach baseline level.

### Intermittent androgen suppression in prostate cancer: testosterone levels and its implication [^113GY2wC]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) in patients affected by prostate cancer seems to lessen the severity of the side effects that are associated with continuous androgen ablation.

Aim

This report monitors the effect of IAS on testosterone values, quality of life, and sexual function during phases of therapy.

Methods

A total of 100 patients entered a prospective study of IAS. Androgen blockade was prolonged until a serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) nadir was reached and then resumed for a PSA threshold of 10 ng/mL, in repeated cycles. During I phase, we assessed testosterone levels, well-being with quality-of-life score, and sexual function.

Main Outcome Measures

All patients were followed up every 3 months with PSA and total testosterone determinations, and with quality-of-life score using a 10-point questionnaire. Side effects were assessed using yes/no questions. Sexual function was assessed using yes/no questions and in the sexually active patients with International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF).

Results

All patients completed I cycle of treatment (I ON plus I OFF phase). During the OFF phase, 46% of patients showed low testosterone levels, while the others recovered normal testosterone concentrations at a mean of 6.2 months after therapy. There is a negative correlation between baseline PSA values and length of OFF phase and testosterone recovery, and a negative correlation between length of OFF phase and testosterone value during OFF phase. Worsening in Quality of Life (QOL) was significant during active treatment with respect to baseline, but therapy withdrawal showed a positive impact with respect to treatment period. Improvement in quality of life correlated to testosterone recovery and time to testosterone recovery. Fifty-four percent of subjects had normal sexual intercourse at therapy withdrawal, with a correspondence to time to testosterone recovery.

Conclusions

Quality of life and sexual function seem to follow testosterone normalization. These results could have implications in the analysis of IAS.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^116C786A]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society early prostate cancer detection — core information for informed decision-making states that prostate cancer is an important health concern for men, and screening with the PSA blood test alone or with both PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE) detects cancer at an earlier stage than if no screening is performed. Prostate cancer screening may be associated with a reduction in the risk of dying from prostate cancer; however, evidence is conflicting and experts disagree about the value of screening, and for men whose prostate cancer is detected by screening, it is not currently possible to predict which men are likely to benefit from treatment. Depending on the treatment selected, treatment for prostate cancer can lead to urinary, bowel, sexual, and other health problems that may be significant or minimal, permanent or temporary; the PSA and DRE may produce false-positive or false-negative results, meaning that men without cancer may have abnormal results and get unnecessary additional testing while clinically significant cancers may be missed, and false-positive results can lead to sustained anxiety about prostate cancer risk. Abnormal results from screening with the PSA or DRE require prostate biopsies to determine whether or not the abnormal findings are cancer, biopsies can be painful, may lead to complications like infection or bleeding, and can miss clinically significant cancer, and not all men whose prostate cancer is detected through screening require immediate treatment, but they may require periodic blood tests and prostate biopsies to determine the need for future treatment.

### Predictive value of inflammatory marker PLR in prostate cancer [^114SNkfh]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common cancer among older men, resulting in the death of nearly 300,000 men each year. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the primary tool for routine prostate cancer screening, received its initial approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the 1980s as a tumor marker for monitoring elderly prostate cancer patients. However, the application of PSA as a biomarker has encountered numerous limitations to date. PSA is not a specific biomarker for prostate cancer, and some things can affect its levels, including age, acute prostatitis, ejaculation, catheterization, trauma, and particular medications. For PSA ranges between 4 and 10 ng/mL, 10–20 ng/mL, and greater than 20 ng/mL, studies have reported cancer detection rates of 11.8–20.5%, 20.5–25.0%, and 47.1–53.0%, respectively. Even at a PSA range of less than 4, prostate cancer is still detected in close to 15% of men. The decision to perform a prostate biopsy solely based on PSA levels leads to overdiagnosis, causing physical discomfort, psychological suffering, and financial strain on the patient. Currently, some new imaging and biomolecular markers are not widely available for clinical use due to their cost and practicality. With the increasing demand for healthcare, there is a need for cost-effective and practical biomarkers for early diagnosis of PCa, which would enhance patient treatment options and prognosis.

Inflammation has long been recognized as strongly associated with cancer incidence, tumor stage, and progression. Hematologic laboratory tests can be utilized to evaluate systemic inflammation. The Systemic Immune Inflammation Index (SII) is an indicator showing the systemic immune and inflammatory status. In 2014, researchers initially used it to predict the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. SII integrates absolute blood cell counts of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets by multiplying the platelet count by the ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte counts and is presently regarded as an indicator of human immune response and inflammatory condition. As a common inflammatory marker, the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) not only reflects the enhancement of the body's inflammatory response but also indicates the enhancement of platelet-mediated tumor-promoting effects or the weakening of lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor immunity. In previous studies, PLR was an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in various tumors, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, and gastric cancer. Most importantly, many inflammatory markers are inexpensive and reproducible in clinical laboratory tests.

### Prostate involvement during sexually transmitted infections as measured by prostate-specific antigen concentration [^112sKPr2]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Although we used PSA as a marker of prostate infection/inflammation/cell damage, PSA may also possibly rise as a result of a more generalised response to infection at other non-prostate sites (e.g. urethra), recent ejaculation (within 1 day), or digital rectal examination (DRE;). We believe these possibilities are less likely because of null results for NCNGU, an STI defined by urethral inflammation; unchanged results after adjustment for sexual activity in our previous study; and the extreme rarity with which DREs are performed during routine STI work-up, especially in the military.

In summary, young men with chlamydia and gonorrhea were more likely to have a large PSA rise during infection than controls. Future studies should investigate the specificity of this rise to prostate infection, as well as the long-term effects of infections on PSA and, by possible extension, the prostate environment.

### Prostate involvement during sexually transmitted infections as measured by prostate-specific antigen concentration [^116RjFnM]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this large study of US military members, men with exudative STIs were more likely to have a large PSA rise during infection than controls, similar to findings from our previous smaller study of STI patients. This rise was observed for chlamydia and gonorrhoea, but not for NCNGU. Although cases were also more likely to have higher pre-acute PSA, this difference should not have influenced inferences for PSA change because similar findings were observed for absolute and relative change, only the latter of which varies depending on the pre-acute value.

While all STIs had the potential for prostate involvement, chlamydia cases were most likely to have a large PSA rise, followed by gonorrhoea cases, whereas NCNGU cases were no more likely to have a rise than controls. One possible reason for these differences may be likelihood of symptoms as a possible marker of duration of infection. We previously hypothesised that men with asymptomatic infections/non-specific symptoms might be more likely to have prostate infection because of their likely lesser awareness of their STI and consequent delay seeking treatment. This delay might provide pathogens with greater opportunity to ascend to and infect the prostate, which we believe is a likely necessary first step for prostate carcinogenesis. This hypothesis is consistent with differences in the likelihood of symptoms for each STI. Approximately half of chlamydial infections are asymptomatic in men, a large proportion of which are ultimately diagnosed in the military because of routine female screening, contact tracing, and self-referral for risky behaviours; 1–49% of gonorrhoeal infections present without symptoms; and a likely even smaller proportion of diagnosed NCNGU infections present without symptoms because NCNGU is typically only investigated in men with urethral symptoms. An alternative explanation for null NCNGU findings, but not for differences between chlamydia and gonorrhoea, is that some NCNGU cases did not have an infectious aetiology.

### Circulating sex hormones play no role in the association between sexual activity and the risk of prostate cancer [^113ygQnV]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

High sexual activity (SA) has been reported to reduce the risk of prostate cancer (PC). The role of sex hormones (SHs) in this regard remains controversial.

Aims

To determine the impact of SA and SHs on PC development.

Methods

In a multicentric hospital-based case-control study, 194 newly diagnosed PC patients along with 317 age-matched controls were studied. Sociodemographic and medical characteristics of participants were recorded. History of vasectomy and sexually transmitted infection (STI), marital status, age at first intercourse, premarital sex, and the current frequency of sexual intercourses per month (SPM) were evaluated. Total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), estradiol (ES), sex hormone binding globulin, and albumin were also measured. Logistic regression model was used to identify independent risk factors for PC.

Main Outcome Measures

(i) The association between SA, SHs, and the risk of PC; (ii) The correlation between SHs and SA; (iii) The interaction between SHs and SA and established risk factors for PC and erectile dysfunction in determining the risk of PC; and (iv) The correlation between SHs and SA in determining the risk of PC in different decades of life.

Results

Vasectomy, STI, and marital status did not differ significantly between two cohorts. Controls reported premarital sex more commonly than cases (P < 0.001). Cases had the first intercourse at older age (P = 0.03) and had less SPM (P < 0.001). TT, FT, and ES were higher in controls (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, TT, calculated FT, SPM > 4, and age at time of marriage < 24 were protective against PC. The protective effect of high SA and SHs increased as patients' age increased.

Conclusions

High SA as well as TT and FT were protective against PC. Their protective role enhances by each decade of increasing age. The protective effect of high SA was independent from circulating levels of SHs.

### Who and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^111wR7FR]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Screening for prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is controversial. Screening is currently transitioning from being an all-or-nothing-question, to finding new ways of individualized testing. However, consensus remains to be reached within guideline groups and worldwide experts regarding who – and when – to screen, if at all. In this Q & A, we invite seven of the world's key opinion leaders in the field, both proponents and skeptics, to elaborate on what they believe the current screening policy should be. The authors have all published widely on PSA, and comprise a wide variety of experience in areas such as urology, epidemiology, evidence-based medicine, and medical decision-making.

Currently, only one guideline group, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), recommends against screening for all men. Most other guideline groups recommend shared decision-making, involving a discussion of the pros and cons of screening. To aid in decision-making, some propose using a risk-stratified approach taking into account multiple factors along with a PSA measurement. However, the specifics of such an approach are a subject of debate; for instance, the appropriate age limits of screening remain to be defined. Randomized screening trials, including the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the Göteborg trial have provided evidence that regular PSA-screening can reduce prostate cancer mortality by 21–44% at 13–14 years of follow-up; the age groups studied in these trials were 55–69 and 50–64 years, respectively. Thus, the question remains regarding the screening of men outside this age range. There is a growing body of evidence on the benefits of commencing screening in the mid-40s. While the American Urological Association (AUA) bases its recommendation on the 55–69 age group based on the ERSPC results, the European Urological Association recommends a baseline PSA be obtained at 40–45 years of age.

### Repeating an abnormal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level: how relevant is a decrease in PSA? [^114Vhwh6]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

To examine the practice of repeating an abnormal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before proceeding to prostate biopsy, we assessed the pattern of PSA change following an initially raised (≥ 4.0 ng ml(-1)) PSA, and the relationship of this to prostate cancer diagnosis. In 7052 men, 71.2% with initially raised PSA had a reduction in PSA, with values < 4.0 ng ml(-1) in 37.8%. A total of 43.0% of men with prostate cancer showed a PSA decrease below their baseline level. Short-term decreases in PSA may occur in men with prostate cancer, including high-grade cancer, and so should not influence the decision to proceed to prostate biopsy.

### Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (Jalyn) [^114vUCqD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The most common side effects of JALYN include:

ejaculation problems
trouble getting or keeping an erection (impotence)
a decrease in sex drive (libido)
dizziness
enlarged or painful breasts. If you notice breast lumps or nipple discharge, you should talk to your healthcare provider.
runny nose

Depressed mood has been reported in patients receiving dutasteride, an ingredient of JALYN.

Dutasteride, an ingredient of JALYN, has been shown to reduce sperm count, semen volume, and sperm movement. However, the effect of JALYN on male fertility is not known.

Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Test: Your healthcare provider may check you for other prostate problems, including prostate cancer before you start and while you take JALYN. A blood test called PSA (prostate-specific antigen) is sometimes used to see if you might have prostate cancer. JALYN will reduce the amount of PSA measured in your blood. Your healthcare provider is aware of this effect and can still use PSA to see if you might have prostate cancer. Increases in your PSA levels while on treatment with JALYN (even if the PSA levels are in the normal range) should be evaluated by your healthcare provider.

### Assessment of the vaginal residence time of biomarkers of semen exposure [^112ysXhw]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine and compare the residence time in the vagina of biomarkers of semen exposure for up to 15 days post exposure. The biomarkers are prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Y chromosome DNA, the sex determining region of the Y chromosome (SRY) and testis-specific protein Y-encoded 4 (TSPY4). The secondary objectives are to determine if biomarker concentrations differed between intercourse and inoculation groups, to establish whether the sampling frequency post exposure affected biomarker concentrations and decay profile and to determine if biomarker concentrations in vaginal swabs obtained by the participant at home were similar to swabs obtained by the nurse in the clinic.

Study Design

We randomized healthy women to unprotected intercourse (n = 17) versus vaginal inoculation with the male partner's semen in the clinic (n = 16). Women were then further randomized to have vaginal swabs obtained at either 7 or 4 time points after semen exposure, up to 15 days post exposure, either obtained at home by the participant or in the clinic by the research nurse.

Results

PSA and SRY were markers of recent semen exposure. TSPY4 was detectable in approximately 50% of participants at 15 days post exposure. Unprotected intercourse resulted in significantly higher concentrations of select biomarkers. Sampling frequency and home versus clinic sampling had no significant effect on biomarker concentrations.

Conclusions

Objective biomarkers of recent or distant semen exposure may have great utility for verifying protocol compliance in a variety of clinical trials.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111cpVHw]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinicians and policy makers

This systematic review provides important information for an individual man's decision making about prostate cancer screening. It supported the development of an evidence based clinical practice guideline, as reflected in the accompanying Rapid Recommendation article. Our analysis indicates that PSA screening yields, at best, only a small benefit in prostate cancer specific mortality but does not reduce overall mortality. This small benefit should be weighed against the potential short term complications (biopsy related, false positive and false negative findings) and long term downstream effects (treatment related side effects, in particular related to urinary and sexual function). The latest results of the PIVOT and ProtecT trials should help guideline developers identify the subset of patients with clinically localised prostate cancer who will likely benefit from local, curative treatment while avoiding overtreatment. Although active surveillance is increasingly accepted to treat low risk prostate cancer, it is burdensome to patients due to the need for frequent follow-up visits, PSA testing, digital rectal examinations, prostate biopsies, and, recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The value of MRI in determining which prostate cancers appear clinically relevant versus indolent seems promising but remains uncertain in the context of PSA screening.

### Influence of circumcision and sexual behaviour on PSA levels in patients attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic [^111XgYot]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Early age at first intercourse, increased number of sexual partners, lack of circumcision and history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are associated with prostate cancer. There has been no investigation of the effect of these factors on prostate health at an early age. Previously collected serum samples from STD clinic attendees were tested retrospectively for anti-chlamydial antibodies, and prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentration. Patients at an STD clinic were interviewed regarding age of first intercourse, number of sexual partners and circumcision status. This was compared to clinical diagnosis, anti-chlamydial antibody titre and PSA concentration. The results showed: (1) that of patients with an anti-chlamydial antibody titre equal or greater than 1 in 64 (n = 27) 37% had a PSA concentration greater than 0.8 ng/ml while those with a titre less than 1/64 (n = 201) only 17% had a PSA > 0.8 (P < 0.05). (2) No association was found with circumcision status. (3) Early age of first intercourse and more than 20 sexual partners were associated with a synergistic increase in mean anti-chlamydial antibody titre and a mean PSA concentration of 1.2 ng/ml (95% CI 0.56–1.76). It is concluded that these results provide the first evidence that sexual behaviour related risk factors for prostate cancer do damage the prostate at an early age. Though they do not prove that infection is a cause of prostate cancer they do justify further research into the specificity of agents involved and impact of antibiotic treatment.

### Exploring discordance between biologic and self-reported measures of semen exposure: a qualitative study among female patients attending an STI clinic in Jamaica [^113Z1rnv]. AIDS and Behavior (2013). Low credibility.

We explored the use of qualitative interviews to discuss discrepancies between two sources of information on unprotected sex: biomarker results and self-reported survey data. The study context was a randomized trial in Kingston, Jamaica examining the effect of STI counseling messages on recent sexual behavior using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as the primary study outcome. Twenty women were interviewed. Eleven participants were selected because they tested positive for PSA indicating recent semen exposure, yet reported no unprotected sex in a quantitative survey ("discordant"): 5 reported abstinence and 6 reported condom use. Nine participants who also tested positive for PSA but reported unprotected sex in the survey were interviewed for comparison ("concordant"). Qualitative interviews with 6 of the 11 discordant participants provided possible explanations for their PSA test results, and 5 of those were prompted by direct discussion of those results. Rapid PSA testing combined with qualitative interviews provides a novel tool for investigating and complementing self-reported sexual behavior.

### Blood levels of free-PSA but not complex-PSA significantly correlates to prostate release of PSA in semen in young men, while blood levels of complex-PSA, but not free-PSA increase with age [^114YCKML]. The Prostate (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The proportion of free- and complex-prostate specific antigen (PSA) in serum is used for differentiating between benign and malignant prostate disease. To further understand the physiological relationship between PSA in seminal plasma and blood, we have analyzed free-PSA (fPSA) and complex-PSA (cPSA) in blood and PSA in seminal plasma in young healthy men. We also compared age-related changes of PSA-forms in blood from young versus older men.

Methods

Total-PSA (tPSA), fPSA, and cPSA were measured in (i) blood and semen from 289 male conscripts (mean age 18.1 years) and in (ii) blood from a representative population of 1,389 men (mean age 46.5 years) without diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) during long-term follow-up.

Results

fPSA in serum (r = 0.40, P < 0.0001) but not cPSA (r = 0.09, P = 0.11), correlates to PSA in seminal fluid. fPSA levels in blood in young (geometric mean: 0.20 ng/ml) versus middle-aged men (geometric mean: 0.18 ng/ml) was not different (P = 0.06), whereas cPSA in middle-aged men (geometric mean: 0.38 ng/ml) was higher (P < 0.0001) than in young men (geometric mean: 0.28 ng/ml).

Conclusions

fPSA in blood, but not cPSA, is associated to PSA in semen (approximately 17% co-variation). In blood cPSA, but not fPSA, increase with age in healthy men, which may reflect an increasing incidence of prostate disease.

### Infertile men have higher prostate-specific antigen values than fertile individuals of comparable age [^111UCznJ]. European Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Infertile men are at greater risk for oncological and nononcological chronic disease than fertile individuals.

Objective

To investigate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values in men presenting for primary couple's infertility compared with a cohort of fertile individuals, according to the recommendation of the European Association of Urology guidelines that a first PSA assessment should be done at 40–45 yr of age.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a cross-sectional study. Data from 956 (90%) infertile men and 102 (9.6%) fertile participants were analysed. Circulating hormones, total PSA, and semen parameters were investigated in every man.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics, local polynomial smoothing, and linear regression models were used to test potential associations with PSA levels.

Results and Limitations

Overall, PSA > 1ng/ml was found in 318 (30%) men. Serum PSA was higher (p = 0.02), while serum testosterone (p < 0.01) was lower in infertile than in fertile men. In participants younger than 40 yr, 176 (27%) men had PSA > 1 ng/ml; of them, a greater proportion were infertile (28% infertile vs 17% fertile, p = 0.03). At multivariable linear regression analysis, infertile status (coefficient 0.21; 95% confidence interval 0.02–0.39) was associated with higher PSA values, after adjusting for age and serum testosterone level. This was a single-centre study, raising the possibility of selection biases.

Conclusions

Infertile men have higher PSA values than fertile individuals. Of all, almost one out of three primary infertile men younger than 40yr has a first total PSA value of > 1ng/ml.

Patient Summary

In this study, we observed that (1) infertile men have higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values than fertile individuals and (2) a greater proportion of infertile men younger than 40yr had total PSA > 1ng/ml at the first assessment. These data might be relevant to study the potential clinical impact of more rigorous screening in primary infertile men.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^115GeWqe]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) testosterone deficiency — PSA follow-up laboratory testing specifies: Baseline: Measure in testosterone deficient patients over 40 years of age and in those testosterone deficient patients with a history of prostate cancer. Testosterone titration phase: Not Recommended. Stable phase: In men without a history of prostate cancer, testing should be conducted utilizing a shared decision-making approach, in accordance with the AUA Early Detection of Prostate Cancer Guideline. Prostate cancer patients on testosterone therapy should have their PSA levels monitored on the same schedule as men without testosterone deficiency; however, clinicians may choose to increase the frequency of testing.

### Ejaculation frequency and risk of prostate cancer: updated results with an additional decade of follow-up [^1148UPUJ]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests that ejaculation frequency may be inversely related to the risk of prostate cancer (PCa), a disease for which few modifiable risk factors have been identified.

Objective

To incorporate an additional 10 yr of follow-up into an original analysis and to comprehensively evaluate the association between ejaculation frequency and PCa, accounting for screening, clinically relevant disease subgroups, and the impact of mortality from other causes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prospective cohort study of participants in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study utilizing self-reported data on average monthly ejaculation frequency. The study includes 31925 men who answered questions on ejaculation frequency on a 1992 questionnaire and followed through to 2010. The average monthly ejaculation frequency was assessed at three time points: age 20–29 yr, age 40–49 yr, and the year before questionnaire distribution.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

Incidence of total PCa and clinically relevant disease subgroups. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results and Limitations

During 480831 person-years, 3839 men were diagnosed with PCa. Ejaculation frequency at age 40–49 yr was positively associated with age-standardized body mass index, physical activity, divorce, history of sexually transmitted infections, and consumption of total calories and alcohol. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test utilization by 2008, number of PSA tests, and frequency of prostate biopsy were similar across frequency categories. In multivariable analyses, the hazard ratio for PCa incidence for ≥ 21 compared to 4–7 ejaculations per month was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–0.92; p < 0.0001 for trend) for frequency at age 20–29 yr and 0.78 (95% CI 0.69–0.89; p < 0.0001 for trend) for frequency at age 40–49 yr. Associations were driven by low-risk disease, were similar when restricted to a PSA-screened cohort, and were unlikely to be explained by competing causes of death.

Conclusions

These findings provide additional evidence of a beneficial role of more frequent ejaculation throughout adult life in the etiology of PCa, particularly for low-risk disease.

Patient Summary

We evaluated whether ejaculation frequency throughout adulthood is related to prostate cancer risk in a large US-based study. We found that men reporting higher compared to lower ejaculatory frequency in adulthood were less likely to be subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer.
