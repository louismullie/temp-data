## Question

Can montelukast be used alone to treat bacterial sinusitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether montelukast (Singulair) can be used alone to treat acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) and what the appropriate, evidence-based management should be for ABRS. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how ABRS is defined and what first-line therapies guidelines recommend. Then, I should verify montelukast's FDA-labeled indications and key safety warnings. Next, I will check whether any guideline endorses leukotriene modifiers for ABRS specifically. Finally, I will synthesize the microbiology, antibiotic options and durations, and clarify any niche scenarios where montelukast might be reasonable in sinonasal disease [^11552ayP] [^112Ug5CU].

> Let me first confirm the standard of care for ABRS. ABRS is typically a bacterial complication of a viral upper respiratory infection and targets common pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, for which guideline-concordant first-line therapy is amoxicillin/clavulanate or amoxicillin in appropriate adults. Fluoroquinolones, cefuroxime axetil, and extended-release amoxicillin/clavulanate are FDA-approved options but fluoroquinolones should be reserved given safety concerns and the self-limiting nature of some ABS cases. Watchful waiting without immediate antibiotics is also an endorsed option in selected adults when reliable follow-up is assured, but when antibiotics are chosen, the above agents are evidence-supported first-line choices [^11552ayP] [^114o1Y4f] [^115Gjq6e] [^116P9EVJ] [^112dp3N5] [^114RCeCn].

> Now, I need to check montelukast's regulatory status and intended uses. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist indicated for maintenance treatment of asthma, for seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, and for prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction; it is not an antibiotic and it is not indicated for the treatment of ABRS or any acute bacterial infection. I should also confirm safety: the FDA has strengthened warnings about serious neuropsychiatric events, advising careful risk–benefit consideration, particularly when disease is mild and alternatives exist. Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and, less commonly, neuropsychiatric symptoms, underscoring that it should not be used as a substitute for antibiotics in ABRS [^112Ug5CU] [^111y8DdB] [^116381jS] [^111rGgWN] [^11174BfW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could leukotriene modifiers help ABRS symptomatically even if they're not antimicrobial. Wait, let me verify whether any guideline endorses montelukast for ABRS. I find no high-quality guideline recommending montelukast for ABRS; by contrast, allergy guidelines caution against routinely adding montelukast to antihistamines for seasonal allergic rhinitis due to limited incremental benefit, and rhinology guidance reserves leukotriene modifiers for selected chronic rhinosinusitis phenotypes such as NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease. In fact, in postoperative CRSwNP, a randomized trial showed no long-term add-on benefit from montelukast over intranasal corticosteroids alone, and modern CRS care increasingly relies on intranasal corticosteroids and, in refractory CRSwNP, biologics such as dupilumab or omalizumab, none of which apply to ABRS management [^115PdFUC] [^1137eKQB] [^115QaXzg] [^115ED7KR] [^111zxib7] [^1134cU5t].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to ensure I'm not missing a niche ABRS role for montelukast. ABRS typically follows a viral URI, and while viral–bacterial coinfection is common, the identification of viruses does not obviate antibiotic therapy once ABRS criteria are met; sinonasal culture techniques favor endoscopic middle meatus sampling when aspiration is impractical, but this nuance does not change that antibiotics, not leukotriene antagonists, address the bacterial component. Imaging studies of ARS show early mucosal changes regardless of bacterial status, again reinforcing that anti-inflammatory adjuncts do not replace antibiotics when ABRS is diagnosed [^112jaiYY] [^115ruEEn] [^112HDDrP] [^114oMv1G].

> Next, I should review antibiotic duration and alternatives, because that often drives prescribing choices. Short-course therapy can be as effective as longer courses for adult acute bacterial sinusitis, and levofloxacin 750 mg for 5 days is noninferior to 500 mg for 10 days, although fluoroquinolones should be reserved for patients with no alternatives due to class safety issues and stewardship principles. This strengthens the case for guideline-preferred beta-lactams first and underscores that adding montelukast to treat ABRS is unnecessary and unsupported; systemic corticosteroids as adjuncts in acute sinusitis have limited evidence and are not routinely recommended either [^114hfBiD] [^115JAziY] [^115Gjq6e] [^116P9EVJ] [^112U5ttG].

> But wait, what if the patient has concomitant asthma or allergic rhinitis driving sinonasal symptoms. Let me think about appropriate use of montelukast in that context: if there is comorbid asthma or allergic rhinitis, montelukast 10 mg nightly can be considered for its labeled indications after weighing neuropsychiatric risk, but it should be framed as treating the comorbidity rather than the bacterial sinusitis itself. I should double-check that the patient's allergic rhinitis is not mild and easily managed with intranasal steroids alone, given recommendations to avoid routine montelukast add-on in seasonal allergic rhinitis, and I must counsel regarding the boxed warning and monitor for mood or behavior changes [^116381jS] [^111rGgWN] [^115PdFUC].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure the clinical message is precise: montelukast does not treat ABRS and should not be used in place of antibiotics when ABRS is diagnosed. Evidence-based ABRS management prioritizes either watchful waiting with reliable follow-up or first-line antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanate or amoxicillin, reserving fluoroquinolones for those without alternatives; montelukast may be used for concomitant asthma or allergic rhinitis, and leukotriene modifiers may have a role in chronic rhinosinusitis with NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease, but they are not recommended for ABRS treatment [^114RCeCn] [^11552ayP] [^115Gjq6e] [^116P9EVJ] [^1137eKQB] [^112Ug5CU].

Montelukast should not be used as **monotherapy for bacterial sinusitis** because it lacks antibacterial activity [^111y8DdB] and is not recommended by clinical guidelines [^11552ayP]. Montelukast may be considered adjunctive therapy for patients with coexisting asthma [^112Ug5CU], allergic rhinitis, or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^1137eKQB], but it should not replace antibiotics in confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. The **standard of care is antibiotic therapy**, with amoxicillin/clavulanate or amoxicillin as first-line agents [^114o1Y4f] [^11552ayP].

---

## Pharmacological properties of montelukast

Montelukast is a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist that blocks cysteinyl leukotriene receptors, reducing inflammation, bronchoconstriction, and mucus production [^111y8DdB]. It is primarily indicated for asthma maintenance therapy, allergic rhinitis, and prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^112Ug5CU]. Montelukast has **no direct antibacterial activity** [^111y8DdB] and does not target the pathogens commonly responsible for bacterial sinusitis, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis [^11552ayP].

---

## Clinical evidence for montelukast in bacterial sinusitis

Currently, there is **no robust clinical evidence** supporting the use of montelukast as monotherapy for bacterial sinusitis. Major guidelines and expert consensus do not recommend montelukast as standalone therapy [^114RCeCn]. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) guidelines emphasize antibiotics as the primary treatment, with amoxicillin/clavulanate or amoxicillin as first-line agents [^11552ayP]. However, montelukast may have a role as adjunctive therapy for patients with coexisting asthma, allergic rhinitis, or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) [^1137eKQB], but it is **not recommended as a substitute for antibiotic therapy** [^11552ayP].

---

## Comparison with standard antibiotic therapies

Antibiotic therapy remains the **cornerstone of bacterial sinusitis treatment** [^11552ayP] [^114RCeCn]. Antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanate [^114o1Y4f], levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin have demonstrated high clinical success rates (approximately 88–91%) [^115JAziY] [^1176j7xN]. These antibiotics directly target the bacterial pathogens responsible for sinus infections [^112dp3N5], leading to symptom resolution and prevention of complications. In contrast, montelukast lacks antibacterial activity [^111y8DdB] and has not demonstrated clinical efficacy comparable to antibiotics. Therefore, montelukast **cannot be considered an effective alternative** to antibiotic therapy.

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Montelukast is generally well-tolerated, with common adverse effects including abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and fatigue [^11174BfW]. However, **serious neuropsychiatric adverse effects** — such as mood changes, anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation — have been reported, particularly in pediatric populations. The FDA has issued warnings about these potential adverse effects, emphasizing caution when prescribing montelukast, especially when alternative treatments are available.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Clinical guidelines consistently recommend antibiotic therapy as the primary treatment for bacterial sinusitis. Montelukast is **not recommended as monotherapy** by major guidelines or expert consensus statements. The AAO-HNSF and AAFP guidelines [^11552ayP] emphasize antibiotic therapy and do not list montelukast as a standalone treatment option.

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

Montelukast may be considered **adjunctive therapy** for selected patients, such as those with coexisting asthma [^112Ug5CU], allergic rhinitis, or AERD [^1137eKQB]. In these patients, montelukast may help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms related to underlying allergic or inflammatory conditions. However, in these scenarios, montelukast should not replace antibiotic therapy in confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial sinusitis [^11552ayP].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Montelukast should not be used as **monotherapy for bacterial sinusitis** [^11552ayP]. It lacks antibacterial activity [^111y8DdB] and has not demonstrated efficacy comparable to standard antibiotic therapies. Clinical guidelines consistently recommend antibiotic therapy as the primary treatment for bacterial sinusitis, reserving montelukast for adjunctive use in selected patients with coexisting inflammatory conditions [^114RCeCn] [^1137eKQB].

Terms used in this guideline define how certain terms are used specifically for this document.

- **Air therapy**: Anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy is a treatment utilizing a reliever inhaler that contains a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and formoterol. When used in response to symptoms without regular maintenance therapy, it is termed as-needed AIR therapy. As of November 2024, the only product licensed for as-needed AIR therapy contains budesonide/formoterol.

- **Asthma control**: Complete control of asthma is defined as no daytime symptoms, no night-time awakening due to asthma, no asthma attacks, no need for rescue medication, no limitations on activity including exercise, normal lung function (in practical terms, forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] and/or peak expiratory flow [PEF] more than 80% predicted or best), and minimal side effects from treatment.

- **Atopic disorder**: Atopic disorders are allergic conditions, including allergic rhinitis (hay fever), atopic dermatitis (eczema), allergic asthma, and other specific and non-specific allergic conditions such as food allergies.

- **Bronchial challenge test**: This test measures airway responsiveness, known as bronchial responsiveness. It is performed by administering small increments of a bronchoconstrictor (most commonly methacholine) and measuring the FEV1 after each dose until it falls by a predetermined amount, typically 20% from baseline.

- **Bronchial hyperresponsiveness**: A measure of how easily bronchospasm can be induced in the airways.

Several cases of eosinophilic conditions, including Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), have recently been reported in asthmatic patients being treated with antileukotriene receptor antagonists. One patient with CSS experienced a clinical relapse after treatment with montelukast, and two asthmatic patients developed CSS while receiving montelukast treatment. In one case, a reduction in the dose of oral steroids preceded the onset of CSS. To our knowledge, no case of CSS relapse has previously been reported in association with leukotriene antagonists.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^116P9EVJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Moxifloxacin is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) caused by susceptible isolates of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, or *Moraxella catarrhalis* [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Because fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.14)] and for some patients ABS is self-limiting, reserve moxifloxacin for treatment of ABS in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

- **Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis**:
	- Moxifloxacin is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis (ABECB) caused by susceptible isolates of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Haemophilus parainfluenzae*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, methicillin-susceptible *Staphylococcus aureus*, or *Moraxella catarrhalis* [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

	- Because fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.14)] and for some patients ABECB is self-limiting, reserve moxifloxacin for treatment of ABECB in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

- **Usage**:
	- To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of moxifloxacin and other antibacterial drugs, moxifloxacin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

### Medical management strategies in acute and chronic rhinosinusitis [^116hidHG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis has historically been considered as resulting from upper airway anatomical abnormalities. However, the concept has evolved, and it is now recognized as an inflammatory disorder of the nasal and sinus mucosa. Acute rhinosinusitis is usually caused by a viral infection, while chronic rhinosinusitis represents a persistent and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder characterized by increased expression of type 1, 2, or 17 cytokines in the nasal and sinus mucosa, similar to asthma. Exacerbations occur due to aeroallergens in allergic individuals and from irritants, pollutants, and viral/bacterial infections in all subjects.

Chronic rhinosinusitis may be categorized by phenotypes, such as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or without nasal polyps. Endotypes are defined based on underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Understanding chronic rhinosinusitis endotypes can optimize management by employing targeted medical therapies. Recognizing rhinosinusitis as a heterogeneous inflammatory disease has led to the identification of various predisposing conditions, new medical treatment options, and the understanding that rhinosinusitis is primarily a medical issue.

### Microbiology of acute maxillary sinusitis in children [^114oMv1G]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

In this study, at least one microorganism was detected in 30 of 31 (97%) patients using viral and bacterial PCR. In 10 (32%) patients, one respiratory virus was detected, and more than one virus was not detected in any patient. Among these detected viruses, rhinovirus (13%) was the most common, followed by the influenza virus type A/B (10%). These findings are consistent with Marom et al. that rhinovirus was most commonly detected, followed by the influenza virus, in viral PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs of children with acute rhinosinusitis. These data concur with our results, even though Marom et al. obtained their samples from nasopharyngeal swabs and not from sinus aspirates.

In this study, all samples contained both respiratory viruses and bacteria, and none of them contained only respiratory viruses. It remains unclear whether viral sinusitis is predominant in adults or children. Several studies have reported the occurrence of viral pathogens in adult acute sinusitis. Pitkäranta et al. reported the presence of rhinovirus or coronavirus in the sinus aspirates of 8 of 20 (40%) adult sinusitis patients. Puhakka et al. reported viral infections in 81.6% of nasopharyngeal aspirates (not sinus aspirates) of the young adult patients with sinusitis studied, believing that early-stage acute sinusitis has a viral etiology. However, to our knowledge, no studies have reported viral pathogens in acute pediatric sinusitis. The present results show that severe sinusitis in children results from bacterial infections or viral and bacterial co-infections.

### Effects of montelukast on patients with asthma after experimental inoculation with human rhinovirus 16 [^115AsCZC]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Leukotrienes are induced by viral infections.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether treatment with montelukast would improve asthma disease control in patients with mild allergic asthma during an experimentally induced rhinovirus infection.

- **Methods**: Patients with mild allergic asthma were randomized to receive treatment with either montelukast or placebo, and 7 days later both groups were inoculated with human rhinovirus 16. Patients were evaluated at baseline, during the acute infection phase, and during the recovery phase for asthma and cold symptoms by questionnaire. Sputum, nasal lavage fluid, and blood were analyzed for viral shedding and cellular inflammation, and peak expiratory flow was measured daily.

- **Results**: A total of 19 patients (11 in the placebo group and 8 in the active group) completed the study. No significant differences were found in asthma control and cold symptom scores between the control and treatment groups. The change in peak expiratory flow from the randomization to acute illness phase was greater in the placebo group than the treatment group (mean, -22 vs. 0 L/min; p = 0.05). During the recovery phase, the percentage of sputum eosinophils increased in the placebo group and remained at baseline levels in the montelukast group (median, 2.7% vs. 0.2%; p = 0.05 between groups).

- **Conclusions**: In this pilot study, montelukast did not improve asthma control or cold symptom scores caused by experimental rhinovirus infection. Analysis of secondary outcomes suggests that montelukast may prevent reductions in lung function and increases in sputum eosinophil levels.

### The use of montelukast for pruritus in neurofibromatosis 1 [^111Zv1yA]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Discussion

NF1 encodes the protein neurofibromin, which regulates p21ras activation and its downstream effects. Attempts to target p21ras itself have been challenging; therefore, therapy approaches focus on targeting the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) that activate p21ras. Sunitinib is a highly selective RTK inhibitor with activity against c-kit, PDGFR, FGFR, RET, and VEGFR, which are all pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of both pheochromocytomas and neurofibromas. Much of the literature at the time of writing has studied the effect of sunitinib on pheochromocytomas and plexiform neurofibromas, which have malignant potential. Nevertheless, cutaneous neurofibroma formation arises from similar biochemical pathways as pheochromocytomas and plexiform neurofibromas and is therefore also affected by therapy with sunitinib. Considering that many patients with plexiform neurofibromas or NF1-associated pheochromocytomas also have cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas, the effect of sunitinib on all types of neurofibromas is worth evaluating. In this case, the patient was treated with sunitinib for her pheochromocytoma and concomitantly experienced a reduction in the size of her cutaneous neurofibromas.

In addition to the reduction in size of her neurofibromas with sunitinib therapy, the patient also experienced significant pruritus of her neurofibromas. Though adverse skin reactions occur in approximately 90% of cases treated with angiogenic inhibitors, pruritus is not a commonly reported side effect of sunitinib. Pruritus has been reported in studies of sorafenib and imatinib as well.

### Concomitant bilastine and montelukast as additive therapy for seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and mild-to-moderate asthma. The SKY study [^111UwLm8]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

Mean (SD) total symptom score (TSS, panel A) and asthma quality of life questionnaire (AQLQ, panel B) values were assessed in patients treated with bilastine plus montelukast and compared to those treated with bilastine or montelukast alone. Estimated (SEM) changes in TSS and AQLQ from the corresponding baseline values observed after each week of treatment with bilastine, montelukast, or bilastine plus montelukast are depicted in panels (C) and (D), respectively. B denotes baseline. For TSS values, * indicates P < 0.05 when comparing bilastine versus montelukast after 1 week of treatment; # indicates P < 0.001 when comparing TSS values observed 4 weeks after treatment with bilastine plus montelukast, bilastine, or montelukast alone versus corresponding baseline values.

We compared, for the first time, the efficacy and safety of the concomitant administration of bilastine with montelukast versus respective monotherapies in a large population of patients with seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (SARC) and asthma. Contrary to our original hypothesis, concomitant administration of bilastine with montelukast was as effective as either agent alone in the treatment of SARC symptoms. The reasons for not showing any additive effects of bilastine plus montelukast, compared with each agent alone, could likely be related to the overall mild intensity of SARC symptoms at baseline. This might have reduced the room for improvement, thus limiting the probability of detecting differences between treatments. The absolute extent of the effect of treatments on symptoms or on the use of rescue medications is impossible to gauge as a placebo arm was not included. Notably, the improvement in TSS values observed in our study suggests some level of treatment efficacy.

### Short-course versus long-course oral antibiotic treatment for infections treated in outpatient settings: A review of systematic reviews [^114hfBiD]. Family Practice (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to summarize the evidence comparing the effectiveness of short and long courses of oral antibiotics for infections treated in outpatient settings.

- **Methods**: We identified systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials for children and adults with bacterial infections treated in outpatient settings from Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and The Database of Review of Effects. Data were extracted on the primary outcome of clinical resolution and secondary outcomes.

- **Results**: We identified 30 potential reviews and included 9. There was no difference in the clinical cure for children treated with short or long course antibiotics for group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis (OR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.11); community-acquired pneumonia (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.01); acute otitis media [< 2 years old OR: 1.09 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.57); ≥ 2 years old OR: 0.85 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.21)]; or urinary tract infection (RR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.64, 1.76). There was no difference in the clinical cure for adults treated with short or long course antibiotics for acute bacterial sinusitis (RR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.81, 1.21); uncomplicated cystitis in non-pregnant women (RR 1.10, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.25), or elderly women (RR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.62, 1.54); acute pyelonephritis (RR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.80, 1.32); or community-acquired pneumonia (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.74, 1.26). We found inadequate evidence about the effect on antibiotic resistance.

- **Conclusions**: This overview of systematic reviews has identified good quality evidence that short course antibiotics are as effective as longer courses.

### Bacterium detected by gram stain and drug sensitivity in Chinese children with acute sinusitis [^116cD9h9]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is one of the most common infections of the upper respiratory tract in both children and adults. It is reported that 5–10% of children with upper respiratory tract infections are complicated with acute sinusitis, and 6–13% of children were diagnosed with sinusitis by the age of 3. Although pediatric ARS is common in outpatient clinics in China, there is a lack of relevant data on its epidemiology and economic burden. Both the mucosa of nasal passages and paranasal sinuses are involved in most ARS cases. Viruses and pathogenic bacteria are often found in the nasal secretions of ARS patients. Generally, most ARS cases are caused by viruses and are aggravated by bacterial coinfection or secondary infection.

Sinus puncture culture was previously believed to be the most accurate method for diagnosing ARS. However, a recent meta-analysis found that endoscopic-guided middle meatus samples may be more sensitive and less invasive for ARS compared with sinus puncture. Therefore, samples were collected from the middle meatus with the help of endoscopy.

In pediatric ARS, it was discovered that respiratory bacteria were present in 65% of the sinus secretions, while bacterial and viral agents were present in 32% of the secretions. Rhinovirus and influenza virus were the most prevalent viruses, while Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae ranked first among bacterial species. However, the microbial composition contributing to ARS is not static. For example, the popularization of vaccines in children can lead to changes in the frequency and bacteriology of acute sinusitis cases.

### Microbiology of acute maxillary sinusitis in children [^111D9Pho]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract illnesses are common during childhood and require frequent medical care. Acute rhinosinusitis frequently occurs as a complication of acute viral upper respiratory infection. Children with acute rhinosinusitis constitute approximately 6.5% to 13% of patients with upper respiratory tract illnesses, and some acute rhinosinusitis patients need medical care. Although acute rhinosinusitis is a common pediatric disease, its etiology remains unknown. A few studies have reported the presence of viral and bacterial pathogens through microbiological analysis of sinus aspirates obtained from children with acute sinusitis. However, no study has comprehensively assessed viral and bacterial pathogens through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using sinus aspirates obtained from children with acute sinusitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the microbiology of acute pediatric rhinosinusitis through molecular biological analysis.

### AugmentinXR [^114o1Y4f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). High credibility.

Adults with a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) were evaluated in three clinical studies. In one study, 363 patients were randomized to receive either Augmentin XR 2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours or levofloxacin 500 mg orally daily for 10 days in a double-blind, multicenter, prospective trial. These patients were clinically and radiologically evaluated at the test of cure (day 17–28) visit. The combined clinical and radiological responses were 83.7% for Augmentin XR and 84.3% for levofloxacin at the test of cure visit in clinically evaluable patients (95% CI for the treatment difference = -9.4, 8.3). The clinical response rates at the test of cure were 87.0% and 88.6%, respectively.

The other two trials were non-comparative, multicenter studies designed to assess the bacteriological and clinical efficacy of Augmentin XR (2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 days) in the treatment of 2,288 patients with ABS. Evaluation timepoints were the same as in the prior study. Patients underwent maxillary sinus puncture for culture prior to receiving study medication. At the test of cure, the clinical success rates were 87.5% and 86.6% (intention-to-treat) and 92.5% and 92.1% (per protocol populations).

### A case of canine-transmitted postoperative sinusitis [^113GDCQf]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Low credibility.

We present the first documented case of acute bacterial sinus infection with Staphylococcus schleiferi in a 58-year-old male recovering from endoscopic sinus surgery on postoperative oral corticosteroids. Within one month of surgery, the patient reported treating an outer ear infection in his dog, which was culture positive for Staphylococcus schleiferi and Corynebacterium sp. This coincided with an acute exacerbation of the patient's sinus symptoms, characterized by increased purulent drainage, facial pain, and increased aural fullness. Nasal endoscopy revealed purulence and thick mucus in multiple sinuses, which tested positive for S. schleiferi. The patient was treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which resolved the active infection. Staphylococcus schleiferi has shown only rare transmission to human hosts, affecting both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Typically, this bacterial pathogen presents as a skin infection or outer ear infection in canines, potentially serving as a source of infection in humans when they treat their pets. This case marks the first documented instance of acute bacterial sinusitis caused by this pathogen in human literature and highlights the need for continued observation as a possible zoonotic pathogen that may cause sinus exacerbations in susceptible populations.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome: a consensus guideline [^111mmCqK]. BJU International (2015). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for chronic bacterial prostatitis, particularly in relation to physiotherapy, PERG 2015 guidelines recommend considering the following specialist physiotherapy treatment options: pelvic floor re-education, local pelvic floor relaxation, biofeedback, general relaxation, deep relaxation/mindfulness, trigger point release, myofascial release, stretches, exercise for pain management, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, acupuncture for trigger point release and pain management, and bladder retraining.

### Maxillary sinus puncture and culture in the diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis: The case for pursuing alternative culture methods [^115ruEEn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Traditional assessments of the microbial flora associated with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis have relied on maxillary sinus punctures (taps) and culture. These taps are now considered the gold standard for obtaining cultures and are used as the method of identifying bacterial pathogens in antimicrobial trials. However, maxillary sinus taps are limited by patient discomfort and technical concerns. These factors have restricted the use of taps in antibiotic trials and microbial surveillance, prompting exploration of alternative methods.

We conducted a retrospective, systematic review of literature from 1950 to 2000, focusing on articles that compare culture techniques in the nose and paranasal sinuses for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. The results indicate that nasal cultures have poor correlation with maxillary sinus cultures. In contrast, there is 60% to 85% concordance between endoscopically guided middle meatal cultures and maxillary sinus cultures. However, these studies are limited by small sample sizes, rendering them inadequate for concrete recommendations regarding the role of endoscopically guided middle meatal cultures as a formal method of pathogen identification in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

We recommend a formal prospective study with a sufficient sample size to assess the concordance between the microbial flora of maxillary sinus punctures and middle meatal cultures in acute rhinosinusitis.

### Management update of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and the use of cefdinir [^113acDkg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis, bacteriology, diagnosis, and antimicrobial treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is reviewed. Most cases of ABRS arise as complications of the rhinosinusitis from colds and other acute viral respiratory infections. Nose blowing during colds may be a risk factor for ABRS by propelling bacteria-laden nasal fluid into the sinus cavity.

The bacterial causes of ABRS continue to be S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, other streptococcal species, M. catarrhalis, anaerobes, and S. aureus. Clinical diagnosis of ABRS is based on obtaining a history of a cold or influenza-like illness that does not improve or worsens after seven days.

A 10-day course of treatment with an antimicrobial effective against resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae is recommended. A clinical trial was reviewed in which cefdinir was effective in treating ABRS.

### Dupixent [^115ED7KR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies. The studies, SINUS-24 (NCT02912468) and SINUS-52 (NCT02898454), involved 724 adult subjects aged 18 years and older who were on background intranasal corticosteroids (INCS).

Subjects included those with CRSwNP, despite prior sino-nasal surgery or treatment, and those who were ineligible or intolerant to systemic corticosteroids in the past two years. Participants with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps were excluded from the trials. Rescue with systemic corticosteroids or surgery was permitted during the studies at the discretion of the investigator.

In SINUS-24, 276 subjects were randomized to receive either 300 mg of Dupixent (N = 143) or placebo (N = 133) every two weeks for 24 weeks. In SINUS-52, 448 subjects were randomized to receive either 300 mg of Dupixent every two weeks for 52 weeks (N = 150), 300 mg every two weeks until Week 24 followed by 300 mg every four weeks until Week 52 (N = 145), or placebo (N = 153).

All subjects demonstrated evidence of sinus opacification on the Lund Mackay (LMK) sinus CT scan, with 73% to 90% experiencing opacification of all sinuses. Subjects were stratified based on their history of prior surgery and co-morbid conditions such as asthma and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug exacerbated respiratory disease (NSAID-ERD). A total of 63% of subjects reported previous sinus surgeries.

### Management of persistent, post-adenotonsillectomy obstructive sleep apnea in children: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111rGgWN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

We are uncertain about the magnitude of montelukast's additive effects on obstructive apnea–hypopnea index (oAHI) when coadministered with intranasal steroids compared to the efficacy of intranasal steroids alone, as no available studies have been found. Based on a single small observational study, the favorable effects of this drug combination on apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) relative to no treatment are substantial (mean difference, −4.4/h; 95% confidence interval, −5.2/h to −3.6/h), considering that the recruited children had only mild persistent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Studied outcomes have not included the frequency of OSA resolution, quality of life (QOL), OSA-related morbidity, or snoring.

In the single observational study, one child in the montelukast/budesonide group developed epistaxis that resolved within three days of discontinuing the intervention and did not recur upon reinitiation of the medications. In 2020, the FDA strengthened existing warnings about serious behavior and mood-related changes associated with montelukast, including suicidal thoughts or actions. The FDA has recommended that the benefits of montelukast may not outweigh the risks, especially when the disease symptoms are mild and can be adequately treated with other medications.

Parents may prefer intranasal steroids with or without montelukast as an intervention to reduce the severity of persistent OSA over continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or additional surgical interventions.

The cost of the combination of intranasal steroids and montelukast for a 12-week course can be high for some families.

### Levofloxacin [^1145gu11]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) using either 750 mg by mouth for 5 days or 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10–14 days. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high dose, short course of levofloxacin, 780 outpatient adults with clinically and radiologically determined acute bacterial sinusitis were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multicenter study. This study compared levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth once daily for five days to levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 days.

Clinical success rates, defined as complete or partial resolution of the pre-treatment signs and symptoms of ABS to such an extent that no further antibiotic treatment was deemed necessary, in the microbiologically evaluable population were 91.4% (139/152) in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 88.6% (132/149) in the levofloxacin 500 mg group at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (95% CI [-4.2, 10.0] for levofloxacin 750 mg minus levofloxacin 500 mg).

Rates of clinical success by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable population, who had specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry, showed comparable results for the five- and ten-day regimens at the test-of-cure visit 22 days post treatment.

### Levofloxacin [^115Gjq6e]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Because fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1–5.15)] and for some patients ABS is self-limiting, reserve Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection for treatment of ABS in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

- **Culture and susceptibility testing**: Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing the infection and to determine their susceptibility to levofloxacin [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Therapy with Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection may be initiated before results of these tests are available.

### Augmentinxr [^117MFZ89]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Augmentin XR Extended Release Tablets are indicated for the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia or acute bacterial sinusitis due to confirmed, or suspected β-lactamase−producing pathogens (i.e. H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, H. parainfluenzae, K. pneumoniae, or methicillin-susceptible S. aureus) and S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (i.e. penicillin MICs = 2 mcg/mL). Augmentin XR is not indicated for the treatment of infections due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL. Data are limited with regard to infections due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL [see clinical studies].

Of the common epidemiological risk factors for patients with resistant pneumococcal infections, only age > 65 years was studied. Patients with other common risk factors for resistant pneumococcal infections (e.g. alcoholism, immune-suppressive illness, and presence of multiple co-morbid conditions) were not studied.

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia in whom penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae is suspected, bacteriological studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility when Augmentin XR is prescribed.

Acute bacterial sinusitis or community-acquired pneumonia due to a penicillin-susceptible strain of S. pneumoniae plus a β-lactamase−producing pathogen can be treated with another Augmentin® (amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium) product containing lower daily doses of amoxicillin (i.e. 500 mg every 8 hours or 875 mg every 12 hours).

### Tezepelumab treatment in severe asthma with recurrent chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps: Case series [^115z9R5P]. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). Low credibility.

A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 6 years ago; he underwent surgery 4 years ago. He is an ex-smoker (0.75 pack per day from age 20 years to age 57 years). Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bronchial wall thickness without a low-attenuation area, which is indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was diagnosed with asthma 3 years ago, and his CRSwNP relapsed 3 years ago. The patient experienced exertional dyspnea, continuous nasal congestion, and loss of smell. He had asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment twice per year. Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory disease were not observed.

He was referred to our hospital for poorly controlled severe asthma and CRSwNP. He received a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) combination therapy (fluticasone propionate/formoterol, 1000/40 μg per day) and a leukotriene receptor antagonist (montelukast, 10 mg per day) for 2 years and 3 months. However, his symptoms persisted and exacerbations occurred. Subcutaneous tezepelumab (210 mg every 4 weeks) was initiated in April 2023. Before tezepelumab administration, his Asthma Control Test (ACT) score was 18 and his Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) score was 53. His total serum IgE level was 483 IU/mL (normal range: 0–148 IU/mL). His Multiple Allergen Simultaneous Test result, which is classified into 7 levels (0–6) based on specific IgE concentration, indicated Dermatophagoides farina as class 2 and house dust as class 1. Despite receiving a high-dose ICS and LABA, his inflammatory markers included high levels.

### Lack of long-term add-on effect by montelukast in postoperative chronic rhinosinusitis patients with nasal polyps [^115QaXzg]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Eosinophils and mast cells are among the key cells in inflammatory diseases like chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and asthma. Leukotriene antagonists have proven to be effective in the treatment of asthma, but data about their efficacy in CRS are scarce, whereas data on montelukast as an add-on treatment to intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) in a postoperative setting are completely lacking.

The study was a prospective, randomized, open-label trial. In this trial with long-term follow-up, the efficacy of montelukast as an add-on treatment to INCS in postoperative CRS with nasal polyp (CRSwNP) patients was evaluated. CRSwNP patients (N = 72) undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery were randomized into two arms for postoperative treatment. One group (N = 36) received INCS as monotherapy, whereas the other group (N = 36) received INCS in association with montelukast for 1 year. The efficacy of montelukast with INCS was evaluated by assessing both subjective (total five-symptom score [T5SS]) and objective (nasal polyp score [NPS], Lund-Mackay [LMK] score, and subjective olfactometry [Barcelona Smell Test 24]) outcome parameters and compared with the gold standard of INCS in monotherapy.

After 1 year of surgery, T5SS, NPS, and LMK scores were significantly reduced in patients treated with either INCS or INCS plus montelukast, without significant differences between the two treatment arms. Improvement of smell loss by olfactometry was also observed with no differences between arms. Similar findings were observed at 3 and 6 months.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include the addition of a consumer to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and three new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy. This includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient.

A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, was selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups, including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics, have reviewed and revised the guideline.

- **Three specific issues were considered**: 1) Evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children; 2) Evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens; and 3) The diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration.

It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children less than or equal to 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary.

### Microbial keratitis (bacterial, fungal) [^115FyBKX]. COP (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bacterial keratitis, specifically in relation to topical antibiotics, the CO 2022 guidelines recommend offering empirical fluoroquinolone monotherapy (levofloxacin/moxifloxacin). This involves administering the medication hourly day and night for 48 hours, then every 2 hours daily for 72 hours, and subsequently every 4 hours for 7 days, in patients with small lesions (< 1 mm) lacking sight-threatening characteristics.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute sinusitis [^112U5ttG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is the inflammation and swelling of the nasal and paranasal mucous membranes, a common reason for patients to seek primary care consultations. The related impairment of daily functioning and quality of life is attributable to symptoms such as facial pain and nasal congestion.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of systemic corticosteroids on clinical response rates and to determine adverse effects and relapse rates of systemic corticosteroids compared to placebo or standard clinical care in children and adults with acute sinusitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February week 1, 2014), and EMBASE (January 2009 to February 2014).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing systemic corticosteroids to placebo or standard clinical care for patients with acute sinusitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Five RCTs with a total of 1,193 adult participants met our inclusion criteria. We judged methodological quality to be moderate in four trials and high in one trial. Acute sinusitis was defined clinically in all trials. However, the three trials performed in ear, nose, and throat (ENT) outpatient clinics also used radiological assessment as part of their inclusion criteria. All participants were assigned to either oral corticosteroids (prednisone 24 mg to 80 mg daily or betamethasone 1 mg daily) or the control treatment (placebo in four trials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in one).

### Imaging findings of the orbital and intracranial complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis [^117Mzk8t]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

In patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, severe orbital and intracranial complications can occur. This review illustrates the anatomic relationship between the paranasal sinuses and the orbital and intracranial compartments. Subsequently, the spectrum of orbital and intracranial complications of rhinosinusitis and related imaging findings are discussed and illustrated by case material from daily practice.

- **Teaching points**:
	- Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis can cause severe orbital and intracranial complications.
	- If orbital or intracranial complications are suspected, cross-sectional imaging is mandatory.
	- Infection can spread from the ethmoid sinus to the orbit through the lamina papyracea.
	- Frontal sinusitis can spread intracranially through dehiscences or osteomyelitis.
	- Radiologists must recognize imaging findings of complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

### Singulair [^111y8DdB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors, as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD4 in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n = 12), Singulair inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively.

The effect of Singulair on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received Singulair, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received Singulair, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of Singulair. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis [^112jaiYY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis are two of the most common indications for antimicrobial agents in children. Together, they account for billions of dollars in healthcare expenditures. The pathogenesis of these conditions is identical. In the majority of children with each condition, a preceding viral upper respiratory tract infection predisposes them to developing the acute bacterial complication. It has been shown that viral upper respiratory tract infections predispose to the development of acute otitis media in 37% of cases.

Currently, precise microbiologic diagnosis of acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis requires performing tympanocentesis in the former and sinus aspiration in the latter. The identification of a virus from the nasopharynx in either case does not obviate the need for antimicrobial therapy. Furthermore, nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs are not useful in predicting the results of culture of the middle ear or paranasal sinus. However, it is possible that a combination of information regarding nasopharyngeal colonization with bacteria and infection with specific viruses may inform treatment decisions in the future.

### Clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetics of montelukast in dyspeptic children with duodenal eosinophilia [^112je6rY]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Montelukast, a competitive cysteinyl leukotriene-1 receptor antagonist, reduces airway eosinophilia in asthmatics. We evaluated the effect of this drug in children with eosinophilic duodenitis, defined histologically as duodenal mucosa with a peak eosinophil count of more than 10 eosinophils/high power field (hpf).

- **Methods**: Forty children and adolescents (ages 6–18 years) with dyspepsia and duodenal eosinophilia were enrolled in a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of montelukast therapy. Subjects were randomized to receive either 10 mg of montelukast or an identical placebo once daily and were evaluated on day 14 for symptomatic and biochemical responses. Subjects were also randomized to one of two blood sampling schemes to evaluate montelukast pharmacokinetics.

- **Results**: Using a post-treatment global pain assessment, a positive clinical response was observed in 62.1% of patients receiving montelukast compared with 32.4% on placebo (p < 0.02). The pain assessment score deteriorated in 45% of montelukast responders (5/11) after crossover to placebo and improved in 62% (8/13) of placebo non-responders on crossover to montelukast. In patients with peak duodenal eosinophil counts between 20–29/hpf (n = 19), a positive pain assessment response was observed in 84% of patients receiving montelukast compared to 42% receiving placebo (p < 0.01). Response rate did not differ by age, gender, or histologic findings at baseline. Pharmacokinetic analysis yielded parameter estimates for the absorption rate constant (Ka), apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F), and elimination rate constant.

### Clinical implications of microbial biofilms in chronic rhinosinusitis and orbital cellulitis [^1144g4UM]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

In view of the aforementioned observations relating to biofilm and microbial virulence in various systemic infections, we tried to explore similar occurrences in CRS and orbital cellulitis. It was justifiable to study these two disease entities together because they are clinically inter-related, with the pathogenesis of the latter condition often developing as a complication of the former (frequently ethmoidal sinusitis).

Cryer et al. first suggested the presence of biofilms on the sinus mucosa of CRS patients. This short study of 16 CRS patients, who had failed to respond to both surgical and medical treatments, utilized scanning electron microscopy to analyze the specimens of sinus mucosa. In their experiments, the researchers found four specimens with a thicker coating than what is found in a normal muco-ciliary blanket. Further studies on the pathogenesis of various bacterial infections suggested that bacteria could adhere to solid surfaces and form a slimy, slippery coat. These so-called bacterial biofilms were prevalent on most wet surfaces, and bacterial cells embedded inside biofilms were resistant to antimicrobial agents and the host immune defense mechanism.

- **Demonstration and prevalence of biofilms**: Ferguson and Stolz demonstrated the presence of bacterial biofilms in two of four patients with CRS. Also using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Sanclement et al. noted a prevalence of biofilms in 80% of the mucosal biopsies of CRS patients. Further electron microscopic research revealed the presence of biofilms in silast.

### Cefuroxime axetil [^112dp3N5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis was examined through one adequate and well-controlled trial. In this study, subjects with acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis had a maxillary sinus aspirate collected by sinus puncture before treatment initiation. Radiographic and clinical evidence confirmed acute maxillary sinusitis in all subjects. The trial found that the clinical effectiveness of cefuroxime axetil in treating acute maxillary sinusitis was comparable to an oral antimicrobial agent containing a specific β-lactamase inhibitor. However, microbiology data showed that cefuroxime axetil was effective against acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis caused only by Streptococcus pneumoniae or non-β-lactamase–producing Haemophilus influenzae. There were insufficient numbers of β-lactamase–producing Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of cefuroxime axetil against these organisms.

This trial randomized 317 adult subjects, with 132 from the U.S. and 185 from South America. In both this trial and a supporting maxillary puncture trial, 15 evaluable subjects had non-β-lactamase–producing Haemophilus influenzae as the identified pathogen, of which 67% (10/15) had this pathogen eradicated. Additionally, 18 evaluable subjects had Streptococcus pneumoniae as the identified pathogen, with 83% (15/18) achieving eradication.

### Treatment options for chronic rhinosinusitis [^112Dt9y7]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as persistent symptomatic inflammation of the nasal and sinus mucosa. Although insights into the pathophysiology of CRS have largely expanded over the last two decades, the exact etiology remains unknown and is likely due to multiple host and environmental factors. Treatments aim to reduce mucosal inflammation, control infection, and restore mucociliary clearance within the sinuses.

The principal goal of this article is to outline a rational approach to the treatment of chronic sinus disease based on currently available diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Emphasis will be placed on the management, therapeutic response, and objective evaluation of therapeutic efficiency.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral montelukast in acute asthma exacerbation [^111ch5SZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Our study did not reveal significant differences in pulmonary function tests measured as FEV1 at admission and discharge and PEF measured at specific intervals or length of hospital stay in patients hospitalized with acute asthma exacerbation that were given oral montelukast versus placebo. The efficacy and tolerability profile of oral montelukast were comparable to placebo, and no serious adverse effects were encountered.

The pathology of asthma triggers the arachnoid acid cascade leading to the formation of leukotrienes via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. The cysteinyl leukotrienes possess pro-inflammatory characteristics which can directly cause or potentiate airflow obstruction by increased mucosal secretion and bronchospasm. Leukotriene pathway modifiers, hence, are a subject of interest as a possible adjunct therapy in the acute management of asthma exacerbation.

However, our results are in contrast with a recently published study by Ramsay et al. They randomized 73 patients and found significantly higher peak expiratory flows (PEFs) measured in the morning after admission in patients who received montelukast (p = 0.046; 95% CI of 1.15–113.6 L/min) compared to patients who did not. A study by Silverman et al. evaluated the effects of another LTRA, zafirlukast. They randomized patients into three groups: oral zafirlukast at 20 mg and 160 mg versus placebo. They looked at the time to relapse in the outpatient setting after discharge from the emergency department and found a reduction in the absolute rate of relapse by 5.3% in patients treated with zafirlukast.

### Clinical safety and tolerability of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in controlled clinical trials in patients aged ≥ 6 years [^116dd2L7]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist administered orally once daily for the treatment of chronic asthma in adults and children. A comprehensive analysis of safety data from double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials with montelukast has not been previously reported.

- **Patients and methods**: A pooled analysis of safety data from 11 multicenter, randomized, controlled montelukast Phase IIb and III trials and five long-term extension studies was performed. A total of 3,386 adult patients (aged 15–85 years) and 336 pediatric patients (aged 6–14 years) were enrolled in the trials; 2,031 adults received montelukast for up to 4.1 years, and 257 children received montelukast for up to 1.8 years. Summary statistics comparing incidences of adverse events among treatment groups were calculated.

- **Results**: The overall incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events among montelukast-treated patients, both adult and pediatric, was similar to that among patients receiving placebo. There were no clinically relevant differences in individual adverse events, including infectious upper respiratory conditions and transaminase elevations, between montelukast and placebo groups. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred with similar frequencies during placebo, montelukast, and inhaled beclomethasone therapy. No dose-related adverse effects of montelukast were observed in adults treated with dosages as high as 200 mg per day (20 times the recommended dose) for 5 months. This tolerability profile of montelukast observed in clinical trials has been generally reflected in practice.

### Tezepelumab treatment in severe asthma with recurrent chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps: Case series [^114DYok8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Low credibility.

The study presents a case series on the use of tezepelumab for treating severe asthma in patients with recurrent chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. The findings indicate potential benefits of this treatment approach in managing such complex conditions. Further research is necessary to establish the long-term efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in this patient population.

### Prevalence of pus in radiologically diseased sinuses in patients undergoing surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis [^111SHCj1]. Otolaryngology — head and neck surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to establish the prevalence of pus in radiologically diseased sinuses in patients undergoing sinus surgery and to correlate this with the bacterial load in the sinuses.

- **Study design and setting**: A prospective study was performed on adult patients diagnosed with chronic sinusitis undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery at a group of academic hospitals in Adelaide. In 45 consecutive and unselected patients, a radiologically diseased sinus was surgically opened. A specially designed suction aspirator was placed into the sinus under endoscopic control. These aspirates were Gram stained and cultured to quantify the polymorphonuclear neutrophil count, bacterial flora, and bacterial colony count. The CT scans of all patients were graded using the Lund-Mackay scoring system.

- **Results**: A variety of bacteria, most commonly staphylococci, were cultured from a radiologically diseased sinus in 88% of patients. There was no correlation between the bacterial colony count and the presence of pus, and only 11% of patients had microscopic evidence of inflammation in sinus aspirates. There was no correlation between the Lund-Mackay CT score and the presence of pus in the sinus.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of patients undergoing surgery for chronic sinusitis did not have a purulent exudate, and there was no correlation with the bacterial load. The usefulness of antibiotics in treating chronic rhinosinusitis, in the absence of macroscopic pus, is questionable.

### Xhance [^112cQnha]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In both trials, the coprimary efficacy endpoints were as follows: the change from baseline at Week 4 in the composite symptom score (CSS), as determined by patients using a daily diary, and the change from baseline at Week 24 in percent opacified sinus volume. CSS was the sum of the individual nasal symptom scores for congestion/obstruction, facial pain/pressure, and nasal discharge. Each symptom was rated by the patient on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) in the morning immediately prior to the next dose. Sinus opacification was measured by CT scan and scored using a 3-dimensional computer-assisted volumetric assessment software to quantify the average percent of opacified volume in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses.

Efficacy was demonstrated for both coprimary endpoints (CSS and percent opacified sinus volume) for Xhance 186 mcg twice daily and Xhance 372 mcg twice daily. Improvements demonstrated in CSS at Week 4 with either dose of Xhance remained at Weeks 8 and 12.

- **Secondary efficacy endpoints**: Change from baseline in individual symptoms of the CSS (nasal congestion, nasal pain/pressure, and nasal discharge) at Week 4.

- **Acute exacerbations**: Acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis (AECRS), defined as a worsening of symptoms that required escalation of treatment (e.g. antibiotics, oral steroids, acute care visits), were assessed in the CRSsNP patients from pooled data (Trials 3 and 4) through Week 24. The rate of AECRS was re…

### Microbiology of acute maxillary sinusitis in children [^1168j52C]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

All the maxillary sinus aspirate samples obtained from 31 pediatric acute maxillary sinusitis patients were examined through viral and bacterial PCR. At least one microorganism was detected in the maxillary sinus aspirates from 30 patients (97%). Viral nucleic acids were detected in maxillary sinus aspirates in 10 patients (32%). Furthermore, pathogenic bacteria were detected in all samples wherein viral nucleic acids were detected; none of the samples contained only viruses. The most common virus detected in the sinus aspirates was rhinovirus in four patients. Influenza virus was detected in three patients (type A, one case; type B, two cases), RSV in one patient, hBoV in one patient, and PIV3 in one patient.

- **Bacterial PCR results**: Bacterial PCR revealed the presence of 39 bacteria, among which H. influenzae was the most common bacterium, identified in 14 patients (36%). S. pneumoniae was detected in 10 patients (26%), M. catarrhalis in 5 patients (13%), and C. pneumoniae in 4 patients (10%). The age distribution of these patients showed that in those aged ≥ 11 years, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis were detected. In patients ≤ 10 years, although the same three bacteria, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, were found, various other bacteria, including C. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and L. pneumophila, were also detected. C. pneumoniae was specifically noted in children aged 8 to 10 years.

### The effect of montelukast sodium on the duration of effusion of otitis media [^111WQtnt]. Clinical Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

This study tests the hypothesis that montelukast sodium, a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist, will decrease the duration of the effusion of otitis media in patients aged 2 to 12 years. Tympanometry and spectral gradient acoustic reflectometry were used to confirm the presence of effusion. Patients were treated with amoxicillin for 10 days and either montelukast sodium or a placebo for 30 days in a random, double-blind manner.

Sixty patients completed the study: 31 received a placebo and 29 received montelukast sodium. At a 4-week follow-up visit, 5 ears (16%) were free of effusion in the placebo group, while 17 ears (58%) were free of effusion in the montelukast sodium group. The difference was significant, with the efficacy of montelukast sodium in clearing the effusion being 49%.

### Montelukast as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of mild to moderate asthma: A systematic review [^11364hb9]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this review was to systematically assess the medium to long-term benefits and risks of montelukast as an add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) compared to placebo and active controls in the treatment of mild to moderate asthma.

Data sources included Medline, Embase, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, reference lists of retrieved articles, clinical trial registries, and study results databases.

- **Review methods**: A systematic review was conducted on randomized controlled trials with a duration of 12 weeks or more, involving adolescents and adults. These trials compared montelukast/ICS with ICS monotherapy or montelukast/ICS with active control/ICS. Meta-analyses were performed where feasible, with a primary focus on clinical outcomes such as exacerbations. Adverse events were also evaluated.

- **Results**: Thirteen studies meeting all inclusion criteria were identified. Seven studies, which included both constant and tapered doses of ICS, compared montelukast/ICS with ICS monotherapy. Six studies assessed the addition of montelukast to an active control (salmeterol). Overall, the data suggested that montelukast/ICS was clinically more effective than ICS monotherapy. The ICS-sparing potential of montelukast was clearly demonstrated in one study. Montelukast/ICS and ICS monotherapy exhibited similar safety profiles. In the active-controlled studies, montelukast/ICS was clinically less effective than salmeterol/ICS in the 12-week trials, with a pooled proportion of patients experiencing at least one exacerbation (p = 0.006). However, separate analysis of active-controlled 48-week trials showed comparable proportions of patients experiencing at least one exacerbation.

### Levofloxacin [^115JAziY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) using either 750 mg by mouth for 5 days or 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 to 14 days. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high-dose short course of levofloxacin, 780 outpatient adults with clinically and radiologically determined acute bacterial sinusitis were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multi-center study. This study compared levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth once daily for five days to levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 days.

Clinical success rates, defined as complete or partial resolution of the pre-treatment signs and symptoms of ABS to such an extent that no further antibiotic treatment was deemed necessary, were reported in the microbiologically evaluable population. Success rates were 91.4% (139/152) in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 88.6% (132/149) in the levofloxacin 500 mg group at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit, with a 95% CI of [-4.2, 10] for levofloxacin 750 mg minus levofloxacin 500 mg.

Rates of clinical success by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable population, who had specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry, showed comparable results for the five- and ten-day regimens at the test-of-cure visit 22 days post-treatment.

* **Note**: Forty percent of the subjects in this trial had specimens obtained by sinus endoscopy. The efficacy data for these subjects is not included in this summary.

### Randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing desloratadine and montelukast in monotherapy and desloratadine plus montelukast in combined therapy for chronic idiopathic urticaria [^1154s4wy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

H1-receptor antagonists are considered particularly effective in reducing pruritus, and they are therefore recommended as first-line treatment in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). Recently, antileukotriene receptors have been used in patients with CIU, either as monotherapy or combined with H1-receptor antagonists.

- **Objective**: We compared the clinical efficacy of 5 mg of desloratadine administered once daily either as monotherapy or combined with a leukotriene antagonist, 10 mg of montelukast daily, and 10 mg of montelukast administered daily as monotherapy for the treatment of patients affected by CIU with placebo.

- **Methods**: One hundred sixty patients aged 18 to 69 years (mean ± SD, 43.9 ± 13.4 years) with a history of moderate CIU were selected. A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study design was used. Patients were treated with 5 mg of desloratadine once daily (n = 40), 10 mg of montelukast once daily (n = 40), 5 mg of desloratadine in the morning plus montelukast in the evening (n = 40), or matched placebo (n = 40). Assessment of treatment efficacy was based on scores of daily cutaneous symptoms evaluated both reflectively and instantaneously.

- **Results**: Only the group treated with desloratadine as monotherapy or as combined therapy completed the study. Twenty-seven of the 40 patients in the montelukast group and 35 of the 40 patients in the placebo group discontinued the treatment. Reflective evaluations showed significant differences in all groups compared with the placebo.

### Montelukast as an adjunct to oral and inhaled steroid therapy in chronic nasal polyposis [^117NaXiV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

To examine the potential of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, as an adjunct to oral and inhaled steroids in subjects with chronic nasal polyps, a prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted.

Thirty-eight consecutive adult patients with bilateral nasal polyps were randomized into two groups. Eighteen subjects were treated with oral prednisolone for 14 days and budesonide nasal spray for 8 weeks. Twenty subjects received similar treatment with additional oral montelukast for 8 weeks. Subjects completed a modified nasal ICSD symptom score at 8 and 12 weeks after beginning treatment and the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire at 12 weeks.

Symptom scores improved in both groups after treatment. Subjects treated with montelukast reported significantly less headache (P = 0.013), facial pain (P = 0.048), and sneezing (P = 0.03) than controls. Four weeks after completing treatment, no significant differences were recorded.

Montelukast therapy may have clinical benefits as an adjunct to oral and inhaled steroids in chronic nasal polyposis, but effects are not maintained after cessation of treatment.

### Imaging follow-up study of acute rhinosinusitis [^112HDDrP]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

To evaluate, through imaging, the course of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) and the associations between paranasal imaging results, symptoms, bony anatomic variations, and culture-proven bacterial ARS, the study utilized an inception cohort design involving 50 conscripts with ARS.

During a single ARS episode, symptoms were collected daily, and sequential cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans of the paranasal sinuses were taken from the same patients 2 to 3, 5 to 6, and 9 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms. Culture-proven bacterial ARS was verified with maxillary sinus aspiration and bacterial culture at 9 to 10 days.

- **Results**: At 2 to 3 days, 38% of the patients exhibited major abnormalities, 42% had minor abnormalities in their paranasal sinuses, and 68% had an occluded ostiomeatal complex (OMC). These proportions remained consistent at both 5 to 6 days and 9 to 10 days. Patients with bacterial ARS had slightly higher CBCT scores at 2 to 3 days compared to those without. Over time, the CBCT and symptom scores gradually increased in patients with bacterial ARS and decreased in those without. There was only a weak correlation between CBCT and symptom scores (rs = 0.36), and anatomic variations were not related to the development of bacterial ARS.

- **Conclusions**: Paranasal mucosal abnormalities and occlusion of the OMC are present when ARS symptoms begin and remain fairly constant in most patients, regardless of the presence of bacterial ARS. This indicates that the disease process spreads to the paranasal sinuses and causes obstruction early in the ARS episode.

A 68-year-old asthmatic presented markedly unwell with arthralgia, mononeuritis multiplex, peripheral neuropathy, and eosinophilia. His past medical history included perennial rhinitis and nasal polyps. Three months prior to admission, his prednisolone was stopped and montelukast was started. The diagnosis of montelukast-associated Churg-Strauss syndrome was made. The drug was stopped and steroids were started, leading to general improvement and reduction of eosinophilia; however, the neurological deficit persisted.

### Xolair [^111zxib7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Xolair were evaluated in two randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials: CRSwNP Trial 1 [NCT03280550] and CRSwNP Trial 2 [NCT03280537]. These trials enrolled patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) who had an inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids (CRSwNP Trial 1, n = 138; CRSwNP Trial 2, n = 127). Patients received Xolair or placebo subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks, with the Xolair dosage and frequency detailed according to Table 3, for a duration of 24 weeks followed by a 4-week follow-up period. All patients received background nasal mometasone therapy during both the treatment period and a 5-week run-in period.

Prior to randomization, patients were required to provide evidence of bilateral polyps, verified by a nasal polyp score (NPS) of ≥ 5, with NPS ≥ 2 in each nostril, despite the use of nasal mometasone during the run-in period. NPS was measured via endoscopy and scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 4 per nostril: 0 indicating no polyps; 1 indicating small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below the inferior border of the middle turbinate; 2 indicating polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate; 3 indicating large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle turbinate; and 4 denoting large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity, for a total NPS ranging from 0 to 8.

Patients were furthermore required to have a weekly average nasal congestion score (NCS) of > 1 before randomization, despite the use of nasal mometasone. Nasal congestion was measured through a daily assessment on a scale from 0 to 3.

### Singulair [^1112nhqJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors, as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD4 in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled crossover study (n = 12), Singulair inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively.

The effect of Singulair on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received Singulair, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted compared with placebo over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received Singulair, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of Singulair. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known.

- **General**: There have been no clinical trials in asthmatics to evaluate the relative efficacy of morning versus evening dosing. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar whether dosed in the morning or evening. Efficacy has been demonstrated for asthma when montelukast was administered in the evening without regard to the time of day.

### Xhance [^111SW4NT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Xhance was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trials in adults 18 years and older with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and associated moderate to severe nasal congestion (Trial 1 [NCT01622569], Trial 2 [NCT01624662]). The two trials included a total of 646 patients: 348 males (53.9%) and 298 females (46.1%), with a mean age of 45.5 years. Patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive 93 mcg, 186 mcg, or 372 mcg twice daily or placebo for a period of 16 weeks. At baseline, 35.7% of patients had polyps graded as mild, 79.0% as moderate, and 18.3% as severe. Additionally, 90.6% of patients reported previous use of a topical steroid nasal spray for the treatment of CRSwNP, and 53.6% reported previous sinus surgery or polypectomy.

- **Co-primary efficacy endpoints**: The co-primary efficacy endpoints were:
	1. Change from baseline to Week 4 in nasal congestion/obstruction averaged over the preceding 7 days of treatment.
	2. Change from baseline to Week 16 in bilateral polyp grade.

	- Nasal congestion was rated by the patient on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) at the time immediately prior to the next dose. The polyp grade was determined by the clinician using nasal endoscopy. Polyps on each side of the nose were graded on a categorical scale (0 = no polyps; 1 = mild – polyps not reaching below the inferior border of the middle turbinate; 2 = moderate – polyps reaching below the inferior border).

### Tezepelumab achieves improvement of severe uncontrolled asthma and rhinosinusitis: Case series [^1124UNGk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

The CT scan findings regarding case patients 2 to 4 are as follows:

- **Case patient 2**:
	- *CT scan results*: In March, CT scans showed soft shadow filling of the bilateral ethmoid and maxillary sinuses before tezepelumab administration (A). By October, after administration, improvement was noted in the soft tissue shadows of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses (B). Further scans in August depicted mucosal thickening within the left ethmoid sinus (C). By January, after starting tezepelumab therapy, improved soft tissue shadows in the ethmoid sinuses were observed (D).

- **Case patient 4**:
	- *CT scan results*: In June, CT scans indicated soft tissue shadow bilateral filling of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses (E). By January, significant improvement was recorded in both sinuses after the initiation of tezepelumab therapy (F).

Case patient 3 was a 74-year-old male who was referred to a core hospital in August for repeated asthma attacks and was prescribed prednisolone, 10 mg daily. He also presented with nasal congestion and nasal polyps. Laboratory data showed a peripheral blood eosinophil count of 39 cells/μL and an IgE level of 518 IU/L. Pulmonary function tests indicated a %FEV1 value of 33%, an FEV1/FVC value of 45.3%, and a fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) level of 118 ppb. A CT scan exhibited mucosal thickening within the left ethmoid sinus (Fig 2, C). Prior treatment at the previous clinic included inhalants such as an ICS/LABA combination (budesonide/formoterol, 200/6 μg; 4 inhalations twice daily) and LAMA (tiotropium, 5 μg twice daily).

An increase in the FEV1 value was noted after these interventions.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^1176j7xN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a controlled double-blind study conducted in the US, moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily for ten days) were compared with cefuroxime axetil (250 mg twice daily for ten days) for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. The trial included 457 patients valid for the efficacy analysis. Clinical success, defined as cure plus improvement, at the 7 to 21 day post-therapy test of cure visit was 90% for moxifloxacin and 89% for cefuroxime.

An additional non-comparative study was conducted to gather bacteriological data and evaluate microbiological eradication in adult patients treated with moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for seven days. All patients (n = 336) underwent antral puncture in this study. At the 21 to 37 day follow-up visit, the clinical success rates and eradication/presumed eradication rates were 97% (29 out of 30) for *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, 83% (15 out of 18) for *Moraxella catarrhalis*, and 80% (24 out of 30) for *Haemophilus influenzae*.

- **Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis**: Moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily for five days) were evaluated for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis in a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the US. This study compared moxifloxacin with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) and enrolled 629 patients. Clinical success was assessed at 7 to 17 days post-therapy. The clinical success rate for moxifloxacin was 89% (222/250) compared to 89% (224/251) for clarithromycin.
