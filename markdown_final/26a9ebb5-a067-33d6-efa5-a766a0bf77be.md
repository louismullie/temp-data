## Question

Unilateral vision blurriness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about unilateral vision blurriness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and frame the clinical problem. Then, I should categorize the differential by time course and pain status. Next, I will prioritize high-risk emergencies and outline a focused history and examination. After that, I should specify when and how to image, and then detail management pathways for key etiologies. Finally, I will consider special populations, functional impacts, and follow-up, while continuously checking assumptions and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct: unilateral vision blurriness is a monocular symptom that can reflect disease at the cornea, lens, vitreous, retina, choroid, optic nerve, or intracranial visual pathways, and the urgency of evaluation hinges on time course, associated symptoms, and risk factors, so I need to keep those axes front and center as I proceed [^1118hfof].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should categorize by time course and pain because that narrows the differential and triages urgency. Acute painless loss suggests vascular occlusion, retinal detachment, or compressive optic neuropathy, whereas acute painful loss points to corneal disease, anterior uveitis, or optic neuritis; transient episodes raise vasospasm, migraine, or ischemia; subacute or chronic courses suggest inflammatory, degenerative, compressive, or amblyogenic etiologies, and I should double-check that these buckets align with accepted frameworks before proceeding [^116SLQEF] [^112HW4p5].

> I will now examine high-risk emergencies that mandate same-day ophthalmology or emergent care: central retinal artery occlusion, acute angle-closure glaucoma, retinal detachment, giant cell arteritis with ischemic optic neuropathy, and compressive lesions threatening the optic nerve. I should confirm that these are the canonical emergencies and that delays worsen outcomes, which they do, so I need to ensure I do not miss these in the initial sorting [^116wXx39] [^1125PxVE] [^112UPyMp].

> Next, I should review a focused history to separate benign from dangerous causes. I need to check onset and tempo, pain characteristics, photophobia, floaters or flashes, headache or jaw claudication, trauma, contact lens use, medication exposures including anticholinergics, topiramate, fingolimod, amantadine, and vigabatrin, systemic vascular risk factors, and prior similar episodes. I should confirm that these elements map to guideline-based history taking and that I am not omitting key drug toxicities, which they do and I should not omit them [^114HHXTZ] [^117HrPk6] [^1139ujnr] [^116x9Hgu] [^114N7gRU].

> Wait, let me verify the examination priorities: visual acuity, pupils for RAPD, confrontational fields, slit lamp for cornea and anterior chamber, intraocular pressure, and a dilated fundus exam are essential. If the fundus is not visible, I should use ultrasound to assess for retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage, and I should remember that bedside ultrasound can support optic nerve sheath findings in optic neuritis, though I must not overstate its specificity [^116wXx39] [^111mSZ9r].

> I need to ensure I do not over-order imaging; most nontraumatic ocular causes are diagnosed clinically and do not require imaging, but I should obtain emergent brain and orbit MRI with contrast for suspected optic neuritis, compressive lesions, or when the neuro-ophthalmic exam suggests intracranial disease. CT is reserved for trauma or when MRI is contraindicated, and I should double-check that this aligns with ACR appropriateness criteria, which it does [^116MnGi6] [^1118hfof].

> Let me consider optic neuritis carefully: typical ON in young adults is painful, causes RAPD, dyschromatopsia, and a central scotoma, and warrants MRI to assess for demyelination and to exclude atypical features. High-dose IV methylprednisolone can hasten recovery, and I should remember to test for AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG if atypical features are present because management and prognosis differ, so I should confirm that I am not missing antibody-mediated disease [^114RTvRq] [^117LQUgd].

> For suspected giant cell arteritis, I should act immediately: start high-dose systemic steroids even before biopsy if vision is threatened, because the risk of contralateral involvement is high and delays cause irreversible loss. I should confirm that this is supported by rheumatology and ophthalmology guidance, which it is, and I should also remember that new visual loss can rarely occur during treatment, so vigilance remains necessary [^112LhweC] [^115xP3pf].

> In acute angle-closure glaucoma, I should confirm the classic presentation of unilateral pain, blurred vision with halos, corneal edema, and very high IOP, and I must treat urgently with topical and systemic IOP-lowering agents and arrange laser iridotomy. I should also remember medication triggers like topiramate and anticholinergics, and I need to ensure the fellow eye is prophylactically treated because recurrence risk is substantial [^1125PxVE] [^117HrPk6].

> For retinal detachment, I should double-check that new floaters, flashes, and a curtain or shadow in the visual field mandate emergent ophthalmology referral, and that ultrasound helps when the fundus is not visible. Surgical repair has high success if macula-on, so I must not delay [^116wXx39].

> But wait, what if the presentation is transient monocular vision loss? I should consider amaurosis fugax from embolic disease, vasospasm, or migraine, and I should evaluate carotid and cardiac sources promptly because of stroke risk. I need to ensure I do not dismiss these as benign without workup, as vascular etiologies are common and actionable [^116SLQEF] [^112hVoBu].

> I should review medication-induced etiologies: amantadine can cause bilateral corneal edema with blurred vision that improves with cessation, fingolimod can cause macular edema, and vigabatrin carries a high risk of irreversible bilateral visual field constriction, so I need to ask explicitly about these drugs and counsel on monitoring and discontinuation if visual symptoms occur [^116x9Hgu] [^1139ujnr] [^114N7gRU].

> Let me think about special populations. In children, amblyopia and strabismus are leading causes of unilateral vision loss, and early detection and treatment are critical. In older adults, AMD, glaucoma, and ischemic optic neuropathy predominate, and falls risk counseling is essential. In patients with cancer, metastatic disease can compress the optic nerve and cause acute loss, so I should maintain a low threshold for neuroimaging in atypical or progressive cases [^112Gvuvw] [^114CgXK3] [^112UPyMp].

> I should confirm functional implications and counseling: unilateral vision loss increases risks of falls, dependency, and quality-of-life impairment, and patients with monocular status should wear impact-resistant protective eyewear during activities with eye injury risk. For AMD, AREDS2 supplementation reduces fellow-eye progression risk, and patients should monitor vision and return promptly with new symptoms [^113cRsVS] [^111RCUq4] [^115KjGH1].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety netting: patients with unilateral blurriness need clear return precautions for new floaters, flashes, field defects, pain, or sudden worsening, and those with chronic or progressive disease require scheduled ophthalmic care. I need to ensure my plan addresses both the affected eye and the fellow eye, especially in bilateral conditions like AMD or glaucoma [^116wXx39] [^115KjGH1].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include uveal melanoma as a common cause of unilateral blurred vision, but I should correct that: while it can present with blurred vision or photopsia, it is relatively uncommon and should be considered when there are choroidal findings or risk factors, so I should not overcall its frequency in the general differential of unilateral blurriness [^1158FjUx].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, time course– and pain-based triage, rapidly identify emergencies, tailor testing to pretest probability, and treat specific etiologies with evidence-based urgency. If I keep verifying each step against guidelines and key studies, I will minimize delays and maximize visual outcomes for patients with unilateral vision blurriness [^116MnGi6] [^1179ZjAy] [^112LhweC].

Unilateral vision blurriness is most often due to **refractive error, cataract, or corneal disease** [^114BkK4b], but it can also signal serious conditions such as **retinal detachment, optic neuritis, or acute angle-closure glaucoma** [^116wXx39] [^1179ZjAy] [^1125PxVE]. Red flags include **sudden onset, pain, flashes/floaters, field defect, or RAPD**, which require **urgent ophthalmology or emergency care** [^116wXx39] [^116MnGi6]. Initial workup should include **visual acuity, pupils, slit lamp, and fundus exam** [^114HHXTZ]; imaging (MRI or CT) is reserved for suspected neurologic or orbital disease [^1118hfof]. Management is cause-specific, ranging from glasses or cataract surgery to urgent treatment for retinal detachment, optic neuritis, or glaucoma [^116wXx39] [^114RTvRq] [^1125PxVE].

## Red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation

- **Sudden onset**: Suggests vascular, inflammatory, or compressive etiologies [^1179ZjAy].
- **Pain**: Indicates corneal disease, uveitis, or acute glaucoma [^114HHXTZ].
- **Flashes/floaters**: Suggests retinal detachment or posterior vitreous detachment [^116wXx39].
- **Field defect**: Implies retinal or optic nerve pathology [^116wXx39].
- **RAPD**: Indicates optic nerve disease [^117LQUgd].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Initial clinical evaluation

- **Visual acuity**: Snellen or logMAR chart [^notfound].
- **Pupil examination**: RAPD, anisocoria, reactivity [^117LQUgd].
- **Slit lamp examination**: Cornea, anterior chamber, lens [^114HHXTZ].
- **Fundus examination**: Disc, macula, vessels, retina [^116wXx39].
- **Intraocular pressure**: Tonometry [^114BakV4].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging is indicated for suspected **neurologic or orbital disease** [^1118hfof]. MRI is preferred for optic nerve, chiasm, and brain lesions; CT is used for trauma, bony lesions, or when MRI is contraindicated [^1118hfof].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Refractive errors**: Glasses or contact lenses [^notfound].
- **Cataract**: Surgical extraction and intraocular lens implantation [^notfound].
- **Corneal disease**: Topical antibiotics, antivirals, or anti-inflammatory agents; corneal transplantation in advanced cases [^notfound].
- **Retinal detachment**: Urgent surgical repair (scleral buckle, vitrectomy, or pneumatic retinopexy) [^116wXx39].
- **Optic neuritis**: High-dose intravenous corticosteroids; disease-modifying therapy if multiple sclerosis is diagnosed [^114RTvRq].
- **Glaucoma**: Topical or systemic IOP-lowering agents; laser or surgical intervention as indicated [^1125PxVE].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by **cause**: refractive errors and early cataract have excellent outcomes with correction or surgery, whereas retinal detachment, optic neuritis, and glaucoma can cause permanent vision loss if not treated promptly [^116wXx39] [^114RTvRq] [^1125PxVE]. Complications include permanent vision loss, amblyopia in children, and increased risk of injury or falls [^113cRsVS] [^114CgXK3].

---

Unilateral vision blurriness has a broad differential, but **focused history, exam, and selective imaging** enable accurate diagnosis and timely management. Sudden, painful, or field-threatening symptoms warrant **urgent care** to prevent irreversible vision loss [^116wXx39].

### Clinical reasoning: a 62-year-old woman with transient vision loss [^112hVoBu]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Transient visual loss (TVL) is a common complaint in the emergency department, with numerous possible etiologies. Prompt evaluation and management of TVL can potentially prevent progression to permanent visual loss. In this case, a 62-year-old woman presented with acute, painless, unilateral TVL. Two weeks before presentation, the patient reported bitemporal headaches and paresthesia of the distal extremities. A review of systems revealed chronic fatigue, cough, diffuse arthralgias, and decreased appetite for the previous 6 months. This case highlights the diagnostic approach to patients with TVL. Some common and rare causes associated with this clinical manifestation are briefly reviewed.

### Prevalence and causes of unilateral vision impairment and unilateral blindness in Australia: the national eye health survey [^114BkK4b]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

This study determines the prevalence of unilateral vision impairment (VI) and unilateral blindness to assist in policy formulation for eye health care services.

Objective

To determine the prevalence and causes of unilateral VI and unilateral blindness in Australia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted from March 2015 to April 2016 at 30 randomly selected sites across all strata of geographic remoteness in Australia. A total of 1738 indigenous Australians 40 years or older and 3098 nonindigenous Australians 50 years or older were included.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The prevalence and causes of unilateral vision impairment and blindness, defined as presenting visual acuity worse than 6/12 and 6/60, respectively, in the worse eye, and 6/12 or better in the better eye.

Results

Of the 1738 indigenous Australians, mean (SD) age was 55.0 (10.0) years, and 1024 participants (58.9%) were female. Among the 3098 nonindigenous Australians, mean (SD) age was 66.6 (9.7) years, and 1661 participants (53.6%) were female. The weighted prevalence of unilateral VI in indigenous Australians was 12.5% (95% CI, 11.0%-14.2%) and the prevalence of unilateral blindness was 2.4% (95% CI, 1.7%-3.3%), respectively. In nonindigenous Australians, the prevalence of unilateral VI was 14.6% (95% CI, 13.1%-16.3%) and unilateral blindness was found in 1.4% (95% CI, 1.0%-1.8%). The age-adjusted and sex-adjusted prevalence of unilateral vision loss was higher in indigenous Australians than nonindigenous Australians (VI: 18.7% vs 14.5%; P = 0.02; blindness: 2.9% vs 1.3%; P = 0.02). Risk factors for unilateral vision loss included older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.60 for each decade of age for indigenous Australians; 95% CI, 1.39–1.86; OR, 1.65 per decade for nonindigenous Australians; 95% CI, 1.38–1.96), very remote residence (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.01–2.74) and self-reported diabetes (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.12–2.07) for indigenous Australians, and having not undergone an eye examination in the past 2 years for nonindigenous Australians (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.04–2.27). Uncorrected refractive error and cataract were leading causes of unilateral VI in both populations (70%-75%). Corneal pathology (16.7%) and cataract (13.9%) were leading causes of unilateral blindness in indigenous Australians, while amblyopia (18.8%), trauma (16.7%), and age-related macular degeneration (10.4%) were major causes of unilateral blindness in nonindigenous Australians.

Conclusions and Relevance

Unilateral vision loss is prevalent in indigenous and nonindigenous Australians; however, most cases are avoidable. As those with unilateral vision loss caused by cataract and posterior segment diseases may be at great risk of progressing to bilateral blindness, national blindness prevention programs may benefit from prioritizing examination and treatment of those with unilateral vision loss.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^117DNM9r]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patient education — Educate patients about the prognosis and potential value of treatment as appropriate for their visual and functional status; encourage patients with early AMD or a family history of AMD to assess their own visual acuity using monocular vision testing and to have regular dilated eye exams for early detection of intermediate AMD; educate patients with a high-risk AMD phenotype about detecting new symptoms of MNV and the need for prompt notification to an ophthalmologist; instruct patients with unilateral disease to monitor the fellow eye and to return periodically even without symptoms, but promptly after onset of new or significant visual symptoms; instruct patients to report symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, including eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or decreased vision, increased sensitivity to light, or increased number of floaters promptly; and strongly recommend to patients who are currently smoking to stop because there are observational data that support a causal relationship between smoking and AMD and other considerable health benefits of smoking cessation.

### Eye health indicators for universal health coverage: results of a global expert prioritisation process [^112jTKvy]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

There are some notable absences from the final menu. The concept of 'people-centred' eye care proposed in the World Report on Vision is not represented. We presented 13 'responsiveness' indicators in Round 1, including 7 patient-reported outcome indicators, but the panel prioritised none; this will require further study. Disease-specific indicators for glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration were potentially under-represented in the initial long-list and not prioritised by the panel, despite their prominence as causes of vision loss globally. This may be because the natural history of these conditions make monitoring more complex than for cataract or refractive error. Appropriate coverage indicators for these conditions will require further investigation, and as the menu evolves, more 'difficult-to-measure' concepts would ideally be included. Trachoma and onchocerciasis were not prioritised, likely reflecting the progress made in these areas in recent years. However, we expect endemic countries would continue to report against indicators aligned with their elimination programmes. Unilateral vision impairment, associated with, for example, infectious corneal ulcers, is not included in the menu but was identified as a knowledge gap in the World Report on Vision and could be included in future as it gains priority in eye health planning. The GAP indicator for evidence of research on the cost-effectiveness of eye health programmes was not prioritised, but more evidence of cost-effectiveness may strengthen the case for resource allocation. Finally, broader health and financing indicators potentially relevant to eye health (demographics, non-communicable diseases, water and sanitation, government health spending) were not prioritised but could be obtained from other national reporting mechanisms to support eye care planning as appropriate.

### Fingolimod hydrochloride (fingolimod) [^1139ujnr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5. A problem with your vision called macular edema. Macular edema can cause some of the same vision symptoms as a multiple sclerosis (MS) attack (optic neuritis). You may not notice any symptoms with macular edema. If macular edema happens, it usually starts in the first 3 to 4 months after you start taking fingolimod but can happen at any time. Your doctor should test your vision around the time you start taking fingolimod, 3 to 4 months after you start taking fingolimod, periodically while you continue taking fingolimod, and any time you notice vision changes during treatment with fingolimod. Your risk of macular edema is higher if you have diabetes or have had an inflammation of your eye called uveitis.

Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms:

blurriness or shadows in the center of your vision
a blind spot in the center of your vision
sensitivity to light
unusually colored (tinted) vision

What is fingolimod capsule?

Fingolimod capsule is a prescription medicine used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults and children 10 years of age and older.

It is not known if fingolimod capsules are safe and effective in children under 10 years of age.

### Management and outcomes of unilateral group D tumors in retinoblastoma [^114CNisr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

While primary treatment with intra-arterial chemotherapy seems to be a more promising modality, it has limited availability and requires expertise of the treating oncologist and the interventional radiologist; therefore, considering the potentially fatal complications of IAC, institutes that lack experience in this field can consider other modalities with comparable outcomes. Most group D eyes will give at least navigational visionand any attempt to save the smallest potential of vision should not be disparaged. Moreover, the need of adopting one classification system cannot be over-emphasized.

### Comprehensive pediatric eye and vision examination [^115qsPtq]. AOA (2017). Medium credibility.

Visual development in infants and children — timeline and vulnerability are outlined as follows: "Development of the visual system begins prenatally and continues after birth", and "Basic visual functions develop rapidly during the first year of life". "By 6 months of age, vision has become the dominant sense and forms the basis for perceptual, cognitive, and social development; however, maturation of the visual system continues for several years". "From birth to about 6 years of age, the visual system is susceptible to vision conditions that cause either blurred visual input or abnormal binocular interaction such as interference from amblyogenic bilateral refractive error, amblyogenic anisometropia, constant unilateral strabismus, congenital cataracts, hemangioma, corneal scarring, and any other condition that obstructs vision", and "This interference can lead to amblyopia, which, if left untreated, can cause serious vision loss". Objective testing shows "the visual cortex is capable of achieving 20/20 visual acuity by 6 months of age", while subjective responses are "influenced by verbal and cognitive development".

### Permanent unilateral vision loss from allergic fungal sinusitis [^1144godW]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In the absence of trauma, sudden unilateral painless visual loss is an uncommon condition in the pediatric population requiring emergent medical evaluation. In the acute care setting, clinicians face the challenge of accurately assessing the patient and determining the initial diagnostic workup. A careful history alone helps guide diagnosis with sudden visual loss that is unilateral and persistent. Several neuro-ophthalmological conditions that present with these characteristics include retinal artery or vein occlusion, diseases affecting the cavernous sinus or orbital apex region, and optic neuropathy. Simple eye examination techniques have crucial diagnostic value in helping localize the disease process, determining the level of urgency, and need for timely intervention. Here we present an adolescent patient with nontraumatic, acute unilateral visual loss who had concerning ophthalmological examination findings and was subsequently diagnosed with optic neuropathy secondary to allergic fungal sinusitis.

### How far should I manage acute optic neuritis as an ophthalmologist? A United Kingdom perspective [^117LQUgd]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical signs of optic neuritis

The first episode of unilateral ON results in a relative afferent pupil defect, red desaturation and blurred vision, with or without a visual field defect. Frequently, a central scotoma is noted, but depending on the site of inflammation, any visual field defect can be observed. The disc may be swollen in one third of MS-ON, and a higher proportion of non-MS-ON. Non-MS-ON has more heterogeneous presentation, this is particularly true for MOG-ON.

### Topiramate induced bilateral myopia: a potential precursor to acute angle closure glaucoma [^117HrPk6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute angle closure glaucoma is a well-described vision-threatening emergency that must be promptly identified and addressed by the emergency medicine clinician. The classic presentation of unilateral eye pain, vision changes, and increased intraocular pressure is a description of a primary angle closure. This process can also occur secondarily to structural changes, systemic diseases, and certain medications.

Case Report

We present a case of acute onset of myopia in the setting of topiramate use. Initial ocular examination revealed no abnormalities in intraocular pressure or slit lamp examinat, however, prompt ophthalmological evaluation revealed narrowed angles bilaterally, resulting in surgical fixation to prevent progression into angle closure glaucoma. WhyShould anEmergencyPhysicianBeAware ofThis? Acute angle closure secondary to extra-ocular etiologies is a less well-known presentation. In contrast to primary acute angle closure in which patients classically have unilateral pain and redness, these patients may present with painless, bilateral vision changes. Emergency providers must maintain a high clinical suspicion to recognize this condition that can progress to angle closure glaucoma if untreated.

### Acute unilateral vision loss from central retinal artery occlusion associated with an atrial septal aneurysm and a patent foramen ovale: a case report [^1134o2Md]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute unilateral vision loss is an ophthalmological emergency. It can have multiple aetiologies, and physicians must be able to quickly determine the cause of the condition, as immediate intervention may prevent permanent vision loss. Acute unilateral vision loss has not previously been associated with a patent foramen ovale (PFO).

Objective

We describe a patient who presented with painless sudden loss of vision in his left eye. He was diagnosed to have central retinal artery occlusion, likely from a paradoxical embolus associated with an atrial septal aneurysm containing a PFO. The patient underwent successful percutaneous closure of the PFO without complication. This report details the evaluation and differential diagnosis of acute unilateral vision loss. Additionally, the controversy of whether a PFO should be closed prophylactically for stroke prevention is discussed.

Conclusion

Acute unilateral vision loss from central retinal artery occlusion may be caused by a paradoxical embolus originating from an atrial septal aneurysm with a PFO. This case should be considered in the controversy of whether prophylactic closure of a PFO could be beneficial for primary prevention of stroke.

### Improved modeling of human vision by incorporating robustness to blur in convolutional neural networks [^112MDP7j]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

There is a general bias to consider blurry vision as suboptimal, problematic, and in need of correction. However, such assumptions may overlook the potential contributions of blur for real-world vision and object recognition. For example, humans can leverage blurry contextual information to support more accurate object recognition, and both face and object recognition remain quite robust to substantial levels of blur. Recent work has further revealed that defocus blur provides an important cue for depth perception. Neurophysiological studies have also found that shape-selective neurons in the visual cortex can be tuned to varying degrees of blur, with some neurons preferring blurry over clear depictions of 2D object shapes. Thus, blur appears to be an important feature that is encoded by the visual system.

Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that the omission of blurry training inputs may cause CNNs to rely excessively on high spatial frequency information for object recognition, thereby causing systematic deviations from biological vision. To address this question, we compared the performance of standard CNNs trained exclusively on clear images with CNNs trained on a combination of clear and blurry images. By testing standard versus blur-trained CNNs on a diverse set of neural, visual, and behavioral benchmarks, we show that blur-trained CNN models significantly outperform standard CNNs at predicting neural responses to object images across a variety of viewing conditions, including those that were never used for training.

Unlike standard CNNs, blur-trained CNNs favor the processing of lower spatial frequency information, allowing for greater sensitivity to global object shape. Finally, contrary to the notion that CNNs are very poor at recognizing objects in novel or challenging viewing conditions, we show that CNNs trained on clear and Gaussian-blurred images exhibit greater robustness to multiple forms of blur, visual noise, as well as various types of image compression. From these findings, we conclude that instances of blurry vision are not fundamentally problematic for biological vision; instead blur may constitute a positive feature that can promote the development of more robust object recognition in both artificial and biological visual systems.

### Loss of vision [^112HW4p5]. Practical Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Visual loss is not uncommon and many patients end up seeing neurologists because of it. There is a long list of possible causes but in most patients visual loss is associated with visual field loss. This means that for practical purposes the differential diagnosis can usually be narrowed down to a manageable shortlist by consideration of where in the visual pathway the lesion is likely to be, along with the time course of the visual loss. This article provides a practical approach to the diagnosis and appropriate investigation of such patients, dividing them into four groups: those in whom vision is lost transiently, acutely, subacutely (i.e., days to weeks) and over a longer time frame (months to years). In addition, there is a discussion of those patients in whom visual loss is not obviously accompanied by any visual field loss.

### Vigabatrin (Vigpoder) [^114N7gRU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNING: PERMANENT VISION LOSS

VIGPODER can cause permanent bilateral concentric visual field constriction, including tunnel vision that can result in disability. In some cases, VIGPODER also can damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
The onset of vision loss from VIGPODER is unpredictable and can occur within weeks of starting treatment or sooner, or at any time after starting treatment, even after months or years.
Symptoms of vision loss from VIGPODER are unlikely to be recognized by patients or caregivers before vision loss is severe. Vision loss of milder severity, while often unrecognized by the patient or caregiver, can still adversely affect function.
The risk of vision loss increases with increasing dose and cumulative exposure, but there is no dose or exposure known to be free of risk of vision loss.
Vision assessment is recommended at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting VIGPODER), at least every 3 months during therapy, and about 3 to 6 months after the discontinuation of therapy.
Once detected, vision loss due to VIGPODER is not reversible. It is expected that, even with frequent monitoring, some patients will develop severe vision loss.
Consider drug discontinuation, balancing benefit and risk, if vision loss is documented.
Risk of new or worsening vision loss continues as long as VIGPODER is used. It is possible that vision loss can worsen despite discontinuation of VIGPODER.
Because of the risk of vision loss, VIGPODER should be withdrawn from patients with refractory complex partial seizures who fail to show substantial clinical benefit within 3 months of initiation and within 2 to 4 weeks of initiation for patients with infantile spasms, or sooner if treatment failure becomes obvious. Patient response to and continued need for VIGPODER should be periodically reassessed.
VIGPODER should not be used in patients with, or at high risk of, other types of irreversible vision loss unless the benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the risks.
VIGPODER should not be used with other drugs associated with serious adverse ophthalmic effects such as retinopathy or glaucoma unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.
Use the lowest dosage and shortest exposure to VIGPODER consistent with clinical objectives [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### Amblyopia preferred practice pattern [^111RCUq4]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Amblyopia PPP — safety and protective eyewear advises risk mitigation for unilateral vision impairment, noting the better-eye risk is "approximately 1:1000". Consequently, "amblyopic children who have vision of 20/50 or worse need to wear proper protective eyewear full time, even if they do not benefit from optical correction".

### Unilateral acute idiopathic maculopathy. 1991 [^114rgtxR]. Retina (2012). Low credibility.

This is a report of nine patients who experienced sudden, severe, unilateral central vision loss following a flulike illness. Each patient had an exudative detachment of the macula. All patients experienced a spontaneous resolution of the acute macular manifestations with near-complete recovery of vision. A characteristic "bull's-eye" appearance in the macula persisted. The acute manifestations of the disorder did not recur in any of the patients during the period of follow-up. The constellation of findings was suggestive of an inflammatory disease of the retinal pigment epithelium, but a specific causative agent could not be identified. The acute clinical and angiographic features, the natural course, and the residual pigment epithelial derangement were not consistent with any previously described disorder.

### Amblyopia preferred practice pattern [^115AS9JN]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Amblyopia — diagnostic criteria require detection of a visual acuity (VA) deficit and identification of the likely cause. Unilateral findings include asymmetric objection to monocular occlusion, failure to initiate or maintain fixation or strong preference for one eye, preferential looking with an interocular difference of two or more octaves, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) interocular difference of two or more lines with the better eye within the normal range. Bilateral amblyopia is defined by BCVA in each eye of VA worse than 20/50 in both eyes at age 3 to < 4 years, VA worse than 20/40 in both eyes at age 4 to < 5 years, or VA worse than 20/30 in both eyes at age ≥ 5. A unilateral or bilateral amblyogenic factor needs to be present along with the corresponding VA deficit, and in cases of bilateral amblyopia the visual acuity may not be symmetrical.

Case presentation

A 40-year-old, healthy man was referred to our clinic with acute painful visual loss in the right eye for 2 weeks. He suddenly developed acute blurriness in the right eye 2 weeks prior. He developed retrobulbar pain at the same time, which worsened on ocular movement. Over the course of 2 weeks, the blurriness in the right eye worsened. He did not experience any visual discomfort before the recent onset of unilateral vision loss. The patient had no significant social, past medical, past surgical, or trauma history. There was no current medication. He had one maternal uncle who was nearly blind in both eyes (unknown cause) and passed away. He also had a nephew (son of his younger brother) who had strabismus and decreased vision in one eye. A review of systems revealed no other symptoms except progressive visual loss with ocular pain. Upon ocular examination, visual acuity registered 20/40 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. The Ishihara colour test score was 8/14 in the right eye and 12/14 in the left eye. The right pupil reacted slowly and weakly and the left pupil reacted normally to direct light. There was a relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. The ocular motility examination was normal. The anterior segments were normal. On fundus examination, there was optic disc swelling in the right eye with no abnormality in the left eye (Fig. 1 -a). A visual field test showed there was a generalized visual field defect in the right eye and superotemporal visual field defect in the left eye (Fig. 2 -a). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed definite enhancement of the right optic nerve, consistent with optic neuritis. The optic nerve of the left eye showed normal MRI findings from the optic nerve head to the chiasm. No periventricular white matter lesion or brain parenchymal lesion was found (Fig. 3). He was given 1 g of intravenous methylprednisolone daily for three days. His ocular pain resolved, and visual acuity improved to 20/20 within 2 weeks after the steroid pulse treatment (Fig. 2 -b).

### Impact of unilateral and bilateral vision loss on quality of life [^113cRsVS]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate whether unilateral vision loss reduced any aspects of quality of life in comparison with normal vision and to compare its impact with that of bilateral vision loss.

Methods

This study used cluster stratified random sample of 3271 urban participants recruited between 1992 and 1994 for the Melbourne Visual Impairment Project. All predictors and outcomes were from the 5 year follow up examinations conducted in 1997–9.

Results

There were 2530 participants who attended the follow up survey and had measurement of presenting visual acuity. Both unilateral and bilateral vision loss were significantly associated with increased odds of having problems in visual functions including reading the telephone book, newspaper, watching television, and seeing faces. Non-correctable by refraction unilateral vision loss increased the odds of falling when away from home (OR = 2.86, 95% CI 1.16 to 7.08), getting help with chores (OR = 3.09, 95% CI 1.40 to 6.83), and becoming dependent (getting help with meals and chores) (OR = 7.50, 95% CI 1.97 to 28.6). Non-correctable bilateral visual loss was associated with many activities of daily living except falling.

Conclusions

Non-correctable unilateral vision loss was associated with issues of safety and independent living while non-correctable bilateral vision loss was associated with nursing home placement, emotional wellbeing, use of community services, and activities of daily living. Correctable or treatable vision loss should be detected and attended to.

### Vigabatrin (vigabatrin for oral solution) [^117UN2E1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Permanent Vision Loss

Vigabatrin can cause permanent vision loss. Because of this risk and because, when it is effective, vigabatrin provides an observable symptomatic benefit; patient response and continued need for treatment should be periodically assessed.

Based upon adult studies, 30 percent or more of patients can be affected with bilateral concentric visual field constriction ranging in severity from mild to severe. Severe cases may be characterized by tunnel vision to within 10 degrees of visual fixation, which can result in disability. In some cases, vigabatrin also can damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity. Symptoms of vision loss from vigabatrin are unlikely to be recognized by patients or caregivers before vision loss is severe. Vision loss of milder severity, while often unrecognized by the patient or caregiver, can still adversely affect function.

Because assessing vision may be difficult in infants and children, the frequency and extent of vision loss is poorly characterized in these patients. For this reason, the understanding of the risk is primarily based on the adult experience. The possibility that vision loss from vigabatrin may be more common, more severe, or have more severe functional consequences in infants and children than in adults cannot be excluded.

The onset of vision loss from vigabatrin is unpredictable, and can occur within weeks of starting treatment or sooner, or at any time after starting treatment, even after months or years.

### Comprehensive pediatric eye and vision examination [^112Gvuvw]. AOA (2017). Medium credibility.

Amblyopia — etiology, treatability, and prevalence are summarized as follows: Amblyopia is the leading cause of monocular vision loss in children and is generally attributable to strabismus, anisometropia, combined strabismus and anisometropia, or form deprivation (e.g., media opacity). Unilateral amblyopia is commonly associated with constant unilateral strabismus and/or amblyogenic anisometropia, while bilateral amblyopia usually results from high bilateral refractive error or bilateral form deprivation. Although amblyopia is a treatable condition in both children and adults, the end result is better when diagnosed and treated early, and the prevalence of amblyopia in the general population is believed to be between 2% and 2.5%.

### The evaluation of acute vision loss: central serous chorioretinopathy [^113TwyPL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Acute vision loss is frightening to patients and may represent serious pathology that is irreversible if not intervened upon quickly. We present a case of a 36-year-old man with sudden onset of unilateral painless central visual disturbance described as flashes of light. His emergency department examination was normal, and an ophthalmologic consult found fluid accumulation in the subretinal space on optical coherence tomography, confirming a diagnosis of central serous chorioretinopathy. Central serous chorioretinopathy is a poorly understood disease associated with type A personality and elevated glucocorticoids. Although there is no proven treatment regimen for acute disease, vision problems usually resolve. Some patients have recurrent episodes that can lead to permanent visual loss

### Unilateral acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE) with delayed contralateral eye involvement [^115NUwam]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This patient's acute onset blurry vision, photopsias, and peripheral distortion in the setting of macular placoid lesions is most consistent with APMPPE, an inflammatory chorioretinopathy. Patients often present with acute vision loss that may be associated with central or paracentral scotomas, photopsias, and/or metamorphopsia. Atypical APMPPE is likely in this patient who had unilateral involvement and contralateral vision symptoms occurring > 6 months later, with subretinal fluid and papillitis that improved with steroid treatment. Her first and second presentations were preceded by a viral prodrome and influenza vaccination, respectively, both of which have been associated with APMPPE. Coxsackievirus B4 and Adenovirus type 5 have been implicated. FA and ICGA imaging showed staining patterns characteristic of APMPPE. Choriocapillaris hypoperfusion secondary to inflammation has been hypothesized to cause the early phase pattern, while late hyperfluorescence may be due to vascular leakage. Hypofluorescence on ICGA also reflects choriocapillaris hypoperfusion, supporting APMPPE as a primary choroidal vasculitis with secondary involvement of the RPE.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® vision loss [^116MnGi6]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vision loss is a common medical problem that can arise secondary to a variety of pathologies including trauma, ischemia, infection or inflammation, demyelination, and mass lesions anywhere along the visual pathway. Most nontraumatic pathology to the globe is diagnosed by ophthalmologic examination and does not require imaging. When needed, the choice of imaging study is directed at the known or suspected cause and the expected anatomic location of the insult along the visual pathway. This document focuses on the appropriateness of imaging in adults where vision loss is the primary presenting symptom. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Transient monocular blindness associated with hemiplegia… [^111tkH5m]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

INTRODUCTION TEMPORARY obscuration of vision, unilateral or bilateral is not uncommon, especially if under that heading one includes the transient amaurosis associated with spasm of accommodation, glaucoma, and hysteria. The visual disturbance accompanying migraine is another common example. Rarer causes of intermittent blindness include eclampsia, lead poisoning, ergot poisoning, malaria, quinine and tobacco intoxication, polycythaemia rubra vera, and paroxysmal hemoglobinuria. Circulatory deficiency in the territory of the basilar and posterior cerebral arteries may also occasion transient disturbances in vision. The bizarre, rapidly changing field defects complained of in the presence of papilledema, particularly when it is due to intracranial venous thrombosis, are less well known.

In addition to the above types, however, there is a fairly large number of cases of periodic blindness in which the principal derangement is an interruption of the retinal blood flow, usually of one eye only. It is this group of cases which is under. FISHER M. TRANSIENT MONOCULAR BLINDNESS ASSOCIATED WITH HEMIPLEGIA. AMA Arch Ophthalmol. 1952; 47: 167–203.

### Delay in presentation to hospital for childhood cataract surgery in India [^1149JBJU]. Eye (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cataract is an avoidable cause of childhood vision impairment and blindness. Globally it is responsible for 5–20% of blindness in children and is a priority for the VISION 2020: Right to Sight Initiative. A recent systematic review on the global burden of childhood cataract reported prevalence estimates ranging from 0.32 to 22.9 per 10000 children. Although a treatable condition, previous research from India indicates that about half of the children in schools for the blind suffer from potentially preventable and/or treatable conditions with cataract being one of the leading causes.

Cataract in early childhood can be clinically classified as either congenital or developmental the former deemed to have greater impact on vision. This categorization is widely applied but is imprecise and unsatisfactory since it is almost impossible to know the age of onset of childhood cataract with most occurring during fetal life, while in many cases the cataract becomes apparent later in childhood with the precise age of onset remaining unknown. However, these terms are used in many countries to provide a clinical dichotomous indication of impact on vision, and are used as such here.

The developing visual system requires appropriate visual experience during infancy and early childhood. If compromised by cataract, bilateral or unilateral form deprivation amblyopia results which affects the child's educational and psychosocial development. Thus, while treatment of adult cataract is effective for visual rehabilitation at any age, a visually significant cataract that occurs in infancy and early childhood must be treated as early as possible, and requires long-term follow-up. In particular, unilateral visual deprivation in infancy results in more severe visual acuity deficits than bilateral deprivation, and this is related to the fact that in the unilateral condition visual development of the affected eye occurs in competition with an unaffected eye.

The time at which treatment of congenital cataract is most effective is within the first six to eight weeks after birth for unilateral cases, and within the first 14 weeks, for bilateral cases. Previous reports suggest that late diagnosis limits the scope for successful outcomes.

### Unilateral multifocal choroiditis following EBV-positive mononucleosis responsive to immunosuppression: a case report [^112JL1oX]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

There is considerable value of titrating immunosuppression to the disease activity as evidenced by the reduced number of lesions along with improvement in vision with azathioprine immunosuppression. In fact, our patient demonstrated test-retest reliability when she self-discontinued the medicine (Figs. 8 and 9) This suggests that adequate immunosuppression may be causally responsible for her improvement and potentially the reason why her condition remained unilateral. Taken together, these findings argue that MFC progression and visual potential can be optimized through aggressive immunosuppression.

In summary, we present a completely unilateral case of MFC temporally correlated with EBV infection that demonstrated a dramatic improvement in vision and lack of involvement of the fellow eye with aggressive immunosuppression.

### Iridocorneal endothelial syndrome presenting with large diurnal intraocular pressure fluctuation [^114BakV4]. Journal of Glaucoma (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of The Study

The purpose of the study was to report a case of iridocorneal endothelial syndrome with an initial presentation of a large diurnal fluctuation of intraocular pressure (IOP) which peaked early in the morning.

Methods

A 31-year-old white man had transient blurry vision oculus sinister (OS) upon awakening in the morning for the past 2 months. The blurry vision improved within 1 to 2 hours. Clinical examination, diurnal IOP measurements, and specular microscopy were performed to investigate the cause of his transient blurry vision.

Results

At 6 AM, IOP OS was 38 mm Hg with corneal edema and visual acuity of 20/30. At 8 AM, IOP OS decreased to 25 mm Hg with clear cornea and visual acuity of 20/20. Diurnal IOP measurements revealed a large fluctuation OS (18 mm Hg). Specular microscopy revealed pleomorphism, polymegathism, light peripheral borders and light/dark reversal of the corneal endothelium OS. IOP oculus dexter remained within normal limits with clear cornea and stable visual acuity throughout the diurnal measurements.

Conclusions

In patients with consistent daily episodes of transient blurry vision, clinicians should suspect a large diurnal IOP fluctuation with high peak IOP. If symptoms and signs are unilateral, iridocorneal endothelial syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis and corneal specular microscopy should be obtained.

### Vision and vision-related outcome measures in multiple sclerosis [^115yr6k8]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Retinal findings and other afferent visual manifestations of multiple sclerosis

Some patients with previous optic neuritis or multiple sclerosis experience transient visual blurring associated with increase in body temperature with exercise, a hot bath, or fever — so-called Uhthoff phenomenon. This symptom is caused by a temporary impairment of conduction by demyelinated axons in the afferent visual pathway. A similar phenomenon can affect other sensory and motor pathways.

Despite recovery of static measures of visual function, there may be impaired motion perception following optic neuritis — clinically known as the Pulfrich phenomenon. This symptom has been related to a sustained deficit in functional MRI during tasks that require motion perception. Development of a delayed latency VEP response in the clinically unaffected fellow eye following optic neuritis is associated with improvement in time-constrained binocular perception (, suggesting an adaptive cortical response to improve synchronicity of input and, thereby, aid binocular vision. Binocular inhibition, the reduction in binocular vision compared to the better eye alone, has been observed in patients with multiple sclerosis and a history of acute unilateral optic neuritis.

Abnormalities of the retinal layers other than the RNFL have been observed in post-mortem specimens from patients with multiple sclerosis, where 79% of eyes exhibited ganglion cell loss and 40% showed amacrine and bipolar cell loss in the inner nuclear layer. These findings have been corroborated in vivo by OCT, demonstrating thinning of the GCL + IPL, and associated with reductions in visual function and vision-specific quality of life. These retinal findings demonstrated by OCT also correlate with more general clinical and imaging measures of multiple sclerosis disease activity and severity.

About 5% of patients with early multiple sclerosis have evidence of microcystic macular oedema or thickening of the inner nuclear layer on OCT. Microcystic macular oedema and inner nuclear layer thickening also occur in other inflammatory disorders associated with optic neuritis and do not appear merely to be due to vitreous traction. In multiple sclerosis, the presence of microcystic macular oedema and inner nuclear layer thickening are associated with increased inflammatory disease activity, including gadolinium-enhancing lesions and new T 2 lesions on brain MRI. Because the retinal layers do not contain myelin, these observations suggest the inflammatory process in multiple sclerosis is not limited to myelinated CNS structures. However, the occurrence of microcystic macular oedema in non-inflammatory optic neuropathies indicates other mechanisms also may be involved.

### Ultrasound-assisted diagnosis of optic neuritis in the emergency department: a case report [^111mSZ9r]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Optic neuritis is a common cause of subacute unilateral vision loss, occurring in 1–5 per 100,000 persons per year. It is more common in Caucasians, women, and those from countries with northern latitudes. Those aged 20–49 years are at greatest risk. The condition arises due to inflammation of the optic nerve. Inflammation may occur due to systemic inflammatory disorders, most commonly multiple sclerosis.

Case Report

A 21-year-old African-American male presented to our emergency department with a complaint of painful unilateral vision loss. On examination he was found to have a relative afferent pupillary defect and red desaturation. A bedside ultrasound suggested pseudopapilledema suggestive of optic neuritis. He was admitted to Neurology for confirmation of and treatment for optic neuritis. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed optic neuritis. The patient was treated with i.v. steroids and discharged after improvement in visual function. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Optic neuritis is a clinical diagnosis. The subtle historical components and examination findings make it a diagnostic challenge for the busy emergency physician. Early diagnosis may improve visual outcomes. Discovery of pseudopapilledema on bedside ultrasound may be seen in optic neuritis, and is another finding that emergency physicians may assess for in patient presenting with unilateral vision loss.

### Ocular Lyme borreliosis as a rare presentation of unilateral vision loss [^115Eu74K]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Ocular Lyme borreliosis is a rare manifestation of Lyme disease. We describe a case of an 80-year-old woman who presented with a 1-month history of unilateral painless central vision loss. Based on a temporal artery biopsy, she was initially diagnosed with giant cell arteritis and treated with a 3-day course of high-dose intravenous steroids. A more detailed history uncovered multiple previous treatments for Lyme disease and residence in an endemic Lyme area. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with ocular Lyme borreliosis and treated with intravenous antibiotics. After 5weeks of treatment, unilateral vision loss did not progress and optic disc oedema resolved.

### The swollen optic nerve: an approach to diagnosis and management [^112xaNFv]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis of swollen optic nerves differs according to whether the swelling is unilateral or bilateral, or whether visual function is normal or affected. Patients with a unilaterally swollen optic nerve and normal visual function most likely have optic nerve head drusen. Patients with abnormal visual function most likely have demyelinating optic neuritis or non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy. Patients with bilaterally swollen optic nerve heads and normal visual function most likely have papilloedema, and require neuroimaging followed by lumbar puncture. However, if their visual function is affected, the most likely causes are bilateral demyelinating optic neuritis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein optic neuritis: these patients require investigating with contrast-enhanced MRI of the orbits.

### Choroidal effusion after initiation of topical dorzolamide treatment [^116Q9Hrr]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We report a case of unilateral serous choroidal effusion in a patient without prior glaucoma surgeries that developed within 1week of starting topical dorzolamide. A Caucasian female in her 60s with a history of severe primary open-angle glaucoma in the left eye without prior glaucoma surgeries developed irritation and subsequently blurry vision in her left eye within 1week of starting topical dorzolamide 2% in the left eye only. Funduscopic exam and B-scan ultrasound demonstrated a serous choroidal effusion in the nasal and temporal periphery. After discontinuing dorzolamide and initiating prednisolone and cycloplegic agents, the choroidal effusions fully resolved after 2 weeks, and vision returned to baseline. Choroidal effusion can occur as a result of an idiosyncratic reaction to topical dorzolamide even in patients without prior glaucoma surgeries. Immediate cessation of dorzolamide and treatment with steroid and cycloplegic agents result in good vision recovery for dorzolamide-induced choroidal effusion.

### Amantadine [^116x9Hgu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CNS Effects

Patients with a history of epilepsy or other "seizures" should be observed closely for possible increased seizure activity.

Patients receiving amantadine hydrochloride tablets who note central nervous system effects or blurring of vision should be cautioned against driving or working in situations where alertness and adequate motor coordination are important.

Other

Patients with a history of congestive heart failure or peripheral edema should be followed closely as there are patients who developed congestive heart failure while receiving amantadine hydrochloride tablets.

Patients with Parkinson's disease improving on amantadine hydrochloride tablets should resume normal activities gradually and cautiously, consistent with other medical considerations, such as the presence of osteoporosis or phlebothrombosis.

Because amantadine hydrochloride tablets have anticholinergic effects and may cause mydriasis, it should not be given to patients with untreated angle closure glaucoma.

Corneal Edema

Corneal edema has been reported in patients taking amantadine. Symptoms include sudden onset of blurry vision, or progressive vision loss, with or without eye pain. Corneal involvement is usually bilateral. Onset can occur from a few weeks to several years after starting amantadine. Resolution of symptoms typically begins within weeks of amantadine cessation. However, corneal grafts have been required in some patients when the condition is not recognized. Permanent damage can occur if amantadine is continued. Ask patients if their vision has changed and obtain ophthalmologic examinations to rule out corneal edema should vision changes occur after initiation of therapy with amantadine. If corneal edema occurs, taper and discontinue amantadine [see Dosage and Administration].

Point-of-care ocular ultrasound can provide the clinician with more information about potential intraorbital and extraocular pathology, especially in cases when direct visualization of the eye is limited. This case report describes the findings in a pediatric patient who presented with a 1-month history of eye injection and worsening blurry vision. After point-of-care ultrasound demonstrated abnormal debris in the posterior vitreous cavity, subsequent evaluation revealed a diagnosis of pars planitis.

### Adie's tonic pupil presenting with unilateral photophobia successfully treated with dilute pilocarpine [^115CV8CX]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 40-year-old healthy man presented with a 4-month history of photophobia, blurred vision and a right dilated pupil. Examination revealed a right pupil that was not reactive to light but constricted strongly to a near target and slowly redilated when he looked back in the distance. Pharmacological testing with dilute pilocarpine 0.1% resulted in constriction of the right pupil but no change in the left pupil. This also resulted in resolution of his photophobia and blurry vision. Neurological examination was otherwise normal, and a diagnosis of Adie's tonic pupil was made. The main differential diagnosis to consider for a large pupil is a third nerve palsy, pharmacological mydriasis, tonic pupil and local iris processes, such as iris sphincter tears from trauma. Knowledge of the key features of these conditions can avoid wasted resources from unnecessary testing. Dilute pilocarpine 0.1% three times a day can be considered as a pharmacological therapy for symptomatic relief.

### Blind drunk [^111T5fVL]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Purtscher's retinopathy is a haemorrhagic and vaso-occlusive retinal vasculopathy, caused by microembolisation occluding retinal and choroidal arterioles. This leads to retinal haemorrhages and ischaemia. The usual cause is severe trauma. 1 However, a variety of conditions including acute pancreatitis, childbirth, long bone fracture, chest trauma and systemic inflammatory vasculitides may cause similar retinal presentations. 1–4 This highlights Purtscher's retinopathy as a clinically important differential diagnosis of visual loss. We present a case report of a 43-year-old man who was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. While in hospital he developed sudden onset unilateral loss of vision. This case highlights the need to ensure prompt diagnosis and initiation of appropriate multidisciplinary management.

### Progression of retinal pigmentation mimicking unilateral retinitis pigmentosa after bilateral pars planitis: a case report [^116cUm31]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

To report our findings in a young patient with unilateral retinitis pigmentosa (RP)-like appearance who developed pigmentary changes in his left retina after an episode of bilateral pars planitis.

Case Presentation

A 17-year-old man presented with 6 months of blurry vision in both eyes. He was diagnosed with bilateral pars planitis. Progressive, intraretinal bone crepuscule pigmentation developed in his left retina during the following three months. An electroretinogram showed subnormal response only in the left eye, suggesting the diagnosis of unilateral pseudoRP.

Conclusion

An inflammatory disease like pars planitis can accelerate the pigmentation of the retina and mimic a RP in young patients. Causes of pseudoRP may be considered, especially in those rare cases with unilateral affection.

### Update on the evaluation of transient vision loss [^116SLQEF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Transient vision loss may indicate underlying vascular disease, including carotid occlusion and thromboembolism, or it may have a more benign etiology, such as migraine or vasospasm. This review focuses on the differential diagnosis and workup of patients presenting with transient vision loss, focusing on several key areas: the relationship to thromboembolic vascular disease, hypercoagulable testing, retinal migraine, and bilateral vision loss. The objective is to provide the ophthalmologist with information on how to best manage these patients. Thromboembolic etiologies for transient vision loss are sometimes managed with medications, but when carotid surgery is indicated, earlier intervention may prevent future stroke. This need for early treatment places the ophthalmologist in the important role of expediting the management process. Hospital admission is recommended in patients presenting with transient symptoms within 72 hours who meet certain high-risk criteria. When the cause is giant cell arteritis, ocular ischemic syndrome, or a cardioembolic source, early management of the underlying condition is equally important. For nonthromboembolic causes of transient vision loss such as retinal migraine or retinal vasospasm, the ophthalmologist can provide reassurance as well as potentially give medications to decrease the frequency of vision loss episodes.

### How do I manage functional visual loss [^113ABBN1]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

b Prisms can be used in several ways to assess for functional vision loss in monocular cases. In severe monocular functional visual loss, a 10-dioptre vertical prism test can be used to displace an image vertically towards the apex of the prism, thus leading to recognition of diplopia. Even if the patient denies experiencing diplopia, the diplopic images are difficult to ignore or 'suppress' and the patient can often be observed looking from one image to the other where visual acuity is near equal. Similarly, a prism reflex test, typically with a 20-dioptre horizontal prism, can be used in an adult patient to induce a motor fusion response. The prism is placed base out before one eye whilst the patient fixes on a near target. This induces diplopia and the eye behind the prism adducts towards the apex of the prism to move the prismatic image to the fovea. The fellow eye will make a corresponding abduction but due to ongoing diplopia it will make a positive fusional adduction after a second or so to restore binocular single vision. This fusional movement confirms the patient has binocular vision even if they don't report experiencing diplopia - only patients with severe unilateral visual loss will not overcome the prism and therefore not make the second fusional movement. In unilateral cases with less severe impairment the similar monocular vertical prism dissociation test using a 4-dioptre vertical prism can be used over to induce vertical diplopia whilst fixating on a high acuity target (eg single 6/6 Snellen optotype at distance). This relies on the patient reporting they observe diplopia and if so to compare the sharpness of the two letters. If they are reported as similar, then this confirms good acuity in both eyes.

### The spectrum of giant cell arteritis through a rheumatology lens [^112LhweC]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Treating new-onset GCA

Rheumatologists are often involved in making treatment decisions in patients with new-onset GCA. "High-dose" glucocorticoid therapy is needed, but how high exactly? There has never been a clinical trial on this. Some ophthalmology departments use the same starting dose for all GCA patients, but in rheumatology practice it is recognised that most patients with cranial GCA respond symptomatically to 40–60 mg oral prednisolone; a higher dose within this range is generally preferred if there are ischaemic visual manifestations or jaw/tongue claudication. Body weight and comorbidities are also taken into account. All these together are sometimes called patient "phenotype". For GCA with threatened visual loss, intravenous glucocorticoids are sometimes preferred (see below).

Relevance of ischaemic visual features

Preventing visual loss, which includes "protecting the second eye" if monocular visual loss has already occurred — is a fundamental tenet of early treatment of GCA. When GCA is strongly suspected, therefore, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy is started as soon as possible. Because of general adherence to this tenet, the counterfactual (what would have happened if glucocorticoids were deferred?) has remarkably little data to inform it, and the literature that exists is easy to misinterpret.

According to a literature review published in 2005, in the era before glucocorticoid therapy was available (before 1950), on average 49.9% of patients with GCA had some degree of vision loss, including partial visual loss, and 17.6% had bilateral blindness; once one eye was involved, 34% of patients developed complete visual loss. After glucocorticoid treatment became available, visual loss was reported in 29.2% and bilateral blindness in 5.8%. Only 3.3% developed visual loss that begun after glucocorticoid had been started. The authors noted higher rates of visual loss in reports from ophthalmology clinics than from rheumatology clinics. GCA patients presenting with a history of transient ischaemic visual symptoms are at higher risk of future visual loss; and GCA patients presenting with unilateral visual loss are at highest risk of progressing to bilateral visual loss.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaOrbits vision and visual loss [^1118hfof]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Visual loss can be the result of an abnormality anywhere along the visual pathway including the globe, optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tract, thalamus, optic radiations or primary visual cortex. Appropriate imaging analysis of visual loss is facilitated by a compartmental approach that establishes a differential diagnosis on the basis of suspected lesion location and specific clinical features. CT and MRI are the primary imaging modalities used to evaluate patients with visual loss and are often complementary in evaluating these patients. One modality may be preferred over the other depending on the specific clinical scenario. Depending on the pattern of visual loss and differential diagnosis, imaging coverage may require targeted evaluation of the orbits and/or assessment of the brain. Contrast is preferred when masses and inflammatory processes are differential considerations. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Brimonidine allergy presenting as vernal-like keratoconjunctivitis [^114qrrUP]. Journal of Glaucoma (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a brimonidone-induced allergic reaction that mimicked a limbal form of vernal keratoconjunctivitis in the setting of background ocular surface toxicity.

Patients and Methods

A 78-year-old male with a history of primary open angle glaucoma presented with symptoms of unilateral blurry vision, irritation, and redness shortly after starting brimonidine exclusively in the right eye. Examination revealed injected palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, diffuse punctate epithelial erosion and discrete, non-staining corneal limbal infiltrates superiorly.

Results

Given the unilateral presentation, the patient was diagnosed with an allergic limbal keratoconjunctivitis secondary to bromonidine. Shortly after discontinuing the brimonidine, there was full resolution of the corneal limbal infiltrates. The punctate epithelial erosions and tear film abnormalities remained.

Conclusion

Direct medication allergy and ocular surface disease are two distinct entities that often co-exist. Distinguishing between the two entities, sometimes by trial and error, is critical in the management of these patients.

### Bilateral internal carotid artery dissection in the postpartum period [^1175zojo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Bilateral internal carotid artery dissection is a rare event associated with pregnancy, especially in a patient without any predisposing risk factors.

Case

A 34-year-old woman presented with postpartum unilateral weakness, headaches, and blurry vision 14 days after vaginal delivery. Radiologic imaging revealed bilateral cervical internal carotid artery dissections and cerebral infarctions. She was treated with anticoagulation and showed radiographic and clinical improvement.

Conclusion

The pathophysiology of cervical artery dissection appears multifactorial, with evidence suggesting environmental and genetic contributions. Intimal injury related to the Valsalva maneuver during labor as well as hemodynamic and hormonal changes related to pregnancy are presumed causes of peripartum spontaneous carotid artery dissection. Antithrombotic therapy for at least 3 to 6 months after dissection and follow-up neuroimaging are suggested.

### Consensus disease definitions for ophthalmic immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors [^112itpGF]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Immune-related arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy

Common: Vasculitis is a rare complication of checkpoint inhibitors, but if present, mostly involves large vessels in the form of GCA or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Patients are typically over 50 years old and women are at higher risk. The resulting AAION typically presents with precipitous or sometimes stuttering vision loss that can be either unilateral or bilateral. In the setting of arteritis, visual symptoms are commonly accompanied by manifestations of cranial hypoperfusion such as headache, jaw claudication, or scalp tenderness as well as systemic symptoms such as fatigue, fevers, or myalgias. Signs of optic neuropathy should be present, such as diminished visual acuity, dyschromatopsia, an afferent pupillary defect, and VF defects. The optic disc is typically swollen but can occasionally be normal in posterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Choroidal hypoperfusion on FFA is suggestive of vasculitis and inflammatory markers including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are commonly elevated but can occasionally be normal. A definite diagnosis can be ascertained through temporal artery biopsy, but diagnostic yield is dependent on the timing, length, and quality of the biopsy. In older patients with typical symptoms and elevated ESR and CRP, the diagnosis is probable and should trigger urgent treatment (online supplemental table 4).

Treatment in acute settings is high dose (1000 mg) IVMP for 3–5 days followed by a very slow oral corticosteroid taper. Subtypes, evaluations, and definitions for AAION are in online supplemental table 4. Given the potential for sudden severe complications of vasculitis, strong consideration should be given to holding ICI treatment.

Possible: On examination, there may be retinal ischemic manifestations. Arteritis may also involve efferent pathways and cause diplopia. Other diagnostic modalities can be helpful in difficult cases such as temporal artery ultrasound, cranial MRI with post-contrast vessel wall imaging of the extracranial circulation, and a vasculitis protocol positron emission tomography-CT of the body. Analogous to spontaneously occurring GCA, treatment with tocilizumab can be considered to avoid adverse effects of long-term corticosteroid use.

### Comprehensive adult eye and vision examination [^117QK6ky]. AOA (2023). High credibility.

Background — United States vision loss burden and projections include 2015 estimates of "1.02 million" legally blind individuals (best-corrected visual acuity of "20/200 or less" in the better-seeing eye) and "approximately 3.22 million" with visual impairment (best-corrected visual acuity "less than 20/40" in the better-seeing eye), with "up to 8.2 million" having reduced vision due to uncorrected refractive errors; by 2050, counts are projected to double to "approximately 2.01 million" with legal blindness, "6.95 million" with visual impairment, and "16.4 million" with reduced vision due to uncorrected refractive errors. The document notes that "Visual impairment increases with age among all racial and ethnic groups", and the elderly population "(65 years and older)… was approximately 56 million in 2020" and is estimated to reach "nearly 86 million by 2050". It further states that "at least 40 percent of vision loss in the United States is either preventable or treatable with timely intervention".

### An update on optic neuritis [^114RTvRq]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Optic neuritis (ON) is the most common cause of subacute optic neuropathy in young adults. Although most cases of optic neuritis (ON) are classified as typical, meaning idiopathic or associated with multiple sclerosis, there is a growing understanding of atypical forms of optic neuritis such as antibody mediated aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and the recently described entity, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated disease (MOGAD). Differentiating typical ON from atypical ON is important because they have different prognoses and treatments. Findings of atypical ON, including severe vision loss with poor recovery with steroids or steroid dependence, prominent optic disc edema, bilateral vision loss, and childhood or late adult onset, should prompt serologic testing for AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG. Although the traditional division of typical and atypical ON can be helpful, it should be noted that there can be severe presentations of otherwise typical ON and mild presentations of atypical ON that blur these traditional lines. Rare causes of autoimmune optic neuropathies, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and collapsin response-mediator protein 5 (CRMP5) autoimmunity also should be considered in patients with bilateral painless optic neuropathy associated with optic disc edema, especially if there are other accompanying suggestive neurologic symptoms/signs. Typical ON usually recovers well without treatment, though recovery may be expedited by steroids. Atypical ON is usually treated with intravenous steroids, and some forms, such as NMOSD, often require plasma exchange for acute attacks and long-term immunosuppressive therapy to prevent relapses. Since treatment is tailored to the cause of the ON, elucidating the etiology of the ON is of the utmost importance.

### Does blindness affect ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials? [^112qN69w]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of blindness on ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMP) responses.

Methods

Thirty-one subjects with unilateral blindness (UB group) and 25 age and sex-matched healthy subjects (control group) were recruited for the present study. The oVEMP responses including latency, amplitude and amplitude asymmetry ratio (AR) were measured and compared between the blind side, the contralateral eye of the UB group and the control subjects.

Results

Ocular VEMP recordings were obtained from 29 of 31 patients (93.5%) for the blind side of the UB group. There was no significant difference in terms of latency, amplitude and AR value between the blind side and the contralateral eye of the UB group and the control subjects.

Conclusion

Clear oVEMP recordings can be elicited as long as the eyeball and extraocular muscles are preserved in a blind eye.

### Features and risk factors for new (secondary) permanent visual involvement in giant cell arteritis [^115xP3pf]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

New permanent visual loss (PVL) in treated patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a rare but worrisome occurrence. In this study, we aimed to describe the frequency and main features of new PVL occurring after the beginning of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with newly diagnosed GCA.

Methods

We included in an inception cohort all consecutive patients newly diagnosed with GCA in the internal medicine department of a tertiary-care hospital between 1976 and May 2020. The study population comprised all the patients without bilateral PVL before treatment who were followed for at least one year. Only well-documented visual events that set after the initiation of glucocorticoid treatment were regarded as new PVL.

Results

Eleven out of 502 patients (2.2%) experienced a new PVL including 6 occurrences during the initial therapeutic phase and 5 during the tapering phase. Patients with new PVL during treatment had higher mean age, more often displayed temporal artery abnormalities on physical examination, and had higher mean platelet counts at GCA onset. There was a strong excess risk of contralateral recurrence during treatment in patients with unilateral loss at GCA onset compared with patients with uncomplicated GCA (10.5% vs 1.1%, OR = 10.26, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

New PVL in treated GCA is a rare, but significant occurrence. Older patients and patients who already had unilateral PVL at diagnosis have higher risk of new ischaemic visual loss during treatment compared to the other patients. Close clinical, laboratory, and eye monitoring of these high-risk patients is of paramount importance.

### Complete unilateral vision loss and optic nerve cupping from metastatic prostate cancer to the optic canal [^112UPyMp]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 71-year-old man, living with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer to the lymph nodes, spine and skull, presented with acute on chronic left eye vision loss. Examination revealed no-light-perception vision, a relative afferent pupillary defect and optic disc cupping. MRI brain revealed optic canal narrowing from metastatic sphenoid bone expansion and extraosseous tumour compressing the intracanalicular optic nerve. The optic disc cupping and excavation without significant pallor of the remaining neuroretinal rim was likely secondary to chronic compression of the optic nerve. The patient was treated with radiation therapy, but did not regain vision and was referred to palliative care as his condition continued to worsen. As patients live longer with advanced cancer, there is a greater risk of metastasis to atypical areas of the body including the optic nerve. This case demonstrates the unique combination of optic disc cupping from optic canal metastasis due to prostate cancer.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management and rehabilitation of post-acute mild traumatic brain injury [^114eSxzc]. DoD/VA (2021). High credibility.

Visual symptoms — background and urgent referral: Vision symptoms, including sensitivity to light, eye fatigue, difficulty focusing, and blurry vision occur acutely in some individuals who sustain mTBI, and most vision symptoms resolve within minutes or hours; however, for those with persistent difficulties, targeted assessments to guide symptom management during the first few weeks after mTBI are most effective. PCPs need to be aware of reasons for an urgent referral to an eye care provider, including vision loss or decline, diplopia, abnormal pupils, abnormal external eye exam, abnormal visual behavior, abnormal eye movements, or acute ocular symptoms; if visual symptoms persist and impact daily function, providers should refer patients to optometry, ophthalmology, neuro-ophthalmology, neurology, and/or vision rehabilitation team. Higher-order cognitive symptoms may be mistaken for ocular or vision issues, and occupational therapy vision assessment or behavioral neurology assessment may be very helpful in ruling out these symptoms.

### Primary angle-closure disease preferred practice pattern ® [^1125PxVE]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary angle-closure disease natural history — glaucomatous optic neuropathy can develop rapidly if patients with high intraocular pressure (IOP) from unilateral AACC do not receive treatment, and untreated fellow phakic eyes are at increased risk for developing acute angle closure. Following AACC, the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness increases in the first few days, returns to an average thickness at approximately 1 month, and develops decreased thickness at 3 months. In one study examining patients for 4 to 10 years following an AACC event, 18% of eyes were blind, of which 50% were blind from glaucoma. Fifty-eight percent of eyes had visual acuity worse than 20/40. Thus, AACC (and subsequent PACG) creates significant visual morbidity with progressive vision loss that may result in unilateral and bilateral blindness.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^115KjGH1]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to follow-up (after treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that for patients with unilateral disease, the fellow eye without MNV remains at high risk of developing advanced AMD. The risk can be lowered by as much as 36% over a 10-year period by taking the AREDS/AREDS2 supplements. Patients should be instructed to monitor their vision and to return to the ophthalmologist periodically, even in the absence of symptoms, but promptly after the onset of any new or significant visual symptoms. Patients at exceptionally high risk (e.g., those who have advanced AMD in one eye and large drusen with RPE changes in the fellow eye) may be examined more frequently (i.e., every 6–12 months) in an effort to detect asymptomatic MNV at a treatable stage. Since some patients with AMD also have cognitive impairment, a family member or care assistant should prompt the patient to self-test. Optical coherence tomography is useful and OCTA may be useful for evaluating the status of high-risk fellow eyes.

### Clinical reasoning: acute monocular vision loss in a patient with ipsilateral extracranial chronic internal carotid artery occlusion [^114HFicJ]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

We report the case of a middle-aged man who presented with acute painless monocular vision loss. His medical history was remarkable for chronic total occlusion of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) and a recent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on the contralateral ICA. In a stepwise multidisciplinary approach assessment, we review the differential diagnosis of acute vision loss and investigate how the patient's intracranial and extracranial hemodynamic reorganization after chronic ICA occlusion may affect the clinical reasoning. Early complications of CEA and the differential diagnosis of new-onset anisocoria are also discussed.

### Acute unilateral vision loss with optic disc oedema in retinitis pigmentosa [^116m8ryM]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 36-year-old woman presented with acute vision loss and was found to have disc oedema and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). She presented with a history of acute, painless vision loss in her left eye over a period of 10 days. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50, N6 in the right eye (OD) and 20/160, N6 in the left eye (OS). She was found to have a swollen optic disc and the examination of her fundus showed changes suggestive of RP. The diagnosis of RP was confirmed by electroretinogram, and after ruling out demyelinating changes in the central nervous system and other possible infectious causes of papillitis, she was treated with intravenous steroids followed by a course of oral steroid therapy. Following treatment, her visual acuity improved to 20/60. Acute vision loss may occur in patients with RP and prompt steroid therapy may result in partial visual recovery.

### Leber hereditary optic neuropathy: current perspectives [^113KjzPG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical features of vision loss

LHON usually presents as painless, subacute, central visual loss in one eye. Weeks to months later, the second eye becomes involved, with a median delay of 6–8 weeks. Within 1 year, 97% of those affected have involvement of the second eye, such that a patient presenting with a unilateral optic neuropathy for longer than 1 year is highly unlikely to suffer from LHON-related vision loss. Approximately 25% have bilateral simultaneous vision loss, but in some individuals it may be that vision loss in the first eye is not noticed before the second eye becomes involved.

The majority of individuals progress to a visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Due to preferential involvement of the papillomacular bundle, the earliest visual field abnormality is a cecocentral scotoma (Figure 1), which can enlarge to become a larger central defect. Dyschromatopsia is common and usually parallels the degree of visual acuity loss. Pupillary light reflexes usually remain intact due to relative sparing of melanopsin-containing RGCs. This subset of RGCs are thought to be more resistant to metabolic insult from mitochondrial dysfunction when compared with all RGCs. In cases of asymmetric bilateral or monocular vision loss, however, a relative afferent pupillary defect can occur.

On fundus examination preceding or during the acute stage of vision loss, there can be characteristic findings, including optic disc hyperemia, peripapillary telangiectatic blood vessels, vascular tortuosity, and swelling of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) around the optic disc (Figure 2A) without corresponding leakage on fluorescein angiography (sometimes termed "pseudoedema"). The fundus can look normal in 20%–40% of those in the active stage of vision loss, which can delay diagnosis. Eventually, as the disease progresses, disc hyperemia, peripapillary telangiectasias, and pseudoedema resolve. Approximately 6 weeks after onset of vision loss, optic disc pallor develops and can be accompanied by cupping of the optic disc, reflecting the death of RGCs that occurs in the chronic atrophic phase (Figure 2B).

### Amantadine hydrochloride (amantadine HCl) [^111Z8Gjo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should be advised of the following information:

Blurry vision and/or impaired mental acuity may occur.

Gradually increase physical activity as the symptoms of Parkinson's disease improve.

Avoid excessive alcohol usage, since it may increase the potential for CNS effects such as dizziness, confusion, lightheadedness and orthostatic hypotension.

Avoid getting up suddenly from a sitting or lying position. If dizziness or lightheadedness occurs, notify physician.

Notify physician if mood/mental changes, swelling of extremities, difficulty urinating and/or shortness of breath occur.

Do not take more medication than prescribed because of the risk of overdose. If there is no improvement in a few days, or if medication appears less effective after a few weeks, discuss with a physician.

Consult physician before discontinuing medication.

Seek medical attention immediately if it is suspected that an overdose of medication has been taken.

Drug Interactions

Careful observation is required when amantadine hydrochloride is administered concurrently with central nervous system stimulants.

Agents with anticholinergic properties may potentiate the anticholinergic-like side effects of amantadine.

Coadministration of thioridazine has been reported to worsen the tremor in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease, however, it is not known if other phenothiazines produce a similar response.

Coadministration of Dyazide®(triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide) resulted in a higher plasma amantadine concentration in a 61-year-old man receiving amantadine hydrochloride 100 mg TID for Parkinson's disease.1It is not known which of the components of Dyazide®contributed to the observation or if related drugs produce a similar response.

Coadministration of quinine or quinidine with amantadine was shown to reduce the renal clearance of amantadine by about 30%.

The concurrent use of amantadine hydrochloride with live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) intranasal has not been evaluated. However, because of the potential for interference between these products, LAIV should not be administered within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after administration of amantadine hydrochloride, unless medically indicated. The concern about possible interference arises from the potential for antiviral drugs to inhibit replication of live vaccine virus. Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine can be administered at any time relative to use of amantadine.

### Invisibility of moving objects: a core symptom of motion blindness [^114SDWuv]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Although the higher brain mechanisms of seeing moving objects have been deeply investigated, motion blindness remains a rare and enigmatic symptom. Very few case reports well describe the detailed symptoms and the lesions. We report a case of a patient who presented with invisibility of moving objects, that is, motion blindness resulting from a unilateral right hemispheric lesion. This man, in his 60s, suffered persistent motion blindness from a unilateral right temporoparietal subcortical haemorrhage. He could not see the moving objects, just felt the objects 'disapper' when they began moving. The symptom was observed not only in his daily life but also during investigations in the hospital. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient who showed persistent motion blindness with a right unilateral lesion, and only the second one with clinically apparent motion blindness, whose symptoms were similar to those of the first reported case.

### Unilateral glaucoma in Sotos syndrome (cerebral gigantism) [^115WAtKL]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2000). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a patient with unilateral glaucoma associated with Sotos syndrome. Sotos syndrome (cerebral gigantism) is a disorder of growth and development with characteristic facial changes and normal endocrine function. Ocular manifestations may also include megalocornea, iris hypoplasia, cataracts, megalophthalmos, strabismus, nystagmus, and retinal dystrophy.

Methods

Case report. A 50 year-old man with the clinical features of Sotos syndrome presented with complaints of decreased vision in the left eye.

Results

Ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral megalocornea, megalophthalmos, iris hypoplasia and transillumination defects, cataracts, and unilateral glaucoma. Intraocular pressure was lowered, and visual field loss was stabilized with topical medications.

Conclusion

Sotos syndrome patients should be examined routinely to allow for early detection and treatment of potential ocular problems, including glaucoma.

### Bilateral vision loss associated with radiofrequency exposure [^115JfmCa]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old otherwise healthy woman presented with painless binocular vision loss 1 week after direct application of radiofrequency energy to her orbits. She had no light perception bilaterally. Pupils were dilated and not reactive to light. Fundoscopic exam initially showed optic disc swelling in the right eye and a normal-appearing disc in the left eye. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits showed gadolinium enhancement of both intraorbital optic nerves. She underwent a course of high-dose steroid treatment without recovery of vision. Optic discs were pale 11 weeks after injury. With exclusion of other possible causes, this represents a unique case of irreversible binocular optic nerve damage and blindness secondary to radiofrequency exposure.

### Shedding some light on laser pointer eye injuries [^113HT5d3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Laser use has become common in the home and workplace. We present a review of laser eye injuries and guidance for the emergency medicine physician on evaluation of laser eye injury-related complaints.

Methods

A review of the literature on the potential for injury, concerning signs and symptoms, evaluation, and referral recommendations is discussed.

Results

The scientific literature finds that laser eye injuries are uncommon from use of nonindustrial lasers. Furthermore, an eye injury from a regulated Class 2 or Class 3A by a transient sweep across the line of vision does not result in injury, but injury can occur with a direct intentional prolonged exposure.

Conclusions

Patient's history of the length and type of laser exposure is important. A significant direct eye exposure to a laser, persistent after images, and decreased visual acuity should initiate urgent referral to an ophthalmologist for further ophthalmologic testing. Brief laser exposure or indirect exposures with complaints of headaches or blurry vision require other diagnostic explanations.

### Anisocoria secondary to inadvertent contact with scopolamine patch [^1162wadW]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological anisocoria can be distinguished from neurogenic pupillary dilation using the 1% pilocarpine test in both eyes. In the absence of trauma to the eye, if the dilated pupil fails to constrict within 30 min, is proof of pharmacological blockage of the iris muscle. Neurogenic dilation of the pupil due to oculomotor nerve palsy, for example, does not directly affect the cholinergic receptor of the sphincter pupillae, and will constrict if pilocarpine is instilled into the affected eye. Other causes of decreased response to pilocarpine would include trauma or increased intraocular pressure.

There are several case reports of inadvertent pharmacological mydriasis due to scopolamine (hyoscine). Many of these cases, an MRI or CT scan were obtained to investigate the cause of the anisocoria, however in only one case, imaging was cancelled as the patient recalled coming into contact with a scopolamine patch. A similar case report discussed a 46-year-old female nurse who worked in a stroke ward who also presented with sudden onset unilateral mydriasis. With further history, she recalled applying a hyoscine (scopolamine) patch to a patient in the morning. Another case report revealed a 42-year-old male with progressive blurred vision who had initially denied any topical eye medications, but later remembered that he used atropine 1% which believed were lubricant eye drops. Glassner and Skiendzielewski, also described inadvertent ocular contamination of scopolamine patches in air medical personnel. A 28-year-old male with blurry vision and unilateral mydriasis had been wearing a scopolamine patch to prevent motion sickness but inadvertently caused contamination to his eye. Aside from scopolamine, there have also been cases of inadvertent contact with anticholinergic agents that also lead to anisocoria. Examples include ipratropium use in critically ill patients and deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna).

### Eye emergencies… [^116wXx39]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

PROGNOSIS Favorable vision recovery following an open globe injury is associated with initial visual acuity better than 20/400. The presence of an afferent pupillary defect or posterior wound location indicates poor vision outcomes. 24 Follow-up after a globe injury should include monitoring for sympathetic ophthalmia, which, although rare, may lead to profound vision loss. Retinal Detachment CASE SCENARIO A 60-year-old woman presents with several new floaters and a series of flashing lights in her right eye. She noticed a progressively enlarging black spot in her superior visual field during the past two days. Her visual acuity on presentation is 20/25 with a dense superior scotoma on confrontational visual field testing. DIAGNOSIS Patients with a retinal detachment may notice unilateral flashing lights in their peripheral vision, followed by an increase in floaters.

These symptoms may be attributed to a posterior vitreous detachment; however, 14% of patients develop a retinal tear. 11 Visual acuity may be unaffected with a retinal tear, but confrontational visual field testing may detect a peripheral visual field defect. If untreated, a retinal detachment may occur, causing a visual field defect in the peripheral vision that enlarges over the next few days. If the detachment is large enough to involve the macula, the patient may have a significant decline in vision. A dilated funduscopic examination can identify a retinal detachment. A retinal tear may be difficult to detect with direct ophthalmoscopy; however, the surrounding retina will appear elevated. Ocular ultrasonography has a 94% sensitivity in diagnosing a retinal detachment if the retina cannot be visualized because of cataract or vitreous hemorrhage.
27.

TREATMENT Immediate ophthalmology referral is indicated for patients with symptoms such as flashing lights, floaters, or visual field defect, or if a retinal detachment is detected on initial examination. 12 Surgical treatment involves sealing the retinal tear with a laser and reapproximating the retina to the underlying choroid with an intraocular gas bubble or scleral buckle. Surgery is successful for more than 95% of patients. 13, 14. This article updates previous articles on this topic by Gelston, and Pokhrel and Loftus. 31 32.

### A 31-year-old man with recurrent blurred vision [^115WXQ5L]. Brain Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 CLINICAL HISTORY

A 31‐year‐old male patient was first admitted to the hospital with the chief complaint of blurred vision lasting 1 month. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass in the sellar and suprasellar region, which was significantly contrast‐enhancing (Figure 1). Pituitary‐related hormones were normal. The patient underwent his first surgical treatment. A year later, the patient was readmitted due to double vision with drooping of the left eyelid. Physical examination showed limited abduction of the left eye and drooping of the left eyelid. The left pupil was insensitive to light. Tumor recurrence was considered after a re‐examination of cranial MRI and the patient underwent a second surgery (Box 1).

### Vision and concussion: symptoms, signs, evaluation, and treatment [^115th3XB]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Vision and concussion — evaluation and immediate management: Obtaining a vision-specific history and performing a targeted visual system examination will aid the clinician in identifying these issues; an assessment of visual acuity alone is insufficient in the setting of concussion. For most patients who have only mild and temporary injury, these symptoms are likely indicative of diffuse brain dysfunction associated with decreased attention and visual symptoms, but patients with prolonged visual symptoms may have difficulty with convergence and accommodation attributable to dysfunction of the brainstem's near triad. If deficits are identified, clinicians can provide timely supportive care and suggest academic accommodations during the school re-entry process, and for the minority of patients who continue to have ongoing visual symptoms, referral to appropriate specialty care (ie, sports medicine, physiatry, neurology, neuropsychology, ophthalmology, otorhinolaryngology) may be beneficial. Temporary base-in prism combined with refractive correction for near vision can improve symptoms of blurred vision and diplopia associated with accommodative and convergence dysfunction, and children and adolescents who have persistent visual symptoms may benefit from referral to appropriate specialists for additional evaluation and treatment to optimize visual function and quality of life. Visual symptoms are important to recognize after pediatric concussion and can be managed to minimize their negative impact on function in school, sports, and activities of daily living for children and adolescents.

### Cosmetic contact lenses: potential threat to vision health – 2025 [^113twMm6]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Cosmetic and costume contact lenses — safety and use guidance emphasizes that the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Academy of Optometry "encourage consumers to understand the risks of using unprescribed costume contact lenses", noting that "The risks include adverse events, such as corneal abrasions, corneal ulcers and infections, including even potentially vision-threatening infections". Contact lenses, including holiday designs, "require a prescription and supervision by an eye care professional and should never be shared with others", and "costume contact lenses require the same precautions as regular contact lenses". Care instructions include: "Keep water away from your contact lenses. Take contact lenses out before showering, swimming, or using a hot tub". "Do not "top off" solutions. Use only fresh contact lens disinfecting solution in a clean case — never mix old and new solutions". "Keep the contact lens case clean and replace it every 3 months". "Wear and replace contact lenses according to the schedule prescribed by your doctor", "Follow the specific contact lens cleaning and storage guidelines from your doctor and the solution manufacturer", and "Remove the contact lenses and consult your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as redness, pain, tearing, increased light sensitivity, blurry vision, discharge, or swelling". Patients should "See your eye doctor yearly or as often as he or she recommends for contact lens examination". "These recommendations apply to both contact lenses prescribed for refractive error (vision correction) and for contact lenses that alter the appearance (or color) of the eye".
