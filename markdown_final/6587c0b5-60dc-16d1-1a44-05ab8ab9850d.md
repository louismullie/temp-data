## Question

Oral antihistamine uses

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about oral antihistamine uses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic classes and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and guideline-backed indications. Next, I will examine condition-specific uses, including allergic rhinitis, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, anaphylaxis, and the common cold. After that, I need to check special populations and safety, including pediatrics, pregnancy, and older adults. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and highlight what to avoid, making sure I double-check any claims that seem too broad or unsupported by the cited evidence.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic framework. Oral H1 antihistamines are inverse agonists at H1 receptors that reduce histamine-mediated symptoms; they are broadly divided into first-generation agents with significant CNS penetration and anticholinergic effects, and second-generation agents with minimal CNS penetration and less sedation, which guides modern preference for second-generation drugs in most settings [^b402bd77] [^d69c0f91].

> I need to verify the strength of evidence across indications. High-credibility guidelines consistently support second-generation oral antihistamines for allergic rhinitis and urticaria, whereas evidence for atopic dermatitis is limited and mixed, and for the common cold is generally negative or only modest in combination products; anaphylaxis care reserves antihistamines for adjunctive use only, never as primary therapy [^4c7cb8e3] [^d69c0f91] [^f06d6bff] [^c9fb49ff] [^3e12b651] [^5cafcd40].

> Now, allergic rhinitis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about oral antihistamines being first-line for everyone. Contemporary guidelines recommend second-generation oral antihistamines for patients whose predominant symptoms are sneezing and itching, while intranasal corticosteroids are preferred when nasal congestion predominates or symptoms are moderate to severe; intranasal antihistamines can be considered when rapid onset or local therapy is desired, and combining oral antihistamines with intranasal steroids generally does not add benefit over intranasal steroids alone, so I should be careful not to overstate combination therapy [^2b8de021] [^4c7cb8e3] [^475fd3f1] [^9f0a9010] [^4a80019b].

> For urticaria, I should confirm dosing strategy. Second-generation oral antihistamines are first-line for acute and chronic urticaria, and if control is inadequate, guidelines support up-dosing to 2–4 times the standard dose before escalating to biologics or immunomodulators; this applies to adults and children, with pediatric safety data supporting several second-generation agents down to age 2 years or younger in some cases, though I need to check product-specific labeling before prescribing [^f06d6bff] [^6921ac7c] [^eee76edd].

> Atopic dermatitis is trickier. Wait, let me verify the monotherapy evidence. A Cochrane review found no randomized trials supporting oral H1 antihistamines as monotherapy for eczema, and an updated Cochrane review of add-on therapy showed inconsistent benefits, with only small, possibly non-clinically meaningful improvements in pruritus for some agents; thus, antihistamines may be used symptomatically for itch, but they do not treat the dermatitis itself, and second-generation agents are preferred for safety if used [^1a5bf90e] [^c9fb49ff] [^8eee6c09].

> Anaphylaxis requires a strict hierarchy. I should double-check that I'm not overstating any role for oral antihistamines. Epinephrine is first-line; oral antihistamines are third-line for persistent cutaneous symptoms after stabilization, and sedating first-generation agents should be avoided because sedation can confound assessment; cetirizine has comparable onset to diphenhydramine for cutaneous symptoms in mild reactions, but that does not substitute for epinephrine in anaphylaxis [^5cafcd40] [^70991095] [^128eb0c2].

> For the common cold, I initially thought antihistamines might help rhinorrhea, but wait, I should verify the evidence. Monotherapy with non-sedating antihistamines shows no clinically meaningful benefit, whereas combination products with decongestants and sometimes analgesics show modest global symptom improvements in adults and older children at the cost of more adverse effects; there is no evidence of benefit in young children, so I need to avoid recommending antihistamines for colds in that group [^3e12b651] [^ff39cedf] [^e3af080d].

> Next, I should review special populations and safety. In children, first-generation antihistamines are discouraged due to sedation, cognitive impairment, and emerging signals of increased seizure risk in young children; second-generation agents are preferred, with pediatric labeling down to age 2 years for several agents, and dosing should follow age-appropriate schedules; in pregnancy, cetirizine, levocetirizine, and desloratadine have the most safety data and are reasonable choices; in older adults, avoid first-generation agents due to anticholinergic burden and fall risk, and consider renal or hepatic dose adjustments for some second-generation drugs [^4c7cb8e3] [^406708ae] [^eee76edd] [^295ebb28] [^7b782310].

> I will now examine practical selection and monitoring. Let me think about onset, potency, and sedation trade-offs. Cetirizine and levocetirizine are potent but can cause sedation in a minority, whereas fexofenadine is essentially non-sedating; intranasal antihistamines offer rapid onset and may outperform oral agents for nasal congestion, but taste and somnolence can limit adherence; for chronic urticaria, I should plan for up-dosing if needed and reassess at 2–4 week intervals, documenting response and adverse effects before escalating therapy [^6f1830b3] [^4a80019b] [^6921ac7c].

> But wait, what about insomnia and performance? I should confirm that first-generation antihistamines impair next-day function even when taken at bedtime. Multiple guidelines advise against first-generation agents for allergic rhinitis due to sedation, performance impairment, and anticholinergic effects, and sleep societies recommend against antihistamines for insomnia because of poor risk–benefit and next-day cognitive effects; this reinforces choosing second-generation agents whenever possible [^d69c0f91] [^43a51164] [^9ef5c103].

> Let me synthesize a stepwise approach. For allergic rhinitis, start with patient preference and predominant symptoms: use second-generation oral antihistamines for sneezing and itching, consider intranasal corticosteroids for congestion or moderate to severe disease, and reserve intranasal antihistamines for rapid relief or when oral therapy is inadequate; avoid routine combination of oral antihistamine plus intranasal steroid as initial therapy. For urticaria, begin with a second-generation antihistamine and up-dose up to fourfold if symptoms persist, then consider add-on therapy or biologics. For atopic dermatitis, prioritize skin-directed anti-inflammatory therapy and use second-generation antihistamines only for symptomatic itch relief. For anaphylaxis, ensure epinephrine access and use non-sedating antihistamines only as adjuncts after stabilization. For the common cold, avoid antihistamine monotherapy and use combination products cautiously in adults with informed consent about limited benefit and adverse effects [^2b8de021] [^f06d6bff] [^8eee6c09] [^5cafcd40] [^3e12b651].

> Finally, I should double-check what to avoid. Do not use first-generation antihistamines chronically for allergic rhinitis, do not rely on antihistamines for anaphylaxis, do not use antihistamines for primary treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis, and do not use antihistamines for insomnia; also avoid assuming antihistamines treat the underlying inflammation in atopic dermatitis, and be cautious with combination cold medications in children given lack of benefit and higher adverse effect rates [^d69c0f91] [^5cafcd40] [^ecd41f4d] [^43a51164] [^c9fb49ff] [^3e12b651].

---

Oral antihistamines are used to relieve **allergy symptoms** such as sneezing, itching, runrhinorrhea, and hives [^b402bd77] by blocking H1 receptors [^1048b311]. Second-generation agents (cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, desloratadine) are preferred for their **minimal sedation** and favorable safety profile [^4c7cb8e3] [^d69c0f91]. They are first-line for allergic rhinitis [^2b8de021] and urticaria [^f06d6bff], and are used for pruritus in atopic dermatitis [^8eee6c09], though they do not treat the underlying inflammation [^c9fb49ff]. First-generation agents (diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine) are reserved for short-term use when sedation is desired or for insomnia, given their anticholinergic and sedative effects [^e82fd492] [^43a51164]. They are not effective for asthma or anaphylaxis and should not replace epinephrine [^7e4d67ad] [^70991095].

## Pharmacological classification and mechanism of action

Oral antihistamines are classified into **first-generation** and **second-generation** based on their pharmacological properties and side-effect profiles [^627c0f22].

| **Generation** | **Examples** | **Key characteristics** |
|-|-|-|
| First-generation | - Diphenhydramine <br/> - Chlorpheniramine <br/> - Hydroxyzine | - Sedating <br/> - Anticholinergic <br/> - Cross blood-brain barrier <br/> - Useful when sedation is desired [^e82fd492] |
| Second-generation | - Cetirizine <br/> - Loratadine <br/> - Fexofenadine <br/> - Levocetirizine <br/> - Desloratadine | - Minimal sedation <br/> - Low anticholinergic activity <br/> - Once-daily dosing <br/> - Preferred for daytime use [^4c7cb8e3] |

---

These agents act as **H1-receptor antagonists**, blocking histamine binding and thereby reducing symptoms such as itching, sneezing, and nasal congestion [^b402bd77].

---

## Clinical indications

### Allergic rhinitis

Second-generation oral antihistamines are **first-line therapy** for allergic rhinitis, effectively relieving sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea [^2b8de021] [^4c7cb8e3]. They are less effective for nasal congestion, for which intranasal corticosteroids may be added [^6f1830b3] [^475fd3f1].

---

### Urticaria

Oral antihistamines are **first-line therapy** for acute and chronic urticaria, providing rapid relief of pruritus and wheal formation [^f06d6bff]. Doses can be increased up to fourfold in refractory cases [^6921ac7c] [^5b39b009].

---

### Atopic dermatitis

Antihistamines are used primarily to control **pruritus** in atopic dermatitis, although they do not address the underlying inflammation [^8eee6c09]. Second-generation agents are preferred for their minimal sedation [^c9fb49ff].

---

### Anaphylaxis

Antihistamines are **adjunctive therapy** in anaphylaxis, used after epinephrine to relieve cutaneous symptoms such as itching and hives [^5cafcd40]. They do not treat airway or cardiovascular compromise and should not delay epinephrine administration [^70991095].

---

### Common cold

Antihistamines, particularly first-generation agents, may relieve rhinorrhea and sneezing in adults with the common cold, but **benefit is limited** and offset by sedation; they are not recommended for young children [^3e12b651] [^ff39cedf].

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

- **First-generation antihistamines**: Sedation, cognitive impairment, anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, urinary retention), and potential for overdose toxicity, especially in children and older adults [^d69c0f91] [^e82fd492].
- **Second-generation antihistamines**: Minimal sedation, low anticholinergic activity, and favorable cardiovascular safety; however, cetirizine and levocetirizine may cause mild sedation at higher doses [^6f1830b3] [^c31077ca].
- **Special populations**: Caution is advised in pregnancy, lactation, and patients with hepatic or renal impairment; dose adjustments may be necessary [^7b782310] [^295ebb28].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

Oral antihistamines are **not effective** for asthma or anaphylaxis and should not replace epinephrine in anaphylaxis management [^7e4d67ad] [^70991095]. They are also ineffective for non-allergic rhinitis, except for azelastine, which has additional anti-inflammatory properties [^4a80019b].

---

## Summary of clinical uses

| **Indication** | **Recommended antihistamine** | **Clinical notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Allergic rhinitis | Second-generation | First-line; minimal sedation [^2b8de021] |
| Urticaria | Second-generation | First-line; dose can be increased up to 4x [^f06d6bff] |
| Atopic dermatitis | Second-generation | For pruritus control only [^8eee6c09] |
| Anaphylaxis | Second-generation | Adjunctive after epinephrine [^5cafcd40] |
| Common cold | First-generation (limited) | Short-term use in adults only [^3e12b651] |

---

Oral antihistamines are **effective for allergic symptoms** such as rhinitis, urticaria, and pruritus, with second-generation agents preferred for their safety and minimal sedation. They are not effective for asthma or anaphylaxis and should be used cautiously in special populations.

Antihistamines have long been a mainstay in the therapy for allergic rhinitis. Many different oral antihistamines are available for use, and they are classified as first generation or second generation based on their pharmacologic properties and side-effect profiles. The recent introduction of intranasal antihistamines has further expanded the role of antihistamines in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Certain patient populations, such as children and pregnant or lactating women, require special consideration regarding antihistamine choice and dosing as part of rhinitis therapy.

### Oral H1 antihistamines as monotherapy for eczema [^1a5bf90e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Eczema is a common skin disease in many countries, and although the majority of cases of eczema occur before the age of five years and often resolve during childhood or adolescence, it can also persist into adulthood. Itch is the most important aspect of eczema, often impacting significantly on the quality of life of an affected individual.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral antihistamines (H1 antagonists) as monotherapy in children and adults with eczema.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to March 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We examined the reference lists of excluded studies in order to identify further references to relevant trials. We searched trials registers for ongoing and unpublished trials. We also handsearched the abstracts of the International Research Workshops on eczema, as well as the conference proceedings of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) and the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), from 2000 to 2011.

Selection Criteria

We sought to include randomised controlled trials that assessed the effects and safety of oral H1 antihistamines as monotherapy in children and adults with eczema. We excluded studies that compared an antihistamine versus another antihistamine and had no placebo control arm. We also excluded topical antihistamines and oral H1 antihistamines as 'add-on' therapy and studies using any concomitant therapy other than emollients or moisturisers, principally because some of these forms of concomitant therapy may be considered treatment modifiers in assessments of the effects of antihistamines on eczema.

Data Collection and Analysis

Our search retrieved 409 references to studies. Based on assessments of their titles, abstracts, or both, we excluded all except 36 of these studies. After evaluation of the full text of each report, we excluded a further 35 studies, and 1 study is awaiting classification pending a response from the trial investigators.

Main Results

No randomised controlled trials met our inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no high-level evidence to support or refute the efficacy or safety of oral H1 antihistamines used as monotherapy for eczema. Because most of the studies allowed the use of concomitant medications and involved multi-therapeutic approaches, meaningful assessments of the individual effects of oral H1 antihistamines on eczema were not feasible. Although well-designed randomised controlled trials excluding concomitant medications appear to be needed, consideration should be given to the potential ethical issues raised with the use of antihistamines as monotherapy for the management of eczema by withholding the use of rescue or additional therapies. A further systematic review of studies in which concomitant therapies were permitted might be of value in determining the potential benefits of oral H1 antihistamines as add-on therapy.

### Oral H1 antihistamines as' add-on' therapy to topical treatment for eczema [^c9fb49ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The symptoms of eczema can lead to sleeplessness and fatigue and may have a substantial impact on quality of life. Use of oral H1 antihistamines (H1 AH) as adjuvant therapy alongside topical agents is based on the idea that combining the anti-inflammatory effects of topical treatments with the blocking action of histamine on its receptors in the skin by H1 AH (to reduce the principal symptom of itch) might magnify or intensify the effect of treatment. Also, it would be unethical to compare oral H1 AH alone versus no treatment, as topical treatment is the standard management for this condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral H1 antihistamines as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment in adults and children with eczema.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2018: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database (Global Resource of EczemA Trials; from inception). We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the abstracts of four conference proceedings held between 2000 and 2018.

Selection Criteria

We sought RCTs assessing oral H1 AH as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment for people with eczema compared with topical treatment plus placebo or no additional treatment as add-on therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Primary outcome measures were 'Mean change in patient-assessed symptoms of eczema' and 'Proportion of participants reporting adverse effects and serious adverse events'. Secondary outcomes were 'Mean change in physician-assessed clinical signs', 'Mean change in quality of life', and 'Number of eczema flares'.

Main Results

We included 25 studies (3285 randomised participants). Seventeen studies included 1344 adults, and eight studies included 1941 children. Most studies failed to report eczema severity at baseline, but they were conducted in secondary care settings, so it is likely that they recruited patients with more severe cases of eczema. Trial duration was between three days and 18 months. Researchers studied 13 different H1 AH treatments. We could not undertake pooling because of the high level of diversity across studies in terms of duration and dose of intervention, concomitant topical therapy, and outcome assessment. Risk of bias was generally unclear, but five studies had high risk of bias in one domain (attrition, selection, or reporting bias). Only one study measured quality of life, but these results were insufficient for statistical analysis.Although this review assessed 17 comparisons, we summarise here the results of three key comparisons in this review.Cetirizine versus placeboOne study compared cetirizine 0.5 mg/kg/d against placebo over 18 months in 795 children. Study authors did not report patient-assessed symptoms of eczema separately for pruritus. Cetirizine is probably associated with fewer adverse events (mainly mild) (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.01) and the need for slightly less additional H1 AH use as an indication of eczema flare rate (P = 0.035; no further numerical data given). Physician-assessed clinical signs (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index (SCORAD)) were reduced in both groups, but the difference between groups was reported as non-significant (no P value given). Evidence for this comparison was of moderate quality.One study assessed cetirizine 10 mg/d against placebo over four weeks in 84 adults. Results show no evidence of differences between groups in patient-assessed symptoms of eczema (pruritus measured as part of SCORAD; no numerical data given), numbers of adverse events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.45; mainly sedation, other skin-related problems, respiratory symptoms, or headache), or physician-assessed changes in clinical signs, amount of local rescue therapy required, or number of applications as an indicator of eczema flares (no numerical data reported). Evidence for this comparison was of low quality.Fexofenadine versus placeboCompared with placebo, fexofenadine 120 mg/d taken in adults over one week (one study) probably leads to a small reduction in patient-assessed symptoms of pruritus on a scale of 0 to 8 (mean difference (MD) -0.25, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.07; n = 400) and a greater reduction in the ratio of physician-assessed pruritus area to whole body surface area (P = 0.007; no further numerical data given); however, these reductions may not be clinically meaningful. Results suggest probably little or no difference in adverse events (mostly somnolence and headache) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.50; n = 411) nor in the amount of 0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate used (co-intervention in both groups) as an indicator of eczema flare, but no numerical data were given. Evidence for this comparison was of moderate quality.Loratadine versus placeboA study of 28 adults compared loratadine 10 mg/d taken over 4 weeks versus placebo. Researchers found no evidence of differences between groups in patient-assessed pruritus, measured by a 100-point visual analogue scale (MD -2.30, 95% CI -20.27 to 15.67); reduction in physician-assessed clinical signs (SCORAD) (MD -4.10, 95% CI -13.22 to 5.02); or adverse events. Study authors reported only one side effect (folliculitis with placebo) (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.76). Evidence for this comparison was of low quality. Number of eczema flares was not measured for this comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the main comparisons, we did not find consistent evidence that H1 AH treatments are effective as 'add-on' therapy for eczema when compared to placebo; evidence for this comparison was of low and moderate quality. However, fexofenadine probably leads to a small improvement in patient-assessed pruritus, with probably no significant difference in the amount of treatment used to prevent eczema flares. Cetirizine was no better than placebo in terms of physician-assessed clinical signs nor patient-assessed symptoms, and we found no evidence that loratadine was more beneficial than placebo, although all interventions seem safe.The quality of evidence was limited because of poor study design and imprecise results. Future researchers should clearly define the condition (course and severity) and clearly report their methods, especially participant selection and randomisation; baseline characteristics; and outcomes (based on the Harmonising Outcome Measures in Eczema initiative).

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^4c7cb8e3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for allergic rhinitis, more specifically with respect to oral antihistamines, AAAAI/ACAAI 2020 guidelines recommend to do not use first-generation antihistamines in patients with allergic rhinitis. Prefer second-generation antihistamines over first-generation antihistamines when prescribing oral antihistamines.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^d69c0f91]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Oral antihistamines for allergic rhinitis—Recommendation 6 states: “We recommend against prescribing a first-generation antihistamine and are in favor of a second-generation antihistamine when prescribing an oral antihistamine for the treatment of AR.” Strength of recommendation is Strong with High certainty of evidence. Selecting a second-generation antihistamine reduces potential side effects associated with first-generation agents, including sedation, performance impairment, poor sleep quality, and anticholinergic-mediated symptoms. First-generation antihistamines may produce performance impairment in school and while driving that can exist without subjective awareness of sedation, and their use has been associated with increased automobile and occupational accidents. In one early study, chlorpheniramine caused greater drowsiness and dry mouth for the first 2 weeks, but at doses of chlorpheniramine <24 mg/day there was no significant difference versus placebo in subjective drowsiness, dizziness, irritability, or dry mouth over the remaining 6 weeks. Bedtime dosing may leave residual central nervous system effects due to long terminal elimination half-life (>24 hours for chlorpheniramine). A cohort study of strong anticholinergics (including first-generation antihistamines) reported adjusted hazard ratios for dementia of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.74-1.16) for 1 to 90 days of standardized daily doses and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.21-1.96) with cumulative 3 years of daily use; these findings further support use of second-generation antihistamines over first-generation antihistamines for AR.

### Are antihistamines effective in children? A review of the evidence [^8e9a4eef]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

During the last decades, much attention has been paid to off-label and unlicensed prescriptions in paediatrics. However, on-label prescribing can also cause health issues. In this paper, the case of first-generation H 1 -antihistamines is investigated, notably the range of indications for which products are licensed in different European countries and the evidence base (or lack thereof) for each indication, as well as reported adverse drug reactions.

Methods

Review of the Summary of Product Characteristics of first-generation H 1 -antihistamines with a focus on paediatric use. This is plotted against the evidence available in the literature.

Results

This investigation shows a large variability in labelled indications and licensing ages when compared in five different European countries. Moreover, most of the indications are not based on clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety of these drugs in children.

Conclusions

Many of the licensed indications of first-generation antihistamines do not appear to be evidence based.

### Evidence-based use of antihistamines for treatment of allergic conditions [^b402bd77]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Available since the 1940s, H 1 antihistamines are mainstay treatments for allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis and urticaria. They function as inverse agonists that bind to the H 1 receptor to inhibit histamine-induced inflammation. The older, first-generation drugs are no longer recommended for patient use because of their well-documented negative adverse effect profile. Evidence has been accumulating to support a newer generation of H 1 antihistamines in oral and intranasal formulations, including in combination with intranasal corticosteroids. The literature is replete with large meta-analyses and systematic reviews establishing the safety and efficacy of second-generation H 1 antihistamines in adult and pediatric allergic rhinitis populations, including combination nasal spray agents (eg, MP29-02 or MP-AzeFlu). Although intraclass differences do exist, patient preference, access, and costs should be the priority. Robust data on the regular, not as needed use of H 1 antihistamines for urticaria have been published, including in the management of children and pregnant or lactating women. In addition, H 1 antihistamines can be used in other related allergic conditions, such as the secondary symptoms of anaphylaxis, to provide patients with greater comfort, including in allergic asthma, depending on the individual.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^6f1830b3]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Oral antihistamines for allergic rhinitis (AR)—comparative properties and use: Oral antihistamines block histamine at the H1 receptor and are categorized as first- or second-generation agents; first-generation examples include diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and hydroxyzine, with use limited by sedation and mucosal dryness, whereas commonly used second-generation drugs include fexofenadine, cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and desloratadine, and in almost all situations second-generation antihistamines are preferred. Data indicate that cetirizine and levocetirizine are the most potent but carry a modest risk of sedation not seen with other drugs in this class. Advantages include rapid onset of action, once-daily dosing, maintenance of effectiveness with regular use, and availability without a prescription; maximum benefit is with continuous use, but as-needed use can provide significant symptom relief and is appropriate for some patients with intermittent symptoms. Although most studies have shown that intranasal steroids (INS) used continuously are superior to oral antihistamines for AR, especially for nasal congestion, an antihistamine used alone intermittently or continuously may provide adequate relief; oral antihistamines usually add no further improvement to INS, though adding as-needed INS to a regularly taken oral antihistamine is a viable strategy. The choice between oral agents and intranasal sprays is often based on patient preference, which may promote better adherence, and a table lists FDA-approved oral antihistamines for AR with key prescribing details.

### The efficacy of intranasal antihistamines in the treatment of allergic rhinitis [^6aacd23f]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To discuss the new use of intranasal antihistamines as first-line therapies, compare and contrast this class of medication with the traditionally available medications, and discuss the potential for intranasal antihistamines to provide relief superior to second-generation oral antihistamines.

Data Sources

Review articles and original research articles were retrieved from MEDLINE, OVID, PubMed (1950 to November 2009), personal files of articles, and bibliographies of located articles that addressed the topic of interest.

Study Selection

Articles were selected for their relevance to intranasal antihistamines and their role in allergic rhinitis. Publications included reviews, treatment guidelines, and clinical studies (primarily randomized controlled trials) of both children and adults.

Results

This panel was charged with reviewing the place of intranasal antihistamines in the spectrum of treatment for allergic rhinitis. Intranasal antihistamines have been shown in numerous randomized, placebo-controlled trials to be more efficacious than the oral antihistamines. Although intranasal corticosteroids are considered by some to be superior to intranasal antihistamines, multiple studies have shown an equal effect of the 2 classes of medication. Both intranasal corticosteroids and intranasal antihistamines have been shown to reduce all symptoms of allergic rhinitis. In addition, some intranasal antihistamines have a more rapid onset of action than intranasal corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The future of allergy treatment will likely involve a combination of both intranasal corticosteroids and intranasal antihistamines because of the benefits of local administration and their additive effect on efficacy.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^5cafcd40]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral H1-antihistamines relieve the cutaneous symptoms of anaphylaxis; combined H1- and H2-antihistamines may be more effective than H1-antihistamines alone, although data are limited.However, cutaneous symptoms are not life-threatening and also respond to adrenaline (although the effect may not be long-lasting). The ASCIA 2020 guideline cautions against the use of sedating antihistamines as “side effects (drowsiness or lethargy) may mimic some signs of anaphylaxis”.Antihistamines may be helpful in treating cutaneous symptoms that persist following resolution of anaphylaxis symptoms, but are not recommended until the acute reaction has been successfully treated with more appropriate interventions.,,,,A non-sedating oral antihistamine is preferred, to avoid confounding due to the risk of sedation which can indicate reaction progression.

### Comparative pharmacology of H1 antihistamines: clinical relevance [^7b782310]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

H1 antihistamines have similar efficacy in the treatment of allergic disorders; however, they differ in terms of their chemical structure, clinical pharmacology, and safety. This review focuses on the clinical pharmacology (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics) of the newer oral H1 antihistamines (acrivastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and mizolastine). Understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these H1 antihistamines provides an objective basis for selection of appropriate dosages and dose intervals. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies provide a rationale for the modified dosage regimens that may be required in special populations, such as the very young, the elderly, those with hepatic or renal dysfunction, or those taking other medications concurrently. Many H1 antihistamines are currently available for use. Clinical pharmacology studies help physicians to select the best H1 antihistamines for their patients.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^dd024621]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Allergic rhinitis—oral antihistamine with oral leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA): For seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), the guideline advises against combining montelukast with an oral antihistamine when symptoms are not controlled by an oral antihistamine; this is a conditional recommendation with moderate certainty, noting this approach is usually less efficacious than intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) monotherapy and should be considered only after a shared decision-making discussion.

### New oral H1 antihistamines in children: facts and unmeet needs [^30c42a8b]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Second-generation antihistamines differ from first-generation ones because of their elevated specificity and affinity for peripheral H1-receptors and because of their lower penetration to the central nervous system, having fewer sedative effects as a result. Over the last few years, new compounds with different pharmacokinetic properties have been synthesized. More recent improvements of the molecules, generally in the form of active metabolites, led to the synthesis of new-generation antihistamines.

Methods

Recommendations on the minimum criteria that would have to be met for compounds to be classified as new-generation antihistamines have been recently established by a consensus statement. In the past, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of H1 antihistamines have not been optimally investigated in the pediatric population, especially in infants and young children.

Results

The pharmacology of second-generation H1 antihistamines has been investigated relatively deeper than old antihistamines in children. In the pediatric population, clinical studies with new-generation antihistamines are still limited in number and, with rare exceptions, of brief duration. Comparative trials on the efficacy and safety between different compounds are also lacking.

Conclusions

Properly designed, long-term trials with new-generation H1 antihistamines need to be performed in single age groups, in order to better define the effects of these drugs in all pediatric population.

### Oral antihistamines for the symptom of nasal obstruction in persistent allergic rhinitis – a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^437d620a]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Oral antihistamines are recommended by a World Health Organisation working group as a first-line pharmacological treatment in mild persistent allergic rhinitis. There is, however, uncertainty with respect to their effectiveness for a common symptom, that of nasal obstruction.

Objective

To test the null hypothesis that oral antihistamines have no effect on the symptom of nasal obstruction in a clinical setting in patients with persistent allergic rhinitis.

Methods

Protocol based review of double-blind randomized controlled trials of oral antihistamine (i.e. drugs considered to act as a histamine receptor type-1 antagonist) vs. placebo. A search was carried out for published and unpublished trials. Individuals had to be age 12 years or older (with a diagnosis confirmed by skin prick tests, IgE blood tests or nasal allergen challenge), experiencing their normal allergen exposure. A symptom score for nasal obstruction had to be recorded. Predetermined quality criteria were applied. Treating their data as 4-point scores, a meta-analysis was carried out for studies, which provided enough data to be pooled.

Results

Meta-analysis found a weighted mean difference of -0.52 in favour of treatment for patient-assessed symptom scores (95% confidence interval (CI)-0.73,-0.31, P<0.00001), and of -0.33 in favour of treatment for healthcare worker assessed scores (95% CI -0.49, -0.16, P = 0.0001).

Conclusion

Oral antihistamines cause statistically significant improvement in the symptom of nasal obstruction in patients with persistent allergic rhinitis.

### Myths, facts and controversies in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^70991095]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Myth 5: ‘Antihistamines can be used to treat anaphylaxis initially; epinephrine is only needed if symptoms worsen’

Histamine is only one of many inflammatory mediators released during anaphylaxis. Oral antihistamines take around 30 min for onset of effect; intravenous chlorphenamine has a faster onset, but can cause hypotension. Antihistamines are not effective against anaphylaxis: their prophylactic use during controlled immunotherapy does not prevent anaphylaxis, and any apparent response during acute management of reactions is most likely due to the patient’s own endogenous epinephrine.Antihistamines have now been relegated to third-line therapy in international guidelines; their use is limited to the relief of cutaneous symptoms and should never delay the administration of epinephrine or fluid resuscitation during patient stabilisation.

Myth 6: ‘Corticosteroids prevent delayed or biphasic reactions in anaphylaxis’

Historically, corticosteroids have been used to prevent protracted and biphasic reactions (the latter defined as a recurrence of symptoms within 72 hours of initial anaphylaxis, without re-exposure to the trigger). However, this has never been tested in a randomised clinical trial; more recent evidence has cast doubt over their efficacy.A recent systematic review and meta-analysis included 27 studies with 4114 anaphylaxis cases, of whom 192 (4.7%) had biphasic reactions.Steroid administration did not affect the likelihood of a late phase reaction (OR 1.52, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.43). In fact, there was a non-significant trend towards increased risk, although this is probably because steroid use was more common with severe reactions. Biphasic reactions were more common where hypotension was present at initial reaction (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.15), but this is unusual in food-induced anaphylaxis. The median time to onset of biphasic symptoms was 11 (range 0.2–72) hours, that is, 50% of reactions occurred >11 hours after initial reaction. This is relevant because current guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends patients over 16 years are observed for 6–12 hours after anaphylaxis (children under 16 should be admitted).In reality, it is generally accepted that prolonged observation may not be required following a straightforward reaction in someone who already has a comprehensive management plan and rescue medication (including epinephrine autoinjectors) in place.

### Antihistamines [^2deaa258]. Dermatologic Clinics (2001). Low credibility.

In the 1990s, major improvements occurred in the therapeutic index of H1 antihistamines. The third-generation compounds promise to be more effective and nontoxic. The future major advances are likely to result from development and exploitation of non-H1 receptor-mediated antiallergic actions of these drugs.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^883a99e0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Oral antihistamine with oral decongestant in allergic rhinitis—We suggest that for patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and nasal congestion uncontrolled with an oral antihistamine, the clinician consider the addition of pseudoephedrine, when tolerated. Strength of recommendation: Conditional. Certainty of evidence: Moderate. Controlled studies demonstrate that the combination of an oral antihistamine and an oral decongestant is more effective than the individual components, although pharmacologic options other than this combination generally are preferred; pseudoephedrine is far superior to other decongestants. If a fixed combination is chosen, side effects such as insomnia should be considered, and if side effects occur the dose should be adjusted, if possible, or the fixed combination stopped and either separate monotherapy products selected.

### Histamine and H1-antihistamines: celebrating a century of progress [^1048b311]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

In this review we celebrate a century of progress since the initial description of the physiologic and pathologic roles of histamine and 70 years of progress since the introduction of H(1)-antihistamines for clinical use. We discuss histamine and clinically relevant information about the molecular mechanisms of action of H(1)-antihistamines as inverse agonists (not antagonists or blockers) with immunoregulatory effects. Unlike first (old)-generation H(1)-antihistamines introduced from 1942 to the mid-1980s, most of the second (new)-generation H(1)-antihistamines introduced subsequently have been investigated extensively with regard to clinical pharmacology, efficacy, and safety; moreover, they are relatively free from adverse effects and not causally linked with fatalities after overdose. Important advances include improved nasal and ophthalmic H(1)-antihistamines with rapid onset of action (in minutes) for allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis treatment, respectively, and effective and safe use of high (up to 4-fold) doses of oral second-generation H(1)-antihistamines for chronic urticaria treatment. New H(1)-antihistamines introduced for clinical use include oral formulations (bilastine and rupatadine), and ophthalmic formulations (alcaftadine and bepotastine). Clinical studies of H(3)-antihistamines with enhanced decongestant effects have been conducted in patients with allergic rhinitis. Additional novel compounds being studied include H(4)-antihistamines with anti-inflammatory effects in allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and other diseases. Antihistamines have a storied past and a promising future.

### Oral antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations for the common cold [^ff39cedf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although combination formulas containing antihistamines, decongestants, and/or analgesics are sold over-the-counter in large quantities for the common cold, the evidence for their effectiveness is limited. This is an update of a review first published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations compared with placebo or other active controls (excluding antibiotics) in reducing the duration of symptoms and alleviating symptoms (general feeling of illness, nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, and cough) in children and adults with the common cold.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE via EBSCOhost, Embase, CINAHL via EBSCOhost, LILACS, and Web of Science to 10 June 2021. We searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov on 10 June 2021.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations compared with placebo, other active treatment (excluding antibiotics), or no treatment in children and adults with the common cold.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We categorised the included trials according to the active ingredients.

Main Results

We identified 30 studies (6304 participants) including 31 treatment comparisons. The control intervention was placebo in 26 trials and an active substance (paracetamol, chlorphenindione + phenylpropanolamine + belladonna, diphenhydramine) in six trials (two trials had placebo as well as active treatment arms). Reporting of methods was generally poor, and there were large differences in study design, participants, interventions, and outcomes. Most of the included trials involved adult participants. Children were included in nine trials. Three trials included very young children (from six months to five years), and five trials included children aged 2 to 16. One trial included adults and children aged 12 years or older. The trials took place in different settings: university clinics, paediatric departments, family medicine departments, and general practice surgeries.  Antihistamine-decongestant: 14 trials (1298 participants). Eight trials reported on global effectiveness, of which six studies were pooled (281 participants on active treatment and 284 participants on placebo). The odds ratio (OR) of treatment failure was 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.48; moderate certainty evidence); number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3.9 (95% CI 3.03 to 5.2). On the final evaluation day (follow-up: 3 to 10 days), 55% of participants in the placebo group had a favourable response compared to 70% on active treatment. Of the two trials not pooled, one showed some global effect, whilst the other showed no effect. Adverse effects: the antihistamine-decongestant group experienced more adverse effects than the control group: 128/419 (31%) versus 100/423 (13%) participants suffered one or more adverse effects (OR 1.58, 95%CI 0.78 to 3.21; moderate certainty of evidence). Antihistamine-analgesic: four trials (1608 participants). Two trials reported on global effectiveness; data from one trial were presented (290 participants on active treatment and 292 participants on ascorbic acid). The OR of treatment failure was 0.33 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.46; moderate certainty evidence); NNTB 6.67 (95% CI 4.76 to 12.5). Forty-three per cent of participants in the control group and 70% in the active treatment group were cured after six days of treatment. The second trial also showed an effect in favour of the active treatment. Adverse effects: there were not significantly more adverse effects in the active treatment group compared to placebo (drowsiness, hypersomnia, sleepiness  10/152 versus 4/120; OR 1.64 (95 % CI 0.48 to 5.59; low certainty evidence). Analgesic-decongestant: seven trials (2575 participants). One trial reported on global effectiveness: 73% of participants in the analgesic-decongestant group reported a benefit compared with 52% in the control group (paracetamol) (OR of treatment failure 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.52; moderate certainty evidence; NNTB 4.7). Adverse effects: the decongestant-analgesic group experienced significantly more adverse effects than the control group (199/1122 versus 75/675; OR 1.62  95% CI 1.18 to 2.23; high certainty evidence; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH 17).  Antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant: six trials (1014 participants). Five trials reported on global effectiveness, of which two studies in adults could be pooled: global effect reported with active treatment (52%) and placebo (34%) was equivalent to a difference of less than one point on a four- or five-point scale; the OR of treatment failure was 0.47 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.67; low certainty evidence); NNTB 5.6 (95% CI 3.8 to 10.2). One trial in children aged 2 to 12 years, and two trials in adults found no beneficial effect. Adverse effects: in one trial 5/224 (2%) suffered adverse effects with the active treatment versus 9/208 (4%) with placebo. Two other trials reported no differences between treatment groups.

Authors' Conclusions

We found a lack of data on the effectiveness of antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant combinations for the common cold. Based on these scarce data, the effect on individual symptoms is probably too small to be clinically relevant. The current evidence suggests that antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant combinations have some general benefit in adults and older children. These benefits must be weighed against the risk of adverse effects. There is no evidence of effectiveness in young children. In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about adverse effects associated with the use of over-the-counter nasal preparations containing phenylpropanolamine.

### Diphenhydramine: time to move on? [^e82fd492]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Diphenhydramine is one of the most widely available, longest-used antihistamine medications but has many side effects including sedation and risk of toxicity in overdose including cardiac toxicity. It is frequently inappropriately used when newer, more favorable antihistamine medications are available. Second-generation antihistamines are also widely available and affordable, with many of the same desired effects as diphenhydramine and fewer, if any, of the undesirable side effects. Because of the negative side effects and wide availability of alternative antihistamine medications, it is definitively time to move on from diphenhydramine.

First-generation oral antihistamines for nonallergic rhinitis (NAR)/vasomotor rhinitis (VMR)—There are no DBPC trials evaluating the therapeutic efficacy and safety of first-generation oral antihistamines for NAR/VMR; some clinicians suggest that monitored use may be considered for bothersome postnasal drainage refractory to other therapies. Decisions should be individualized with physician–patient shared decision-making, patients should be carefully monitored, the lowest effective dose used, and agents discontinued if side effects occur; special caution is advised in frail elderly patients and in individuals with chronic disorders or those working with heavy machinery, driving, or flying.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^cb8c6a99]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Intranasal antihistamines for allergic rhinitis (AR)—recommendation and evidence profile: Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR, with a policy level of Option based on randomized controlled trials with minor limitations and observational studies and an overall equilibrium of benefit and harm. The aggregate evidence quality is Grade A and the level of confidence in evidence is high, but most trials were of short duration. Benefits include rapid onset and increased effectiveness over oral antihistamines for nasal congestion, while risks/harms/costs include increased cost relative to oral antihistamines, poor taste, sedation, more frequent dosing, epistaxis, and local side effects. The Guideline Development Group judged this class generally second-line after failure of nasal steroids or oral antihistamines due to poor acceptance, taste, and cost, though specific patients may be appropriate for first-line therapy; intentional vagueness is none and the role of patient preferences is large with shared decision making emphasized. Exclusions include that these agents are not approved for children younger than 5 years, and differences of opinion were minor.

### Treatment for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria: focus on oral antihistamines [^6e3a5e94]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of first- and newer-generation antihistamines for the management of allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), with a focus on management in the pharmacy.

Data Sources

A literature review was performed using MEDLINE (1966-October 2005), with no time or language restrictions. Key words or phrases used were histamine, antihistamine(s), first- and second-generation, allergic rhinitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, quality of life, impairment, sedation, cost-effectiveness, astemizole, cetirizine, desloratadine, diphenhydramine, fexofenadine, loratadine, hydroxyzine, ketotifen, and mizolastine. Additional references were found in the bibliographies of the articles cited.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials and other experimental studies of the use of antihistamines for the management of allergic rhinitis and CIU were selected. Review papers and guidelines were also included.

Data Synthesis

First-generation antihistamines are effective at ameliorating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and CIU; however, they are associated with adverse effects due to a lack of selectivity for the histamine H(1)-receptor and an ability to bind to cerebral H(1)-receptors. Newer-generation agents, in general, possess high H(1)-receptor selectivity and a low tendency to cross the blood-brain barrier, while maintaining efficacy. In general, safety at elevated doses has been demonstrated for the newer antihistamines, although higher rates of sedation and impairment have been reported with increasing doses for some agents.

Conclusions

Pharmacists can play an important role in the management of allergic rhinitis and CIU by considering the relative advantages of newer-generation agents when reviewing treatment options.

### Azelastine and olopatadine in the treatment of allergic rhinitis [^d2c92664]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature supporting current recommendations for nasal antihistamines as first-line therapy for allergic rhinitis.

Data Sources

Published articles in the peer-reviewed medical literature.

Study Selection

Clinical trials focusing on the efficacy, safety, and recommended uses of the currently approved nasal antihistamines in the United States: azelastine nasal spray, 0.1%, and olopatadine nasal spray, 0.6%.

Results

Azelastine nasal spray, 0.1%, and olopatadine nasal spray, 0.6%, have rapid onsets of action, are well tolerated, and have clinical efficacy for treating allergic rhinitis that is equal or superior to oral second-generation antihistamines. Both also have a clinically significant effect on nasal congestion. Azelastine is also approved for nonallergic rhinitis. Although older data suggest that intranasal steroids have greater clinical efficacy than nasal antihistamines, more recent comparisons in patients with mild to moderate disease have shown equal or noninferior efficacy. In addition, in contrast to oral antihistamines or leukotriene antagonists, the combination of a nasal antihistamine and intranasal steroid may provide additive benefits for treating patients with more severe disease.

Conclusion

The data support current recommendations for nasal antihistamines as first-line therapy for allergic rhinitis. Future studies should address possible as needed use, the use of premixed antihistamine-steroid combinations, and the treatment of mixed rhinitis.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^def45e52]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline—Oral antihistamines plus oral decongestants: “Oral antihistamines and oral decongestant combinations control AR symptoms better than either oral antihistamine or oral decongestant alone,” but adding a decongestant “increases side effects of insomnia, headache, dry mouth, and nervousness,” and “the potential for tolerance from chronic use of oral decongestants may be seen.” In one study, “24-hour extended-release pseudoephedrine (240 mg) caused less insomnia than 12-hour extended-release pseudoephedrine (120 mg) taken twice daily (4% vs 15%, P < .01),” and a meta-analysis found pseudoephedrine increased “systolic blood pressure (0.99 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.90)” and “heart rate (2.83 beats/min; 95% CI, 2.0 to 3.6)” with “no effect on diastolic blood pressure (0.63 mm Hg, 95% CI, −0.10 to 1.35).” Use is age-restricted: “not recommended for patients under 4 years of age,” and “extended-release, 120-mg, 12-hour dose is not recommended for patients under 12 years of age.”

### Guidance on completing a written allergy and anaphylaxis emergency plan [^59ed8572]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Allergy plan—mild reaction management and antihistamine use note that in a milk allergy cohort 53% of reported reactions were mild (defined as cutaneous symptoms [angioedema excluded], rhinitis, or conjunctivitis), and in a Canadian study of accidental peanut exposures 30% of exposures resulted only in mild symptoms; therefore, in the event of a mild allergic reaction involving isolated skin symptoms, mild facial or oral symptoms, or mild gastrointestinal tract discomfort, none of which meet the criteria for anaphylaxis, the use of oral antihistamines may be an option; emphasizing the option to observe and the option of using antihistamines allows the plan to be individualized; if antihistamine alone is not permitted, then no antihistamine would be listed, mild symptoms would not be treated, and close observation and watching for possible progression would be indicated, with an option to list allergens under “special situation” to indicate that any symptoms would require the administration of epinephrine.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^30e575e1]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common diseases affecting adults. It is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States today and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall. AR is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generates $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually. It can impair quality of life and, through loss of work and school attendance, is responsible for as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. Not surprisingly, myriad diagnostic tests and treatments are used in managing this disorder, yet there is considerable variation in their use. This clinical practice guideline was undertaken to optimize the care of patients with AR by addressing quality improvement opportunities through an evaluation of the available evidence and an assessment of the harm-benefit balance of various diagnostic and management options.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to address quality improvement opportunities for all clinicians, in any setting, who are likely to manage patients with AR as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The guideline is intended to be applicable for both pediatric and adult patients with AR. Children under the age of 2 years were excluded from the clinical practice guideline because rhinitis in this population may be different than in older patients and is not informed by the same evidence base. The guideline is intended to focus on a limited number of quality improvement opportunities deemed most important by the working group and is not intended to be a comprehensive reference for diagnosing and managing AR. The recommendations outlined in the guideline are not intended to represent the standard of care for patient management, nor are the recommendations intended to limit treatment or care provided to individual patients.

Action Statements

The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend intranasal steroids for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR whose symptoms affect their quality of life. The development group also made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend oral second-generation/less sedating antihistamines for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should make the clinical diagnosis of AR when patients present with a history and physical examination consistent with an allergic cause and 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing. Findings of AR consistent with an allergic cause include, but are not limited to, clear rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, pale discoloration of the nasal mucosa, and red and watery eyes. (2) Clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR who do not respond to empiric treatment, or when the diagnosis is uncertain, or when knowledge of the specific causative allergen is needed to target therapy. (3) Clinicians should assess patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR for, and document in the medical record, the presence of associated conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media. (4) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with AR who have inadequate response to symptoms with pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls. The panel recommended against (1) clinicians routinely performing sinonasal imaging in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of AR and (2) clinicians offering oral leukotriene receptor antagonists as primary therapy for patients with AR. The panel group made the following options: (1) Clinicians may advise avoidance of known allergens or may advise environmental controls (ie, removal of pets; the use of air filtration systems, bed covers, and acaricides [chemical agents formulated to kill dust mites]) in patients with AR who have identified allergens that correlate with clinical symptoms. (2) Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR. (3) Clinicians may offer combination pharmacologic therapy in patients with AR who have inadequate response to pharmacologic monotherapy. (4) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a surgeon who can offer, inferior turbinate reduction in patients with AR with nasal airway obstruction and enlarged inferior turbinates who have failed medical management. (5) Clinicians may offer acupuncture, or refer to a clinician who can offer acupuncture, for patients with AR who are interested in nonpharmacologic therapy. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the use of herbal therapy for patients with AR.

### Antihistamine use in children [^8953934c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

This review provides an overview of the use of antihistamines in children. We discuss types of histamine receptors and their mechanism of action, absorption, onset and duration of action of first-generation and second-generation H(1)-antihistamines, as well as elimination of H(1)-antihistamines which has important implications for dosing in children. The rationale for the use of H(1)-antihistamines is explored for the relief of histamine-mediated symptoms in a variety of allergic conditions including: non-anaphylactic allergic reactions, atopic eczema (AE), allergic rhinitis (AR) and conjunctivitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and whether they have a role in the management of intermittent and chronic cough, anaphylaxis, food protein-induced gastrointestinal allergy and asthma prevention. Second-generation H(1)-antihistamines are preferable to first-generation H(1)-antihistamines in the management of non-anaphylactic allergic reactions, AR, AE and CSU due to: their better safety profile, including minimal cognitive and antimuscarinic side effects and a longer duration of action. We offer some guidance as to the choices of H(1)-antihistamines available currently and their use in specific clinical settings. H(1)-antihistamine class, availability, licensing, age and dosing administration, recommended indications in allergic conditions and modalities of delivery for the 12 more commonly used H(1)-antihistamines in children are also tabulated.

### Oral antihistamine / analgesic / decongestant combinations (...) [^e3af080d]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are over-the-counter formulas containing antihistamines, analgesics, and/or decongestants effective in treating symptoms of the common cold. Evidence-Based Answer Antihistamine/analgesic/decongestant combinations have some general benefit in adults and older children. However, these benefits must be weighed against the risk of adverse effects. There is no evidence of effectiveness in young children.
1. On the final evaluation day, more patients in the treatment group were judged to have had a favorable response; however, the antihistamine/decongestant group also experienced more adverse effects than the placebo group.

Four trials evaluated antihistamine/analgesic combinations, including two that reported on global effectiveness; data could not be pooled because one of the trials used an active control. In the remaining trial that provided data on global effectiveness, the proportion of participants who were completely cured at the end of the trial was 70% with treatment vs. 43% with control, with an NNT of 7. The antihistamine/analgesic group did not experience notably more adverse effects compared with placebo. Seven trials evaluated analgesic/decongestant combinations; one trial demonstrated that treatment was beneficial in subjective global effectiveness.

Of the six trials that evaluated a combination of antihistamine, analgesic, and decongestant, five trials reported on global effectiveness; two studies in adults could be pooled. More participants reported the treatment as beneficial when measured the morning after taking an evening dose. However, when asked on days 3 and 5, participants reported that treatment provided no notable benefit.

### Atopic dermatitis: update on skin-directed management: clinical report [^8eee6c09]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Itch control—Pruritus is a major, multifactorial burden in atopic dermatitis, and supportive measures alongside active disease control are emphasized; antihistamines may help some patients, with second-generation agents favored for safety. It can be difficult to eliminate itch, but supportive measures include avoiding irritants, minimizing triggers, and continuing skin-directed anti-inflammatory and barrier-restorative treatments; treatment of active AD most improves itch, oral antihistamines do not directly affect dermatitis yet may benefit some patients, and nonsedating second-generation antihistamines are not associated with the same side effect profile as first-generation agents and have been shown to be safe to use long-term.

### Evaluating approved medications to treat allergic rhinitis in the United States: an evidence-based review of efficacy for nasal symptoms by class [^dd7e38fc]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate how well the medications currently approved in the United States for allergic rhinitis (AR) treat nasal symptoms when examined according to Food and Drug Administration-indicated uses and dosages.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966 onward), EMBASE (1974 onward), and the Cochrane Library (2007) were systematically searched according to the following criteria defined at a roundtable meeting of the authors: randomized controlled trial, at least a 2-week duration, and approved indication and dosage in the United States.

Study Selection

Data from studies that met the inclusion criteria were extracted into evidence tables, which were reviewed twice by the full panel of authors. Individual panel members also were asked to comment on abstracts, articles, and summary tables based on their known expertise. The entire faculty approved the selection of studies included in this review.

Results

Fifty-four randomized, placebo-controlled studies involving more than 14,000 adults and 1,580 children with AR met the criteria for review: 38 studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR; n = 11,980 adults and 946 children) and 12 studies of perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR; n = 3,800 adults and 366 children). The median percentage changes from baseline for total nasal symptom score for SAR were as follows: nasal antihistamines, -22.2%; oral antihistamines, -23.5%; intranasal steroids (INSs), -40.7%; and placebo, -15.0%. For PAR, the changes were as follows: oral antihistamines, -51.4%; INSs, -37.3%; and placebo, -24.8%. Data for mediator antagonists were limited.

Conclusions

The data, although limited, confirm that INSs produce the greatest improvements in nasal symptoms in patients with SAR. In addition, INSs are effective for PAR, but the data were of variable quality, and oral antihistamines may be equally effective for some patients. The reporting of published data should be standardized to permit better comparisons in future studies.

### Diphenhydramine as an analgesic adjuvant in refractory cancer pain [^690bedd5]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2001). Low credibility.

Clinical and animal data suggest that antihistamines may have efficacy in the management of pain. While many mechanisms of action have been proposed for the analgesic action of antihistamines, the exact mechanism is unknown. Controlled clinical trials in different pain models have demonstrated that antihistamines have direct and adjuvant analgesic activity. We report three patients with advanced cancer pain refractory to adjuvants and oral, intravenous, and epidural opioids, who achieved sustained pain relief after the repeated administration of diphenhydramine. Diphenhydramine may be useful in the treatment of neuropathic and nociceptive pain that has failed to respond to treatment with opioids and adjuvant analgesics. We suggest a starting dose of 25 mg of oral or parenteral diphenhydramine every 6 to 8 hours, with titration to effect.

### Intranasal versus oral treatments for allergic rhinitis: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^475fd3f1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatments for allergic rhinitis include intranasal or oral medications.

Objective

To perform a systematic review with meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness of intranasal corticosteroids or antihistamines versus oral antihistamines or leukotriene receptor antagonists in improving allergic rhinitis symptoms and quality of life.

Methods

We searched four bibliographic databases and three clinical trial datasets for randomized controlled trials (1) assessing patients aged 12 years and older with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis, and (2) comparing intranasal corticosteroids or antihistamines versus oral antihistamines or leukotriene receptor antagonists. We performed a meta-analysis of the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS), Total Ocular Symptom Score, Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ), development of adverse events, and withdrawals owing to adverse events. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation.

Results

We included 35 studies, most of which assessed patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and displayed an unclear risk of bias. Superiority of intranasal treatments was found for all assessed outcomes. Intranasal corticosteroids were more effective than oral antihistamines at improving the TNSS (mean difference [MD], -0.86; 95% CI, -1.21 to -0.51; I 2 = 70%), Total Ocular Symptom Score (MD, -0.36; 95% CI, -0.56 to -0.17; I 2 = 0%), and RQLQ (MD, -0.88; 95% CI, -1.15 to -0.61; I 2 = 0%), which were mostly associated with clinically meaningful improvements. Superiority of intranasal corticosteroids at improving the TNSS was also found against oral leukotriene receptor antagonists (MD, -1.05; 95% CI, -1.33 to -0.77). Intranasal antihistamines were more effective than oral antihistamines at improving the TNSS (MD, -0.47; 95% CI, -0.81 to -0.14; I 2 = 0%) and RQLQ (MD, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.56 to -0.06; I 2 = 0%).

Conclusions

Randomized controlled trials suggest that intranasal treatments are more effective than oral treatments at improving symptoms and quality of life in seasonal allergic rhinitis.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^977bd826]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

JTFPP rhinitis pharmacotherapy—antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), and systemic corticosteroids state that we recommend against prescribing a first-generation antihistamine and are in favor of a second-generation antihistamine when prescribing an oral antihistamine for the treatment of AR, we suggest that the clinician not select oral LTRA montelukast for the initial treatment of AR and note that serious neuropsychiatric events have been reported and that montelukast should be used to treat AR only in patients who are not treated effectively with or cannot tolerate other alternative therapies, we recommend that the clinician not select an oral LTRA for the treatment of nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), we suggest that for the treatment of very severe or intractable AR the clinician may consider a short course (5-7 d) of oral corticosteroids, and we suggest that for the treatment of very severe or intractable AR the clinician not prescribe a depot parenteral corticosteroid for AR due to potential risks.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^92268352]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Regarding the use of anti H2 antihistamines, most guidelines deleted this point but the American guidelines.

Should treatment for CSU be provided on-demand or in a sustained manner? : The beneficial effects of nonsedating H 1 -antihistamines given on demand appear to be low.

Key point: Nonsedating H 1 -antihistamines should be given in a sustained manner.

Does antihistamines induced somnolence affect its use of in CSU? : It is well known that H 1 -antihistamines cause sedation, somnolence and fatigue, leading to impairment of cognitive function, memory and psychomotor performance. A position paper of the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA 2 LEN) highlights the risk posed by the fact that first-generation H 1 -antihistamines, all of which are sedating, are generally regarded as safe simply because of their long-standing use. Given the unwanted side-effects and potential dangers of first-generation H 1 -antihistamines, newer, nonsedating second-generation H 1 -antihistamines with superior risk/benefit ratios (which are widely available at competitive prices) are strongly recommended.

Key point: Nonsedating antihistamines are recommended for CSU treatment.

### Epinephrine for first-aid management of anaphylaxis [^9e431ec4]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Progression unpredictability and limits of antihistamines—Even physicians with years of experience cannot determine at the onset whether an episode will remain mild or escalate over minutes to become life-threatening, and although some oral H1-antihistamines relieve itching and hives within 30 or 40 minutes, severe, life-threatening respiratory and/or cardiovascular symptoms can appear suddenly after the hives have disappeared.

---

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^2cee2836]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Key point: Given the safety of most antihistamines, doses can be increased up to four times the standard dose on an individual basis.

Can switching from one antihistamine to another attain an individualized response? : According to the British American and EAACI 2014 guidelines, all patients should be offered a choice between two or more nonsedating H 1 -antihistamines, because individual differences in response and tolerance to different antihistamines have been reported.

Is it useful to combine different antihistamines (i.e. sedating and nonsedating)? : In patients with severe, recalcitrant urticaria for whom the standard dose is not effective, combinations of antihistamines are frequently used as another way of updosing. This might involve, for example, two different second-generation antihistamines, or a second-generation antihistamine in the morning and a first-generation antihistamine in the evening. However, first-generation antihistamines are no longer recommended in chronic urticaria, and the clinical benefit of combining antihistamines is probably limited when H 1 -receptors are already occupied by another H 1 -antihistamine.

Key point: There are no studies that demonstrate that treatment with the combined use of sedating and nonsedating antihistamines is more effective than updosing the same antihistamine.

Is it useful to combine H 1 - and H 2 -antihistamines? : Several relatively small studies have shown that combined use of H 1 -antihistamines and H 2 -antihistamines (cimetidine, ranitidine) may be more effective than using H 1 -antihistamines alone. This effect is related to an increase in the plasma levels of H 1 -antihistamine, most likely due to a pharmacologic interaction with the isoenzyme cytochrome P-450 in the liver. This phenomenon does not occur when cimetidine is associated with cetirizine. Accordingly, a review of recent studies does not allow confident decision-making about the use of H 2 -receptor antagonists in urticaria.

### Role of antihistamines in ocular allergy [^55fdb075]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Although H(1) antihistamines are commonly used to treat allergic disorders and have demonstrated efficacy in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, data on the effects of these agents specifically on ocular symptoms are limited. Oral H(1) antihistamines inhibit some symptoms of pruritus and erythema in laboratory models and have been shown to be superior to placebo for relief of symptoms in clinical trials. Eye drops typically provide faster relief of ocular symptoms than oral agents, and combination therapy with a topical agent and an oral agent has been found to be superior to the oral agent alone. In general, oral H(1) antihistamines have been considered superior to intranasal corticosteroids for relief of ocular symptoms, but some studies have shown equal efficacy for these agents, or even superior efficacy for intranasal corticosteroids.

### Oral antihistamines alone vs in combination with leukotriene receptor antagonists for allergic rhinitis: a meta-analysis [^06bbbf60]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective To evaluate whether an adjuvant therapy of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) based on oral H1-antihistamines (H1) can increase efficacy of allergic rhinitis (AR) treatment. Data Sources The search involved databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception up to September 23, 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared efficacy of LTRAs + H1 vs H1 alone were eligible. Review Methods Pooled comparative effects were measured using weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analysis comparing seasonal vs perennial AR was prespecified to explore the source of heterogeneity. The evidence quality of each outcome was assessed by the GRADE approach. Results A total of 8 RCTs were included (n = 1886), and all measured outcomes used scaled scores. Compared with H1 alone, H1 + LTRAs were superior to improve overall daytime (WMD, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.19 to -0.03, high quality) and composite (WMD, -0.12; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.01; low quality) nasal symptoms. Specifically, H1 + LTRAs had better efficacy against composite nasal rhinorrhea, sneezing, and daytime itching but not congestion. The effects were more pronounced in patients with perennial AR compared to those with seasonal AR. There were no significant differences in nighttime nasal symptoms and eye symptoms between the 2 groups. Conclusion The current evidence suggests that LTRAs + H1 can increase the therapeutic efficacy against daytime and composite nasal symptoms, including rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching; however, it does not affect nighttime nasal symptoms and eye symptoms. The patients with perennial AR may benefit more from the combination therapy.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^e37a1264]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Second-generation oral antihistamine combinations and montelukast-specific cautions—OAH 2G + INCS have not been shown to have any additive benefit over using just the INCS. For OAH 2G + LTRA, there is lack of adequate evidence of added efficacy to make a specific recommendation for or against this combination versus monotherapy; with the serious neuropsychiatric events reported with montelukast, this combination should rarely be used, and montelukast should generally be reserved for patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^f06d6bff]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema—antihistamines—In most cases antihistamines are effective therapy, and after eliminating identifiable triggers, high-quality evidence supports antihistamines as first-line therapy. Second-generation antihistamines are designed to limit transfer across the blood-brain barrier and have less sedating effects than first-generation agents; first-generation antihistamines can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills and should be prescribed with caution in older adults, and higher than FDA-approved doses of some second-generation antihistamines can cause sedation. Second-generation antihistamines are effective for acute urticaria when used regularly and titrated to an effective dose in most patients, with reassuring long-term safety, even in small children; other medications with potent antihistaminic activity, such as doxepin, might have efficacy when FDA-approved antihistamines lack sufficient efficacy, and Histamine 2 blockers, in combination with H1-antihistamines, might be considered, although the evidence supporting this combination is weak.

### Antihistamines: do they work? Further well-controlled trials involving larger samples are needed [^1073f102]. Allergy (2004). Low credibility.

Histamine is one of the most important steps in the phlogistic allergic reaction. Its activity is due to the link to specific receptors on the cellular surface. H1-receptors of second generation are the most currently prescribed drugs in allergic diseases for their high selectivity, little or no central sedative effect, rapid onset of action and long half lives. Antihistamines can modulate part of immunological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation reducing mediator release and expression of adhesion molecules, regulating the release of cytokines, chemokines and consequently inflammatory cells recruitment. The anti-inflammatory effects of cetirizine, desloratadine and levocetirizine are reviewed. Quality of life is considered too, as a main parameter in a global evaluation of the antihistamine's effects.

### Allergic rhinitis and urticaria burden and antihistamine treatment options in Thailand: a modified Delphi study [^58139633]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Allergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic urticaria impose significant socioeconomic burdens on lower-income countries. Despite the availability of evidence-based guidelines, their implementation varies, and comprehensive data on these allergic conditions are notably lacking in Thailand.

Objectives

We sought to describe current management strategies for AR and urticaria in Thailand.

Methods

The Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Association of Thailand used a modified Delphi method to explore consensus on management strategies for AR and urticaria. Clinicians with expertise in these conditions provided input through a web-based questionnaire. The survey assessed disease burden in Thailand, its impact on quality of life, and the use of H 1 -antihistimine treatment options.

Results

In total, 105 experts, mainly in allergy and immunology, with 70% having more than 10 years of clinical practice, provided input. Consensus was achieved on 22 (88%) of the 25 statements. Second-generation antihistamines were preferred as initial treatment for AR and urticaria because of their reduced sedation and lack of anticholinergic effects. Almost all participants (98.1%) recommended these antihistamines for acute and chronic urticaria. Additionally, 87.6% of the respondents favored up-dosing a single antihistamine agent for managing chronic urticaria. The benefits of orally disintegrating antihistamines were particularly noted for their ease of administration and patient compliance.

Conclusion

Results indicate a knowledge gap in evidence-based practices among Thai clinicians. Addressing this gap through enhancing clinical guideline adherence and encouraging pharmacist involvement in patient care can improve access to medication and better disease management, ultimately improving patient outcomes while reducing the socioeconomic burden of AR and urticaria.

### Allergic rhinitis: treatment based on patient profiles [^7c3342fb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is a common medical condition characterized by nasal, throat, and ocular itching; rhinorrhea; sneezing; nasal congestion; and, less frequently, cough. The treatment of allergic rhinitis should control these symptoms without adversely affecting daily activities or cognitive performance and should prevent sequelae such as asthma exacerbation or sinusitis. This review describes a stepwise approach to treatment of allergic rhinitis derived from a synthesis of clinical trial results, patient preferences, and real-world tolerability data. Key clinical considerations include frequency and intensity of symptoms, patient age, comorbidities, compliance with treatment regimens (influenced by formulation, route and frequency of administration), and effects on quality of life. Oral second-generation antihistamines, versus first-generation agents and inhaled corticosteroids, should be considered first-line treatment because they provide rapid relief of most allergic rhinitis symptoms without safety and tolerability issues. Additional therapeutic agents can then be added or substituted based on individual symptom response.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^09f4b5fb]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Diphenhydramine

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation H1 antihistamine approved in some countries as an OTC antitussive, including the USA and the UK. In Germany, diphenhydramine 50 mg is approved as a hypnotic or antiemetic only. First-generation antitussives in combination with oral decongestants are recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence Based Guidelines for the treatment of cough in common cold and in the so-called upper airway cough syndrome.However, despite the title of those guidelines, this recommendation is based on expert opinion.In cough challenge studies in healthy participantsand patients with acute viral respiratory infection (diphenhydramine combination syrup with decongestant) in adults efficacy could have been established.However, no symptom or objective cough monitoring-based studies are available for acute cough. There is a clear-cut discrepancy between evidence of efficacy and broad clinical use of diphenhydramine/decongestant combinations for acute cough—despite an important sedative effect (dizziness)—especially in the USA. Table 1 evaluates how European antitussives match up to the modern metrics in cough research.

### Management of allergic rhinitis: a review for the community pharmacist [^b40ac447]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Allergic rhinitis is a highly prevalent disease affecting the quality of life of millions of North Americans. The management of allergic rhinitis includes allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy, and immunotherapy. Current pharmacologic options include oral and intranasal antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, oral and intranasal decongestants, oral and intranasal anticholinergics, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. Second-generation oral antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids are the mainstays of treatment, with practice guidelines recommending intranasal corticosteroids as first-line treatment for moderate to severe allergic rhinitis.

Methods

Clinical trials studying a widely used intranasal corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate, in comparison with second-generation oral antihistamines, cetirizine, loratadine, or montelukast, were selected to support the comparative review of the efficacy and tolerability of these 2 classes of medications. Studies evaluating the combination of fluticasone propionate with an oral antihistamine were also included to review the efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy to treat allergic rhinitis.

Findings

Studies comparing fluticasone propionate with cetirizine had mixed findings; fluticasone propionate was found to have equal or greater efficacy in reducing nasal symptom scores. Combination therapy of fluticasone propionate and the oral antihistamine, loratadine, was found to have efficacy comparable with that of intranasal corticosteroid alone.

Implications

Many of these medications are available over the counter in the pharmacy, and the community pharmacist plays an important role as part of the patient's health care team in managing this disease. Pharmacotherapy is patient-specific, based on type, duration, and severity of symptoms, comorbidities, prior treatment, and patient preference. This article aims to provide an overview of the pathophysiology, available treatment options, guideline recommendations, and role of the pharmacist for this disease.

Intranasal antihistamines (INAH)—efficacy, onset, and approvals: “For relief of nasal symptoms of SAR, INAH are equal to or superior to oral antihistamines and may benefit patients for whom oral antihistamine treatment fails.” “INAH have a more rapid onset of action than INCS and oral antihistamines do, are more effective than oral antihistamines in the control of nasal congestion, and provide a favorable safety profile.” “Comparisons of INCS to INAH for reduction of nasal symptoms are conflicting, with some showing equality and some showing superiority of INCS.” “In a systematic review of INCS and INAH, INAH provide comparable relief of allergic eye symptoms.” “Two INAH, azelastine and olopatadine, are approved by the FDA for the treatment of SAR. Azelastine is also approved for the treatment of PAR and VMR.” INAH onset is fast: “INAH have a rapid onset of action in AR ranging from 15 to 30 minutes, compared with an average of 150 minutes for oral antihistamines.” They “have been shown to improve nasal as well as nonnasal AR symptoms and QOL.” For nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), “Azelastine has also been shown to be clinically effective,” but for olopatadine “there are no placebo-controlled trials to support its efficacy in relief of NAR symptoms.”

### Ebastine in allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria [^802a026f]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Histamine is a key mediator in the development of allergy symptoms, and oral H(1)-antihistamines are among the most widely used treatments for symptomatic relief in conditions such as allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria. Ebastine is a second-generation antihistamine which has been shown to be an effective treatment for both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis. In controlled clinical trials in adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, ebastine 10 mg once-daily improved symptoms to a significantly greater extent than placebo and to a similar extent as loratadine 10 mg and cetirizine 10 mg (both once-daily), while ebastine 20 mg proved to be more effective than these two comparator antihistamines. In addition, ebastine was significantly more effective than placebo at relieving the symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria. Ebastine provides efficacy throughout the 24-h dosing interval with once-daily administration and clinical benefit is seen from the first day of treatment. Small studies have found beneficial effects for ebastine in patients with other disorders, including cold urticaria, dermographic urticaria, atopic asthma, mosquito bites and (in combination with pseudoephedrine) the common cold. In addition to the regular ebastine tablet, a fast-dissolving tablet (FDT) formulation, which disintegrates in the mouth without the aid of a drink, is also available. It has been shown to be bioequivalent to the regular tablet, and to be significantly more effective than desloratadine at reducing histamine-induced cutaneous wheals. A number of patient surveys demonstrated that the majority of individuals who tried the fast-dissolving formulation reported it to be convenient for use, fast-acting and preferred it to their previous antihistamine medication. Perhaps most importantly, a large proportion of patients indicated that they would prefer to use this new formulation in the future. Ebastine has a rapid onset of action and it can be administered once-daily, with or without food. Dose modifications are not needed in elderly patients, or in those with renal or mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Ebastine is generally well-tolerated, and clinical studies showed that at usual therapeutic doses of 10 and 20 mg once-daily, it had no clinically relevant adverse effects on cognitive function and psychomotor performance or on cardiovascular function. In conclusion, ebastine is an effective and generally well-tolerated treatment for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. In addition to the regular tablet formulation, ebastine is available as a FDT, providing a treatment option that is particularly convenient for patients.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^764beb72]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) step-care antihistamine-based therapy—A “step-care approach has been developed for the management of CU,” with second-generation antihistamines “considered first-line agents (step 1).” For patients not controlled on US Food and Drug Administration–approved monotherapy, “several treatment options can be used (step 2),” and “Higher doses of second-generation antihistamines might provide more efficacy, but data are limited and conflicting for certain agents.” Add-on options where the “Addition of H2-antagonists or leukotriene receptor antagonists can be considered” and “First-generation antihistamines can also be considered” are followed by step 3, in which “Treatment with hydroxyzine or doxepin can be considered.” Systemic corticosteroids “are frequently used… but no controlled studies have demonstrated efficacy,” although “short-term use (eg, 1-3 weeks’ duration) might be required,” while “long-term use… should be avoided as much as possible.” Patients not adequately controlled “on maximal antihistamine therapy (eg, step 3 care) might be considered to have refractory CU.”

### An algorithm recommendation for the pharmacological management of allergic rhinitis in the UK: a consensus statement from an expert panel [^0ff62251]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Management in primary care—treatment

Figure 2a shows an algorithm for the treatment of AR in primary care, adapted by the consensus group from the 2008 British Society of Allergy & Clinical Immunology (BSACI) guidelinesin order to simplify treatment in primary care and incorporate recently available treatment options.

Fig. 2 
Treatment algorithm for allergic rhinitis in (a) primary care and (b) secondary care. AH: anti-histamine; AZE: azelastine; IgE: immunoglobulin E; INCS: intranasal corticosteroid; LTRA: leukotriene receptor antagonist; OAH: oral antihistamine; OC: oral corticosteroid; Rx: treatment; SPT: skin prick test; Sx: symptoms. (a) *You may consider the addition of an OAH to INCS. However, scientific evidence shows that adding an OAH to INCS provides no additional benefit over INCS alone. † This consensus group does not recommend routine early use of oral corticosteroids (OC); OC use should be reserved for short-term acute severe symptoms. (b) *Evidence for the benefit of these add-ons is lacking. Adapted from BSACI Scadding 2008.

Education

Patients should be educated on the nature of AR, allergen avoidance, available treatments (including safety and potential side effects), and be given realistic expectations of the results of therapy. Treatment failure may be related to poor technique in the use of nasal sprays and drops and, therefore, appropriate training is essential.

Treatment options

Nasal douching

Saline douching is a safe, inexpensive treatment, demonstrated to reduce symptoms in children and adults with seasonal rhinitis. It is more commonly used in mainland Europe than in the UK. In our opinion it has only a limited role in the management of AR, and there is little objective data to support its use.

Oral/topical non-sedating antihistamines

Oral and topical non-sedating AHs are recommended as first-line therapy for mild-moderate intermittent and mild persistent AR. The therapeutic effect of intranasal AH is superior to that that of oral AH,with the additional benefit of a faster onset of action (i.e. within 15 mins).Patients responsive to AH therapy should be instructed to continue therapy during periods of allergen exposure. Those non-responsive to therapy (e.g. symptomatic after 2 weeks) should be stepped up.

### Guidance on completing a written allergy and anaphylaxis emergency plan [^128eb0c2]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Allergy and anaphylaxis—second-generation antihistamines and cetirizine use are characterized by fewer central nervous system effects and comparable efficacy to diphenhydramine for certain mild reactions, as sedation and impairment in cognitive function can complicate assessment; second-generation H1 antihistamines are significantly less likely to cause these adverse effects, and in a randomized double-blind study of 70 allergic reactions during oral food challenge cetirizine had similar efficacy and onset of action compared with diphenhydramine in treating cutaneous symptoms during acute food-induced allergic reactions, supporting that cetirizine is a good option to consider for isolated mild symptoms.

### Treatment of allergic rhinitis [^4b1f2aa4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis, a common and often debilitating disease marked by rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing, is on the increase worldwide. Treatment involves allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy, and, in selected cases, immunotherapy. This overview describes the characteristics, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. The major contributing allergens of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis are identified. Pharmacotherapy is described within the context of treatment guidelines developed by the major asthma and allergy professional organizations. Oral H1 antihistamines are first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate allergic rhinitis. The newer, nonsedating agents are recommended over first-generation antihistamines. Some of the newer oral antihistamines, such as cetirizine, desloratadine, and fexofenadine, have been shown to relieve the symptom of nasal congestion. Intranasal steroids are first-line therapy for patients with more severe symptoms.

### First do no harm: managing antihistamine impairment in patients with allergic rhinitis [^c31077ca]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Antihistamines are effective medications that have been used for decades in the management of allergic rhinitis; however, they may be administered or selected in an inappropriate fashion and may be the source of drug-related morbidity. Our objective is to present relevant background information and an expert consensus statement on the use of antihistamines in treatment of allergic rhinitis. In July 2002, 14 experts in allergy, clinical immunology, pharmacology, and impairment assessment were invited to participate in a roundtable conference to present current concepts and develop a consensus statement on the clinical management of allergic rhinitis with antihistamines. Many of the antihistamines used to treat allergic rhinitis, as well as the disease itself, may produce sedation, impairment, and reduced quality of life. Allergic rhinitis is more appropriately managed with the relatively nonimpairing second-generation antihistamines (eg, loratadine, desloratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine), because older agents (eg, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and brompheniramine) produce sedation and impairment and worsen sleep architecture. Although there is some debate surrounding the varying degrees of efficacy of second-generation antihistamines, it is known that some agents may produce varying levels of drowsiness or impairment, especially at higher than recommended doses. The differences with regard to safety among the second-generation antihistamines are smaller than are the differences between the first and second generations. A nonsedating, nonimpairing (even at higher than recommended doses), second-generation antihistamine is preferred for all patients, particularly those with a higher risk for the development of adverse effects. We recommend that primary care and specialist physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, and all other health professionals involved in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic rhinitis follow this consensus document and share this information with patients for whom antihistamine therapy is recommended. In addition, further epidemiologic studies on the effects of antihistamines should be performed.

### First-generation antihistamines and seizures in young children [^406708ae]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of prescriptions of first-generation antihistamines with seizure events in young children?

Findings

In this cohort study of 3178 children in Korea, prescriptions of a first-generation antihistamine were associated with a 22.0% higher seizure risk in children, especially in those aged 6 to 24 months.

Meaning

These findings reinforce the importance of cautious first-generation antihistamine prescription in young children and underline the need for further research to fully understand associations between antihistamine use and seizure risk.

### Prospects for antihistamines in the treatment of asthma [^7e4d67ad]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Antihistamines have been evaluated as potential therapies for asthma for more than 50 years. With first-generation compounds, side effects prevented effective dosing. By reviewing published studies of the effectiveness of terfenadine, cetirizine, and loratadine in clinical asthma, evidence for the relevant effect of the second-generation antihistamines on bronchial asthma can be found. Terfenadine, at doses of 120 or 180 mg twice a day, reduced symptoms and improved pulmonary function in mild and moderate allergic asthma but was ineffective in severe perennial asthma. Fexofenadine at doses used for allergic rhinitis had little effect on seasonal allergic asthma. Research is ongoing to determine the effects of higher doses of fexofenadine. In 5 studies, cetirizine at doses of 10 to 20 mg, once or twice daily, consistently improved asthma symptoms compared with placebo or terfenadine 60 mg twice a day in 2 cases, whereas in 2 studies, loratadine at doses of 10 to 20 mg daily has not produced significant improvement in asthma. However, loratadine 5 mg combined with 60 mg of pseudo-ephedrine twice a day significantly improved both asthma symptoms and peak expiratory flow. Similarly, the combination of loratadine 20 mg and the leukotriene-receptor antagonist montelukast improved asthma symptoms, peak expiratory flow, and beta-agonist use over montelukast alone. Therefore, there might be a role for second- and third-generation antihistamines in treating mild and moderate asthma, which might require administering doses greater than those commonly used to treat allergic rhinitis. If higher doses are sedative, the addition of decongestants or leukotriene-receptor antagonists might enhance the effects of lower doses of the antihistamines.

### Oral antihistamine / decongestant / analgesic combinations (...) [^37fa8d0f]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Antihistamine/decongestant: 12 trials. Eight trials reported on global effectiveness and six could be pooled. The odds ratio of treatment failure was 0.
27. Antihistamine/analgesic: three trials. Two reported on global effectiveness, and data from one study were presented. The OR of treatment failure was 0. 33 and the NNTB was 6.
67. After six days of treatment, 43 percent of participants in the control group were cured, compared with 70 percent in the active treatment group. The second study also showed an effect in favor of active treatment. Analgesic/decongestant: six trials.

One trial reported on global effectiveness: 73 percent of participants on active treatment benefited, compared with 52 percent of the control group, who took paracetamol. The OR was 0.
28. Antihistamine/decongestant/analgesic: five trials. Four trials reported on global effectiveness, and two could be pooled. Reported global effect was 52 percent with active treatment and 34 percent with placebo. The OR of treatment failure was 0. 47 and the NNTB was 5.
6. Currently, no antiviral medications are available to treat the common cold, so the goal of care is symptom relief. All of the four combination medications in this analysis produced greater overall symptom relief compared with the control.

1 The antihistamine/decongestant trials reported the greatest benefit, with four patients needing to be treated for one additional patient to have symptom improvement. However, because the confidence intervals overlapped, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that one combination provides more benefit than another.

### Time-dependent inhibition of histamine-induced cutaneous responses by oral and intramuscular diphenhydramine and oral fexofenadine [^1d17b864]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Diphenhydramine is often the treatment of choice for acute urticarial or allergic reactions despite its adverse effects of sedation and impairment. Second- and third-generation histamine1-antihistamines are generally devoid of these adverse effects but are typically not used because of a perceived slower onset of action.

Objective

To examine the time-dependent effects of oral fexofenadine and oral and intramuscular diphenhydramine to reduce histamine-induced wheal-and-flare responses.

Methods

Eighteen healthy patients were included in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-way, randomized, crossover study with oral fexofenadine (180 mg) and oral and intramuscular diphenhydramine (50 mg). Histamine-induced skin tests were performed before and more than 6 hours subsequent to dosing. The primary end point was time to induce a 50% reduction in histamine-induced flare. Secondary end points included change from baseline at each time point in wheal-and-flare responses and area under the curve at more than 6 hours for flare.

Results

No significant differences were found in the 50% inhibitory responses of histamine-induced flares among the 3 groups (P = .09). No significant differences were found among the 3 groups in change from baseline at each time point except for 30 minutes during which fexofenadine had no inhibitory effect. Area under the curve analyses for wheal-and-flare responses revealed no differences among treatments at more than 6 hours.

Conclusion

Diphenhydramine tended to work more rapidly than fexofenadine, but the differences were not statistically significant. Given the adverse effect profile of diphenhydramine, but only marginal onset of action advantage, the risk-to-benefit ratio may be more favorable for oral fexofenadine when treating an acute urticarial or allergic reaction.

### The effect of oral antihistamines on the sweating response during heat stress in adults [^bac19c1a]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

The World Allergy Organization confirms the prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) has increased worldwide due to climate change—inflicting 1 in 5 people globally. Global warming and elevations in atmospheric carbon dioxide have caused an earlier onset, prolonged duration, increased intensity, and have amplified allergenicity during the pollen season.

Public health guidance heeds certain medications during hot weather, informing general practitioners to be aware of the potential side effects and adjust dosage as needed. Of particular concern are drugs with anticholinergic effects, which may blunt the sweating response. These medications, which include antihistamines, continue to be identified as a risk factor for heat‐related illness. A recent systematic review concluded that limited evidence (n = 1) exists to confirm or refute whether antihistamines impair thermoregulation during heat stress. The only evidence examined fexofenadine, which, unlike other antihistamines, does not bind to M3 muscarinic receptors – the primary receptor stimulating sweat secretion from eccrine sweat glands. Determining if other over‐the‐counter antihistamines, an accessible and common treatment for AR, impair sweating is important as pollen season coincides with the hottest period of the year.

### Management of urticaria in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review [^3d20b995]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

4.4 Patient management

Classically, the recommended algorithm for treating urticaria includes the use of second‐generation antihistamines, and if inadequate control within 2‐4 weeks, the dose can be increased up to four times the original dose. If this is still inadequate control after a further 2‐4 weeks, specialist referral should be considered, where specialists can consider prescribing omalizumab and ciclosporin to help alleviate symptoms.However, in most patients, second generation oral antihistamines provide adequate control of urticaria.The pathophysiology of COVID‐19 related urticaria demonstrates that antihistamines alone will not stop mast cell histamine degranulation but will only act to reduce the severity of urticaria.

Low systemic steroids, on the other hand, target the COVID‐19 inflammatory storm, which prevents mast cell activation, and thus histamine release. Therefore, low dose systemic steroids may be able to effectively manage urticaria in COVID‐19 through their proposed mechanism of action. Combining this with antihistamines can improve patients' clinical response to urticaria. A further benefit of low dose steroids, shown through a randomized control trial, has demonstrated an increase in survival rate in COVID‐19 patients (Randomized Evaluation of COVID‐19 Therapy [RECOVERY], ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04381936). Although corticosteroids are promising, it may increase the risk of prolonged viral replication, so it may be best to use them for the shortest duration possible until symptoms are controlled. After this, consideration should be made to promptly switch to omalizumab. Ciclosporin is currently not recommended in COVID‐19 patients.

4.5 Limitations

All included articles were case. Only three case reports detailed pathological study results.A diagnostic characteristic of urticaria is that the cutaneous lesions must be evanescent (no one lesion should last more than 24 hours), however this was only noted by Falkenhain‐López et al.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^e8b5482b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 practice parameter—new and newly emphasized guidance includes that food allergy testing not be performed in the routine evaluation of possible allergic rhinitis (AR), and that the oral leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast should only be used for AR in patients with inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies, with noted serious neuropsychiatric events. Either intranasal antihistamine (INAH) or intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) may be offered as first-line monotherapy for nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), and additional studies support the use of combination INCS and INAH in AR and NAR. Oral decongestants should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy, and first-generation antihistamines should not be used in AR, especially on a chronic basis, due to sedation, performance impairment, poor sleep quality, anticholinergic-mediated symptoms, and increased risk of dementia. The use of intranasal decongestants is suggested to be limited to short-term use, with combination therapy including an intranasal decongestant for up to 4 wk in limited circumstances. Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) tablets are both effective for AR and may help prevent and/or treat allergic asthma, whereas neither acupuncture nor herbal medications have adequate studies to support a recommendation for AR. New information highlights local allergic rhinitis (LAR), possibly present in up to 25% of patients with rhinitis, and cough is emphasized as a common symptom in both AR and NAR; four new algorithms combining evidence and expert opinion can guide treatment of intermittent and persistent AR and NAR.

### Antihistamines and their role as antipruritics [^5cdcb691]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Antihistamines that bind to the histamine 1 receptor (H1) serve as important therapeutic agents to counter the effects of histamine in the skin. Two generations of antihistamines exist; however, second-generation agents are more advantageous because they cause less sedation, have a longer half life and are more selective for the H1 receptor. While H1 antihistamines have proven to be effective at reversing the pruritus and cutaneous lesions of chronic urticaria, their ability to treat pruritus associated with other cutaneous and systemic diseases is unproven.

Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) in nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) and combination therapy—We recommend that the clinician not select an oral LTRA for the treatment of NAR (strength conditional; certainty ungraded as there are no studies), and the text states there is no evidence, mechanistic rationale, or expert opinion supporting LTRAs in NAR. For AR, an oral LTRA plus oral antihistamine may be more effective than LTRA monotherapy, and this combination is similarly effective as intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) monotherapy though likely more costly and burdensome; when considering montelukast, a shared‑decision making conversation should be utilized.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^220a6386]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Table IV (continued)—Allergic and nonallergic rhinitis management recommendations state the following: For allergic rhinitis (AR) with nasal congestion uncontrolled on an oral antihistamine, we suggest that the clinician consider adding pseudoephedrine, when tolerated. For seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), we suggest the clinician not combine the oral leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) montelukast with an oral antihistamine when symptoms are not controlled with an oral antihistamine. In patients ≥12 y of age with symptoms of SAR, we recommend that the clinician not prescribe, as initial treatment, a combination of an oral antihistamine and an intranasal steroid in preference to monotherapy with an intranasal steroid; similarly, for SAR and perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) we suggest not prescribing the combination of an oral antihistamine and an intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) in preference to intranasal steroid monotherapy. For AR, we suggest against adding oral montelukast to an INCS due to lack of adequate evidence of improved efficacy and concerns for serious neuropsychiatric events from montelukast. For nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), we suggest offering an INCS as a first-line therapy and we suggest offering an intranasal antihistamine (INAH) as a first-line therapy. Regarding allergen immunotherapy (AIT), we suggest that AIT (subcutaneous or sublingual tablets) be offered through shared decision making to patients with moderate/severe AR who are not controlled with avoidance and/or pharmacotherapy, who choose immunotherapy as the preferred method of treatment, and/or who desire the potential benefit of immunotherapy to prevent or reduce comorbid conditions; we also suggest that AIT be considered for patients with controlled mild/moderate asthma with coexisting AR. For complementary therapies, we cannot make a recommendation for or against the use of acupuncture for the treatment of AR, and we cannot make a recommendation for or against the use of specific herbal products for the treatment of AR.

### Update on rupatadine in the management of allergic disorders [^eac03ea9]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

In a review of rupatadine published in 2008, the primary focus was on its role as an antihistamine, with a thorough evaluation of its pharmacology and interaction with histamine H1 -receptors. At the time, however, evidence was already emerging of a broader mechanism of action for rupatadine involving other mediators implicated in the inflammatory cascade. Over the past few years, the role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) as a potent mediator involved in the hypersensitivity-type allergic reaction has gained greater recognition. Rupatadine has dual affinity for histamine H1 -receptors and PAF receptors. In view of the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma group's call for oral antihistamines to exhibit additive anti-allergic/anti-inflammatory properties, further exploration of rupatadine's anti-PAF effects was a logical step forward. New studies have demonstrated that rupatadine inhibits PAF effects in nasal airways and produces a greater reduction in nasal symptoms than levocetirizine. A meta-analysis involving more than 2500 patients has consolidated the clinical evidence for rupatadine in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in adults and children (level of evidence Ia, recommendation A). Other recent advances include observational studies of rupatadine in everyday clinical practice situations and approval of a new formulation (1 mg/ml oral solution) for use in children. In this reappraisal, we revisit some key properties and pivotal clinical studies of rupatadine and examine new clinical data in more detail including studies that measured health-related quality of life and studies that investigated the efficacy and safety of rupatadine in other indications such as acquired cold urticaria, mosquito bite allergy and mastocytosis.

### Existing and investigational medications for refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria: safety, adverse effects, and monitoring [^5b39b009]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is responsive to H1 antihistamines administered up to four times the recommended US Food and Drug Administration dose in approximately 50% of patients. However, when patients do not respond to these first-line agents, evidence-based guidelines using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology have provided direction for second- and third-line treatments that can effectively treat patients with CSU. Some patients remain refractory to these advanced treatments; therefore, alternative treatments with a lower certainty of evidence may be necessary. Regardless of the therapies used to treat CSU patients, it is essential for clinicians to be knowledgeable about the mechanism of action, efficacy, and safety and monitoring recommendations of the treatments prescribed. This review provides a comprehensive review of the adverse effects and monitoring recommendations for agents in use for CSU treatment as well as those currently undergoing investigation for CSU treatment.

### Allergic rhinitis and urticaria burden and antihistamine treatment options in Thailand: a modified Delphi study [^7a213f31]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

First- versus second-generation antihistamines

The majority (94.3%) of respondents strongly agreed that first-generation antihistamines are associated with adverse effects such as sedation and reduced psychomotor and cognitive function, which may impair learning and reduce work efficiency. Furthermore, 85.7% strongly agreed that when administered at night, these antihistamines, because of their long half-life, prolong the onset latency and decrease the duration of REM sleep, leading to impaired attention, vigilance, working memory, and sensory-motor performance in the next day.

Consequently, 92.4% of respondents endorsed second-generation antihistamines as the preferred initial treatment for AR and urticaria, citing reduced sedation and the absence of anticholinergic effects. Moreover, 88.6% agreed that second-generation antihistamines comprise diverse drugs exhibiting distinct pharmacologic characteristics and safety profiles. This preference was further supported by Thai experts strongly endorsing the perceived benefits, versatility, and applicability of orodispersible tablets (ODTs) of second-generation antihistamines across different patient groups. Most respondents (92.4%) agreed that ODTs are suitable for children, adults, and the elderly with swallowing difficulties or dysphagia, thus enhancing compliance and treatment effectiveness. Furthermore, 90.5% recognized ODTs’ practical advantages, such as not requiring water for administration, rapid dissolution in saliva, and portability. Last, a notable 93.3% agreed that ODTs facilitate medication administration for patients with severe swallowing restrictions—such as the elderly, stroke victims, and those who are bedridden—as well as for patients advised against swallowing (eg, those with renal failure) and for those who are resistant to swallowing (including certain pediatric, geriatric, and psychiatric patients), thus demonstrating the broad applicability of ODTs in addressing diverse clinical needs.

Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis

Most respondents emphasized the need for fast-acting, effective, and nonsedating treatments for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Specifically, 85.7% agreed that modern second-generation oral H 1 -antihistimines, including bilastine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine, meet these criteria. Additionally, 92.4% preferred second-generation H 1 -antihistimines for children as a result of their high selectivity for H 1 receptors, proven clinical efficacy, minimal cognitive adverse effects, and favorable long-term tolerability.

### Allergic rhinitis and urticaria burden and antihistamine treatment options in Thailand: a modified Delphi study [^3eda5685]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis

The EAACI/ARIA guidelines outline the clinical properties of the ideal oral H 1 -antihistimines, and most modern H 1 -antihistimines meet these requirements.A comparison of the clinical profiles of various second-generation antihistamines indicates that bilastine in particular has the highest number of ARIA-recommended antihistamine properties.

Their pharmacologic profiles support the preference for second-generation H 1 -antihistimines in managing pediatric allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. They address the immediate allergic symptoms and align well with the therapeutic goals for children, which include maintaining normal activity levels and minimizing adverse effects.

Treatment of acute and CU

As with AR, second-generation H 1 -antihistimines are efficacious in both acute urticaria and CU and are recommended as first-line therapy. For CU, the EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline recommends antihistamines be taken daily until no longer needed.The dosing regimen is essential to patient adherence, as patients often hesitate to continue treatment if they do not experience immediate relief.Thus, a nonsedating antihistamine that restores a patient’s QoL is essential to enhance the treatment experience.

For all types of urticaria, standard-dosed modern, second-generation H 1 -antihistimines like bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and rupatadine are supported by clinical evidence. However, there is no clear recommendation on which to choose as a result of the lack of well-designed clinical trials comparing their efficacy and safety.

In children, antihistamines with proven efficacy and safety include bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and rupatadine. Prescriber selection should consider age restrictions and availability, as some are not licensed for children under 6 months in many countries, and not all are formulated for pediatric use.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether non-sedating antihistamines reduced symptom severity or duration in the common cold. 156 papers were found using the reported searches, of which 4 presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. It is concluded that there is no good evidence for the use of non-sedating antihistamines in the common cold.

### H1-antihistamines: more relevant than ever in the treatment of allergic disorders [^4a8ecdbf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Histamine is an important chemical mediator of inflammation, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, decreased peripheral resistance, airway smooth muscle contraction, and sensory nerve stimulation causing itching. It also plays a significant role in neurotransmission and in cardiac function. In allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria, there is strong evidence for the role of H(1)-antihistamine treatment. In asthma, additional dose-response studies, including higher doses of antihistamines than those used in allergic rhinitis, are needed to determine the role of antihistamines. In atopic dermatitis, the itch-relieving topical glucocorticoid-sparing effects of H(1)-antihistamines also require further documentation. The potential benefits of each H(1)-antihistamine should be weighed against the potential risks, and second-generation H(1)-antihistamines with excellent, well-documented safety records should be used in preference to older, less safe H(1)-antihistamines. Second-generation H(1)-antihistamines are more relevant than ever in the treatment of allergic disorders.

### Urticaria: a comprehensive review: treatment of chronic urticaria, special populations, and disease outcomes [^42bc8f2c]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Second-generation antihistamines are considered first-line agents in the treatment of chronic urticaria because of their safety and efficacy profile. Some patients require higher doses of H 1 antihistamines alone or in combination with other classes of medications, including H 2 antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, or first-generation H 1 antihistamines. One major therapeutic advance has been omalizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin E that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic urticaria that is unresponsive to H 1 antagonists. In addition, the second article in this continuing medical education series outlines several evidence-based alternative treatments for urticaria and the differences in recommendations between 2 major consensus groups (the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/World Allergy Organization and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force).

### Guidelines for the management of chronic spontaneous urticaria: recommendations supported by the centre of evidence of the French society of dermatology [^295ebb28]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The working group analysed the studies (two persons independently for each intervention) by describing the effect estimates, biases and harms, then graded the level of evidence (from D – no direct research evidence, to A – several multicentric double‐blinded studies with concordant positive results and acceptable risks) after reaching unanimous consensus.The comments from the eight experts who were secondarily interviewed were incorporated into the recommendations, then the synthesis was submitted to a multidisciplinary panel of 28 reviewers, including health providers and patients, who scored each recommendation from 1 to 9.

The main points from the recommendations are as follows.
(i) A second‐generation H 1 antihistamine at a single dose is the recommended first‐line treatment for CSU.There is no evidence to favour one drug over another. Some H 1 antihistamines should be avoided in individuals who present a known increase in QT interval or those on enzymatic inhibitors.
(ii) In case of treatment insufficiency, the working group recommends a rapid increase in dosage (1 week to 2 months) until quadruple dosage of H 1 antihistamines, as a second‐line treatment.
(iii) The working group does not recommend the adjunction of H 2 antihistamines or montelukast to H 1 antihistamines in CSU, owing to the lack of demonstrated efficacy.
(iv) No studies assessed the efficacy or safety of systemic steroids in CSU. The working group does not currently recommend using them.
(v) As a third‐line treatment, in case of decreased QoL of individuals linked to refractory CSU, the working group recommends the adjunction of omalizumab (300 mg every 4 weeks)or ciclosporin (4–5 mg kg −1 per day during a 6‐month period) to H 1 antihistamines. Randomized controlled trials have shown that omalizumab is more effective than placebo, with good short‐term tolerance. No head‐to‐head trials have compared omalizumab and ciclosporin.
(vi) There is no evidence to indicate the optimal delay between the failure of quadruple dosage of H 1 antihistamines and initiation of omalizumab or ciclosporin; this would likely depend on the QoL of patients and the severity of the CSU.
(vii) Isolated studies of hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, sulfasalazine, high‐dose vitamin D, phototherapy and miltefosine for CSU have been published, but the working group does not recommend them because the data are too sparse.
(viii) The working group does not recommend systematic food exclusion diets because of no evidence of benefit for individuals with CSU.No prospective studies have been published to date on therapeutic education programmes and psychotherapy in CSU.
(ix) For children < 12 years old with CSU, single‐dose H 1 antihistamines can be used. The working group recommends favouring rupatadine and desloratadine in case of dosage escalation because more data are available than for other drugs. There is a real lack of evidence for third‐line treatments in paediatric populations.
(x) During pregnancy and breastfeeding, a single dose of cetirizine, levocetirizine or desloratadine is preferred because more safety data for these H 1 antihistamines are available. In case of refractory CSU, a specialized consultation is required.

### Antihistamines for the common cold [^3e12b651]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Although antihistamines are prescribed in large quantities for the common cold, there is little evidence to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess in patients with a common cold the effects of antihistamines in alleviating nasal symptoms, or in shortening of illness duration.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialized Register and EMBASE up to December 2002; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE up to February 2003. We also followed up references in identified papers. We appealed for further articles at a major international conference on Acute Respiratory Infections (1997). We corresponded with experts and got in touch with pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials on treatment of common cold with antihistamines, used either singly or in combination, in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by two reviewers and authors were contacted for further data. Trials were subdivided into monotherapy and combination therapy. Data on general recovery, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and side-effects were extracted and summarized in a systematic review.

Main Results

We included thirty two papers describing 35 comparisons; 22 trials studied monotherapy, 13 trials a combination of antihistamines with other medication. A total of 8930 people suffering from the common cold were included. There were large differences in study designs, participants, interventions, and outcomes. There was no evidence of any clinically significant effect - in children or in adults - on general recovery of antihistamines in monotherapy. First generation - but not non-sedating - antihistamines have a small effect on rhinorrhea and sneezing. In trials with first generation antihistamines the incidence of side effects (especially sedation) is significantly higher with active treatment. Two trials, studying a combination of antihistamines with decongestives in small children, both failed to show any effect. Of the eleven trials on older children and adults, the majority show an effect on general recovery and on nasal symptom severity.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Antihistamines in monotherapy - in children as well as in adults - do not alleviate to a clinical extend nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing, or subjective improvement of the common cold. First generation antihistamines also cause more side-effects than placebo, in particular they increase sedation in cold sufferers. Combinations of antihistamines with decongestives are not effective in small children. In older children and adults most trials show a beneficial effect on general recovery as well as on nasal symptoms. It is however not clear whether these effects are clinically significant.
