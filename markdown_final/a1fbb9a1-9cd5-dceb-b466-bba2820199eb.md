## Question

For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I wanted my boyfriend to appreciate me, so I trashed his car. Scenario 2 | I am planning to burn off some of my fat and saggy skin through running, so that I'll weigh 5 pounds less.

Answer Choices:
A. Wrong, Wrong
B. Wrong, Not wrong
C. Not wrong, Wrong
D. Not wrong, Not wrong

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which of two scenarios is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, and to choose among A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; or D. Not wrong, Not wrong. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the moral status of intentionally damaging someone else's property to manipulate their feelings. Then, I should verify whether pursuing weight loss via running raises any moral issues. Next, I will consider whether the phrasing "burn off fat and saggy skin" implies harmful intent or self-harm, and whether that changes the moral calculus. Finally, I will align the conclusion with common-sense morality and select the matching option.

> Let me first confirm Scenario 1. Trashing someone else's car is deliberate destruction of property, which is both illegal and morally wrong by ordinary standards; it violates respect, autonomy, and non-maleficence, and it uses coercion rather than communication to address relationship problems, which is not how healthy relationships function [^05d4467b] [^c58b033b].

> Now, Scenario 2. Wait, let me verify whether there's any moral wrong here. Planning to lose 5 pounds by running is a common, health-oriented personal goal; guidelines endorse physical activity and modest weight loss for health benefits, and there's no victim, no coercion, and no violation of duties to others, so this is not morally wrong by ordinary standards [^110fd01d] [^5c059b62].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the wording "burn off fat and saggy skin". I should double-check whether that phrasing signals self-harm or disordered body image. But wait, in ordinary usage this reads as colloquial language for fat loss and toning through exercise, not literal burning or mutilation; if there were credible evidence of self-harm intent, the moral assessment would shift, but nothing in the scenario suggests that, so I should not over-interpret the metaphor [^notfound].

> I will now examine the answer choices against this analysis. Scenario 1 is clearly wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong, which corresponds to option B. I should confirm that none of the provided sources contradict this; indeed, the relationship guidance underscores respect and nonviolence, and the obesity guidance supports safe, voluntary physical activity for weight management, reinforcing that B is correct [^05d4467b] [^110fd01d].

---

The correct answer is **B. Wrong, Not wrong**. Trashing someone else's car is **clearly morally wrong** because it involves intentional property damage and harm to another person, violating basic ethical principles and legal norms. In contrast, planning to lose weight through running is **not morally wrong**; it is a personal health choice that does not harm others and is generally viewed as positive or neutral by ordinary moral standards in the US.

---

## Scenario 1: Trashing the boyfriend's car

### Moral analysis

- **Intentional harm**: The act involves deliberate damage to another person's property, causing financial loss and emotional distress.

- **Violation of rights**: Property destruction infringes on the boyfriend's right to own and use his property without interference.

- **Lack of justification**: The motivation (seeking appreciation) does not justify the harmful act, and healthier, non-destructive alternatives exist.

- **Legal implications**: Property damage is illegal and can result in criminal charges, civil liability, and restitution.

---

### Ordinary moral standards in the US

Ordinary moral standards in the US **strongly condemn** intentional property damage, viewing it as unethical, disrespectful, and unjustifiable. Such behavior is seen as a breach of trust and respect in relationships and is generally met with social disapproval and legal consequences.

---

## Scenario 2: Losing weight through running

### Moral analysis

- **Personal choice**: Deciding to lose weight through running is a personal health decision that does not inherently harm others.

- **Health benefits**: Running is widely recognized for its physical and mental health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, weight management, and stress reduction.

- **No violation of rights**: This act does not infringe on anyone else's rights or cause harm to others.

- **Social acceptance**: Pursuing fitness and weight loss through exercise is generally viewed positively or neutrally in US society.

---

### Ordinary moral standards in the US

Ordinary moral standards in the US **do not consider** personal weight-loss efforts through exercise to be morally wrong. Such actions are typically seen as responsible, self-improving, and commendable.

---

## Conclusion

| **Scenario** | **Moral judgment** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Trashing the boyfriend's car | Wrong | - Intentional harm <br/> - Violation of rights <br/> - Illegal <br/> - Socially condemned |
| Losing weight through running | Not wrong | - Personal choice <br/> - Health benefits <br/> - No harm to others <br/> - Socially accepted |

---

The correct answer is **B. Wrong, Not wrong**. Trashing the boyfriend's car is morally wrong, whereas losing weight through running is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

### Investment case for small and sick newborn care in tanzania: systematic analyses [^c2ea81e8]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Small and sick newborn care (SSNC) is critical for national neonatal mortality reduction targets by 2030. Investment cases could inform implementation planning and enable coordinated resource mobilisation. We outline development of an investment case for Tanzania to estimate additional financing for scaling up SSNC to 80% of districts as part of health sector strategies to meet the country's targets.

Methods

We followed five steps: (1) reviewed national targets, policies and guidelines; (2) modelled potential health benefits by increased coverage of SSNC using the Lives Saved Tool; (3) estimated setup and running costs using the Neonatal Device Planning and Costing Tool, applying two scenarios: (A) all new neonatal units and devices with optimal staffing, and (B) half new and half modifying, upgrading, or adding resources to existing neonatal units; (4) calculated budget impact and return on investment (ROI) and (5) identified potential financing opportunities.

Results

Neonatal mortality rate was forecast to fall from 20 to 13 per 1000 live births with scale-up of SSNC, superseding the government 2025 target of 15, and close to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 3.2 target of < 12. At 85% endline coverage, estimated cumulative lives saved were 36,600 by 2025 and 80,000 by 2030. Total incremental costs were estimated at US$166 million for scenario A (US$112 million set up and US$54 million for running costs) and US$90 million for scenario B (US$65 million setup and US$25 million for running costs). Setup costs were driven by infrastructure (83%) and running costs by human resources (60%). Cost per capita was US$0.93 and the ROI is estimated to be between US$8–12 for every dollar invested.

Conclusions

ROI for SSNC is higher compared to other health investments, noting many deaths averted followed by full lifespan. This is conservative since disability averted is not included. Budget impact analysis estimated a required 2.3% increase in total government health expenditure per capita from US$40.62 in 2020, which is considered affordable, and the government has already allocated additional funding. Our proposed five-step SSNC investment case has potential for other countries wanting to accelerate progress.

### Sex, relationships and' everyday psychology' on British magazine problem pages, C. 1960–1990 [^52bfe9ab]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

The stress and depression are entirely your choice. By going for an affair to remedy your marriage problem you've landed yourself in a no-through road where you and your lover are cheating on everybody, including each other. Where's the respect and friendship in that? Guide yourself back to your husband and explain what's gone wrong between you. I'm sure he'll show some feeling for you if you show some for him.

As this response shows, agony aunts often had little patience with letter-writers who claimed the inability to control their emotions. Mary Grant's impatience with one such supplicant was clear when she asked, 'How was it "inevitable" that he became your lover? What's so inevitable about hurling yourself out of a safe, loving, happy marriage into all this worry and misery?'.

Advice columnists applied the same rules of rationality and responsibility to many different kinds of problems over these decades.flatly told a separated woman pregnant by her estranged husband, 'You chose to marry — that carries continuing responsibilities. You chose to make love, and that has now brought about concern for another life'. She did not judge the sexual adventuring of the 27-year-old who had tried and enjoyed 'a lot of sex games' with her ex-boyfriend, but now worried about becoming promiscuous, simply stating that 'Different people mean different things by promiscuous, but plenty of people have short-term relationships on the way to a lasting one'. However, she quickened at the correspondent's unwillingness to admit her own agency: 'plenty of people have a strong, lively interest in sex But they don't all rush into compulsive copulation. They use restraint and responsibility in sex — and so can you the short answer is — if you don't want a promiscuous life, don't lead one'. Likewise, she acidly queried of the 17-year-old who wanted to know whether to start taking the pill 'in case I end up having sex without meaning to', 'wouldn't it be better to avoid any situations where you can't exercise your rational choice about having sex or not?'.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^7a055041]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST strength of recommendations — weak recommendations are graded 2A, 2B, and 2C with corresponding evidence and implications. Weak recommendations (2A–2B): Benefits closely balanced with risks and burden. Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence (2A): Consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials without important limitations or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies; The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (2B): Evidence from randomized controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies; Best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values. Higher quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Weak recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (2C): Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks, and burden; benefits, risk, and burden may be closely balanced; Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence; Other alternatives may be equally reasonable. Higher quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may well change the estimate.

Figure 1 — comparative value of interventions — categorizes value by clinical net benefit and incremental cost for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with intervention versus comparator, where the incremental cost dimension reflects the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained. For favorable clinical net benefit, higher cost corresponds to high value (< $100 000), intermediate value ($100 000 to $200 000), or low value (> $200 000) with the intervention more effective and more costly; lower cost corresponds to high value with the intervention more effective and less costly (cost-saving). For unfavorable clinical net benefit, higher cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and more costly (cost-dominated), and lower cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and less costly.

### Number unnecessarily treated in relation to harm: a concept physicians and patients need to understand [^13e68307]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Physicians are legally and ethically compelled to present their patients with available evidence on the potentially beneficial and harmful effects of a proposed medical or surgical treatment. This, however, is only half the story. It does not offer the patient a clear view of the pros and cons of one treatment option versus another, or even versus no treatment at all. Explicitly stating the number of patients who will not benefit from the proposed treatment, in combination with the risk of a complication, may better inform patients and help them determine and express their treatment preference. This may also help standardize the informed consent procedure.

### Intersectional and marginal debiasing in prediction models for ED admissions… [^622b139f]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Prior work has noted that many fairness approaches limit their focus to groups defined by a single demographic trait, such as race and ethnicity, or consider multiple demographic traits in isolation. 12 We refer to these approaches as "marginal, " as they focus on the marginal distribution of protected attributes while ignoring groups defined by their intersections. Ensuring low subgroup false-negative rates, meanwhile, would help ensure that no single group is falsely discharged at a higher rate. To cover the breadth of potential use case scenarios, we focus on 2 fundamental notions of fairness: sufficiency and separation.

22 For example, if an ED admission model meets sufficiency, patients with a 90% risk score should have equal likelihoods of admission regardless of group membership. In our experiments, we evaluated the ED admission prediction task across adult and pediatric populations in 2 Boston-based health care centers. We compared the performance of marginal and intersectional debiasing with multicalibration and FOMO, specifically with no debiasing, marginal debiasing based on single attributes or multiple attributes concomitantly, and intersectional debiasing based on ethnoracial group and gender.

Group construction scenarios Base: no fairness optimization Gender, race, ethnicity, ethnoracial: protect single attribute Marginal: marginally protect all sensitive attributes Intersectional: protect intersections of all sensitive attributes Fairness task Fair calibration Fair false negative rate. The experiment in this study focuses on 3 protected attributes: race, ethnicity, and gender. Scholars in the social, public health, and computational sciences30, 31 have written about the importance of distinguishing between individual-level identities and systems of discrimination. Here, we conceptualized race, ethnicity, and gender attributes as imperfect proxies of systemic racism, systemic sexism, and structural barriers to health care access.

We compared the mean ECE and FNR among intersectional groups across debiasing conditions in Figure 2.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach — determinants of recommendation strength emphasize that a larger balance of desirable over undesirable effects increases the likelihood of a strong recommendation, whereas a narrower balance favors a weak recommendation; higher quality of evidence increases the likelihood of a strong recommendation; greater variation or uncertainty in values and preferences increases the likelihood of a weak recommendation; and higher costs (greater resources consumed) lower the likelihood of a strong recommendation.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Reference case for high-quality cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) specifies that the reference case should adopt a health care sector perspective, with societal or modified societal perspectives reported when relevant data are available. The analytic horizon should be long enough to capture meaningful differences, and the reference case should consider adopting a lifetime analytic horizon with exceptions accompanied by a clear rationale. Comparators should include all appropriate comparator(s), and it is not appropriate to exclusively compare with high-cost or low-effectiveness options ("comparator gaming") because this would artificially lower the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costing should reflect actual amounts paid including out-of-pocket costs, and cost of drugs should reflect price after discounts or rebates in the base-case analysis, preferably the price available to the entirety or majority of the treatment-eligible population. Outcomes should be reported as life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Effectiveness and safety inputs may be drawn from high-quality randomized trials or high-quality observational studies that support causal inference, and effect sizes should be adjusted for adherence if there is substantial cross-over between the 2 groups. Future costs and benefits should be discounted at a rate of 3% per year, with a range of 2%-9% examined in sensitivity analyses. Results reporting should include the point estimate of the ICER and the probability of being cost-effective at the accepted cost-effectiveness threshold, and negative ICERs should not be reported; instead interventions should be reported as inferior/dominated or cost-saving/dominant as appropriate.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians: update of methods [^e807bcaf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ACP clinical guidelines — grading certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) — defines certainty levels and links them to recommendation strength. High is defined as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate as "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low as "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". The Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) "grades the strength of each recommendation as strong or conditional", and "Strong recommendations are generally based on high or moderate certainty in evidence", though "In rare and extenuating circumstances, a strong recommendation may be based on low-certainty evidence–for example, when the evidence indicates a substantial net benefit in a life-threatening situation". For Strong recommendations, certainty is "High or moderate", the balance is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", they "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations could be considered for use as performance measures". For Conditional recommendations, certainty can be "High, moderate, or low", benefits "probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", applicability "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and policymaking "will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Performance indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### 2020 American Heart Association and American college of cardiology consensus conference on professionalism and ethics: a consensus conference report [^c9f338fc]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Appropriate use criteria and clinical practice guidelines — clinicians should objectively apply appropriate use criteria (AUC) and clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in the evidence-based care of individual patients while avoiding potential conflicts of interest (COIs) in their development and in their application in value-based models of care; tools such as AUC and CPGs can objectively help clinical decision making but are derived from populations and must be applied carefully in unique individual patients; development of these tools must be done with full disclosure of any personal or professional COIs, and AUC, CPGs, and clinical decision support mechanisms should not be used to withhold testing or treatment solely to reduce cost within value-based models of care.

American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines — economic evidence integration from cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is organized around clinical net benefit; the figure states, "The strength of the recommendation is initially judged on the basis of clinical net benefit", with branches including "Yes (clinical net benefit favors an intervention or is similar between interventions)", "No (intervention has clinical net harm)", and "Uncertain clinical net benefit". For favorable clinical net benefit, when certainty of value is "High or moderate certainty", the potential effect is "↑ Conditional to strong 'for' or ↑ strong to conditional 'for'", whereas with "Low or insufficient certainty" it notes "Meaningful differences in resource utilization (intervention cost) can inform priority of recommended interventions". When there is clinical net harm and CEAs indicate "No value (dominated)" with "High or moderate certainty", the potential effect is "↑ Conditional to strong 'against'", and when certainty is "Low or insufficient certainty" the directive is "Do not further consider economic evidence from CEAs or resource utilization (intervention cost)". For uncertain clinical net benefit with "Low or insufficient certainty", the figure also directs "Do not further consider economic evidence from CEAs or resource utilization (intervention cost)". The figure defines "CEA = cost-effectiveness analysis".

### Biased expectations about future choice options predict sequential economic decisions [^49921c9c]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Here, we set the prior values of μ and σ 2 in two possible ways: objective value and subjective values versions. In some previous studies of optimal stopping for price decisions, the mean and variance of the generating distribution has been fixed in advance by the mean and variance of the distribution of objective prices. We implemented an objective values version of the Ideal Observer in this way for all the study conditions reported herein. This objective values procedure for the Ideal Observer assumes that the raw prices can be treated as a proxy for participants' subjective value of the prices, so an Ideal Observer that optimises only the raw prices when making decisions would therefore be an appropriate basis for comparison with participants. However, we also had direct access to participants' subjective values of options in some conditions (Pilot full, Study 1 full condition, Study 1 ratings condition, Study 2 and both sequence length conditions of Study 3), due to the presence of the initial rating phase, and so we could also build a subjective values version of the Ideal Observer. This second way of computing the Ideal Observer assumes that participants' subjective valuation of prices may not necessarily exactly equal the raw price values, especially in their scaling, which may be relevant to full information problems. We used each participants' individualised ratings (subjective valuations) of the prices as option values input to the subjective values version of the Ideal Observer, and we used the mean and variance of individual participants' ratings distributions when initialising the prior of the generating distribution of the Ideal Observer.

Because conditions with an initial rating phase had objective and subjective values versions of the Ideal Observer, with each version providing separate optimality estimates, we were able to test the hypotheses that the use of objective or subjective values when modelling (a) affects the strategy taken by the optimality model and (b) changes the assessment of participant bias. We ensured for both objective values and subjective values versions of the models that better options were always more positively-valued such that the models were always solving a maximisation problem. We further ensured that estimated parameters for both objective values and subjective values versions of the models would be on the same scales by reflecting the objective prices around their mean. Then we rescaled those values to span 1 (the highest/worst price) to 100 (the best price). These reflected and rescaled objective values were then used in objective values models when computing the prior generating distribution, and when inputting price values to the model as option values. Subjective values were already rated by participants on this same 1 to 100 scale.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: developing performance measures from clinical practice guidelines [^7deadca8]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2014). Medium credibility.

GRADE recommendation strength — "Strong recommendations can be made when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence" that "the net benefits of the intervention clearly outweigh the net harms", and "can also be made even if the level of evidence is poor but values and preferences strongly support the action". Strong recommendations mean "there is certainty that the desirable consequences of the intervention exceed the undesirable consequences", that further research is unlikely to change certainty, and that "nearly all patients would desire the intervention when given the choice". In contrast, "weak recommendations are common, reflecting residual uncertainty about the quality of evidence, the ratio of benefits to harms, and/or variation in patient preferences", yet they remain important because "they explicitly acknowledge uncertainty while still providing evidence-based guidance to clinical practice", and help identify gaps and justify some practice variation.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^e989f503]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Transgender and gender diverse children — health care professional guidance for social transition emphasizes that health care professionals (HCPs) should discuss the potential challenges of a social transition and should provide guidance to parents/caregivers and supports to a child when a social gender transition is being considered or taking place, including providing consultation, assessment, and gender supports when needed and sought by the parents/caregivers; aiding family members, as needed, to understand the child's desires for a social transition and the family members' own feelings about the child's expressed desires; exploring with, and learning from, the parents/caregivers whether and how they believe a social transition would benefit their child both now and in their ongoing development; providing guidance when parents/caregivers are not in agreement about a social transition and offering the opportunity to work together toward a consistent understanding of their child's gender status and needs; providing guidance about safe and supportive ways to disclose their child's social transition to others and to facilitate their child's transitioning in their various social environments; facilitating communication, when desired by the child, with peers about gender and social transition as well as fortifying positive peer relationships; providing guidance when social transition may not be socially accepted or safe, either everywhere or in specific situations, or when a child has reservations about initiating a transition despite their wish to do so; working collaboratively with family members and MHPs to facilitate a social transition in a way that is optimal for the child's unfolding gender development, overall well-being, and physical and emotional safety; and providing psychoeducation about the many different trajectories the child's gender may take over time, leaving pathways open to future iterations of gender for the child, and emphasizing there is no need to predict an individual child's gender identity in the future. All of these tasks incorporate enhancing the quality of communication between the child and family members and providing an opportunity for communication about the child's gender with their broader social networks; in many instances, these successes in turn facilitate the parents'/caregivers' success in making informed decisions about the advisability and/or parameters of a social transition for their child. A role of HCPs is to provide guidance and support when children and parents/caregivers wish to proceed with a social transition but judge the social environment would not be accepting, by helping parents/caregivers define and extend safe spaces in which the child can express their authentic gender freely; discussing with parents/caregivers ways to advocate that increase the likelihood of the social environment being supportive in the future, if this is a realistic goal; intervening as needed to help the child/family with any associated distress and/or shame brought about by the continued suppression of authentic gender identity and the need for secrecy; and building both the child's and the family's resilience. From a developmental point of view, parents/caregivers should be aware of the potential developmental effect of a social transition on a child.

### Postpartum hormonal contraceptive use and risk of depression… [^d98dbb54]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The source population included all primiparous women living in Denmark for at least 24 months before giving birth between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2022, identified from the Danish Civil Registration System and the Medical Birth Registry. 8, 9 We excluded women who had received a depression. The following covariates measured at the time of delivery were included in the analyses: maternal age; highest educational level; civil status;. We conducted 5 sensitivity analyses. First, to account for other potential confounders, such as cultural differences in health care use, lifestyle factors, and parental socioeconomic status, we adjusted for immigration status, smoking status, body mass index, highest obtained educational level of the parents, and the number of different HC types previously used, as this may indicate treatment attempts of medical indications for HC use. Due to considerable missing information about body mass index, the parents' educational level, and smoking status, we imputed missing values based on the listed covariates, exposure, and outcome with the MICE package21 where binary variables were imputed with logistic regression and categorical data with polytomous logistic regression with 10 iterations and 5 imputations. Adjustment for immigration and smoking status, body mass index, number of HC types previously used, and highest obtained educational level of the parents led to very similar estimated HRs.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — management for at‑risk infants with no clinical signs and blood glucose > 20–25 mg/dL (1.1–1.4 mmol/L) but < 35–45 mg/dL (2.0–2.5 mmol/L) advises to continue skin‑to‑skin care and to continue breastfeeding as frequently as possible or feed colostrum or 2–10 mL per feed (first 24 hours), and 5–15 mL per feed (24–48 hours of life) of substitute nutrition, noting that glucose water (5% or 10%) is not suitable; buccal 40% dextrose gel is recommended at 0.5 mL/kg (200 mg/kg) in conjunction with a feeding plan and the blood glucose is checked before the next feeding, and a single repeat dose of buccal dextrose gel appears safe; recheck blood glucose concentration before subsequent feedings until the value is acceptable and stable (usually > 45 mg/dL, or ≥ 2.5 mmol/L); if glucose remains low despite feedings, begin intravenous glucose therapy and adjust IV rate by blood glucose concentration, and if the neonate is unable to suck or feedings are not tolerated, avoid forced feedings and begin IV therapy; breastfeeding or oral feeding can continue during IV glucose therapy when the infant is interested and will suckle, and gradually wean the IV glucose as serum glucose normalizes and feedings increase, noting that feeding during IV therapy for hypoglycemia reduces the duration of IV therapy needed and is associated with lower maximum glucose infusion rates.

### Points to consider in the practice of postmortem genetic testing: a statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^f80bd23d]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACMG statement — postmortem genetic testing practice considerations state that because some postmortem genetic testing reports will be part of the public record, sensitivity needs to be given to inadvertently including any health history for surviving family members; If feasible, reports should clearly explain the variant classifications, outlining the relevant criteria used to arrive at each classification, and laboratories may want to consider including an appendix that defines each variant classification in simple terms as well as any actions that are typically taken by individuals who obtain such a diagnosis; Because postmortem samples are often irreplaceable, if the initial genetic testing results are suboptimal or inadequate, laboratories may want to consider accepting and testing other available samples from the deceased individual, and the laboratory may also want to consider releasing incomplete reports under specific situations (eg, cases in which the SNV analysis is successful but the CNV analysis is not).

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^63fa1003]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds for cardiovascular cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — The 2014 ACC/AHA cost-value methodology statement provided thresholds to identify high-, intermediate-, and low-value care based on U.S. per capita gross domestic product, and the writing committee determined that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1–3× per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. WHO-origin GDP benchmarks suggested an intervention that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective and that costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective, but critics note they "set such a low bar for cost effectiveness that very few interventions with evidence of efficacy can be ruled out"; WHO experts now also advise against per capita GDP-based thresholds and suggest considering cost-effectiveness alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicomponent decision process. Reflecting these concerns, the writing committee reviewed alternative approaches to incorporating CEA results into guidelines, including relying on US-based studies for identifying a cost-effectiveness threshold or thresholds for cardiovascular CEAs, and Vanness et al used a health opportunity cost approach estimating that for every $1 000 000 increase in health care expenditures, 1869 persons become uninsured, resulting in 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars; in the probabilistic analysis, 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Policy interventions — guidelines may include cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of health policy actions, with specific analytic expectations. Where relevant, guidelines may report the findings of CEAs that evaluate the cost-effectiveness of health policy interventions. Those evaluating policy interventions should use an analytic horizon that is sufficiently long to fully capture the outcomes of the policy while balancing legitimate concerns about uncertainty in long-term population health outcomes. Careful attention must be paid to the source of key inputs because policies are seldom evaluated in randomized trials. For most policy interventions, estimates of short-term effectiveness and any unintended adverse consequences are estimated from observational analyses, including quasi-experimental study designs. Moreover, CEAs of policy interventions rely on modeling assumptions to forecast long-term health and economic outcomes. Because of the numerous sources of uncertainty in a CEA of this nature, careful expert review of the underlying assumptions and extensive sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of uncertainty on study findings is necessary.

### The effects of contemporaneous peer punishment on cooperation with the future [^c0626dd4]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Design

Figure 1 illustrates the game structure and procedures. Exactly 12 participants take part in each session and they are randomly divided into four groups consisting of three participants each. In the baseline condition, participants are informed that they will make (at most) one decision and that there are a total of four sequential groups. Moreover, they are informed about the position of their group in the succession of groups and learn that the allocation of participants to the groups is random. After reading a printout of the instructions (reproduced in Supplementary Note 3) and being given an opportunity to ask clarifying questions, the experiment starts. In the baseline condition, each member of Group 1 is endowed with €10. The three members of this group simultaneously face the same decision: they are required to divide their endowment between a private account and a group account. More precisely, they are required to decide how much money to allocate to the group account while the rest of the endowment automatically remains in their private account. If individual contributions to the group account sum to less than €15, the experiment ends instantly and all participants of later groups are informed that the experiment has ended and that their earning from the experimental task are zero. However, if the sum of contributions to the group account amounts to €15 or more (i.e. at least 50% of the total group endowment), the game continues and moves to the next group (Group 2). Independent from the sum of total contributions in the group account, members of Group 1 earn the respective amounts in their private accounts (i.e. the initial endowment of €10 minus their individual contribution to the group account). If the game is sustained, the same procedure applies for members of Groups 2 and 3. The experiment ends with the decision of the members of Group 3. If the contributions of Group 3's members to the group account sum to €15 or more, then the members of Group 4 each earn €5. Otherwise, members of Group 4 earn nothing. Reaching the threshold exactly costs €15 to the current generation but provides an endowment of €30 to the subsequent generation(s). There is hence a gain in total earnings (across multiple generations) from reaching the threshold. These potential gains from contributing are largest for members of the first generation, but smaller for participants in subsequent generations (with no such gains from Group 3). Choosing €15 as a threshold value has the advantage of facilitating coordination between group members by allowing for individual contributions of €5 (i.e. 50% of the endowment) to be sufficient for reaching the threshold. Hence, it is a symmetric focal point for coordination. At the same time, individual endowments are smaller than the threshold. Hence, no single group member can unilaterally provide the public good and successful provision requires the cooperation of at least two group members.

The magnitude of these trends varies by ES and by scenario. In general, declines in ES benefits are greatest under scenario A2 and are mitigated under scenarios B1 and B2. In scenario A1B, WNV disease control increases by 4.5%. Hereafter, we focus our results on scenario A2, as observed CO 2 emissions between 1990 and 2010 are closely aligned with projections made under this scenario. Results for scenarios A1B, B1, and B2 are shown in the Supplemental Information (Supplemental Fig. 1).

Fig. 2
Projected changes in ES benefits between 2020 and 2100.

Benefits for each service were calculated at the county-level, then summed at the national level. Projections vary by IPCC SRES scenario, as indicated by the color of the bars. The indicators used for each of the benefits are described in Table 1.

County-level trends

At the county-level, expected changes in ES supply and demand are highly variable (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. 1). ES mismatches are expected to occur in counties where supply decreases and demand increases between 2020 and 2100 (i.e. purple-colored counties, Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. 1). Among these counties, the severity of ES mismatches depends on the relative magnitude of changes in ES supply and demand.

Fig. 3
Maps of changes in ES supply and demand between 2020 and 2100 at the county-level for scenario A2.

Counties where supply or demand change between −5 and 5% are plotted with lower hues. Purple areas outlined in red indicate counties where supply and demand mismatches are expected to occur. This color scheme does not distinguish the severity of projected mismatches between ES supply and demand. For instance, a 90% decrease in supply and a 90% increase in demand will result in a greater mismatch than a 10% decrease in supply and a 10% increase in demand.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) [^cbbb99cc]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

CKD-MBD — dialysate calcium in CKD stage 5D — we suggest using a dialysate calcium concentration of 2.5–3.0 mEq/L (1.25–1.50 mmol/L) (2D). Studies that have measured calcium in spent dialysate have found near-neutral calcium flux in patients with a dialysate calcium concentration of 2.5 mEq/L, and the weak recommendation based on a majority vote of the work group suggests calcium dialysate concentration of 2.5–3.0 mEq/L (1.25–1.50 mmol/L) for both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. Selecting dialysate calcium concentration requires consideration of the patient's calcium levels and other laboratory components of CKD-MBD; concomitant therapies with phosphate binders, calcitriol, vitamin D analogues, or calcimimetics; and treatment goals, acknowledging that others have argued hemodialysate calcium concentration may need to be lower to achieve a neutral calcium mass balance and that a higher dialysate calcium concentration may be needed in patients on nocturnal hemodialysis therapy; thus, the US practitioner needs to use judgment, and in the absence of robust clinical data the practitioner in the outpatient dialysis setting also needs to weigh safety concerns in prescribing individualized dialysate calcium concentrations.

### ONS / ASCO guideline on the management of antineoplastic extravasation [^042c185c]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for extravasation of antineoplastic agents, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, ASCO/ONS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing a surgical referral or escalation of care for patients with central line extravasation of irritants with vesicant properties or vesicant antineoplastic agents, in addition to conservative management, rather than conservative management alone.

- recognize that high-risk populations, such as patients receiving DNA-binding vesicants, those with high-volume estimated extravasation, and those with National Cancer Institute CTCAE grade 2 (erythema associated with symptoms such as edema, pain, induration, and phlebitis), grade 3 (ulceration or necrosis; severe tissue damage), or grade 4 (life-threatening consequences) extravasation, may have a greater likelihood of benefiting from surgical referral or escalation in care.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 758: promoting healthy relationships in adolescents [^c58b033b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Adolescent healthy relationships — obstetrician–gynecologist talking points state clinicians "can start the discussion with a framing statement about privacy and confidentiality", with sample wording that "everything here is confidential, meaning that I will not talk to your family about what is said unless you tell me that [insert the laws in your state about what is necessary to disclose]". Rationales explain that confidentiality "provides a safe space to ask questions", adolescents may feel "embarrassed to talk about [concerns] in front of their parents or guardians", and that "Confidentiality builds trust". Suggested questions cover relationship qualities ("What makes a relationship good? What makes it bad? What does respect look like in a relationship?"), sexual and reproductive health and coercion ("If you are sexually active, does your partner support you using birth control?"; "Has your partner ever interfered with your birth control method or refused your request to use condoms?"; "Has your partner ever forced you to do something sexually that you did not want to do?"), dating violence ("Has any person that you have been on a date with slapped, physically twisted your arm, pushed, grabbed, shoved or physically hurt you? Have you done these things?"), and exchange sex ("Have you ever had sex in exchange for money or some other favor or payment?"). Mental health prompts ask about "little interest or pleasure in doing things", feeling "down, depressed, or hopeless", and thoughts of being "better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way". The guidance affirms that "In mutually respectful relationships there should be safety, support, individuality, equality, trust, and communication" and advises, "If you ever feel uncomfortable or unsafe in a relationship, there are resources available to help", including speaking with the clinician, parents, a teacher, a counselor, or calling "a helpline".

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^4d080661]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology — health outcomes and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) use notes that "the health outcomes of an intervention relative to the comparator may be a change in the incidence of clinical events… or change in survival (ie, life years gained)", and that the QALY "is calculated by multiplying the health-related quality of life associated with a health state with the time spent in that state". Health-related quality of life is "measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 represents death and 1 represents perfect health". For preference weights, those "elicited from a representative sample of fully informed members of the community are generally preferred", though "some experts have argued that economic and ethical principles support the use of quality-of-life estimates elicited from patients who are directly affected by the condition". Important limitations include that higher baseline quality-of-life gains "generate more QALYs than an equivalent gain in survival" in lower-baseline groups, which "translates to a comparatively higher valuation" and raises concerns about exacerbating health disparities, and the assumption of indifference between quality-of-life versus longevity changes yielding the same net QALYs, "which is often not the case". Alternatives "including the 'equal value of life-years gained' and the 'health years in total'" have "not been uniformly adopted by major health technology assessment agencies"; "cost-effectiveness thresholds have not been established for some of these newer metrics", and results using them are "not directly comparable to the results of studies that report incremental cost per QALYs gained". The statement adds that "economic value statements should incorporate findings from available CEAs that measure health outcomes in terms of QALYs and life years".

### Biased expectations about future choice options predict sequential economic decisions [^9fd74e4a]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Theoretical modelling

We were able to theoretically explain, in terms of a computational mechanism, participants' sampling bias. Our model fits suggest that participants' reluctance to increase sampling rates when it is optimal to do so arises because participants expect future option values to be lower on average than the ground truth. Participants of course still make some suboptimal decisions in full conditions, where undersampling bias was reduced or absent, and our data suggests that mis-specified prior expectations may best account for erroneous decisions when they occur in these conditions as well. We should note, however, that the Cost to Sample model was the best-fitting model and may explain suboptimal decisions for many participants. In the Cost to Sample model, participants perceive sampling itself to be intrinsically costly or rewarding, even though there were no ground truth extrinsic costs or rewards associated with sample choices. In the case of undersampling, participants using this strategy would settle for an earlier option in part because continued sampling would be perceived as aversive. Indeed, all three of our models accurately predicted participants' mean sampling rates (Figs. 3–7). The framework we promote here, therefore — using an optimality model to explain accurate performance and then parameterising it to account for systematic bias — appears to produce models that predict participant behaviour with reasonable accuracy. It is certainly possible that different participants within the same sample might adopt any of these strategies, even if the Biased Prior strategy might be the most common.

### Clinical practice guideline: early mobilization and rehabilitation of critically ill burn patients [^376f9621]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). High credibility.

Early mobilization safety in the ICU — adverse events are uncommon overall, with a systematic review reporting only one serious event (oxygen desaturation < 80% in 1/498 [0.2%] of sessions), while six studies documented events including patient medical instability (45% of sessions), orthostatic hypotension (11% in one study and 30% in another), syncope (2%), arterial line dislodgement (1% in one study and 1% of sessions in another), nasogastric tube loss (1%), oxygen desaturation less than 90% (2%), and asymptomatic bradycardia (1%); several RCTs reported no endotracheal tube dislodgement, and a Cochrane review of four RCTs (690 patients) found adverse events occurred in 2 to 5% of intervention patients; for burn-specific caution, burn surgeons may not want patients with fresh lower extremity skin grafts mobilized for at least 3 to 5 days postoperatively.

Regarding patient education for obesity, more specifically with respect to general counseling, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to counsel adult patients with obesity or overweight with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia) that lifestyle changes producing even modest, sustained weight loss of 3–5% produce clinically meaningful health benefits and greater weight losses produce greater benefits. Counsel patients that sustained weight loss of 3–5% is likely to result in clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides, blood glucose, HbA1c, and the risk of developing T2DM.

Inoperable severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) — in a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), the rate of all-cause death at 2 years was lower with TAVI (43.3%) (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.36–0.92; P = 0.02) than with standard medical therapy (68%), and standard therapy included percutaneous aortic balloon dilation in 84%. TAVI reduced repeat hospitalization (55% versus 72.5%; P < 0.001) and improved New York Heart Association (NYHA) class distribution at 1 year (25.2% class III or IV after TAVI versus 58% with standard therapy; P < 0.001), but had higher major stroke at 30 days (5.0% versus 1.0%; P = 0.06) and at 2 years (13.8% versus 5.5%; P = 0.01) and higher major vascular complications (16.2% versus 1.1%; P < 0.001). In a nonrandomized study of 489 extreme-risk patients treated with a self-expanding TAVI valve, 12‑month all‑cause death was 26% with TAVI compared with an expected 43% if treated medically; choice of TAVI versus palliative care is based on shared decision‑making addressing indication, risks, and benefits.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^ec006ee8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to chemoprophylaxis, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients for baseline fracture risk and measure bone mineral density prior to initiating an aromatase inhibitor. Recognize that multiple studies have reported an increased rate of bone loss in women treated with aromatase inhibitors. Use anastrozole with caution in postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral density loss, and if it is used, consider the use of bone-protective agents such as bisphosphonates and RANK ligand inhibitors. Encourage all patients receiving aromatase inhibitors to exercise regularly and take adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements. Recognize that a history of osteoporosis and/or severe bone loss is a relative contraindication for the use of anastrozole. In the International Breast Intervention Study-II, women with severe osteoporosis (T score < -4 or more than two vertebral fractures) were excluded. Recognize that other endocrine preventive therapies that do not reduce bone density, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, are also available for this group of women.

1.5 °C scenario map under different levels of energy-GDP decoupling, RE speed and NETs.

The dimensions are 'speed of renewable energy transition' (for the scenarios the 2020–2040 annual average growth in solar, wind and other renewables, in EJ/yr), 'energy-GDP decoupling' (for the scenarios the 2020–2040 average difference between GDP growth rate and final energy growth rate, in %) and cumulative CO 2 removal until 2100, including CCS (GtCO 2). Historical data points are the rolling averages of the past ten years (e.g. for the 1995 point the period 1986–1995) of the respective indicators. This averaging was chosen (1) because GDP and final energy data are noisy and (2) to emphasise longer-term trends. While historically four years were above a decoupling of 2% since 1986, these are outlieres around a lower, almost constant trend. Historical GDP data (MER, constant 2010 US$) is taken from the World Bank. The conceptually equivalent graph for 2 °C can be found in Supplementary Fig. 4.

The final phase of the recruitment effort is to make sure that the candidate fulfills the needs of the group and to try to make as sure as possible that the candidate would be happy in the new position. This means there must be a very candid exchange of information regarding the goals and expectations of the group and the individual, and how the group's expectations will be measured. It also means making sure that there is a good fit between the culture of the group and the desires of the candidate. Furthermore, a substantial effort should be made to make sure the candidate (and his family) will be happy in the practice location.

### How to write a systematic review of reasons [^5210e0a0]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

As we argue elsewhere, we must reject McCullough et al 's measure of 'the adequacy of the ethical analysis and argument' (p. 67). Furthermore, while it might be possible to replace it with a suitable measure, a systematic review that answers an ethical question may mislead decision-makers when the literature reviewed is incomplete or inadequate. In these cases, the literature's answer to the review question places no burden of proof on those who disagree. Of course, when an empirical literature is inadequate, its answer will also be potentially misleading and uninteresting; the correct safeguard in both cases (inadequate empirical and reason-based literatures) is for the review to conclude only that further research is needed to answer the question. To date, however, the assessment of the quality of reasons and of argument-based literature is much less standardised than, for example, the assessment of the quality of clinical trials and the literature that reports their results. Bioethicists as well as clinical and policy decision-makers are less likely, we surmise, to understand the significance of limitations in reasoning than in study design. A McCullough model systematic review, insofar as it is a systematic review of (quality-weighted) conclusions, also has normative problems: it may mislead when there are mutually incompatible, but maximally informed and individually reasonable, answers to the ethical question, or when different weightings of the reasons (as may be appropriate in dissimilar contexts) support different answers.
