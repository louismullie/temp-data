## Question

What is used to perform ablation cryotherapy or radio frequency ablation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what is used to perform ablation cryotherapy or radiofrequency ablation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core energy sources and mechanisms. Then, I should verify the device components and delivery systems. Next, I will examine procedural approaches and imaging guidance. After that, I need to consider indications by organ system and any modality-specific advantages or limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically oriented answer that distinguishes cryotherapy from radiofrequency ablation in terms of what is actually "used" to deliver treatment.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental distinction in energy sources. Cryotherapy, or cryoablation, destroys tissue by freezing using refrigerants such as nitrous oxide or argon, with injury driven by rapid cooling, target temperatures below roughly −40°C, dwell time, and thawing dynamics, whereas radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency alternating current to generate resistive heating and coagulative necrosis, typically targeting tissue temperatures around 50–60°C or higher for effective ablation zones [^93f45bb6] [^80a0cff5] [^5b4b7a32].

> I need to check the device components next. For cryoablation, the system includes a cryocatheter or cryoballoon, a refrigeration console with pressurized nitrous oxide, coaxial tubing to deliver coolant, and electrical connections; balloon-based systems enable circumferential "single-shot" pulmonary vein isolation, while focal cryocatheters allow point-by-point lesions, and operators rely on real-time visualization of the ice ball to guide therapy [^23b37635] [^f27a923a]. For radiofrequency ablation, the setup comprises an RF generator, cables, and ablation catheters that may be nonirrigated or irrigated (open or closed loop) to modulate lesion size and mitigate overheating; force-sensing and large-tip designs are commonly used to optimize contact and depth, and the generator delivers power at 500–1000 kHz with grounding pads completing the circuit [^23b37635] [^80a0cff5] [^93f45bb6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about approach without verifying access and guidance. Both modalities are delivered percutaneously under image guidance, with CT, ultrasound, or MRI used to navigate catheters or probes to the target, and in cardiac applications, transseptal puncture and electroanatomic mapping are standard for left atrial access and lesion planning; cryoablation often uses fluoroscopy to confirm balloon occlusion and freezing, while RF ablation frequently leverages 3D mapping to guide point-by-point lesions [^23b37635] [^6f419b3d] [^cdf3a0b8].

> Next, I should review organ-specific contexts to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. In renal cell carcinoma, both cryoablation and RF ablation are appropriate percutaneous options for small renal masses, with cryoablation offering superior visualization and a favorable safety profile near critical structures, though RF is widely available and effective; guidelines emphasize operator discretion and patient selection, and note higher local recurrence versus surgery but fewer complications than nephrectomy [^fbc8595f] [^b44086b2] [^c52c56d9]. In hepatocellular carcinoma, RF and microwave ablation are first-line thermal options for early-stage disease, with cryoablation considered in select scenarios; a randomized trial suggested lower local progression with cryoablation versus RF in some subgroups, but RF remains the most established modality in many centers [^610e9e3b] [^03157ec4] [^e5868656]. In lung tumors, RF, cryo, and microwave are all acceptable image-guided options, with cryoablation advantageous near airways or vessels and RF/MWA more available; selection should be individualized to lesion size, location, and comorbidities [^bf57ed54] [^210cc61b]. In prostate cancer, focal cryotherapy is an option within trials, but RF ablation lacks FDA clearance for focal therapy and should be limited to research settings, underscoring that device approval status matters when deciding what to "use" clinically [^b60a9650].

> I should double-check the cardiac arrhythmia domain, where evidence is most robust. For atrial fibrillation, both cryoballoon and RF ablation achieve pulmonary vein isolation with comparable efficacy in large randomized trials, including FIRE AND ICE, and contemporary guidelines endorse either modality based on operator expertise and patient factors; cryoballoon can shorten procedure time, whereas RF offers flexible lesion customization and advanced contact-force technologies [^a4ad6105] [^931cfaf9] [^75ab7274]. For pediatric and congenital heart disease, cryoablation is often preferred near the AV node to mitigate permanent conduction injury risk, and professional statements recommend cryo availability at centers performing pediatric ablations [^3b002079] [^b39cfdce].

> But wait, what about special considerations that change device selection or safety. Cryoablation provides intraprocedural visualization of the ice ball, which can be advantageous near bile ducts, bowel, or airways, yet carries risks such as cryoshock in liver applications and may be less suitable in coagulopathy due to bleeding risk; RF ablation can cause collateral thermal injury and may be limited by heat-sink effects near large vessels, prompting use of cooled-tip systems or alternative energies in select cases [^f27a923a] [^0f5c92eb] [^210cc61b]. I should confirm that both modalities require meticulous planning, real-time imaging, and adherence to validated protocols to balance efficacy and safety [^9e73ee49].

> Let me synthesize the answer succinctly. Cryotherapy ablation uses refrigerant-based systems with cryocatheters or cryoballoons, a refrigeration console, and coolant delivery to freeze and destroy tissue, leveraging real-time ice-ball visualization, whereas radiofrequency ablation uses an RF generator, cables, and catheters that deliver high-frequency current to heat and coagulate tissue, often with irrigation to control temperature and lesion size; both are deployed percutaneously under image guidance, with the choice of modality dictated by tumor or arrhythmia substrate, anatomic location, operator expertise, and device availability and regulatory status [^f27a923a] [^23b37635] [^80a0cff5].

---

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses **RF generators and needle electrodes** to deliver high-frequency current for thermal tissue destruction [^80a0cff5], while cryoablation uses **cryoprobes and pressurized gases** (argon, nitrogen, or nitrous oxide) to freeze and destroy tissue [^f27a923a]. Both are image-guided, minimally invasive procedures, with RFA relying on heat and cryoablation on freezing; device selection depends on tumor size, location, and operator preference [^a0ac788f] [^bf57ed54].

---

## Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) equipment and technique

### Equipment

- **RF generator**: Delivers high-frequency (460–500 kHz) current to create thermal lesions [^80a0cff5].
- **Needle electrodes**: Percutaneous probes (monopolar or bipolar) deliver energy directly into the tumor [^03f008b8].
- **Grounding pads**: Placed on the patient to complete the electrical circuit [^93f45bb6].
- **Imaging guidance**: Ultrasound, CT, or MRI for accurate probe placement and monitoring [^6f419b3d].

---

### Technique

During RFA, the **probe placement** is image-guided into the tumor, followed by **energy delivery** that heats tissue to 60–100°C, causing coagulative necrosis and cell death [^5b4b7a32]. The **duration** varies with tumor size and location, typically 10–30 minutes per lesion.

---

## Cryoablation equipment and technique

### Equipment

- **Cryoprobes**: Needle-like devices that circulate pressurized gas (argon, nitrogen, or nitrous oxide) to freeze tissue [^f27a923a].
- **Gas supply**: High-pressure cylinders provide the refrigerant for rapid cooling.
- **Imaging guidance**: Ultrasound, CT, or MRI for probe placement and ice-ball monitoring [^6f419b3d].

---

### Technique

During cryoablation, **probe placement** is image-guided into the tumor, followed by **freezing**, in which gas expansion cools the probe tip to −40°C or lower, forming an ice ball that destroys tissue via ice crystal formation and ischemia [^f27a923a]. A **thaw cycle** is often included to enhance cell death, and the process may be repeated.

---

## Comparative advantages and limitations

| **Parameter** | **Rfa** | **Cryoablation** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Thermal coagulation | Freezing-induced cell death |
| Visualization | Limited real-time feedback | Clear ice-ball visualization |
| Pain | More post-procedural pain | Less pain, better tolerated |
| Complications | Thermal injury, burns | Cryoshock, bleeding |
| Tumor size | Effective for ≤ 3 cm | Effective for ≤ 4 cm |
| Location | Limited near vessels/bile ducts | Safer near critical structures |

---

## Clinical applications

Both RFA and cryoablation are used for **renal cell carcinoma** [^c52c56d9], hepatocellular carcinoma [^610e9e3b], lung tumors [^bf57ed54], and bone metastases [^7e5aa0fc]. Cryoablation is often preferred near sensitive structures (bile ducts, ureters, bowel) due to better visualization and less collateral damage [^0f5c92eb].

---

## Conclusion

RFA uses **heat from RF current** via needle electrodes, whereas cryoablation uses **freezing from pressurized gas** via cryoprobes. Both are image-guided, minimally invasive options, with selection based on tumor characteristics, location, and operator expertise [^a0ac788f] [^bf57ed54].

### Radiofrequency ablation: mechanism of action and devices [^80a0cff5]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Since the first radiofrequency (RF) ablation description in early 1990's for percutaneous tumor ablation, there has been considerable published data on the subject worldwide. An understanding of RF ablation equipment, mechanism of action and its interactions with tissue is critical to avoid complications and improve patient outcomes. There is considerable variability in the way that RF ablation may be performed, and there is a variety of equipment choices. Despite the accumulated data, the desire to more quickly obtain larger zones of ablation has quickly spurred the introduction of several new ablation modalities. However, RF ablation remains the prototypical thermal ablation technique.

Cryoablation refers to all methods of destroying tissue by freezing. Cryoablation causes cellular damage, death, and necrosis of tissues by direct mechanisms, which cause cold-induced injury to cells, and indirect mechanisms, which cause changes to the cellular microenvironment and impair tissue viability. Cellular injury, both indirect and direct, can be influenced by four factors: cooling rate, target temperature, time at target temperature, and thawing rate. In this review, the authors describe the mechanisms of cellular injury that occur with cryoablation, the major advantages and disadvantages of cryoablation compared with other thermal ablation techniques, and the current commercially available cryoablation ablation systems.

Purpose Of Review

There is increasing interest in minimally invasive alternatives to surgery, especially as the natural history of small renal masses appears in the majority to be that of very slow growth. Cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation are two energy-based therapies that can be applied in a minimally invasive manner. We will review the recent clinical and laboratory studies that have formed the scientific foundation of the current clinical protocols and how these protocols may change in light of recent observations.

Recent Findings

Although there is literature supporting enhanced cell death with the use of a passive thaw in cryoablation, recent data suggest that the use of an active thaw is no different. The active thaw process will effectively cryoablate renal tissue as well as significantly reduce overall operative time. There is lack of uniformity in the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation for renal masses. It has been concluded that hematoxylin and eosin staining is inadequate for assessment of cell viability after radiofrequency ablation and thus, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide staining should be included in the histological assessment of tissue.

Summary

Cryoablation is the most studied modality and its ability to both directly and indirectly damage cells is generally understood. Clinical experience will further refine knowledge about optimal freezing temperature and freeze-thaw cycles. The coagulation necrosis of radiofrequency ablation is an effective means of destroying cancerous tissue but targeting this energy has been difficult and treatment failures have occurred.

### Established focal therapy-HIFU, IRE, or cryotherapy-where are we now?-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1d266092]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

There is an increased uptake of focal therapy over time with a greater proportion of patients with csPCa rather than low-grade cancer undergoing treatment. FT with cryotherapy, HIFU, or IRE is associated with good short-intermediate term oncological and functional outcomes. However, outcome reporting is heterogeneous and often incomplete. Longer-term follow-up and standardized reporting are required to better define and report FT outcomes.

### Radiofrequency ablation devices [^05dd37d5]. VideoGIE (2017). Low credibility.

Areas for future research

Studies comparing RFA with other technologies such as cryoablation for the treatment of BE would be useful to evaluate relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness. More robust data evaluating endoluminal RFA for indications other than BE are needed, including long-term effectiveness data. Existing data for both biliary and EUS-RFA devices remain limited and of low quality. Additional prospective data to better establish safety and clinical benefit, including meaningful outcomes such as survival, are required. Optimal dosimetry and treatment protocols for biliary RFA and EUS-RFA are unknown at this time. The comparative effectiveness of these devices with competing technologies (eg, biliary PDT or ethanol injection at EUS) should be evaluated.

Interventional Radiology

Image-guided interventions provide the means to deliver therapies locally at the disease site, whether the therapies are based on chemical compounds (including drugs and radiotherapeutics), genes, devices (including stents), cells, sound waves (high-intensity focused ultrasound = HIFU) or induction of ablative temperatures (using hyper- and hypothermia with radiofrequency, microwaves or cryotherapy). Most current interventional image-guided procedures are individually tailored to the local anatomic and functional circumstances as well as the personal needs of the patient. In this way, image-guided interventions are in themselves an important and integral part of PM. For example:
Embolisation of bronchial arteries in patients with haemoptysis is guided by CT angiography and DSA during interventions.
Decisions about the treatment of HCC depend on the location, size and number of tumours at each time of presentation, favouring ablation for limited disease and (chemo)embolic techniques for more extensive spread.

Medical imaging is going to play an important role in individualised drug delivery. In the past 30 years, drug delivery research was focussed on targeting carriers such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles and micelles to the disease site. New developments now promote the selective release of bioactive compounds after application of a trigger. The trigger mechanism can be applied locally and at specific times, depending on the individual patient's needs, and can be selectively applied with interventional techniques such as HIFU under the guidance of MRI. Although for many reasons most tumour ablations are performed using percutaneous radiofrequency or microwaves, HIFU is the only clinically viable technology that can be used to achieve a local temperature increase deep inside the human body in a non-invasive way. MRI can be used to provide continuous temperature mapping during HIFU for spatial and temporal control of the heating procedure and prediction of the final lesion based on the received thermal dose.

### Radiofrequency and cryo-ablation effect on transvenous pacing and defibrillatory lead integrity: an in vitro study [^dc3d4b86]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

Intorduction

Medical societies and cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) manufacturers recommend avoiding close or direct contact between the body of transvenous leads and ablation catheters used to treat cardiac arrhythmias. These recommendations are made despite the lack of clinical studies. However, the target myocardium for successful ablation can be contiguous to CIED leads.

Methods and Results

We examine in vitro the effects of direct application of radiofrequency (RF) and cryo-ablation energy on the integrity and functionality of CIED leads (excluding the pacing electrodes and defibrillation coils). A saline bath was created to mimic the body milieu. CIED leads, including all commercially available lead insulation materials, were connected to a CIED pulse generator and placed in direct contact with an ablation catheter in the tissue bath. RF and cryo-ablation energy were delivered under various conditions, including maximal ablation power, temperature, and impedance via the RF generator. CIED lead functionality, reflective of conductor integrity, was evaluated through lead impedance monitoring during ablation. CIED leads were then visually inspected, and examined with optic and electron microscopy as per protocol. A total of 42 leads were studied. All leads showed the absence of insulation damage at the site of ablation visually and with microscopy. Lead functionality was also preserved in all leads.

Conclusion

Catheter ablation in contact with CIED leads using radiofrequency or cryo-ablation in vitro did not affect lead body integrity and function despite aggressive ablation settings. It may be reasonable to perform ablation in contact with the body of CIED leads when clinically necessary.

### Actual role of radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases [^011a10fd]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The liver is, second only to lymph nodes, the most common site for metastatic disease irrespective of the primary tumour. More than 50% of all patients with malignant diseases will develop liver metastases with a significant morbidity and mortality. Although the surgical resection leads to an improved survival in patients with colorectal metastases, only approximately 20% of patients are eligible for surgery. Thermal ablation and especially radiofrequency ablation emerge as an important additional therapy modality for the treatment of liver metastases. RF ablation shows a benefit in life expectancy and may lead in a selected patient group to cure. Percutaneous RF ablation appears safer (versus cryotherapy), easier (versus laser), and more effective (versus ethanol instillation and transarterial chemoembolisation) compared with other minimally invasive procedures. RF ablation can be performed by a percutaneous, laparoscopical or laparotomic approach, and may be potentially combined with chemotherapy and surgery. At present ideal candidates have tumours with a maximum diameter less than 3.5 cm. An untreatable primary tumour or a systemic disease represents contraindications for performing local therapies. Permanent technical improvements of thermal ablation devices and a better integration of thermal ablation in the overall patient care may lead to prognosis improvement in patients with liver metastases.

### Devices for endoscopic hemostasis of nonvariceal GI bleeding (with videos) [^eec1e1d9]. VideoGIE (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Endoscopic intervention is often the first line of therapy for upper- and lower-GI nonvariceal bleeding. Devices used for endoscopic hemostasis in the GI tract can be classified into injection devices (needles), thermal devices (multipolar/bipolar probes, hemostatic forceps, heater probe, argon plasma coagulation, radiofrequency ablation and cryotherapy), mechanical devices (clips, suturing devices, banding devices, stents), and topical devices (hemostatic sprays). This document describes technologies used for endoscopic hemostasis. Cryotherapy and radiofrequency ablation were described in detail in separate recent ASGE Technology assessments and are not reviewed in this document.

### Cooled ablation [^3bf603cc]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2004). Low credibility.

Research on cooled ablation has been evolving for the last 10 years. Findings and current applications are reviewed. A cooled ablation catheter is approved by the FDA for use in idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT) patients, based on data originally submitted by Cardiac Pathways, Inc. This technology has subsequently been used by the clinicians in atrial flutter cases, nonischemic VT, epicardial accessory pathways, and atrial fibrillation. The experience at Johns Hopkins suggests that cooled radiofrequency ablation has utility in a variety of situations and in some instances has come to be the ablation system of choice.

### New technologies in tumor ablation [^f981edcf]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The application of ablative modalities for small renal masses continues to increase. In addition, multiple technologies continue to be studied for the treatment of these renal masses. This review focuses on new and emerging technologies so that the clinician can become more familiar with these modalities as they become available in clinical practice.

Recent Findings

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoablation (cryo) continue to be the most often used ablative modalities for the treatment of small renal masses. In addition, they are the most thoroughly studied modalities leading to a set of well defined variables predicting successful ablation. Microwave ablation (MWA) and irreversible electroporation are newer modalities that offer theoretical advantages to RFA and cryo, although each differs in the specific advantage provided. Multiple animal studies have been performed with each modality; however, in both cases, the optimal device settings are not well defined. For MWA in particular, there are a significant number of systems available and within each system, there are an array of variables that can be modified, which influences the ablation zone size and shape. Other emerging technologies include stereotactic body radiation and high-intensity focused ultrasound, although each has limited data supporting their efficacy to date.

Summary

Ablation technology continues to multiply and evolve. Newer technologies such as MWA and irreversible electroporation are promising as they offer theoretical advantages to RFA and cryo. However, both require further studies to identify the optimal tumor characteristics and device settings leading to successful ablation.

### Thermal ablation techniques: a curative treatment of bone metastases in selected patients? [^7e5aa0fc]. European Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Thermal ablation techniques (radiofrequency-ablation/cryotherapy) can be indicated with a curative intent. The success rate and prognostic factors for complete treatment were analysed.

Material/Methods

The medical records of all patients who had undergone curatively intended thermal ablation of bone metastases between September 2001 and February 2012 were retrospectively analysed. The goal was to achieve complete treatment of all bone metastases in patients with oligometastatic disease (group 1) or only of bone metastases that could potentially lead to skeletal-related events in patients with a long life expectancy (group 2). We report the rate of complete treatment according to patient characteristics, primary tumour site, bone metastasis characteristics, radiofrequency ablation/cryotherapy and the treatment group (group 1/group 2).

Results

Eighty-nine consecutive patients had undergone curatively intended thermal ablation of 122 bone metastases. The median follow-up was 22.8 months [IQR = 12.2–44.4]. In the intent-to-treat analysis, the 1-year complete treatment rate was 67% (95%CI: 50%-76%). In the multivariate analysis the favourable prognostic factors for complete local treatment were oligometastatic status (p = 0.02), metachronous (p = 0.004) and small-sized (p = 0.001) bone metastases, without cortical bone erosion (p = 0.01) or neurological structures in the vicinity (p = 0.002).

Conclusion

Thermal ablation should be included in the therapeutic arsenal for the cure of bone metastases.

Key Points

- Thermal ablation techniques are currently performed to palliate pain caused by bone metastases.
- In selected patients, thermal ablation can also be indicated with a curative intent.
- Oligometastatic and/or metachronous diseases are good prognostic factors for local success.
- Small-size (< 2 cm) bone metastases and no cortical erosion are good prognostic factors.

### Sex-specific efficacy and safety of cryoballoon versus radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ea6b9fa1]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a growing healthcare burden, for which pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using cryoballoon (CB) or radiofrequency (RF) represent attractive therapies. Women are at higher risk of recurrence after AF ablation and present a specific complications profile. Therefore, a systematic catheter-specific assessment of pulmonary vein isolation is urgently needed in women.

Objective

Systematically assessing the sex-specific efficacy/safety of CB vs RF ablation.

Methods

We performed a structured database search of the scientific literature for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational prospective studies (OPS) comparing CB and RF ablation efficacy at 1 year. We investigated the reporting of sex-specific analyses and assessed the comparative sex-specific efficacy, safety and procedural characteristics of CB vs RF using random-effect meta-regression accounting for the proportion of enrolled women.

Results

Twenty-three studies were included (18 OPS and 5 RCTs) for a total of 13509 patients. Sex-specific outcomes by ablation device were reported in two and sex-specific regression in four studies, none of which took the ablation device into account. Meta-regression accounting for the proportion of enrolled women showed no significant difference in outcomes between RF or CB.

Conclusion

The sex-specific reporting in trials comparing CB to RF is extremely low. A quantitative meta-regression using the percentage of enrolled women as sex-specific indicator did not show any difference between CB and RF but acknowledging the low percentage of enrolled women and the lack of sex-specific data, further research including patient-level data is urgently needed to draw more definitive conclusions.

### Percutaneous cryoablation in the liver: a meta-analysis and review of safety with a focus on incidence of cryoshock and major complications [^cb68e075]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk-of- Bias Assessment and Statistical Analysis

Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the Cochrane Q test. The I² statistic was utilized to quantify between-study variation or heterogeneity. A restricted maximum-likelihood model was used to calculate the pooled weighted proportions of complications and cryoshock; they are reported with their 95% confidence interval (CI). A moderator analysis was conducted to explore how various factors such as gender distribution, entity of ablated liver tumor, lesion size, application of cryoablation in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), guidance devices, ablation at special sites, and publication year may have affected the reported outcomes of cryoablation in liver tumor management. This analysis was performed to identify potential sources of heterogeneity or variation in treatment effectiveness across different studies and patient populations. Results of the meta-analysis are presented as forest plots. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the ROB-2 tool, considering the following give domains: (1) bias from incomplete description of the study population; (2) bias from incomplete data on the ablation procedure; (3) bias from incomplete data on ablated lesions (size and entity); (4) bias from failure to use a standardized reporting system for adverse events; and (5) bias from incomplete data on major complications. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. As conventional funnel plots are considered inaccurate for meta-analyses of proportion studies with low proportion outcomes, funnel plots of study size against log odds were calculated. All analyses were performed using Jamovi version 2.3 (The jamovi project, Sydney, Australia).

### Percutaneous cryoablation in the liver: a meta-analysis and review of safety with a focus on incidence of cryoshock and major complications [^0f5c92eb]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Locoregional ablative tumor therapies are increasingly important because they are minimally invasive and offer a curative approach for patients ineligible for surgery. Techniques used in the liver include radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), irreversible electroporation (IRE), and cryoablation. RFA and MWA are well established as first-line treatments for certain malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Cryoablation, unlike traditional hyperthermic techniques, employs hypothermia to induce cell death through both direct thermal damage and indirect mechanisms that alter the cellular microenvironment. In addition, cryoablation provides superior intraprocedural visualization and causes less pronounced direct thermal injury at the periphery of the ablation zone, improving its safety profile. These features make cryoablation particularly suitable for treating lesions close to the bile ducts or intestines, where the use of hyperthermic procedures could pose a higher risk. Currently, cryoablation is experiencing a renaissance, especially in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Yet, it is used cautiously in patients with liver lesions. This hesitancy is mainly due to the risk of cryoshock, a potentially fatal tumor lysis syndrome specifically associated with cryoablation in the liver. The precise pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cryoshock remain unclear, posing challenges for clinicians in anticipating and managing its occurrence during liver procedures (Tables 1 and 2).

### Cryoballoon or radiofrequency ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^a4ad6105]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend pulmonary-vein isolation by means of catheter ablation as treatment for drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Radiofrequency ablation is the most common method, and cryoballoon ablation is the second most frequently used technology.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial to determine whether cryoballoon ablation was noninferior to radiofrequency ablation in symptomatic patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The primary efficacy end point in a time-to-event analysis was the first documented clinical failure (recurrence of atrial fibrillation, occurrence of atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia, use of antiarrhythmic drugs, or repeat ablation) following a 90-day period after the index ablation. The noninferiority margin was prespecified as a hazard ratio of 1.43. The primary safety end point was a composite of death, cerebrovascular events, or serious treatment-related adverse events.

Results

A total of 762 patients underwent randomization (378 assigned to cryoballoon ablation and 384 assigned to radiofrequency ablation). The mean duration of follow-up was 1.5 years. The primary efficacy end point occurred in 138 patients in the cryoballoon group and in 143 in the radiofrequency group (1-year Kaplan-Meier event rate estimates, 34.6% and 35.9%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 1.22; P < 0.001 for noninferiority). The primary safety end point occurred in 40 patients in the cryoballoon group and in 51 patients in the radiofrequency group (1-year Kaplan-Meier event rate estimates, 10.2% and 12.8%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.18; P = 0.24).

Conclusions

In this randomized trial, cryoballoon ablation was noninferior to radiofrequency ablation with respect to efficacy for the treatment of patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and there was no significant difference between the two methods with regard to overall safety.

### The FIRE AND ICE trial: what we know, what we can still learn, and what we need to address in the future [^fc1c924a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The FIRE AND ICE Trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT01490814) was initiated in 2012 as a multicenter, randomized, head‐to‐head comparison of radiofrequency current (RFC) and cryoballoon catheter ablation for the treatment of patients with drug‐refractory symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Six years on, it remains the largest, randomized comparison of safety and efficacy between 2 catheter ablation modalities used in the treatment of patients with AF. This landmark trial not only established noninferiority between cryoballoon and RFC ablation for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) with regard to the study's efficacy and safety primary end points, 1 but also, it evaluated secondary end points that were critical for a representative study interpretation.

In congruence with our trial data presentations, Pocock and Stone discussed characteristics of a clinical trial that should be evaluated to ascertain clinically meaningful outcomes from statistically positive trials. 2 Specifically, their review focused on the balanced interpretation of clinical evidence. In addition to the magnitude of benefit, the size of the trial, the balance between safety and efficacy, and the specificity of the results to a select patient population, the authors discuss careful interpretation of composite primary outcomes and the important role secondary outcomes can play in interpreting results. 2 Because thoughtful assessment of secondary end points can reveal treatment implications that may otherwise be hidden within the primary (often composite) trial end points, the FIRE AND ICE Trial was predefined to evaluate secondary measures of clinical success. These secondary end points were designed to capture insight into the patient‐felt burden of AF after cryoballoon or RFC ablation and identified significant differences between treatment cohorts in measures of clinical success for both patients and healthcare systems. 3, 4

The secondary outcomes advanced our understanding of the patient‐felt impact of AF recurrence after ablation, but important outstanding questions remain. To identify critical evidence gaps that need to be addressed, this review first comprehensively summarizes the published data from the FIRE AND ICE Trial. It then provides additional analyses to evaluate the influence of events that occurred during the blanking period on the overall patient burden of AF recurrence and the impact of newly introduced technology on the trial results. Finally, we discuss outstanding questions and anticipated upcoming trials aimed at closing knowledge gaps to ultimately guide and optimize treatment strategies across the AF disease continuum.

### Cryoneurolysis versus radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of… [^50f3ea8f]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Cryoneurolysis Versus Radiofrequency Ablation for the Treatment of Chronic Low Back PainClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Low back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Currently available treatment options for treating low back facet joint pain include acupuncture, pain medications, psychotherapy, anti-inflammatory steroid injections into the joints, exercise, physical therapy, rest, chiropractic treatments, surgery, and radiofrequency ablation. RFA uses radio waves to target and burn the nerves that send the pain signals to the participant's brain. The purpose of this study is to compare the standard treatment of RFA to a newer therapy called iovera°. The iovera° system is a newer procedure for nerve pain that freezes the targeted nerves leading to a temporary block of the nerve without causing any permanent damage to the nerve. With the nerve blocked, pain is immediately relieved.

The nerve reconnects over time and goes back to working exactly as it did before the procedure. The investigators want to see if iovera° therapy is effective in treating people with facet joint-mediated chronic low back pain. If the participant decide to participate in the study, the investigators will ask the participant to undergo either an RFA or iovera° procedure to treat the participant's CLBP. After the procedure, the investigators will ask the participant to complete surveys to track the participant's response to the procedure at 15 time points over a 1-year period. These time points consist of phone calls and online surveys. Study Procedures are Radiofrequency ablation and the iovera° system. The site investigators will be trained to perform RFA and to use the iovera° device and a single unblinded research team member will administer the iovera° procedure. The procedure administering investigator will not perform any of the study-specific assessments.

Post-treatment: After the study procedure, subjects will be instructed to take their prescribed pain medications as needed in response to their pain experience and record their pain score before taking their medication. Adverse device effects, serious adverse device effects, adverse events, and serious adverse events will be recorded from the time the ICF is signed through Day 360. Any concomitant medications used to treat AEs through postsurgical Day 360 will also be recorded. Device: iovera system Device: Radiofrequency ablation alone

### The FIRE AND ICE trial: what we know, what we can still learn, and what we need to address in the future [^83500ca8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

In 2012, the year the FIRE AND ICE Trial was initiated, the European Society of Cardiology and the Heart Rhythm Society consensus statements recognized RFC as the dominant energy source for AF catheter ablation and discussed PVI as a promising treatment approach. 14, 15 In response to the FIRE AND ICE Trial and many other trials, the consensus documents were updated to recognize PVI as a safe and effective strategy for the treatment of AF with either of the 2 leading catheter ablation modalities, cryoballoon or RFC ablation. 16, 17 Evaluation of the comprehensive end points, in addition to the primary end point that demonstrated noninferiority between the treatment modalities, may have contributed to the acceptance and adoption of cryoballoon ablation. Indeed, secondary end points of the trial were critical in identifying clinically important differences between the 2 treatment cohorts. Thoughtful design and rigorous assessment of secondary outcomes of future clinical trials may be essential to defining the patient‐specific impact of new catheter ablation technologies for the treatment of AF.

### Is there a role for percutaneous ablation for early stage lung cancer? What is the evidence? [^6059fa52]. Current Oncology Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

For patients with early stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), thermal ablation (TA) has become in the least two decades an option of treatment used worldwide for patients with comorbidities who are not surgical candidates. Here, we review data published with different TA techniques: radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA) and cryoablation. This paper reviews also the comparison that has been made between TA and stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT).

Recent Findings

A majority of retrospective studies, the absence of comparative studies, and the variety of techniques make difficult to get evident data. Nevertheless, these stand-alone techniques have demonstrated local efficacy for tumors less than 3 cm and good tolerance on fragile patients. Many recent reviews and database analyses show that outcomes after TA (mainly RFA and MWA) are comparable to SBRT in terms of survival rates. For patients who are unfit for surgery, TA has demonstrated interesting results for safety, benefits in overall survival, and acceptable local control.

### Established focal therapy-HIFU, IRE, or cryotherapy-where are we now?-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^14f0430c]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The outcomes of FT are highly dependent on patient selection. The more aggressive tumors included, the higher the risk of recurrence post-FT. We noted an evolving trend including a greater proportion of csPCa in the patient cohorts receiving treatment. This is in accordance with findings from expert consensus over time in which recommendations for patient selection for FT have also evolved. In 2010 and 2012 consensuses, de la Rosette et al and Ahmed et al respectively found that experts recommended eradication of all cancer as the goal of FT. In 2015 and 2017 consensuses, Donaldson et al and Tay et al respectively found that experts recommended eradication of csPCa. In this particular analysis, we did not have enough data to analyze the impact of the proportion of csPCa included with regards to the oncological outcomes. Another important question is that of untreated GG1 cancer whilst the csPCa lesion is being treated. In the 2015 and 2017 consensuses, experts agreed that GG1 cancer could be left untreated during FT to a csPCa lesion. We found that there was very limited reporting on the incidence and fate of untreated low-grade cancer foci in the various cohorts.

We also observed that ablation patterns changed over time with more focal/targeted ablations being done compared to hemi-ablations. This trend follows that of the rapid adoption of imaging and targeted biopsy over the last decade. With the ability to better identify and localize csPCa, there is greater confidence in treating just the area containing the aggressive tumor for true FT rather than hemi-ablation. In this regard, Zhang et al. demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial that extending ablation to the entire hemi-gland added no advantage to focal ablation using IRE. However, given the small but significant rates of cancer persistence in or around the treatment zone, there is still a necessity to ensure adequate margins around the lesion, and an adequate delivery of ablative energy, regardless of FT modality within the area to be treated itself.

### Bayesian network meta-analysis comparing cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, and antiarrhythmic drugs as initial therapies for atrial fibrillation [^b1c9054d]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) and catheter ablation are first line treatments of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), however, there exists a paucity of data regarding the potential benefit of different catheter ablation technologies versus AADs as an early rhythm strategy.

Objective

To assess the safety and efficacy of cryoablation versus radiofrequency ablation (RFA) versus AADs as a first line therapy of PAF.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus and CENTRAL were searched to retrieve randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing cryoablation, RFA or AADs to one another as first line therapies for atrial fibrillation (AF). The primary outcome was overall freedom from arrhythmia recurrence (AF, atrial flutter [AFL], atrial tachycardia). Secondary outcomes included freedom from symptomatic arrhythmia recurrence, hospitalization, and serious adverse events. A random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% credible intervals (CrI).

Results

Six RCTs (N = 1212) met the inclusion criteria (605 AADs, 365 Cryoablation, and 245 RFA). Compared with AADs, overall recurrence was reduced with RFA (OR: 0.31; 95% CrI: 0.10–0.71) and cryoablation (OR: 0.39; 95% CrI: 0.16–1.00). Comparing ablation (cryoablation and RFA) with AADs in respect to freedom from symptomatic AF recurrence, neither cryoablation (OR: 0.35; 95% CrI: 0.06–1.96) nor RFA (OR: 0.34; 95% CrI: 0.07–1.27) resulted in statistically significant reductions individually compared to AADs, though pooled ablation with both technologies showed lower odds of arrhythmia recurrence (OR: 0.35; 95% CrI: 0.13–0.79). In terms of serious adverse events rates, neither cryoablation (OR: 0.77; 95% CrI: 0.44–1.39) nor RFA (OR: 1.45; 95% CrI: 0.67–3.23) were significantly different to AADs. RFA resulted in a statistically significant reduction in hospitalizations compared to AAD (OR: 0.08; 95% CrI: 0.01–0.99), whereas cryoablation did not (OR: 0.77; 95% CrI: 0.44–1.39). The surface under the cumulative ranking curve showed RFA to be the most effective treatment at reducing overall rates of recurrence, symptomatic recurrence and hospitalizations; whereas cryoablation was most likely to reduce serious adverse events.

Conclusion

Cryoablation and RFA are both effective and safe first line therapies for AF compared to AADs, with RFA being the most effective at reducing recurrences.

### Clinical use of cooled radiofrequency ablation [^9f69193e]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Irrigated (cooled) radiofrequency (RF) ablation has become our primary ablation tool for treating atrial fibrillation, macroreentrant atrial tachycardias, and scar-related ventricular tachycardias. As with any technology that increases ablation lesion size, there is the potential for increased risk. The methods described are a cautious approach to power titration that considers the risks of excessive heating and the lesion size needed for a particular site. Future methods of assessing lesion creation will hopefully refine energy titration to improve safety and efficacy of cooled RF ablation.

### Thermal ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma [^75fffdde]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Thermal ablation, as a form of minimally invasive therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has become an important treatment modality. Because of the limitations of surgery, the techniques of thermal ablation have become standard therapies for HCC in some situations. This article reviews 4 thermal ablation techniques-radiofrequency (RF) ablation, microwave ablation, laser ablation, and cryoablation. Each of these techniques may have a role in treating HCC, and the mechanisms, equipment, patient selection, results, and complications of each are considered. Furthermore, combined therapies consisting of thermal ablation and adjuvant chemotherapy also show promise for enhancing these techniques. Important areas of research into thermal ablation remain, including improving the ability of ablation to treat larger tumors, determining the indications for each thermal ablation modality, optimizing image guidance, and obtaining good outcome data on the efficacy of these techniques.

### Cryosurgery and needle ablation of renal lesions [^03f008b8]. Journal of Endourology (2001). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic renal cryoablation is a minimally invasive alternative for treating renal tumors utilizing narrow probes cooled with a compressed gas such as argon or carbon dioxide. At this time, cryotherapy has shown the most promise as an alternative to partial nephrectomy as a nephron-sparing treatment for renal tumors. Radiofrequency ablation employs needle electrodes placed percutaneously directly into renal lesions to deliver energy, creating high temperatures leading to cell death. High-intensity focused ultrasound is a noninvasive technique in which focused ultrasound energy is applied to cause cell death within the focal zone. Microwave thermotherapy uses small applicators to deliver microwave energy to tissues, resulting in the generation of heat. Although RF, HIFU, and microwave thermotherapy show promise as energy sources for tumor ablation, they are in the early stages of development. Little is known about their acute and chronic histologic effects and long-term efficacy as a treatment for malignant disease. Further work is needed to develop cryosurgery and needle ablation in order to delineate what role these techniques will ultimately play in the management of RCC.

### Thermal ablation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma [^8cfd4993]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Thermal ablation strategies, including the use of radiofrequency, microwaves, lasers, and high-intensity focused ultrasound, are gaining increasing attention as an alternative to standard surgical therapies in the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Benefits over surgical resection include the anticipated reduction in morbidity and mortality, low cost, suitability for real-time imaging guidance, ability to perform ablative procedures on an outpatient basis, and the potential application in a wider spectrum of patients-including those who are not surgical candidates. In this review, the authors examine the reported clinical success of each of these four therapies, potential complications, current limitations, and future directions of development.

### Catheter ablation for the management of atrial fibrillation: current technical perspectives [^93f45bb6]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Catheter technology and energy sources

To date, a variety of energy modalities have been employed for the catheter ablation of AF including radiofrequency (RF), cryoablation (CB), microwave, high-intensity focused ultrasound and electroporation. Notably, the two most commonly used sources in clinical practice are RF and CB.

RF energy is generated at a frequency of 500–1000 KHz and transmitted between the catheter tip and an electrode patch positioned on the skin. The maximum amount of resistive energy occurs within approximately 2 mm of the catheter tip and is either transmitted to the endocardial surface of the heart or the blood. The majority of lesion formation occurs as a result of conductive heat, which is inversely proportional to the distance from the tip of the electrode. CB on the other hand involves three phases of tissue damage. The first occurs during delivery of CB and is known as the freezing–thawing phase. As the temperature drops below −15°C, microscopic extracellular ice formation occurs, followed by intracellular ice formation when the temperature drops below −40°C and results in localised tissue damage. As thawing occurs, there is fusion of the ice crystals with mircothrombi and platelet aggregation. Subsequently, the hemorrhagic-inflammatory phase occurs with localised tissue inflammation and oedema and finally, the replacement-fibrosis phase takes place and a fibrotic scar develops.

When compared with RF energy, patients randomised to either CB or RF groups had similar success rates and safety outcomes at 1.5 years follow-up. The results of the large multicentre Cryobaloon or Radiofrequency Ablation for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (FIRE AND ICE) trial, therefore, validate the use of CB as an alternative to conventional RF ablation for the treatment of paroxysmal AF. While the results of this trial may have been limited by the combined use of both first-generation non-contact force and second-generation contact force (CF) catheters, freedom from AF was still observed in 64.1% of subjects undergoing RF ablation and 65.4% of those undergoing CB. Additional 30 months freedom from AF data supported the non-inferiority of CB to RF ablation. It is important to note that cryoballoon ablation has been associated with significantly higher radiation doses due to the need for PV angiography to confirm complete PV occlusion and ensure optimal tissue freezing. Nonetheless, more than 35 000 CB-based ablations have been performed worldwide to date.

### Keeping it simple: balloon devices for atrial fibrillation ablation therapy [^e98b5a6d]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common disease of increasing prevalence. Catheter ablation has evolved into an established therapeutic option that mainly aims to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins from atrial myocardium. The traditional method comprises point-by-point radiofrequency current ablation guided by electroanatomical mapping and has proven to be effective and safe in experienced hands. However, this approach is technically highly demanding and associated with a long learning curve, limiting its widespread utilization. To address these shortcomings, simplified ablation tools for pulmonary vein isolation are needed. In this context, balloon devices promise to ease the procedure by approaching the entire orifice of a targeted pulmonary vein in a single maneuver. This requires less catheter manipulation in the left atrium and often allows ablation of a large volume of tissue with a single application of ablative energy. Two balloon devices-one using cryoenergy, the other laser energy-have already been established in clinical routine and have demonstrated noninferiority when compared with radiofrequency ablation in large randomized trials. More balloon devices are on the verge of being introduced into clinical practice and bear the potential to expand the interventional electrophysiologist's armamentarium when treating atrial fibrillation. The authors review the use of the established balloon devices available for atrial fibrillation ablation and provide a detailed outlook on upcoming balloon technologies, including 3 different balloons utilizing radiofrequency energy as well as a novel cryoballoon.

Ablation systems for catheter ablation — an ablation system is required in the EP laboratory and generally consists of a generator, cables, and catheters, and the systems should interface with EP monitoring and electroanatomic mapping systems; energy sources can be RF (radiofrequency) ablation, cryoablation, ultrasound ablation, microwave ablation, and laser ablation, with RF and cryotherapy most widely utilized; irrigated RF systems require an irrigation pump to infuse saline in either a closed‑ or open‑irrigated tip catheter, whereas cryoablation systems consist of a cryocatheter, refrigeration console with nitrous oxide, a coaxial tube for nitrous oxide delivery, and an electrical cable, and cryoablation can be delivered at a single site or over a larger tissue area (balloon device); selection depends on operator preference, patient size, and ablation target, RF energy remains the most established modality, cooler RF technologies are generally employed for deep and/or transmural lesions such as with VT (ventricular tachycardia) ablation, and either irrigated RF energy or the cryothermal balloon ablation system is commonly used for atrial fibrillation ablation procedures depending on operator preference; it is desirable for an EP laboratory to have more than one type of ablation system, and it is recommended that all EP laboratory personnel demonstrate familiarity and proficiency with the setup, operation, and characteristics of the ablation system(s) employed at their site.

A, Freedom from cardiovascular rehospitalization with and without a 90‐day blanking period in cryoballoon‐ vs radiofrequency current –treated cohorts is presented. Freedom from cardiovascular rehospitalization was significantly higher in the cryoballoon cohort both when events in the blanking period were included in the analysis (log‐rank test, P < 0.01) and when they were not used (log‐rank test, P = 0.02). B, Freedom from repeat ablation in the cryoballoon vscohort with and without the blanking period is compared. Freedom from repeat ablation was significantly higher in the cryoballoon cohort when events in the blanking period were included in the analysis (log‐rank test, P = 0.03), but the cohorts were no longer statistically different when events in the blanking period were excluded (log‐rank test, P = 0.10).

Repeat Ablations Within and Beyond the Blanking Period by Cohort

With or without the blanking period, the observed difference in freedom from cardiovascular rehospitalization and repeat ablation between cohorts continues to diverge beyond the first year of follow‐up (Figure 2). These data may suggest that, although the timing of initial recurrence was equivalent between cohorts, the symptoms and severity of recurrence felt by patients treated with RFC necessitated increased intervention over time.

What We Know From the FIRE AND ICE Trial

Primary Efficacy and Safety

The FIRE AND ICE Trial tested noninferiority between cryoballoon (Arctic Front or Arctic Front Advance; Medtronic, Inc) and RFC (ThermoCool, ThermoCool SF, or ThermoCool SmartTouch; Biosense Webster, Inc) ablation for PVI in a large, randomized cohort of patients with drug‐refractory paroxysmal AF. 1 The primary efficacy end point was assessed by way of a time‐to‐first‐event analysis, outside the landmark 90‐day blanking period (during which, recurrence[s] of atrial arrhythmias were not counted against the primary end point), of the following prespecified failure events: (1) documented recurrence of AF > 30 seconds, atrial tachycardia, or atrial flutter; (2) prescription of antiarrhythmic drugs; and (3) repeat catheter ablation. The Kaplan‐Meier primary efficacy event‐rate estimates at 12 months after the index procedure were 34.6% in the cryoballoon cohort and 35.9% in the RFC cohort, confirming noninferiority between the ablation modalities (P < 0.001). 1

### Percutaneous cryoablation in the liver: a meta-analysis and review of safety with a focus on incidence of cryoshock and major complications [^4ee2e32f]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Published results indicate a strong consensus on the safety of percutaneous cryoablation in the liver. Various aspects of this therapeutic option have been studied extensively, in particular the application of cryoablation near critical structures. Several investigators conclude that cryoablation is a safe procedure for treating lesions adjacent to vessels, bile ducts, the gallbladder, liver capsule, intestines, adrenal gland, renal diaphragm, and abdominal wall. Furthermore, some investigators focused on the use of cryoablation in treating small lesions. They concluded that it is feasible, particularly due to the better visibility of the ablation zone (Fig. 6). Another area of interest was the combination of cryoablation with TACE in treating large lesions, which has been shown to be effective, well-tolerated, and associated with better overall survival and a minimal complication rate, especially in cases of unresectable HCC. Comparative studies have shown varying results in terms of safety profiles when comparing cryoablation with hyperthermic techniques like RFA and MWA. Most data indicate no significant safety difference. However, there are a few studies suggesting that cryoablation is safer in treating small periductal HCCs and significantly reduces local tumor progression compared to RFA. Additionally, cryoablation is highlighted for its effectiveness and safety in liver cancers unsuitable for surgical resection, showing advantages over both RFA and MWA, and offers better local control of primary HCCs larger than 2 cm than RFA. Of course, in clinical practice, outcomes also depend on how much experience the interventionalist has with each technique.

### Ablation versus medical therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation: an updated meta-analysis [^7225b18f]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest meta‐analysis that compared the effect of ablation with medical treatment in patients with AF and is the only one addressing the effect of cryo‐balloon ablation in the subgroup analyses. Analyses revealed that AF ablation results in a significantly lower mortality rate, hospitalization, AF recurrence, or any atrial arrhythmia recurrence and a further improvement in LVEF compared to medical management. These effects were both valid using cryo‐balloon and radiofrequency ablation methods while the risk of serious side effects is not increased significantly. Data on cardiovascular hospitalization and HF hospitalization was not adequate for meta‐analysis.

Our study showed that ablation would result in a significantly greater reduction in AF or any AA recurrence in patients with refractory, paroxysmal, or persistent AF. It is probable that this decrement in atrial arrhythmia recurrence would result in better patients' quality of life and exercise capacity tolerance, lower morbidity and complications. This study revealed that ablation would cause a remarkable 47 percent risk reduction of atrial arrhythmia recurrence in patients with PAF who were naïve to treatment.

### The FIRE AND ICE trial: what we know, what we can still learn, and what we need to address in the future [^4cdf674b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

What We Need to Address in the Future

As with all successful trials, the FIRE AND ICE Trial generated many questions and future directions for potential clinical research. Specifically, pressing questions persist in the categories of repeat ablations, persistent AF, and newer ablation catheter technologies.

The FIRE AND ICE Redo Study

A substantial proportion of patients experienced recurrence of AF (37% primary efficacy failure in the FIRE AND ICE Trial) after an initially successful PVI. In these patients, re‐isolation of the PVs may be warranted. Little is known about redo ablation after PVI, particularly in regard to electrophysiological differences after an initial cryoballoon or RFC procedure. During a follow‐up of maximally 33 months, repeat ablations were performed in 12% (n = 44) of patients who had undergone an index PVI with the cryoballoon and 18% (n = 66) of patients after an index PVI using RFC.

Recently, 89 of the 110 FIRE AND ICE Trial patients with repeat ablations were retrospectively consented and enrolled in a redo study (ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03314753) with the intention to evaluate lesion durability, repeat ablation strategy, and procedural characteristics in those trial patients. There were 36 patients originally randomized to cryoballoon ablation and 53 patients randomized to RFC ablation. These repeat ablation data are currently being analyzed and will be published shortly.

### Ablation versus medical therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation: an updated meta-analysis [^e74330f7]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Study selection

Our search emerged in 17 747 articles and after removing duplications, 9387 articles remained for the two‐step screening process. The screening process ensued in 31 articles selected for our current study for further evaluation. Finally, 31 articles (from 27 different RCTs) were incorporated in this systematic review. PRISMA flowchart clarifies the comprehensive study selection process (Figure 1).

Figure 1
PRISMA flowchart included studies investigating the effect of ablation compared to medical treatment in management of patients with atrial fibrillation.

3.2 Study characteristics

All selected studies for this meta‐analysis were RCTs. 31 articles were included in our study which were the results of 27 different RCTs. We have reviewed a total number of 6965 patients (ablation: 3643, best medical treatment, BMT: 3322), including 1330 patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; ablation: 655, BMT; 675), 1220 AF patients who did not receive any AADs before the trial and therefore were naïve‐treatment for AF (ablation: 615, BMT; 605), 1653 patients who had failed to at least one AAD before study and therefore assumed as refractory AF (ablation: 962, BMT; 691). There were 12 studies almost assessing just patients with paroxysmal AF,10 studies just studying patients with persistent or long‐standing persistent AF, and the remainder were a mixture of three different AF types.

The ablation method in the majority of our selected studies was radiofrequency catheter ablation, except for one study using hot balloon ablation, and four other studies using cryo‐balloon ablation. The comparator medical therapy group in most of the selected studies used AADs, while four trials used the rate control medications, and three trials used a combination of both.

### Ablation versus medical therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation: an updated meta-analysis [^9b0c949d]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Some meta‐analyses have been done to compare outcome of patients with AF, whether treated by catheter ablation or medical therapy, and the results showed some inconstancy. Evaluation of previous meta‐analysis showed that most recent and very large trials, have not been included in some of them. In another recent meta‐analysis, progression of AF was not evaluated between medical treatment and ablation, or the analyzed data were inconsistent. Furthermore, the results from some others were contradictory. For example, two different previous meta‐analysis done by Mao et al. and Asad et al. resulted in nonsignificant stroke/TIA risk reduction in CA group. On the contrary, Song et al. in their new meta‐analysis resulted that the effect of CA on risk of stroke/TIA in AF patients could assumed to be significant (RR: 0.61, [0.39−0.96]). Considering these controversies and inconsistencies, performing a new meta‐analysis that covers all aspects of ablation vs medical treatment for treatment of patients with AF and includes all new studies in this field, evaluates all the subgroups and outcomes simultaneously in one study seemed to be essential. Here, we aimed to perform a comprehensive meta‐analysis not only to address these conflicts but also to update the current evidence and analysis of subgroups of patients to have a better insight into the effects of ablation and medical therapy for patients with AF especially by considering various subgroups including cryo‐balloon or radiofrequency ablation techniques. Also in this comprehensive meta‐analysis, for the first time Progression of AF was evaluated as one of the secondary end points of comparing these two different managements.

### Cryoballoon best practices II: practical guide to procedural monitoring and dosing during atrial fibrillation ablation from the perspective of experienced users [^0cd4e503]. Heart Rhythm (2018). Low credibility.

Since the evaluation of the cryoballoon in the Sustained Treatment Of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation trial, more than 350,000 patients with atrial fibrillation have been treated. Several studies have reported improved outcomes using the second-generation cryoballoon, and recent publications have evaluated modifications, refinements, and improvements in procedural techniques. Here, peer-reviewed articles published since the first cryoballoon best practices review were summarized against the technical practices of physicians with a high level of experience with the cryoballoon (average ≥ 6 years of experience in ≥ 900 cases). This summary includes a comprehensive literature review along with practical usage guidance from physicians using the cryoballoon to facilitate safe, efficient, and effective outcomes for patients with atrial fibrillation.

3.3.1 Serious adverse events (SAE)

Analysis of 10 studies has been performed for comparing risk ratio (RR) of SAE in the ablation group versus BMT, revealed that there was not any significant differences between these two methods of treatment (RR: 0.92, [0.64−1.33], I²: 51%, p = .03). For comparing cryo‐balloon and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RF CA) as two different methods of ablation, subgroup analysis was done and showed lower SAE in trials that used cryo‐balloon ablation (0.78; [0.34−1.78], I²: 57%, p = .07) compared to RF CA (1.02, [0.57−1.82], I²: 46%, p = .1).,(Forest plots of SAE outcome have been illustrated in Figure 2).

Statistical Analysis

The primary outcome used for this analysis was the HPV test result at the 12-month follow-up visit, whereas the primary treatment variable was the main ablation technique used during baseline treatment (ie, gas-based cryotherapy or TA). Secondary outcomes included the level of pain during treatment, the presence of side effects, and satisfaction with treatment. Subgroup analyses were performed using the HIV status and specific TA protocol.

A descriptive analysis for the primary outcome, as well as selected covariates for the secondary outcomes, and subgroup analysis were performed using central tendency measures (mean, median), as well as frequencies and percentages. The differences by primary treatment were tested using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Estimates of treatment efficacy based on the follow-up HPV test result are presented with their corresponding 95% CI.

Appropriate follow-up and long-term management after AF ablation — management of patients after hospital discharge can be complex, prophylaxis against and management of postprocedure atrial arrhythmias, including timing of repeat ablation and use of concomitant AADs, must be taught to trainees, and the training experience must address risk–benefit decision-making regarding intermediate and long-term anticoagulation; given the complexity of these issues, it would be ill-advised for cardiologists who are not trained in electrophysiology to consider performing ablation procedures for AF, and this statement should also extend to the performance of cryoballoon or other balloon ablation.

### Rationale and design of FIRE AND ICE: a multicenter randomized trial comparing efficacy and safety of pulmonary vein isolation using a cryoballoon versus radiofrequency ablation with 3D-reconstruction [^f5bd2adc]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia imposing substantial morbidity and mortality. Catheter-based pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using radiofrequency current (RFC) has become a standard treatment for drug-resistant and symptomatic paroxysmal AF (PAF). In recent years, the cryoballoon-based technique is increasingly used as a promising alternative with a short learning curve.

Methods

The FIRE AND ICE trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open, blinded outcome assessment, noninferiority trial comparing cryoballoon-, and RFC-based PVI. Patients with drug-resistant PAF will be randomized in a 1:1 matrix in multiple European centers. The primary hypothesis is that cryoballoon ablation is not inferior to RFC ablation using 3-dimensional mapping with respect to clinical efficacy. The primary endpoint is defined as the time to first documented clinical failure, including: (1) recurrence of AF; (2) atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia; (3) prescription of class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs; or (4) re-ablation, whichever comes first, following a blanking period of 3 months after the index ablation procedure. The primary safety endpoint is a composite of death, stroke/transient ischemic attack, cardiac arrhythmias (apart from AF recurrence) causally related to the therapeutic intervention, and procedure-related serious adverse events.

Conclusion

The FIRE AND ICE trial compares 2 different technologies to perform catheter ablation of PAF with respect to efficacy and safety. It aims at providing objective data to guide selection and usage of ablation catheters in the treatment of AF.

### Biophysics of ablation: application to technology [^5b4b7a32]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

The question of what happens to tissue during radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation continues to be asked as we evolve into the use of newer delivery systems.

Methods and Results

Three assumptions are made about RF ablation. (1) Tissue injury is thermally mediated; (2) heat transfer in tissue should be a predictable biophysical phenomenon; and (3) large lesion technologies have more or less equivalent efficacies. Based on these assumptions, predictions are made and discussed. Many of the predictors were proven to be true while some surprisingly were not.

Conclusion

In conclusion, tissue-area injury occurs reproducibly at a temperature of about 50 degrees C. Heat transfer in tissue is a predictable phenomenon. And finally, new technologies for large lesions are all effective, but greater surface area of ablation was achieved with a 10-mm tip and greater depth was achieved with a Chilli cooled ablation catheter.

### The impact of cryoballoon versus radiofrequency ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on healthcare utilization and costs: an economic analysis from the FIRE AND ICE trial [^e3361477]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

This reduction in clinically relevant events during follow‐up after PVI not only reflects a reduced AF burden in the cryoballoon group, it may also have a significant impact on healthcare costs when the 2 technologies are compared. There is a growing need to make transparent assessments of the value of healthcare interventions, balancing costs with health outcomes. 9 Consequently, in this report, we present a trial period economic analysis to better understand the differential cost between cryoballoon and RFC ablation from the perspective of a payer. The analyses were performed across national reimbursement systems in 3 different countries to explore whether reductions in resource use, specifically, rehospitalizations, reinterventions, and cardioversions, result in similar cost differences in each country.

Published literature review: clinical trials performed for FDA approval — Early FDA approvals evaluated irrigated radiofrequency (RF) and cryoballoon ablation (CBA) catheters in randomized trials comparing AF ablation to antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF) who had previously failed treatment with one or more drugs, and in both cases protocol-defined success with ablation (66% and 70%, respectively) was much higher than with drugs (16% and 7%). Subsequent FDA-regulated device approval studies of novel ablation technologies have not required randomization against AADs and reported protocol-defined success rates at 12 months ranging from 61% to 72.5%. A phased array multielectrode RF ablation study in patients with persistent AF refractory to ≥ 1 AAD showed higher protocol-defined success at 6 months with ablation (56% vs 26%) but did not meet its prespecified safety end point, partly due to 4 strokes (2.9% of the patients randomized to ablation).

Society of Interventional Radiology position statement — percutaneous ablation for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) recommends that in patients with small renal tumors (stage T1a), percutaneous thermal ablation is a safe and effective treatment with fewer complications than nephrectomy and acceptable long-term oncological and survival outcomes (Level of Evidence: C; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate). In selected patients with suspected T1a RCC, percutaneous thermal ablation should be offered over active surveillance (Level of Evidence: C; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate). Percutaneous biopsy of small renal masses is recommended before or during PA, whenever possible (Level of Evidence: C; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate).

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of cryoablation versus radiofrequency ablation treatments for persistent atrial fibrillation [^d3056c90]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of 2 strategies for catheter treatment of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation in the long-term period, using cardiac implantable loop recorders. The research is a prospective, randomized, controlled study designed to compare the results of modern catheter technologies in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. The study included 127 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation in the last 6 months before inclusion in the study, for whom at least 2 antiarrhythmic drugs of class I to III were not effective. By random distribution, 50 patients were included in group 1; they underwent cryoballoon ablation, using a cryoballoon of the second generation. Group 2 also included 50 patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation, where a catheter was used to control the contact force. Cardiac implantable loop electrocardiogram recorders were implanted in all patients after surgery. The average duration of follow-up was 36 months. The primary end point of efficacy occurred in 15 patients in the group with cryoballoon ablation and 14 patients in the group with radiofrequency ablation. In conclusion, the primary effectiveness was relatively the same in the groups; yet, in the long-term period, the superiority of radiofrequency ablation using catheters with pressure control was noted, but the difference in results was statistically insignificant (p < 0.672) and there was no significant difference between the 2 methods in terms of overall safety.

### Cryoballoon catheter ablation versus antiarrhythmic drugs as a first-line therapy for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: rationale and design of the international cryo-FIRST study [^a7e32c8f]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Radiofrequency current (RFC) catheter ablation for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) has been shown to be safe and effective in first-line therapy. Recent data demonstrates that RFC ablation provides better clinical outcomes compared to antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) in the treatment of early AF disease. Furthermore, studies comparing RFC and cryoballoon have established comparable efficacy and safety of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF.

Objectives

The Cryo-FIRST trial was designed to compare AAD treatment against cryoballoon PVI as a first-line therapy in treatment naïve patients with AF. Efficacy and safety will be compared between the two cohorts and amongst subgroups.

Methods

The primary hypothesis is that cryoablation is superior to AAD therapy. To test this hypothesis, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 design. Using a 90-day blanking period, primary efficacy endpoint failure is defined as (at least) one episode of atrial arrhythmia with a duration > 30 sec (documented by 7-day Holter or 12-lead ECG). Secondary endpoints (Quality-of-Life, rehospitalization, arrhythmia recurrence rate, healthcare utilization, and left atrial function) and adverse events will also be evaluated. Study enrollment will include 218 patients in up to 16 centers.

Conclusions

This study will be a multi-national randomized controlled trial comparing cryoablation against AAD as a first-line treatment in patients with paroxysmal AF. The results may help guide the selection of patients for early AF disease therapy via cryoballoon ablation.

### Multicenter randomized controlled trial of percutaneous cryoablation versus radiofrequency ablation in hepatocellular carcinoma [^e5868656]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is considered a curative treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Growing data have demonstrated that cryoablation represents a safe and effective alternative therapy for HCC, but no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been reported to compare cryoablation with RFA in HCC treatment. The present study was a multicenter RCT aimed to compare the outcomes of percutaneous cryoablation with RFA for the treatment of HCC. In all, 360 patients with Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhosis and one or two HCC lesions ≤ 4 cm, treatment-naïve, without metastasis were randomly assigned to cryoablation (n = 180) or RFA (n = 180). The primary endpoints were local tumor progression at 3 years after treatment and safety. Local tumor progression rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 3%, 7%, and 7% for cryoablation and 9%, 11%, and 11% for RFA, respectively (P = 0.043). For lesions > 3 cm in diameter, the local tumor progression rate was significantly lower in the cryoablation group versus the RFA group (7.7% versus 18.2%, P = 0.041). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 97%, 67%, and 40% for cryoablation and 97%, 66%, and 38% for RFA, respectively (P = 0.747). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year tumor-free survival rates were 89%, 54%, and 35% in the cryoablation group and 84%, 50%, and 34% in the RFA group, respectively (P = 0.628). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that Child-Pugh class B and distant intrahepatic recurrence were significant negative predictors for overall survival. Major complications occurred in seven patients (3.9%) following cryoablation and in six patients (3.3%) following RFA (P = 0.776).

Conclusion

Cryoablation resulted in a significantly lower local tumor progression than RFA, although both cryoablation and RFA were equally safe and effective, with similar 5-year survival rates.

Repeat biopsy was mandated within 24 months in 36/49 (73.5%) cohorts and for cause in the remaining 13/49 (26.5%) cohorts. Among cohorts with mandated repeat biopsy in their follow-up protocol, the mean actual repeat biopsy rate was 84.5% (± 18.8%), while for cohorts without mandated repeat biopsy, the biopsy rate was 28.7% (± 16.0%). Among the 36 mandated repeat biopsy cohorts, 26/36 (72.2%) reported a pooled overall, any cancer-positive biopsy rate of 44.6% (95% CI 38.7–50.6%, I² = 86%, p < 0.01); 29/36 (80.6%) reported a pooled overall, clinically significant cancer positive biopsy rate of 22.2% (95% CI 17.5–27.7%, I² = 89%, p < 0.01); 25/36 (69.4%) reported a pooled infield, any cancer positive biopsy rate of 21.4% (16.9–26.8%, I² = 79%, p < 0.01); 24/36 (66.7%) reported a pooled infield, clinically significant cancer positive biopsy rate of 8.9% (95% CI 6.2–12.5%, I² = 70%, p < 0.01); 25/36 (69.4%) reported a pooled outfield, any cancer positive biopsy rate of 26.5% (95% CI 21.6–32.0%, I² = 77%, p < 0.01); and, 22/36 (61.1%) reported a pooled outfield, clinically significant cancer positive biopsy rate of 12.3% (95% CI 8.7–17.1%, I² = 77%, p < 0.01). These findings are summarized in Fig. 3A, and detailed in Supplementary Figs. 1–24. We did not observe a clinically significant difference in positive repeat biopsy rates between the focal cryotherapy, HIFU, or IRE cohorts. Notably, there was high heterogeneity across the cohorts, and as such, a formal comparison of different modalities was not performed.

### Sex-specific efficacy and safety of cryoballoon versus radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^75ab7274]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a growing health burden, and pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using cryoballoon (CB) or radiofrequency (RF) represents an attractive therapeutic option. Sex-specific differences in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation of AF and PVI are recognized.

Objective

We aimed at comparing the efficacy, safety, and procedural characteristics of CB and RF in women and men undergoing a first PVI procedure.

Methods

We searched for randomized controlled trials and prospective observational studies comparing CB and RF ablation with at least 1 year of follow-up. After merging individual patient data from 18 data sets, we investigated the sex-specific (procedure failure defined as recurrence of atrial arrhythmia, reablation, and reinitiation of antiarrhythmic medication), safety (periprocedural complications), and procedural characteristics of CB vs RF using Kaplan-Meier and multilevel models.

Results

From the 18 studies, 4840 men and 1979 women were analyzed. An analysis stratified by sex correcting for several covariates showed a better efficacy of CB in men (hazard ratio for recurrence 0.88; 95% confidence interval 0.78–0.98, P = 0.02) but not in women (hazard ratio 0.98; 95% confidence interval 0.83–1.16; P = 0.82). For women and men, the energy source had no influence on the occurrence of at least 1 complication. For both sexes, the procedure time was significantly shorter with CB (-22.5 minutes for women and -27.1 minutes for men).

Conclusion

CB is associated with less long-term failures in men. A better understanding of AF-causal sex-specific mechanisms and refinements in CB technologies could lead to higher success rates in women.

Study design and procedure overview

The FIRE AND ICE trial (NCT01490814) was a multicentre, randomized, blinded-outcomes, parallel-group evaluation of cryoballoon and RFC catheter ablation in patients being treated for drug-refractory and symptomatic paroxysmal AF. A study design manuscript and the primary endpoints have been separately published. In brief, each treatment centre approved the study design with their local ethics review committee(s), and patient informed consent was obtained prior to enrolment. Patients were randomized to either cryoballoon ablation using the Arctic Front™ family of catheters (Medtronic) or RFC catheter ablation using the ThermoCool ® series of catheters (Biosense Webster).

During the index procedure, the (1:1) randomly selected ablation modality was used in the left atrium to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins (PVs). In the cryoballoon procedures, pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) was achieved using fluoroscopic guidance to position the cryoballoon catheter. Once PV-to-balloon occlusion was confirmed by retrograde radiopaque contrast agent retention, circumferential ablation was performed by freezing with a 'single-shot' delivery of coolant to the balloon. In the RFC procedure, PVI was achieved using a focal 'point-by-point' catheter approach, which delivers heat energy to the cardiac tissue. RFC lesion sets encircle the PV antra using electroanatomical mapping for guidance. In both cohorts, a PVI-only strategy was used to ablate AF, and acute index procedure success was documented in both arms with diagnostic testing. All investigators demonstrated the success of PVI by the abolition of conduction of atrial impulses into the PVs. After the index procedure, subjects were followed in this study for up to 33 months. In both groups, subjects were followed-up for a mean time of 1.54 ± 0.8 years.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Society of Interventional Radiology position statement — management of small renal tumors states that for small (< 4 cm) renal tumors, traditional options include active surveillance, radical nephrectomy (RN), and nephron-sparing partial nephrectomy (PN); oncologic outcomes from PN are equal to those from RN, making PN widely accepted as the standard of care for clinically localized RCC. For patients not candidates for surgery, percutaneous image-guided ablation — radiofrequency (RF) ablation, cryoablation, and microwave (MW) ablation — are available as validated options for tumor control and are recommended by multiple societal guidelines.

### Cryoballoon ablation as initial treatment for atrial fibrillation: JACC state-of-the-art review [^602936b2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained arrhythmia observed in clinical practice, is a chronic and progressive disorder characterized by exacerbations and remissions. Guidelines recommend antiarrhythmic drugs as the initial therapy for the maintenance of sinus rhythm; however, antiarrhythmic drugs have modest efficacy to maintain sinus rhythm and can be associated with significant adverse effects. An initial treatment strategy of cryoballoon catheter ablation in patients with treatment-naïve AF has been shown to significantly improve arrhythmia outcomes (freedom from any, or symptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmia), produce clinically meaningful improvements in patient-reported outcomes (symptoms and quality of life), and significantly reduce subsequent health care resource use (hospitalization), and it does not increase the risk of serious or any adverse events compared with initial antiarrhythmic drug therapy. These findings are relevant to inform patients, providers, and health care systems regarding the initial choice of rhythm-control therapy in patients with treatment-naïve AF.

### Radiofrequency versus cryoballoon catheter ablation in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation: a randomized trial [^d3eab140]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) represent a challenging population for rhythm control therapies. Catheter ablation (CA) with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is an effective treatment option for the reduction of the arrhythmic burden. Data regarding the comparability between radiofrequency (RF) and cryoballoon ablation (CRYO) in persistent AF are limited.

Methods

This is a prospective, randomized, single-center study designed to compare the efficacy in terms of rhythm control between RF and CRYO in persistent AF. Eligible participants were randomized 2:1 in two arms: RF and CRYO. The primary endpoint of the study was arrhythmia relapse in the early postprocedural period (first 3 months) and in the middle term follow-up (3 months to 12 months). Secondary endpoints included procedure duration, fluoroscopy time, and complications.

Results

A total of 199 patients participated in the study (133 patients in the RF arm, 66 in the CRYO arm). No statistically significant difference occurred between the two groups regarding the primary endpoint (recurrences ≤ 3 months: 35.5% RF vs. 37.9% CRYO, p .755, recurrences > 3 months: 26.3% RF vs. 27.3% CRYO, p .999). From the secondary endpoints, CRYO was a procedure of significantly shorter duration (75.15 ± 17.21 in CRYO vs. 136.6 ± 43.33 in RF group, p < .05).

Conclusion

CRYO and RF ablation appear to be equally effective for rhythm control in patients with persistent AF. CRYO ablation is advantageous in terms of procedure duration.

2.5 Study outcomes

2.5.1 Primary outcome

The primary outcome of this meta‐analysis was the rhythm control of PAF, which included the recurrence rate of any symptomatic and asymptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmias at 1‐year follow‐up and the incidence of persistent AF at 3‐year follow‐up.

2.5.2 Secondary outcomes

The secondary outcomes included QoL measured by the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality‐of‐Life (AFEQT) questionnaire, hospitalization, intervention‐related side effects, and SAEs. Atrial arrhythmia recurrence was defined as AF, atrial tachycardia, or atrial flutter for ≥ 30 seconds during ambulatory monitoring or for ≥ 10 seconds on a 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Persistent AF was defined as instances of AF lasting for more than 7 days during a 7‐day Holter ECG monitoring or necessitating termination through electrical cardioversion after 48 hours.SAE is defined as an event that results in permanent impairment of a bodily function or structure, serious deterioration in health causing life‐threatening injury or illness, inpatient hospitalization, or prolonged hospitalization for more than 1 day, the requirement of surgical or medical intervention to prevent a life‐threatening illness or injury or to permanently impair a body structure or function, or death.

2.6 Statistical analysis

The efficacy of treatment was evaluated using risk ratio (RR), standardized mean difference (SMD), and 95% confidence interval (CI). A fixed effects model was used when heterogeneity was low (I² < 50% or p ≥ .05); otherwise, a random effects model was used (I² > 50% or p < .05). The sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the robustness of the results. Outcomes of interest were analyzed using StataSE 15. A p < .05 was considered statistically significant.

### Preparation for percutaneous ablation procedures [^9e73ee49]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Percutaneous tumor ablation is now commonly used to treat a wide range of focal tumors. Patients eligible for ablation often have complex medical problems that preclude them from receiving other treatments. The interventional radiologist needs to perform a careful clinical evaluation of each patient before the procedure to determine which patients are suitable candidates for treatment and to identify patients who may be at a higher risk for complications. The clinical consultation also provides an opportunity to prepare the patient for the ablation and to appropriately plan the procedure. In this article, we discuss key components of the consultation and concepts regarding patient evaluation and preparation for a tumor ablation procedure.

### Radiofrequency thermal ablation versus other interventions for hepatocellular carcinoma [^4fb4bc42]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common malignant diseases worldwide. A potential curative option is surgical resection. Due to impaired liver function and/or anatomical reasons only few patients can be treated surgically. For the majority of patients, several interventions have been developed. Among these, local radiofrequency inducing heat production has been used to coagulate the cancer.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of radiofrequency thermal ablation in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with respect to clinically relevant outcomes (mortality, rate of recurrences, adverse events, quality of life, and duration of hospital stay) versus sham intervention, no intervention, or other interventions.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register on The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CancerLit, and Current Contents until October 2003. Handsearches were also conducted. Reference lists of the identified articles were checked for further trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials investigating radiofrequency thermal ablation versus placebo, no intervention, or any other therapeutic approach were considered for inclusion, regardless of blinding, language, and publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial inclusion, quality assessment, and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. Principal investigators were contacted for further information.

Main Results

Only two randomised clinical trials were identified. One trial including 102 patients compared radiofrequency thermal ablation versus percutaneous ethanol injection for small hepatocellular carcinoma. Radiofrequency thermal ablation significantly increased recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.85) but did not significantly influence overall survival (hazard ratio 0.20, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.69). The rate of complications and side effects did not differ significantly between the two groups. Another trial with methodological flaws compared radiofrequency thermal ablation versus percutaneous microwave coagulation for 72 patients with 94 hepatocellular carcinoma lesions. The main outcome criterion was the rate of recurrences in both groups; no significant difference was detected. The rate of side effects did not differ significantly, but significantly more treatment sessions were needed with percutaneous microwave coagulation to achieve complete tumour ablation.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Radiofrequency thermal ablation seems a potentially promising technique for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma. However, more randomised clinical trials are needed.

### The ICE-AFIB trial: a multicenter prospective investigational device exemption (IDE) trial using cryosurgical ablation for atrial fibrillation during concomitant cardiac surgery [^0e6c671b]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Surgical treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF) has transitioned from cut-and-sew to cryothermal and radiofrequency ablation. ICE-AFIB is the first prospective, multicenter investigational device exemptions (IDE) trial to evaluate cryothermy as a sole energy source to perform concomitant Cox-Maze III procedures for patients with non-paroxysmal AF.

Methods

ICE-AFIB is a single-arm, Bayesian adaptive design, IDE study (NCT03732794). Patients ≥ 18 years with persistent/longstanding persistent AF (LSPAF) underwent concomitant cryosurgical Cox-Maze III. Primary effectiveness was freedom from AF/atrial flutter (AFL)/atrial tachycardia (AT) from 6- to 12-months post-procedure. Primary safety was composite major adverse event (myocardial infarction, stroke, major bleeding, death) rate within 30-days. Rhythm assessment was with periodic 24-hour Holter monitoring.

Results

One hundred fifty patients were treated at 14 sites, with median age 69.0 (SD 8.85) years, median BMI 31.0 (SD 6.90) kg/m², CHA₂DS₂-VASc = 3.0 (SD 1.67), median left atrial diameter 5.2 (SD 0.83) cm, 66.0% were male, median current/most recent AF episode was 5.7 (SD 25.86) months in duration (63.3% persistent AF, 36.7% LSPAF). Concomitant procedures were mitral valve (67.3%), tricuspid valve (42.0%), coronary artery bypass grafting (29.3%), and aortic valve (18.7%); 59.3% had multiple concomitant procedures. Primary effectiveness was met with 70% freedom from AF/AFL/AT from 6 through 12-months (posterior probability: 0.9997; 95% credible interval [CrI] 62–77%) and 77% (95% confidence interval: 68.7%, 84.5%) at 12-months off Class I/III AADs. Primary safety at 30-days was achieved with a major MAE rate of 9.3% (posterior probability: 0.974; 95% CrI: 14.2%), including 2.7% stroke, 5.3% major bleeding, 2% operative mortality - all unrelated to surgical ablation/device.

Conclusions

The ICE-AFIB trial demonstrated safety and effectiveness of single procedure cryothermal-only Cryomaze procedure in patients with persistent and longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation.

### Cryoballoon or radiofrequency ablation for symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: reintervention, rehospitalization, and quality-of-life outcomes in the FIRE AND ICE trial [^76b09115]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

FIRE AND ICE was the first large randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of the single-step cryoballoon ablation technique with the point-by-point radiofrequency current (RFC) ablation approach in symptomatic patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). The trial confirmed its primary efficacy objective of the non-inferiority of cryoballoon ablation at 1 year with estimated event rates (first documented recurrence of AF, occurrence of atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia, use of antiarrhythmic drugs, or repeat ablation outside a 90-day blanking period) of 34.6% in the cryoballoon and 35.9% in the RFC arm [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76–1.22; P < 0.001 for non-inferiority]. Overall safety was also not significantly different (1 year Kaplan–Meier event rate estimates, 10.2% with cryoballoon and 12.8% with RFC; HR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.52–1.18; P = 0.24).

While the first FIRE AND ICE report focused on primary outcomes, this current report will focus on secondary endpoints and additional analyses that have important implications on daily clinical practice, including all-cause rehospitalization after the index procedure (which encompasses all repeat ablations for atrial arrhythmias), cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular rehospitalizations, and direct-current cardioversions (DCCVs). Also, the analysis includes an assessment of the quality-of-life surveys for both mental and physical function throughout the 30 months of follow-up.

Kidney cancer — active surveillance and ablative options: Active surveillance is defined as the initial monitoring of tumors using abdominal imaging techniques with delayed intervention when indicated, and the Panel recommends active surveillance as an option for certain patients with small renal masses (< 3 cm), T1a tumors, and competing comorbidities. Patients who are older and those with small renal masses and other comorbidities often have low RCC-specific mortality. Active surveillance and ablative techniques such as cryotherapy, microwave ablation, or radiofrequency ablation are alternative strategies for selected patients, including those who are older, those with competing health risks, and those with T1b masses not eligible for surgery. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may be considered for medically inoperable patients with stage I kidney cancer (category 2B) and with stage III/IV kidney cancer (category 3 for both). A randomized phase III comparison of ablative techniques with surgical resection has not been performed.

microbubble formation. When a scattered microbubble pattern was observed, energy was titrated down in 5-W increments until microbubble generation subsided. Energy delivery was terminated immediately when a brisk shower of dense microbubbles was observed. Radiofrequency energy was delivered by using an 8-mm tip ablation catheter. Intravenous heparin was administered to achieve an activated clotting time of 350 to 400 seconds. Radiofrequency ablation was performed wherever pulmonary vein potentials were recorded around the pulmonary vein antra. The end point of ablation was complete electrical disconnection of the pulmonary vein antrum from the left. remapped with the circular mapping catheter to check for any persisting pulmonary vein potentials and, if necessary, further ablation was performed to eliminate these potentials. All 4 pulmonary veins were isolated.

Neurological checks were performed intermittently during the procedure, at the end of the procedure, and the following day just before discharge. lower mortality and adverse events compared with drug therapy. In current clinical practice, ablation therapy for AF is reserved for patients with symptoms who have failed multiple antiarrhythmic drug regimens. The primary concern in offering an ablation procedure to treat AF as first-line therapy is that complications from the procedure can occur. A recent worldwide.

### Image-guided percutaneous ablation for the treatment of lung malignancies: current state of the art [^210cc61b]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Current scientific evidence indicates similar therapeutic results for all three ablative modalities. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider the tumor features and the patient's characteristics when choosing the ablative technique. For example, although RFA is a widely available technique with proven efficacy and safety, MWA may be preferable in larger tumors. Lung MWA can produce ablative areas of about 6 cm, compared to 3 cm for RFA. Although MWA may be more effective on tumors near the pulmonary hilum and major vessels since the heat dissipation effect does not affect its therapeutic effect, the ablation volume is difficult to control, which increases the risk of bronchial fistula if used near the pulmonary hilum.

Among the advantages of cryoablation compared to heat-based techniques, there is evaluating the ablation site during the procedure. This feature allows the optimization of the treatment in real-time. Cryoablation is an effective alternative in tumors near the great vessels, airways, pericardium, and subpleural lesions, as it tends to cause less pain to the patient than RFA and MWA. As for its disadvantages, CA is not recommended in patients with coagulopathies since a higher rate and severity of lung bleeding. Higher hemoptysis rates have also been reported compared to heat-based modalities (Table 1).

Evolution of patient inclusion criteria and selection tools over time

The patient inclusion criteria for FT among studies was highly heterogeneous, including a range of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, as well as a large range of GGs. In all, only 29/49 (59.2%) of cohorts reported D'Amico/NCCN/CAPRA risk stratification, while 48/49 (98.0%) of cohorts reported ISUP GG compositions of their patients. Earlier cohorts were more likely to report the risk strata compositions of their cohorts. In the 2018–2012 time period, 4/4 (100%) of cohorts reported risk stratification; from 2013 to 2016, 7/7 (100%); from 2017 to 2020, 8/13 (61.5%); and from 2021 to 2024, 10/25 (40.0%).

Over time, we observed a gradual increase in the proportion of GG2-5 patients in the reported cohorts, whereas earlier cohorts generally included a higher proportion of GG1 patients, reflecting a change in the patient selection criteria for FT to target patients with clinically significant prostate cancer (Fig. 1C). In the 2008–2012 time period, 4 studies reported that the proportion of their cohort having csPCa ranged from 35.0 to 42.5%; from 2013 to 2016, 7 studies reported 0.0–57.2%; from 2017 to 2020, 13 studies 16.0–74.3%; and, from 2021 to 2024, 25 studies 66.3–85.3%.

A total of 38/49 (77.6%) of cohorts reported the use of mpMRI in the pre-diagnostic workup before FT. Later cohorts were more likely to utilize mpMRI compared to earlier cohorts. In the 2008–2012 time period, 0/4 (0%) studies reported utilizing mpMRI; from 2013 to 2016, 4/7 (57.1%); from 2017 to 2020, 12/13 (92.3%); and, from 2021 to 2024, 22/25 (88.0%) studies reported utilizing mpMRI. 27/49 (55.1%) of cohorts reported utilizing targeted biopsies while 26/49 (53.1%) cohorts reported using some form of systematic biopsy (12-core or mapping biopsy).

### The impact of cryoballoon versus radiofrequency ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on healthcare utilization and costs: an economic analysis from the FIRE AND ICE trial [^b93d2ef9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The reduction in repeat ablations takes on additional importance when considering the programs that payers have implemented and plan to implement to deliver appropriate care to their members with maximum efficiency. Several European countries have implemented "budget envelopes", under which large increases in the spending associated with a medical technology from year to year are not fully covered. If the cost or number of procedures exceeds predefined levels, payment rates are reduced for the additional procedures. Other forms of risk sharing between payers and providers (such as bundled payment for a year of care) are at various stages of implementation but are intended to have a similar effect. A health technology that can appropriately treat the same number of patients with fewer overall claims could help avoid negative economic consequences for patients, providers, and payers.

Cardiovascular rehospitalizations (not inclusive of repeat ablation procedures) are also a meaningful driver of the cost difference observed in this analysis. These rehospitalizations are likely to have been driven by patients experiencing recurring AF symptoms and seeking medical care. Noncardiovascular rehospitalizations are not a cost driver, and this is likely because of the relative youth and health of the paroxysmal AF population receiving ablations compared with other cardiovascular disease. Cardioversions were not a strong driver of costs in this analysis (because the event rate was low compared with the other HCU types), but their impact on hospital resource burden and patient experience cannot be ignored. There was no difference in payer costs for the index ablation procedure and associated hospitalization as payers do not have a cost difference because reimbursement between the 2 therapies is the same.

### Cryoballoon or radiofrequency ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^be83c323]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study FIRE AND ICE was published by Kuck KH and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation. In the FIRE AND ICE study, the trial question was: is cryoballoon ablation noninferior to radiofrequency ablation in patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF? In the FIRE AND ICE study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the FIRE AND ICE study, the population was: 750 patients (293 female, 457 male). The inclusion criteria were symptomatic patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation; any disease limiting life expectancy to < 1 year; substance misuse; active systemic infection; cryoglobulinemia; unstable angina pectoris; symptomatic carotid stenosis; COPD with detected pulmonary hypertension. In the FIRE AND ICE study, the interventions were: n = 376 cryoballoon (pulmonary vein isolation with cryoballoon ablation with fluoroscopic guidance) n = 374 radiofrequency (radiofrequency ablation using electroanatomical navigation). In the FIRE AND ICE study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in documented clinical failure (recurrence of AF, occurrence of atrial flutter or AT, use of antiarrhythmic drugs, or repeat ablation) (34.6% vs. 35.9%; HR 0.96, 96% CI 0.76 to 1.22). In the FIRE AND ICE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death, cerebrovascular events, or serious treatment-related adverse events at 1 year (10.2% vs. 12.8%; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.18). In the FIRE AND ICE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall safety events. In the FIRE AND ICE study, the conclusion was: in symptomatic patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF, cryoballoon was noninferior to radiofrequency with respect to documented clinical failure (recurrence of AF, occurrence of atrial flutter or AT, use of antiarrhythmic drugs, or repeat ablation).

### Comparison of percutaneous and surgical approaches to renal tumor ablation: metaanalysis of effectiveness and complication rates [^e2191539]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the effectiveness and complication rates of ablation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) performed with a percutaneous approach versus a surgical approach.

Materials and Methods

A search performed on PubMed identified series of renal tumor ablations. Keywords searched included "radiofrequency" (RF), "cryoablation", "cryosurgery", "cryotherapy", "ablation", "renal", "kidney", and "RCC". Review articles were excluded from the search of English-language literature from January 1996 through August 2006. Inclusion criteria were (i) more than one case, (ii) use of RF ablation or cryoablation, (iii) effectiveness based on follow-up imaging, and (iv) report of complication rate. Effectiveness was defined by the proportion of tumors without residual enhancement after one treatment session (ie, primary effectiveness) or after repeated treatments (ie, secondary effectiveness). Major complications were defined as events with substantial morbidity, disability, or increasing level of care. Metaanalysis was performed on primary effectiveness, secondary effectiveness, and major complication rates with a random-effects model. Differences were considered significant if the 95% CIs did not overlap.

Results

Forty-six series (28 percutaneous, 18 surgical) met all inclusion criteria. The primary effectiveness rate for the percutaneous group (87%) was significantly lower than that in the surgical group (94%; P < .05). The secondary effectiveness rate in the percutaneous treatment group (92%) was not significantly different from that in the surgical treatment group (95%; P > .05). The major complication rate in the percutaneous treatment group (3%) was significantly lower than that in the surgical treatment group (7%; P < .05).

Conclusions

Based on a metaanalysis, when ablating renal tumors, a percutaneous approach was safer than an open or laparoscopic approach and was equally effective. However, more than one procedure was needed to treat the tumor completely.

### Quality of life and health care utilization in the CIRCA-DOSE study [^b53cece5]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study evaluated the impact of contact force-guided radiofrequency ablation versus cryoballoon ablation on quality of life and health care utilization.

Background

Traditional outcome parameters, such as arrhythmia-free survival, are insufficient to evaluate the clinical impact of atrial fibrillation (AF), as it fails to the capture patient- and health system-level differences in treatment approaches.

Methods

The CIRCA-DOSE (Cryoballoon Vs. Contact-Force Atrial Fibrillation Ablation) study randomly assigned 346 patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF to contact force-guided radiofrequency or cryoballoon ablation. Health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) was assessed at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months post-ablation using a disease-specific and generic HRQOL instruments. Health care utilization (hospitalization, emergency department visits, and cardioversion) and antiarrhythmic drug use for the 12 months preceding ablation was compared with the 12 months following ablation.

Results

Disease-specific and generic HRQOL was moderately to severely impaired at baseline and improved significantly at 6 and 12 months of follow-up (median improvement in AFEQT [Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy of Life] score 32.4 [interquartile range: 17.7 to 48.9]). When compared with the 12 months pre-ablation, the proportion and absolute number of cardioversions decreased significantly (41.1% vs. 10.1% of patients, 137 vs. 35 events; p < 0.0001). Similar significant reductions in emergency department visits (66.7% vs. 25.1% of patients, 224 vs. 87 events; p < 0.0001), and hospitalizations (25.5% vs. 14.5% of patients, 86 vs. 50 events; p < 0.001) were observed. There were no significant differences between randomized groups.

Conclusions

In this multicenter randomized trial, catheter ablation with advanced-generation technologies resulted in a significant improvement in HRQOL and a significant reduction in health care utilization in the year following AF ablation.

### AASLD practice guidance on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [^03157ec4]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hepatocellular carcinoma, more specifically with respect to management of early disease, local ablation, AASLD 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering thermal ablation (radiofrequency or microwave ablation) in patients with early-stage HCC ≤ 3 cm ineligible for or declining surgery.

### Cryoballoon or radiofrequency ablation for symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: reintervention, rehospitalization, and quality-of-life outcomes in the FIRE AND ICE trial [^ea9b9bc0]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

When comparing cryoballoon and RFC catheter ablation in symptomatic patients with paroxysmal AF, this study demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant advantages for patients treated with cryoballoon ablation in terms of repeat ablations, DCCVs, all-cause rehospitalizations, and cardiovascular rehospitalizations. Both patient groups improved in quality-of-life scores after AF ablation. The endpoint events captured in this current analysis are important to the patient's perception of a successful AF ablation procedure and to the burden of disease on the healthcare systems.
