32 year old male with 3 months of intermittent dysuria and urinary frequency.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate a 32-year-old man with 3 months of intermittent dysuria and urinary frequency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key elements of the history that distinguish infectious from noninfectious and structural causes. Then, I should verify the focused physical examination and first-line tests, including urinalysis and culture. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis and how to prioritize it. After that, I need to outline a staged diagnostic workup with imaging and urologic testing. Finally, I should confirm management pathways for likely diagnoses and close with red flags and follow-up plans, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core history elements I must elicit to frame pretest probabilities and guide testing, because missing a high-yield detail can derail the workup. I need to characterize dysuria precisely (burning vs discomfort, timing during voiding), quantify frequency and nocturia, and screen for obstructive symptoms such as weak stream, hesitancy, straining, and postvoid dribbling, which push me toward urethral stricture or prostatic pathology in men, while also asking about hematuria, flank pain, fever, and systemic symptoms to exclude pyelonephritis or prostatitis, and I should review sexual exposures and STI risks including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and Mycoplasma genitalium, as well as any prior urethritis or STI treatments, because these strongly influence the likelihood of infectious urethritis versus sterile inflammatory conditions [^111Gwqad] [^113LW9Y9] [^114ZaWCX].

> Wait, let me verify the noninfectious and lifestyle contributors I must not overlook, because they can mimic or amplify urinary symptoms. I should ask about bladder irritants such as caffeine, alcohol, artificial sweeteners, and acidic foods, screen for pelvic trauma or instrumentation, and explicitly query ketamine use given the risk of ketamine bladder syndrome with frequency, urgency, and dysuria, and I should also ask about prior urologic procedures, catheterizations, or radiation that could predispose to strictures or interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, since these histories pivot the differential and testing strategy [^111Gwqad] [^117MVze4] [^111yMtX3].

> Next, I should review the focused physical examination, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before I confirm what findings truly change management. I will inspect the external urethral meatus for discharge, erythema, or lesions, palpate along the urethra for masses or tenderness suggesting diverticulum or stricture, perform a digital rectal exam to assess prostate size, tenderness, and consistency while obtaining a postvoid residual, and I should also perform a focused neurologic exam if I suspect neurogenic contributors or if there are signs of retention or detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, because these findings guide whether I escalate to urodynamics or imaging [^115ncMVd] [^113LW9Y9] [^117JbfeD].

> I will now examine the first-line laboratory evaluation, and I need to ensure I order the right tests up front to avoid delays. A urinalysis with microscopy is mandatory to assess pyuria, hematuria, and bacteriuria, and in men with lower urinary tract symptoms I should obtain a urine culture with susceptibilities even if the urinalysis is unrevealing, because guidelines recommend culture in males to guide therapy and detect occult infection or colonization patterns that change management, and I should consider STI NAATs for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and Mycoplasma genitalium if there is any urethral discharge, sexual exposure risk, or persistent urethritis with negative initial testing [^116RajvE] [^114zCQCy] [^114ZaWCX].

> Hold on, I should verify how to interpret culture results in symptomatic men, because thresholds differ from classic asymptomatic bacteriuria definitions. In symptomatic men, colony counts as low as 10² CFU/mL can be clinically significant, so I must integrate colony count with pyuria and symptoms rather than relying on the 10⁵ CFU/mL threshold used historically for asymptomatic screening, and I should double-check for polymicrobial growth suggesting contamination versus true infection, especially if the clinical picture is discordant [^1121oYdt] [^1172Rvx7].

> Let me think about the prioritized differential diagnosis, and I should confirm that I am not anchoring prematurely on infection. In a 32-year-old man with intermittent dysuria and frequency, the leading considerations include urethritis from gonorrhea, chlamydia, or Mycoplasma genitalium, chronic bacterial prostatitis or chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, urethral stricture disease, overactive bladder, and less commonly bladder stones, eosinophilic cystitis, or ketamine bladder syndrome, and I should keep in mind that symptom overlap is common and that culture-negative presentations do not exclude clinically meaningful pathology [^111Gwqad] [^112J8bVt] [^111yMtX3] [^113LW9Y9] [^112xwVrk] [^117MVze4].

> I should confirm the initial management pathway if urinalysis and culture suggest bacterial urethritis or cystitis, because treatment choices and durations differ by sex and site. Empiric therapy should cover likely uropathogens and STIs based on exposure risk, with ceftriaxone plus doxycycline for gonorrhea and chlamydia when STI risk is present, and for lower UTI symptoms in men, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, or trimethoprim for 7 days are reasonable while awaiting culture, with adjustment once sensitivities return, and I must avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in the absence of indications such as pregnancy or urologic procedures [^1132xnmk] [^1172Rvx7].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist or cultures are negative despite compatible symptoms. I need to ensure a staged diagnostic escalation that is proportional to risk and pretest probability. If urethral stricture is suspected from obstructive features or history, I should obtain uroflowmetry with postvoid residual and proceed to retrograde urethrogram or cystoscopy for definitive diagnosis, and if interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is suspected by bladder pain with filling and relief with emptying, I should consider cystoscopy with hydrodistension and potassium sensitivity testing in select cases while also screening for pelvic floor dysfunction, and if CP/CPPS is suspected, I should use the UPOINT approach and consider pelvic floor physical therapy, alpha-blockers, and multimodal pain strategies, and if eosinophilic cystitis is on the table due to hematuria or mass-like imaging, I should plan cystoscopy with biopsy to confirm before initiating steroids [^113LW9Y9] [^112J8bVt] [^114JHfyt].

> I should double-check imaging indications so I do not overuse or underuse tests. Renal and bladder ultrasound is appropriate for hematuria, suspected stones, persistent symptoms despite appropriate therapy, or when I need to evaluate for structural abnormalities such as diverticulum, masses, or congenital anomalies, and CT urography becomes reasonable if ultrasound is nondiagnostic and suspicion for stone, malignancy, or complex anatomy remains high, while MRI can help characterize indeterminate bladder wall lesions or suspected eosinophilic cystitis, and I should remember that rare entities like urachal pathology can present with frequency and dysuria and may require cross-sectional imaging for detection [^114JHfyt] [^113WVLXZ].

> Let me reconsider the role of urodynamics, because I need to ensure I reserve them for the right scenarios. Pressure-flow studies are indicated when I suspect primary bladder neck obstruction, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, or neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, particularly with elevated postvoid residuals or complex voiding complaints, and I should counsel that a single negative study does not exclude detrusor overactivity or obstruction if clinical suspicion remains high [^116BJKx8] [^1114RySj].

> I should confirm red flags that mandate urgent urologic consultation or alternative diagnostic pathways, because missing these has consequences. Gross hematuria, fevers with flank pain suggesting pyelonephritis, acute urinary retention, or a palpable urethral mass require prompt escalation, and in patients with cancer survivorship histories or pelvic radiation, I must maintain vigilance for radiation cystitis, urethral stricture, or secondary malignancy and follow survivorship surveillance guidance for timely evaluation of dysuria and hematuria [^113WjFaV] [^1125dTQE].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring so that I close the loop on treatment and avoid premature closure. If treated empirically for urethritis or UTI, I should reassess within 48 to 72 hours to ensure symptom improvement and tailor therapy to culture results, and if symptoms persist or recur, I should repeat urinalysis and culture and escalate to imaging and urologic referral as indicated, documenting objective response to guide whether ongoing symptoms reflect treatment failure, alternative diagnoses, or chronic pain syndromes [^116RajvE].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, reference-aligned approach: start with a precise history and exam, obtain urinalysis and culture in all men with these symptoms, treat empirically only when indicated and then tailor to culture, escalate to imaging and specialty testing for persistent or complicated cases, and keep a broad differential that includes infectious urethritis, prostatitis syndromes, IC/BPS, urethral stricture, OAB, and less common entities like eosinophilic cystitis or ketamine bladder, adjusting the workup to the evolving clinical picture and patient-specific risk factors [^111Gwqad] [^116RajvE] [^112J8bVt] [^111yMtX3] [^113LW9Y9].

In a 32-year-old man with 3 months of intermittent dysuria and urinary frequency, the most likely causes are **chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS)** [^112J8bVt], **interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS)** [^111yMtX3], or **urethral stricture** [^113LW9Y9]. Less common considerations include chronic bacterial prostatitis [^113nudkf], bladder stones, or malignancy. Essential next steps are **urinalysis, urine culture, and a focused exam** (including digital rectal exam and post-void residual) [^111Gwqad] [^115ncMVd]. If initial tests are inconclusive, obtain **uroflowmetry, renal/bladder ultrasound, and cystoscopy** [^114zCQCy]. Management is diagnosis-specific: CP/CPPS and IC/BPS require multimodal therapy [^111Zm9LC]; strictures may need dilation or urethroplasty [^notfound].

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

### Initial evaluation

- **History**: Onset, duration, severity, associated symptoms (pain, hematuria, systemic symptoms), sexual history, prior UTIs, trauma, instrumentation [^115RQPT9].

- **Physical examination**: Abdomen, flank, genitalia, digital rectal exam (prostate), focused neurologic exam [^114zCQCy].

- **Laboratory tests**: Urinalysis, urine culture, CBC, renal function tests [^1135JKJ5].

---

### Further evaluation (if initial tests are inconclusive)

- **Uroflowmetry and post-void residual**: Assess obstruction [^114zCQCy].

- **Renal and bladder ultrasound**: Identify stones, masses, hydronephrosis [^114zCQCy].

- **Cystoscopy**: Visualize urethra and bladder for strictures, stones, tumors [^114zCQCy].

- **Urodynamic studies**: Evaluate bladder function if IC/BPS suspected [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying diagnosis**:

- **CP/CPPS**: Multimodal therapy (alpha-blockers, pelvic floor physical therapy, analgesics, lifestyle modifications) [^111Zm9LC].

- **IC/BPS**: Bladder training, dietary changes, intravesical therapy, pelvic floor therapy [^notfound].

- **Urethral stricture**: Urethral dilation, endoscopic urethrotomy, or urethroplasty [^notfound].

- **Bladder stones**: Stone removal (cystolitholapaxy or surgery) [^notfound].

- **Bladder cancer**: Surgical resection, chemotherapy, immunotherapy [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and follow-up

Prognosis varies by diagnosis: CP/CPPS and IC/BPS are chronic but manageable with appropriate therapy [^112J8bVt] [^111yMtX3]; urethral stricture has a good prognosis after treatment, though recurrence is common [^notfound]; bladder cancer prognosis depends on stage and grade at diagnosis [^notfound]. Follow-up should be regular to monitor **symptoms**, **treatment response**, and **complications** [^notfound].

---

A 32-year-old man with 3 months of intermittent dysuria and urinary frequency most likely has CP/CPPS, IC/BPS, or urethral stricture. A **structured evaluation** — history, exam, urinalysis, culture, and targeted imaging — is essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy [^115RQPT9].

### Evaluation of dysuria in men… [^1121oYdt]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

5 Nearly one half of men over 55 years of age report some urinary symptoms, and about 25 percent of these men see a physician about their symptoms. 6 Among men of all ages who complain of urinary symptoms occurring more than rarely, dysuria is mentioned as one of the symptoms about 5 percent of the time. Dysuria is often associated with other irritative voiding symptoms, such as urgency, frequency and nocturia, but its most common cause is urinary tract infection. Urinary stasis resulting from urethral obstruction makes BPH a very common predisposing factor for urinary tract infection. The most common cause of recurring urinary tract infection in men is chronic bacterial prostatitis. 8 Furthermore, as men age, urinary obstruction can induce changes in bladder compliance that result in both obstructive symptoms and increased irritative symptoms, including dysuria. 9, 10. BPH-induced dysuria may be caused by urinary infection resulting from obstruction and stasis.

It may also be caused by inflammation of the distended urethral mucosa. Over time, chronic obstruction of urinary outflow as a result of BPH can cause bladder hyperplasia, trabeculation and, eventually, decompensation. 1-adrenoreceptors and can be reduced by alpha-blocker medications. Alpha blockers have been shown to improve BPH-related dysuria. 24 Nearly one half of men with mild BPH symptoms, however, stay the same or improve with expectant management. 9 Surgery, most often transurethral resection of the prostate, continues to represent the most definitive and enduring treatment for BPH. 25 Seminal vesicle congestion following prostatectomy has been described as a cause of dysuria. 26 Decreased symptoms and improved urine flow have also been demonstrated with microwave hyperthermia therapy.
27.

HISTORY The physician should ask the patient about the timing, frequency, severity and location of the dysuria, as well as the presence of other irritative symptoms such as urgency, frequency or nocturia. It is also important to inquire about obstructive symptoms such as weak stream, hesitancy, intermittency and dribbling. 5 per mL are frequently used to diagnose asymptomatic infection, a pure colony count of 10² per mL in the presence of symptoms is considered sufficient to conclude that an infection is present. Hematuria without pyuria should raise the question of stone disease or a urinary tract malignancy such as bladder cancer.

Members of the Chronic Prostatitis Collaborative Research Network (CPCRN) met in a 1-day symposium to review recent findings and to debate unanswered issues in the diagnosis and management of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). The meeting was focused on producing an overview summary statement that would, as nearly as possible, represent the consensus views of the attendees. As discussed below, the participants agreed that a history, physical examination, and urinalysis/urine culture are mandatory for the evaluation of all patients presenting with CP/CPPS, with other assessments categorized as recommended or optional, depending on the history and physical findings. Observations and suggestions regarding first- and second-line therapies are also offered, with the recognition that randomized, placebo-controlled trials to guide selection of therapies for chronic nonbacterial prostatitis are currently lacking.

### Urine trouble: should we think differently about UTI? [^115iUiqd]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is clinically important, given that it is one of the most common bacterial infections in adult women. However, the current understanding of UTI remains based on a now disproven concept that the urinary bladder is sterile. Thus, current standards for UTI diagnosis have significant limitations that may reduce the opportunity to improve patient care. Using data from our work and numerous other peer-reviewed studies, we identified four major limitations to the contemporary UTI description: the language of UTI, UTI diagnostic testing, the Escherichia coli-centric view of UTI, and the colony-forming units (CFU) threshold-based diagnosis. Contemporary methods and technology, combined with continued rigorous clinical research can be used to correct these limitations.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1174tKiQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Which Investigations Are Needed at Diagnosis and During Complicated UTI?

Patient history and clinical review underpin the diagnosis of UTI and assessment of complicating features at presentation (GRADE D).
Urine collection should be done by clean catch, catheterization or suprapubic aspiration and urine analysis, culture and susceptibility testing should be undertaken for all children (GRADE C).
Additional blood investigations for cUTI may include inflammatory markers, full blood count, blood culture, urea, creatinine and electrolytes (GRADE C).
An acute ultrasound scan is helpful in some clinical situations (GRADE D).
All children with cUTI should be reassessed for treatment response at 48 hours. If progress is atypical, consider complications and/or differential diagnosis (GRADE D).
Repeat urine testing is only needed if there is inadequate treatment response (GRADE D).

All children, irrespective of uUTI or cUTI, need urinary investigations to confirm UTI diagnosis – (Table 2). Key investigations and their interpretation are given below.

TABLE 2.
Summary of Diagnostic and Other Initial Investigations in Children With cUTI

As with uncomplicated UTI, clean catch urine collection is preferred due to its noninvasive nature, with catheterization or suprapubic aspiration being the gold standards if collection is difficult or diagnosis is uncertain. In infants under 2 months, clean catch methods are challenging and can result in up to 38% contaminated samples, so catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is advised. Up to 88% of specimens collected via a urine bag with a positive culture will be false positives, so they should only be used in nonurgent situations as an initial screening measure; a negative result confirms the absence of a UTI.

Urine Dipstick Analysis

If leukocyte esterase is greater than trace, pyuria is present. Dipsticks may be false negatives in children with < 3 months with high voiding frequency or with Enterococcus spp. or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These pathogens have a reduced ability to convert nitrate to nitrite, and Enterococcus spp. may not induce a strong inflammatory response to increase leukocyte esterase.– Dipsticks may be false positives due to contamination, fever of a different cause, localized or systemic inflammatory processes, for example, Kawasaki disease.

Urine Microscopy

Pyuria is present with ≥ 5 WBC/high-powered field with standardized or automated microscopy or ≥ 10 WBC/mm³ on a hemocytometer. Because of low sensitivity, negative urine microscopy does not exclude UTI.

### Rare presentation of recurrent eosinophilic cystitis in a child [^114JHfyt]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Eosinophilic cystitis (EC) is a rare presentation in childhood, with just over 100 cases reported in the literature. It often presents with haematuria and irritative lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) including frequency, urgency and dysuria. EC can be treated conservatively or surgically. We present a case of an early adolescent male patient who presented with dysuria and haematuria. An ultrasound scan and MRI revealed a lesion in the bladder wall raising the suspicion of malignancy. The initial biopsy was inconclusive, and so imaging was repeated a month later, showing the bladder mass had altered in position, which was confirmed at cystoscopy. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of EC. Symptoms resolved, but the patient represented 3 years later with irritative LUTS, haematuria and a left-sided bladder mass on imaging. Biopsy confirmed a reoccurrence of EC and he was managed successfully with oral steroids.

### Common questions about chronic prostatitis [^113nudkf]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic bacterial prostatitis:

- **Definition**: CBP is caused by a chronic bacterial infection of the prostate gland characterized by recurrent UTIs caused by the same bacterial strain, pelvic pain, and LUTS.
- **Pathophysiology**: CBP is caused by a chronic bacterial infection commonly involving E. coli and enterococci.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include pain, which may be poorly localized (pelvis, genitalia, lower back, or hypogastrium), and LUTS (weak stream, straining, hesitancy, urgency, frequency, dysuria).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: CBP is not associated with increased mortality.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113C4q31]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definition and diagnostic criteria emphasize that this Guideline supports the most commonly used definition of two episodes of acute bacterial cystitis within a six-month period sometime within the preceding year, and any patient experiencing episodes of symptomatic acute cystitis after previous resolution of similar symptoms meets the criteria for rUTI. Strong evidence suggests that the diagnosis of acute bacterial cystitis should include the combination of acute-onset symptoms referable to the urinary tract, urinary inflammation on microscopic urinalysis (pyuria), and laboratory confirmation of significant bacteriuria, with Table 1 detailing components such as acute-onset symptoms including dysuria with increased urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence; urinary tract inflammation defined as pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/high power field (hpf) on microscopic urinalysis; and detection of a bacterial uropathogen. Without symptoms, bacteriuria of any magnitude is considered asymptomatic bacteriuria, and patients who recur rapidly within two weeks of initial treatment or who display bacterial persistence without symptom resolution may require imaging, cystoscopy, or other further investigation for bacterial reservoirs.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114HaXjM]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Highlights

- Older adults may present atypically with UTI and making a diagnosis can be difficult.
- There is limited authoritative guidance on how older adult outpatients present with UTI.
- Symptoms and signs traditionally associated with UTI (e.g. nocturia, urgency and abnormal vital signs) may have limited utility in diagnosing these infections in older adult outpatients.
- Disability in performing a number of acts of daily living may be better predictors of UTI; high quality studies should be conducted in this area to confirm this.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults: the most fragile women are prone to long-term colonization [^116AYAwx]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is common in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and was shown to account for 22% of all infections and more than 50% of the antibiotic prescriptions in this setting. However, in institutionalized older adults, UTI is difficult to differentiate from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). ABU prevalence rates in LTCFs are high, ranging from 25 to 50% in women and from 15 to 40% in men. Such high ABU prevalence rates obviously compromise the value of a positive urine culture as a diagnostic criterion for UTI. In addition, assessing symptoms of a UTI is challenging in this population. Institutionalized older adults, especially those with mental impairment or chronic symptoms, are often incapable of recognizing or communicating the presence of symptoms. Moreover, this geriatric population frequently exhibits atypical manifestations of acute disease and presents with nonspecific symptoms. As UTI can cause severe infections, practitioners are prone to diagnose a UTI relying solely on vague symptoms such as changes in behavior or changes in the appearance of urine rather than typical symptoms of a UTI such as dysuria, frequency or urgency. Residents of LTCFs thus frequently receive antibiotics due to a suspected infection, resulting in a significant overuse of antimicrobials. Treatment of ABU in this population is however not recommended because of potential adverse effects and a lack of efficacy in preventing subsequent UTIs. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that ABU protects against infection.

### Dysuria: evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^111Gwqad]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Dysuria, a feeling of pain or discomfort during urination, is often caused by urinary tract infection but can also be due to sexually transmitted infection, bladder irritants, skin lesions, and some chronic pain conditions. History is most often useful for finding signs of sexually transmitted infection, complicated infections, lower urinary symptoms in males, and noninfectious causes. Most patients presenting with dysuria should have a urinalysis performed. Urine culture should be performed for infection to guide appropriate antibiotic use, especially for recurrent or suspected complicated urinary tract infection. Vaginal discharge decreases the likelihood of urinary tract infection, and other causes of dysuria, including cervicitis, should be investigated. If a patient has persistent urethritis or cervicitis with negative initial testing, Mycoplasma genitalium testing is recommended. Clinical decision rules may increase the accuracy of diagnosis with and without laboratory analysis. Evaluation and treatment of dysuria through a virtual encounter without laboratory testing may increase recurrent symptoms and antibiotic courses. Persistent symptoms after initial evaluation and treatment require further workup for infectious and noninfectious causes.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^112TE65A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^1146BbVG]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definitions and terminology state that a commonly used definition describes urinary tract infection (UTI) as an infection of the lower and/or upper genitourinary tract which is diagnosed based on the presence of a pathogen in the urinary tract and associated symptoms, with limited evidence to support any "gold standard" UTI definition for epidemiologic or clinical research; this statement endorses a clinically useful, culture-based definition for rUTI of at least 2 culture-proven episodes in 6 months, or at least 3 in 1 year, and distinguishes relapse as UTI symptoms with the same uropathogen within 2 weeks of completing appropriate antibiotic therapy versus recurrence beyond the initial 2 weeks or with a different uropathogen.

In this first episode of the Microbiologist in the Clinic series, clinicians and laboratory scientists share their perspectives about a 30 y/o woman, who is seeking specialty consultation for frequent episodes of urinary urgency, frequency, and dysuria, which respond to short courses of antibiotics. Although her home dipsticks suggest that she has a UTI, and her urinalysis typically has a moderate number of white blood cells, her urine cultures are always negative. The challenges of this clinical presentation are discussed with evidence for evaluation and treatment.

### Does this child have a urinary tract infection? [^117DDGb3]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequently occurring pediatric illness that, if left untreated, can lead to permanent renal injury. Accordingly, accurate diagnosis of UTI is important.

Objective

To review the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of UTI in infants and children.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was conducted for articles published between 1966 and October 2007, as well as a manual review of bibliographies of all articles meeting inclusion criteria, 1 previously published systematic review, 3 clinical skills textbooks, and 2 experts in the field, yielding 6988 potentially relevant articles.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they contained data on signs or symptoms of UTI in children through age 18 years. Of 337 articles examined, 12 met all inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two evaluators independently reviewed, rated, and abstracted data from each article.

Data Synthesis

In infants with fever, history of a previous UTI (likelihood ratio [LR] range, 2.3–2.9), temperature higher than 40 degrees C (LR range, 3.2–3.3), and suprapubic tenderness (LR, 4.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6–12.4) were the findings most useful for identifying those with a UTI. Among male infants, lack of circumcision increased the likelihood of a UTI (summary LR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.9–4.3); and the presence of circumcision was the only finding with an LR of less than 0.5 (summary LR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.18–0.63). Combinations of findings were more useful than individual findings in identifying infants with a UTI (for temperature > 39 degrees C for > 48 hours without another potential source for fever on examination, the LR for all findings present was 4.0; 95% CI, 1.2–13.0; and for temperature < 39 degrees C with another source for fever, the LR was 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16–0.85). In verbal children, abdominal pain (LR, 6.3; 95% CI, 2.5–16.0), back pain (LR, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.1–6.1), dysuria, frequency, or both (LR range, 2.2–2.8), and new-onset urinary incontinence (LR, 4.6; 95% CI, 2.8–7.6) increased the likelihood of a UTI.

Conclusions

Although individual signs and symptoms were helpful in the diagnosis of a UTI, they were not sufficiently accurate to definitively diagnose UTIs. Combination of findings can identify infants with a low likelihood of a UTI.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection in older adults [^1171Mf6J]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a commonly diagnosed infection in older adults. Despite consensus guidelines developed to assist providers in diagnosing UTI, distinguishing symptomatic UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older adults is problematic, as many older adults do not present with localized genitourinary symptoms. This article summarizes the recent literature and guidelines on the diagnosis and management of UTI and ASB in older adults.

Symptoms — dysuria is a key symptom of bacterial cystitis, and in young women there is a 90% probability of a UTI when she reports dysuria and frequency in the absence of vaginal discharge or irritation; history and examination increase UTI probability with dysuria (likelihood ratio [LR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–2), frequency (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.3), hematuria (LR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3–2.9), back pain (LR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2–2.1), and costovertebral angle tenderness (LR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.5), whereas the probability is reduced with a history of vaginal discharge (LR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9) or vaginal irritation (LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9); with aging, acute dysuria remains reliable, new-onset frequency or urgency correlates with UTI, and new-onset urinary incontinence should prompt evaluation for UTI, but worsening of chronic incontinence or other urinary symptoms are not reliably associated with UTI.

### Feasibility assessment of modified chest-knee position in female urethral diverticulectomy: a single-center experience [^115RgNvX]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Urethral diverticula (UD) exhibit a marked female predominance, with acquired cases constituting the majority of clinical presentations. The clinical manifestations of female UD are notoriously heterogeneous and often nonspecific, posing diagnostic challenges. While the classic triad of dysuria, dyspareunia, and postvoid dribbling (termed the "3D" syndrome) has been described, these symptoms coexist in only approximately 20% of patients. More commonly, symptoms such as recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), localized pain, urinary urgency/frequency, anterior vaginal discomfort, or palpable masses dominate the clinical picture. Notably, postvoid dribbling — a form of situational urinary incontinence — remains the most prevalent symptom, reported in 60–70% of cases. This phenotypic variability, compounded by the frequent absence of pathognomonic signs, contributes to diagnostic delays and misclassification, particularly in women with persistent lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) lacking identifiable etiology. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for UD in such scenarios, as illustrated by one patient in our cohort who presented with refractory recurrent UTIs over an extended period. Definitive diagnosis was achieved only after transvaginal ultrasonography identified an anterior vaginal wall mass, underscoring the importance of incorporating UD into the differential diagnosis of treatment-resistant UTIs.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^112yrnDt]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU guideline — ileovesicostomy in neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) may be offered with counseling on risks and likely need for further intervention, with observational outcomes summarized as follows: Clinicians may offer ileovesicostomy to select patients with NLUTD and must counsel them on the risks, benefits, alternatives, and the high-risk of needing additional treatment or surgery (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). In the largest series, 50 patients (21 male; 29 female) underwent ileovesicostomy with mean follow-up 26.3 months (range 1–79 months); the most common etiologies were SCI (42%) and MS (38%), 88% were incontinent preoperatively and 37 were managed with an indwelling urethral and/or suprapubic catheter; pre-operative interventions included pubovaginal sling (65.5%), BNC (20%), suprapubic closure (20%), enterocystoplasty (12%), and urinary fistula repair (6%). Post-procedure, urethral continence was 72% (n = 36) at a mean follow-up of 26 months (range 1–79 months), with continence reported at six months in 42%, at one year in 44.8%, and in 22 of 32 patients with follow-up greater than one year. Reoperations were common, with seventy-seven reoperations in 27 patients; risk of reoperation was significantly related to total complications (p < 0.01) and stoma complications (p = 0.0417), and among patients with four or more complications, 100% required reoperation.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^11549KRB]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms note that acute-onset symptoms attributable to the urinary tract typically include dysuria in conjunction with variable degrees of increased urinary urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence. Dysuria (urethral burning during voiding) is central in the diagnosis of UTI, and acute-onset dysuria is a specific symptom, with more than 90% accuracy for UTI in young women in the absence of concomitant vaginal irritation or increased vaginal discharge. Dysuria can have other causes (e.g., atrophic vaginitis, pelvic floor myofascial pain, vulvar lichen sclerosus), and the specificity of this symptom outside of this narrow population has not been defined. In older adults, the symptoms of UTI may be less clear, and careful evaluation of their chronicity becomes an important consideration when the diagnosis of UTI is in doubt.

### Anterior urethral diverticulum in the female: diagnosis and surgical approach [^115RoZ8Z]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Despite an incidence of 3–40% in different populations, a diagnosis of urethral diverticulum in female patients is often delayed or missed.

Case

A 49-year-old multiparous woman presented complaining of severe, refractory urinary urgency and frequency and urge incontinence, in addition to dysuria and pelvic pain for several years. The diagnosis of an anterior urethral diverticulum was made based on findings at magnetic resonance imaging. Surgical management was accomplished vaginally without significant urethral disruption. At 5 months postoperatively, the patient was markedly improved.

Conclusion

Lower urinary tract pathology can create a diagnostic and surgical dilemma, which necessitates a thorough evaluation and careful management to achieve a satisfactory outcome.

### Common questions about chronic prostatitis [^111Zm9LC]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic prostatitis is relatively common, with a lifetime prevalence of 1.8% to 8.2%. Risk factors include conditions that facilitate introduction of bacteria into the urethra and prostate (which also predispose the patient to urinary tract infections) and conditions that can lead to chronic neuropathic pain. Chronic prostatitis must be differentiated from other causes of chronic pelvic pain, such as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and pelvic floor dysfunction; prostate and bladder cancers; benign prostatic hyperplasia; urolithiasis; and other causes of dysuria, urinary frequency, and nocturia. The National Institutes of Health divides prostatitis into four syndromes: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP), chronic nonbacterial prostatitis (CNP)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. CBP and CNP/CPPS both lead to pelvic pain and lower urinary tract symptoms. CBP presents as recurrent urinary tract infections with the same organism identified on repeated cultures; it responds to a prolonged course of an antibiotic that adequately penetrates the prostate, if the urine culture suggests sensitivity. If four to six weeks of antibiotic therapy is effective but symptoms recur, another course may be prescribed, perhaps in combination with alpha blockers or nonopioid analgesics. CNP/CPPS, accounting for more than 90% of chronic prostatitis cases, presents as prostatic pain lasting at least three months without consistent culture results. Weak evidence supports the use of alpha blockers, pain medications, and a four- to six-week course of antibiotics for the treatment of CNP/CPPS. Patients may also be referred to a psychologist experienced in managing chronic pain. Experts on this condition recommend a combination of treatments tailored to the patient's phenotypic presentation. Urology referral should be considered when appropriate treatment is ineffective. Additional treatments include pelvic floor physical therapy, phytotherapy, and pain management techniques. The UPOINT (urinary, psychosocial, organ-specific, infection, neurologic/systemic, tenderness) approach summarizes the various factors that may contribute to presentation and can guide treatment.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^112xwVrk]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — treatment framework and differential diagnosis: The evidence base used to support this guideline did not favor stepwise "first"→"second"→"third line therapy", and to eliminate the concept of "step therapy", options are grouped by invasiveness with an emphasis on shared decision-making to select therapies based on the patient's needs, desires, and side effect tolerance; there are eight treatment categories: incontinence management strategies, behavioral therapies, optimization of co-morbidities, non-invasive therapies, pharmacologic therapies, minimally invasive therapies, invasive therapies, and indwelling catheters, and patients may select from multiple categories simultaneously. Differential diagnosis and contributors include that interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome shares urinary frequency and urgency with or without UUI, but bladder and/or pelvic pain, including dyspareunia, is crucial; genitourinary syndrome of menopause can contribute to urgency and incontinence symptoms and there is some evidence for improvement with vaginal (but not systemic) estrogen; urinary tract infection can mimic OAB but is generally acute, shorter in duration, accompanied by cues such as dysuria or suprapubic discomfort, and resolves with antibiotics; and lower urinary tract symptoms related to neurological conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis are considered neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction and not idiopathic OAB. Patients with prostates experience OAB nearly as often as those without and may be underdiagnosed and undertreated; some have both benign prostatic hyperplasia and OAB, while others have OAB alone and would benefit from diagnosis specific treatment. Because the term "refractory OAB" lacks a clear definition and consensus, the guideline has refrained from using it.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections across age groups [^1135JKJ5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common outpatient infections, but predicting the probability of urinary tract infections through symptoms and test results can be complex. The most diagnostic symptoms of urinary tract infections include change in frequency, dysuria, urgency, and presence or absence of vaginal discharge, but urinary tract infections may present differently in older women. Dipstick urinalysis is popular for its availability and usefulness, but results must be interpreted in context of the patient's pretest probability based on symptoms and characteristics. In patients with a high probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms, negative dipstick urinalysis does not rule out urinary tract infection. Nitrites are likely more sensitive and specific than other dipstick components for urinary tract infection, particularly in the elderly. Positive dipstick testing is likely specific for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, but urine culture is still the test of choice. Microscopic urinalysis is likely comparable to dipstick urinalysis as a screening test. Bacteriuria is more specific and sensitive than pyuria for detecting urinary tract infection, even in older women and during pregnancy. Pyuria is commonly found in the absence of infection, particularly in older adults with lower urinary tract symptoms such as incontinence. Positive testing may increase the probability of urinary tract infection, but initiation of treatment should take into account risk of urinary tract infection based on symptoms as well. In cases in which the probability of urinary tract infection is moderate or unclear, urine culture should be performed. Urine culture is the gold standard for detection of urinary tract infection. However, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, particularly in older women, and should not be treated with antibiotics. Conversely, in symptomatic women, even growth as low as 10² colony-forming unit/mL could reflect infection. Resistance is increasing to fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Most uropathogens still display good sensitivity to nitrofurantoin. First-line treatments for urinary tract infection include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (when resistance levels are < 20%). These antibiotics have minimal collateral damage and resistance. In pregnancy, beta-lactams, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be appropriate treatments. Interpreting the probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms and testing allows for greater accuracy in diagnosis of urinary tract infection, decreasing overtreatment and encouraging antimicrobial stewardship.

### Ketamine bladder syndrome: an important differential diagnosis when assessing a patient with persistent lower urinary tract symptoms [^117MVze4]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

The recreational use of ketamine is increasing in popularity due to its dissociative and paralytic effects, ease of availability and low cost. However, serious and frequently irreversible damage to the urinary tract is a recently recognised side effect of recreational ketamine use. The authors present a case of a young male patient with a 2-year history of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms and a 5-year history of ketamine consumption. Medical management of such patients is largely limited to analgesia alone, and cessation of ketamine use before irreversible damage occurs remains the best means of avoiding the radical reconstructive surgery required in end-stage disease. This case and an accompanying review of the available literature illustrate the importance of early recognition of ketamine bladder syndrome in recreational users.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^1174T2WE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

THE CLINICAL LANDSCAPE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

An estimated 400 million urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur each year globally, with over 200,000 associated deaths, making UTIs one of the most common bacterial diseases and drivers of antimicrobial usage. UTIs disproportionately affect women, up to 60% of whom experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. This association is generally attributed to anatomy, although hormonal factors also play an increasingly recognized role, including in relation to the vaginal microbiome. Traditionally, a UTI is defined by clinical signs and symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pyuria, or urinary incontinence — often in combination with identification of an offending pathogen via urine culture. This symptom-based approach to UTIs can lack sensitivity or specificity in certain populations, including the very young and elderly, or individuals who are chronically catheterized, with urologic or neurologic abnormalities. For these patients, signs and symptoms can be ambiguous.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116MiZwv]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Currently, there is a lack of authoritative guidance to aid clinicians in making accurate diagnoses when UTI presents atypically. For example, there is no specific NICE guidance relating to the clinical features of UTI in older adults. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) recognises that typical symptoms used to diagnose UTI, such as dysuria and urinary frequency, may not apply to all frail, older women in whom atypical presentations are common. However, these atypical presentations are not fully explained within the guideline. In order to effectively diagnose and treat UTI in older adult outpatients, a clearer understanding of the clinical features that predict infections is required. The aim of this systematic review is therefore to determine the clinical features associated with UTI in older adult outpatients.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^115ncMVd]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis of male chronic pelvic pain conditions — initial evaluation includes "History, including complete review of systems", "Physical examination, including pelvic exam", "Questionnaires (pain, urinary, quality of life)", and "Urinalysis, mid-stream urine culture, PVR" with the directive to "Rule out confusable conditions (see Tables 4 & 5)"; PVR is post-void residual. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) features are "Perineal pain", "Bilateral scrotal pain", "Penile pain, dysuria", and "Ejaculatory pain" and "CP/CPPS Treatment: See Figure 4". Male interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) features are "Bladder pain, pressure, discomfort", "Painful bladder filling", "Painful urge to urinate", and "Daytime/nighttime frequency" and "Male IC/BPS Treatment: See AUA IC/BPS Guideline". Chronic scrotal content pain (CSCP) features are "Unilateral scrotal pain" and "Absence of other pelvic sites of pain or urinary symptoms" with "CSCP Treatment: See Figure 5". Pelvic floor myalgia is indicated by "Tender PFM on exam (see Figure 3)" and "PFM Treatment: PFPT, EMG", where PFM denotes pelvic floor muscles, PFPT pelvic floor physical therapy, and EMG electromyography. The figure cautions that "Some patients may have more than one feature. They are not mutually exclusive (e.g., pelvic floor myalgia is prevalent among men with CP/CPPS or IC/BPS [see dotted line], and may be treated accordingly)".

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^112J8bVt]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of male chronic pelvic pain — chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS): Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of CP/CPPS in patients who experience chronic perineal pain, bilateral scrotal content pain, penile pain, suprapubic pain, dysuria, or pain with ejaculation (Expert Opinion). Patients with CP/CPPS have symptoms of chronic pain or discomfort in the pelvic region in the absence of other causes of pain, and the pain can occur in the perineum, lower abdomen/suprapubic area, testes (typically bilateral), or penis; the pain may occur with ejaculation or during urination. It is important to note that men with CP/CPPS also commonly have LUTS such as urgency, frequency and nocturia, while the symptom that distinguishes IC/BPS is pain attributed to the bladder (e.g., painful bladder filling, relief with urination, or painful urge to urinate).

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^1136GLNi]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Upper versus lower tract UTI

UTI can be categorised anatomically into upper tract and lower tract infection. Upper tract UTI involves infection and inflammation in the kidneys (pyelonephritis) and ureters (figure 2). This typically leads to abdominal pain and loin tenderness, with systemic features such as fever, anorexia, vomiting, lethargy and malaise. Lower tract UTI involves infection within the bladder (cystitis) and urethra, with localised symptoms such as lower abdominal or suprapubic pain, dysuria, urinary frequency and urgency. Older children may present with signs and symptoms suggesting the site of infection. In younger patients, these classical signs are often absent, and differentiating between upper and lower UTI is less obvious.

### A 26-year-old woman with dysuria and hematuria [^113uL9Eq]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

In this case, we present imaging findings characteristic of chronic genitourinary schistosomiasis. Schistosoma haematobium, a blood fluke endemic to Africa and the Middle East, is a prominent cause of hematuria and bladder cancer in regions lacking adequate water sanitation. Luminal calcifications of the genitourinary tract, that is, of the bladder and/or ureters, from deposition of fluke eggs are a classic sign of chronic S. haematobium infection and should raise suspicion for the disease even when urine or serological tests are negative. It is important to recognize these findings on CT or, in resource-limited settings, plain film to allow for prompt, effective treatment.

### Dysuria: evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^115RQPT9]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The most common cause of acute dysuria is infection, especially cystitis. Other infectious causes include urethritis, sexually transmitted infections, and vaginitis. Noninfectious inflammatory causes include a foreign body in the urinary tract and dermatologic conditions. Noninflammatory causes of dysuria include medication use, urethral anatomic abnormalities, local trauma, and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. An initial targeted history includes features of a local cause (e.g., vaginal or urethral irritation), risk factors for a complicated urinary tract infection (e.g., male sex, pregnancy, presence of urologic obstruction, recent procedure), and symptoms of pyelonephritis. Women with dysuria who have no complicating features can be treated for cystitis without further diagnostic evaluation. Women with vulvovaginal symptoms should be evaluated for vaginitis. Any complicating features or recurrent symptoms warrant a history, physical examination, urinalysis, and urine culture. Findings from the secondary evaluation, selected laboratory tests, and directed imaging studies enable physicians to progress through a logical evaluation and determine the cause of dysuria or make an appropriate referral.

### Posterior urethral valves diagnosed by bedside ultrasound in the ED [^112kX9Rr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Posterior urethral valves are the most common cause of urinary obstruction in male children. Presentations of posterior urethral valves beyond the neonatal period include urinary tract infection, abdominal mass, renal failure, diminished urinary stream, crying during micturition, incontinence, dysuria, hematuria, or failure to thrive. Early diagnosis is imperative because early surgical relief of the obstruction is believed to help prevent the progression to endstage renal disease. This case serves to remind us that, in the male child who presents with urinary symptoms and/or abdominal symptoms, the bedside sonogram is a valuable tool that can clarify the diagnosis and expedite care.

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women? [^112E5WTn]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic of UTI

The diagnosis of UTI in the older patients is complicated by the frequent absence of specific clinical signs in these patients. There is currently no gold standard for diagnosis in this age group. We based the diagnosis of UTI on the clinician's assessment during the patient's admission, coupled with strict criteria. Patients were considered eligible for the UTI group if they were treated for UTI during their hospital stay based on their initial urine culture results. To confirm the diagnosis of UTI, patients had to have: a positive urine culture (as defined above) associated with a bloodstream infection with the same bacteria, or at least one major symptom of UTI (dysuria, pollakiuria), or imaging compatible with UTI, or at least two minor symptoms among: fever or chills, hypotension, confusion, urological obstruction, or flank pain without another diagnosis to explain these symptoms. Additionally, we collected other symptoms, such as onset of incontinence, acute urinary retention, or acute renal insufficiency. However, these symptoms were not included in our criteria, as they are not usually considered in the diagnosis of UTI. U-WBC, as a diagnostic criterion, was excluded to avoid biasing the leukocyte threshold selection. For patients with discordant classification between the patient's hospital admission report and our definition, patient's charts were reviewed by a geriatrician and an infectious disease physician independently (M.G. and K.B.). In the case of a discordant classification between the two investigators or a lack of data to exclude or confirm urinary tract infection, the patient was excluded.

He had a history of brain tuberculosis 2 years back and was hospitalized for 4 months with a urethral catheter. Examination revealed a 3 cm cystic swelling in the penoscrotal junction. On pressing the sac, a gush of urine came out through the urethral meatus. A micturating cystourethrogram revealed a huge anterior urethral diverticulum. Cystoscopic assessment also confirmed the diagnosis and demonstrated transillumination. He subsequently underwent surgical excision of the diverticulum and is doing well on follow-up.

Typical course and comorbidities — IC/BPS "is most commonly diagnosed in individuals over 40", and in European studies "the mean age is older than is typical for the US". On presentation, "A history of a recent culture-proven urinary tract infection (UTI) can be identified on presentation in 18–36% of women, although subsequent cultures are negative". Early in the disease, "Initially it is not uncommon for patients to report a single symptom such as dysuria, frequency, or pain, with subsequent progression to multiple symptoms", and "Symptom flares, during which symptoms suddenly intensify for several hours, days, or weeks, are not uncommon". Additionally, "There is a high rate of prior pelvic surgery (especially hysterectomy) and levator ani pain in women with IC/BPS, suggesting that trauma or other local".

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^1173rGhh]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — asymptomatic bacteriuria: clinicians should not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with NLUTD. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) The guideline notes that antibiotic resistance is a significant problem in NLUTD and that unnecessary antibiotic use should be avoided; treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in catheter-free spinal cord injury (SCI) patients leads to early recurrence with more resistant strains and has no effect on subsequent asymptomatic bacteriuria or UTI in SCI patients performing intermittent catheterization. The exception is pregnancy and prior to urologic procedures in which urothelial disruption or upper tract manipulation is anticipated; for contaminated or clean-contaminated procedures, perioperative antimicrobial treatment or prophylaxis is stated as best practice, with related guidance suggesting obtaining a urine culture and giving a targeted, short course regimen rather than empiric therapy before endoscopic urologic procedures, and recommending a single oral dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for patients with NLUTD.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in infancy — An important cause of bacteriuria without pyuria is asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can occur in infants. In a study of infants 2 to 24 months of age, 0.7% of afebrile girls had 3 successive urine cultures with 10⁵ CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen; this condition can be confused with true UTI but should be distinguished because studies suggest antimicrobial treatment may do more harm than good, and the key discriminator is the presence of pyuria.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1172Rvx7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) diagnostic definitions and specimen requirements — In patients without indwelling catheters, ASB is defined as ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in a voided urine specimen without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). For women, 2 consecutive specimens obtained preferably within 2 weeks are used to confirm persistence, and between 10% and 60% of women do not have persistent bacteriuria on repeat screening after an initial positive specimen. For men, a single urine specimen meeting these quantitative criteria is sufficient for diagnosis. In patients with indwelling devices, ≥ 10³ CFU/mL remains the most appropriate diagnostic criteria for bladder bacteriuria, while lower quantitative counts (≥ 10² to < 10⁵ CFU/mL) from "in and out" catheterization or after insertion of a new indwelling catheter suggest true bacteriuria, although the clinical significance of these lower counts in asymptomatic people has not been evaluated.

### A rare presentation of urogenital tuberculosis leading to obstructive uropathy and renal failure: a case report [^111auy4q]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, is preventable and curable disease. However, it is also second most leading cause of death by a single infectious agent after Coronavirus disease. Amongst the total population, a quarter is estimated to be infected. TB typically infects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can also infect other sites, extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB).

Urogenital tuberculosis (UGTB) is a rare form of EPTB, accounting for 15–20% of cases, primarily affecting the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. It typically affects the kidneys first, followed by downward spread to the ureters, bladder, prostate, epididymis, or genital tract. Infections may remain clinically silent for years due to the slow progression of renal and urological damage, often leading to diagnostic delays (5,6). Nevertheless, diagnosis is often challenging due to its nonspecific symptoms — such as dysuria and hematuria — that mimic more common urological conditions like urinary tract infections.

TB involving the urologic system has two forms, the most common presentation involves the urinary collecting system (renal pelvis, calyces, ureters and bladder) and the less common one involves kidney lesions (ulcers, abscess formation, perinephric spread, caseating necrosis and calcification). The onset of UGTB is insidious, the average time period from pulmonary infection and clinical manifestations of UGTB is 22 years with a male to female ratio 2:1.

Patients without traditional risk factors of TB, physicians often face the challenge of delayed recognition, as they have to go through advanced diagnostic techniques including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and imaging to confirm the diagnosis.

Early diagnosis and initiation of anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT) with full compliance are critical as it ensures favorable outcomes. This case underscores the importance of considering UGTB in the differential diagnosis for patients with atypical presentation and unexplained urological symptoms.

Best of five questions

Question 1

A 23-year-old man presented with an 8-week history of bloody diarrhoea, severe anorectal pain and low-grade pyrexia. On further questioning he also complained of malaise, myalgia and arthralgia. He admitted to unprotected receptive anal sexual intercourse with two male partners in the preceding 6 months. Perianal and rectal examination revealed two fluctuant, tender areas of induration adjacent to the anal verge suggestive of abscesses. An urgent flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed inflamed, friable rectal mucosa with several large ulcers and spontaneous bleeding. Rectal swabs sent for NAAT and genotyping revealed the presence of C trachomatis genotype L1.

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment regimen:
A — Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 7 days
B — Erythromycin 250 mg four times a day for 21 days
C — Olfloxacin 400 mg a day for 7 days
D — Erythromycin 500 mg twice a day for 7 days
E — Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 21 days

Question 2

A 32-year-old man presents with a 6-week history of diarrhoea, anorectal pain and maculopapular rash affecting the trunk, hands and feet. Two years previously he had been investigated for possible Crohn's disease after presenting with several perianal and anal verge ulcers. These had resolved spontaneously and no formal diagnosis had been made. On further questioning he admitted to a 4-week history of perianal swelling and several oral ulcers with a snail track distribution on inspection. Perianal inspection is demonstrated in figure 3.

### Urachal xanthogranuloma: a rare but important case presenting as a urachal mass [^113WVLXZ]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 55-year-old Argentinian male was referred to a Canadian urologist's practice in February 2021 with a three-month history of left lower abdominal pain, urinary frequency, nocturia, and urgency. The patient denied bothersome obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms, gross hematuria, dysuria, urinary incontinence, and B-symptoms including weight loss and change in appetite. His past medical history was significant for obesity and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2017. He had no known drug allergies or medications. Physical examination demonstrated a patient with truncal obesity, weight of 125 kg, height of 178 cm, no abdominal masses, unremarkable umbilicus, unremarkable male genitalia, and a benign prostate. Screening hematologic, extended electrolytes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glomerular filtration rate, and prostate-specific antigen levels were unremarkable. Urinalysis, urine culture, and urine cytology were negative. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated an unremarkable post-void residual and prostate size but an abnormal 4.2 × 6.1 × 5.3 cm mass near the superior aspect of the bladder, prompting further investigation. Cystoscopy was unremarkable and did not reveal a bulge at the dome. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis revealed a 10.3 cm solid and cystic mass abutting the superior bladder and extending up to the level of the umbilicus. There was associated mild soft tissue thickening, stranding, and nodularity on the anterior aspect of retro-umbilical omentum (Fig. 1 a, b, c, d). The radiologist's impression was a potential underlying malignancy, likely a urachal carcinoma, with suspected focal omental carcinomatosis.

### Exploring dysfunctional voiding in girls: a comprehensive literature review of assessment and management strategies [^113W5Tsp]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

History

A comprehensive history is essential in the diagnostic assessment of DV. The history should be adapted to the patient's age and the stage of bladder control development. The history should include the following aspects:
(I) The voiding schedule should include information on the voiding frequency and the frequency of incontinence episodes [in toilet-trained children]. If possible, the voided volume should be estimated because patients with large-capacity bladders may present with large volumes of voided urine, indicating an underactive bladder or polyuria. Voided volume estimation can help determine if the bladder is functioning properly or if there are issues with underactivity or polyuria, both of which are commonly associated with DV.
(II) Bladder dysfunction symptoms such as urgency, hesitancy, painful urination, dribbling, holding maneuvers, straining, daytime incontinence, enuresis, and an intermittent or weak urinary stream should be noted. Table 1 defines these symptoms. Understanding these symptoms is critical, as they provide clues to the underlying cause of DV, helping clinicians narrow down the diagnosis.
(III) A completed standard questionnaire assessing daytime incontinence, voiding habits, urgency, bowel habits, dysuria, quality of life, and urine stream deflection. For example, anterior deflected urinary stream [ADUS], known as wetting the toilet rim during voiding while sitting in an upright position and the upper legs are apart. Another example is vaginal voiding caused by urine remaining in the vestibule after voiding, resulting in immediate post-urination incontinence. ADUS can be a key symptom in diagnosing structural abnormalities, which may contribute to DV and post-urination incontinence.
(IV) Family history should be screened for any renal or urological disorders, including DV, and the age at which family members achieved bladder control. This can help assess familial maturation delays, which can provide important genetic or developmental clues to the presence of dysfunctional voiding or other urological disorders within the family.
(V) Perinatal and neonatal history should be reviewed to investigate any perinatal or neonatal insults, such as perinatal anoxia or congenital infections. These insults could potentially affect the central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as normal bladder function. Early developmental insults have the potential to impact bladder innervation or neural control, which can predispose individuals to lifelong voiding difficulties.
(VI) Dietary intake including details on the type and amount of fluid consumed, should be noted. Excessive urine production, especially during the night, may be a sign of diabetes mellitus, polyuria due to impaired urine concentration, or primary polydipsia.
(VII) Hydration and urine production patterns are important as they can indicate underlying conditions like diabetes mellitus or renal issues like nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which can lead to polyuria.
(VIII) Neurodevelopmental delays and psychological disorders, such as ADHD, depression, or anxiety, may contribute to delayed voluntary bladder control. Although children with DV may not universally present with behavioral issues, the association with psychological disorders should be explored. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders often have delayed or impaired bladder control due to difficulties in establishing voluntary bladder coordination.
(IX) Functional causes of DV may stem from behavioral issues following toilet training or personal stress, particularly conflicts between caregivers and children, which can often be linked to stressors or negative experiences during toilet training. This connection can lead to developmental variances even when anatomical abnormalities are absent.
(X) Toilet training history is important to consider, particularly if it was delayed, prolonged, or stressful or if there was a period of dryness following toilet training. If a period of complete dryness was never achieved after toilet training, structural abnormalities that can cause urine incontinence, such as the ectopic ureter, hypospadias with or without a meatal web, and meatal web alone, should be taken into account. Identifying whether dryness was ever achieved after toilet training is critical in distinguishing between structural and functional causes of incontinence.

### Interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome: appropriate diagnosis and management [^113Xap69]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is characterized by urinary frequency, urgency, and pelvic pain in the absence of any other identifiable pathology. Initial identification of IC/PBS is challenging, as patients may have a range of symptoms that overlap with other disorders, including urinary tract infection (UTI). These patients may be treated empirically with antibiotics; however, many patients with such symptoms are actually culture negative and are later diagnosed with IC/PBS. This review describes the importance of recognizing the symptom overlap between IC/PBS and UTI and focuses on approaches to the diagnosis and management of IC/PBS. Physicians can improve patient care by considering IC/PBS early in the differential diagnosis.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^11285M1j]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment, not diagnosis — describe a clinical syndrome characterized by local bladder signs and symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain, and are defined by absence of findings suggesting infection beyond the bladder: no fever unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or unstable vital signs) unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no flank pain, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Uncomplicated UTI can occur in females or males, patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, patients with immunocompromise, and persons with diabetes; recurrent UTI can be uncomplicated. Patients with urinary catheters (including transurethral, suprapubic, and intermittent catheterization), stents, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes generally do not have uncomplicated UTI, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

### A 16-year-old boy with acute urinary retention [^115RRHHC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Urinary retention can be described as the inability to void volitionally despite an adequate volume of urine in the bladder. It is a common complaint in adults, especially among elderly males with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Children, in contrast, are more likely to have voluntary retention of urine due to urethral irritation or dysuria. Gently massaging the suprapubic region while the child is in a warm bath often relieves the retention in these cases. Other patients described as lazy voiders can present with acute urinary retention. These patients are typically young girls who are embarrassed to void at school. Retraining or timed voiding is often successful managing lazy voiders. However, these benign disorders should only be diagnosed after anatomical or organic causes for their symptoms have been considered and ruled out.

Periodic evaluation lists HISTORY of hematuria, urinary urgency/frequency, urinary incontinence/retention, dysuria, nocturia, and abnormal urinary stream, with Yearly noted. Counseling advises to "Promptly seek medical attention for dysuria or gross hematuria". Potential considerations for further testing and intervention include urinalysis, urine culture, and spot urine calcium/creatinine ratio for patients with positive history, and ultrasound of kidneys and bladder for patients with microscopic hematuria (defined as > 5 RBC/HPF on at least 2 occasions). Referral guidance states nephrology or urology referral for patients with culture-negative microscopic hematuria AND abnormal ultrasound, and urology referral for patients with culture-negative macroscopic hematuria. Additional information states the bladder is included in the left and right flank/hemibabdomen treatment fields only if the fields extended below iliac crest, and to consider patient and cancer/treatment factors and health behaviors that may increase risk, including combination with cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide and alcohol use or smoking.

A 17-year-old boy with no medical comorbidities, but a significant family history of malignancy, presented to Accident and Emergency following 3days of increasing rectal pain, symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction (poor flow, intermittent stream and hesitancy) and dysuria. Notably he had no abdominal pain. Digital rectal examination revealed a tender, enlarged prostate. Inflammatory markers were significantly raised (white cell count 17.7, C reactive protein 191). He was diagnosed clinically as prostatitis and commenced on intravenous antibiotics. Despite this his pain and inflammatory markers deteriorated, necessitating a CT of his abdomen and pelvis. This demonstrated multiloculated large thick-walled abscesses in the pelvis closely related to the rectum, prostate and seminal vesicles with some bowel wall thickening. Laparoscopy demonstrated a large colonic mass adherent to surrounding structures. The procedure was converted to laparotomy to enable resection of the mass via a limited right haemicolectomy. He recovered well and was discharged. Histopathological analysis of the specimen revealed appendicitis.

### Clinical manifestations and functional outcomes in children with eosinophilic cystitis [^117HbUWH]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare disorder, with fewer than 30 pediatric cases reported in the literature. We describe our experience with pediatric eosinophilic cystitis during a 20-year period.

Materials and Methods

Four children referred to our institution were subsequently diagnosed with eosinophilic cystitis between 1984 and 2004. A retrospective chart review was performed to assess clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes.

Results

Mean patient age at presentation was 10.8 years (range 5 to 18) and male-to-female ratio was 3:1. All 4 patients presented with irritative urinary symptoms, including 3 with dysuria and/or gross hematuria and 2 with urinary frequency, lower abdominal pain and/or a concomitant urinary tract infection. Allergic diseases (asthma, allergic rhinitis, etc) were present in 3 patients, and a formal allergen skin test was positive in 2 of those tested. A bladder mass mimicking malignancy was documented in 2 patients. Three patients had symptom resolution with conservative treatment, while 1 had development of an unremitting tumefactive process that eventually required partial cystectomy and bladder augmentation.

Conclusions

Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition with a wide range of clinical manifestations. Children can present with a bladder mass mimicking sarcoma, underscoring the need for biopsy before diagnosis and treatment of a presumed oncological process. The condition usually follows a benign course, although unremitting progression remains a possibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract with no sign of systemic illness or pyelonephritis in a noncatheterized, nonpregnant adult with no urologic abnormalities or immunocompromise. In women, a self-diagnosis of a UTI with the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., frequency, urgency, dysuria/burning sensation, nocturia, suprapubic pain), without vaginal discharge, is accurate enough to diagnose an uncomplicated UTI without further testing. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be reserved for women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, history of resistant isolates, or atypical presentation to make a definitive diagnosis and guide antibiotic selection. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin for five days, fosfomycin in a single dose, trimethoprim for three days, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and delayed antibiotics may be considered because the risk of complications is low. Increased fluids, intake of cranberry products, and methenamine hippurate can prevent recurrent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also effective in preventing recurrence but has a risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Men with lower UTI symptoms should always receive antibiotics, with urine culture and susceptibility results guiding the antibiotic choice. Clinicians should also consider the possibility of urethritis and prostatitis in men with UTI symptoms. First-line antibiotics for men with uncomplicated UTI include trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin for seven days. Uncomplicated UTIs in nonfrail women and men 65 years and older with no relevant comorbidities also necessitate a urine culture with susceptibility testing to adjust the antibiotic choice after initial empiric treatment; first-line antibiotics and treatment durations do not differ from those recommended for younger adults.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113LV38Z]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

Evidence from included studies suggests that a number of symptoms and signs traditionally thought to be associated with UTI, may be of limited diagnostic value in older adults. This review highlights the complexity of diagnosing UTI in older adults, and the breadth of their clinical presentations. The results of this review are based on evidence from studies of variable quality and therefore should be treated with caution. Further high quality studies, with large numbers of participants, need to be performed to corroborate these findings. This would assist clinicians with prompt and accurate diagnosis of true UTI, encouraging appropriate treatment with antimicrobials. Clarity in this area may also help clinicians to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, reducing inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions for the latter condition, thereby improving antimicrobial stewardship. It is unclear how application of information from this review might translate into improved diagnostic rates of UTI in older adults or improve appropriate antimicrobial prescribing.

AUA/SUFU adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — recurrent UTI on clean intermittent catheterization: In NLUTD patients who perform clean intermittent catheterization with recurrent urinary tract infection, clinicians may offer oral antimicrobial prophylaxis to reduce the rate of urinary tract infections following shared decision-making and discussion regarding increased risk of antibiotic resistance (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). This statement was informed by one systematic review, two randomized controlled trials, and three observational studies reporting on rate of UTI, with serious risk of bias and evidence downgraded for inconsistency; the literature shows lack of uniformity in defining recurrent UTI, with variation in urinary symptoms, urine culture colony forming unit/mL threshold, differentiation of bacterial persistence versus reinfection and bacterial species, and number of UTIs per year.

Introduction

Urinalysis by dipstick and/or midstream urine culture (MSU) is the first investigation of the patient presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Negative results are usually assumed to exclude infection and diagnoses such as overactive bladder (OAB) depend on negative tests. The MSU is still considered the gold standard diagnostic test for UTI. It relies on isolating 10⁵ cfu mL⁻¹ of a known urinary pathogen, using aerobic culture with a Enterobacteriaceae -selective media. This was first described by Kass after studying patients with chills, fever, flank pain and dysuria. Kass never claimed to define a threshold for use with "cystitis", i.e. frequency/dysuria. However, 10⁵ cfu mL⁻¹ has been widely adopted. The dipstick has been validated against a standard of 10⁵ cfu mL⁻¹ of a known urinary pathogen.

In fact, these urinalysis methods are not sensitive and are incapable of excluding UTI. Effort is being made to find improved urinalysis techniques to detect UTI, but currently the best performing method is microscopy of a fresh unspun, unstained, clean-catch specimen of urine in a counting chamber to enumerate the white cells.

Our past reliance on dipstick analysis and culture to diagnose UTI has now been rejected in the literature, we should therefore re-examine our understanding of the symptoms and signs involved in LUTS.

The analysis of symptoms presents different challenges to the measurement of change over time, when assessing treatment outcomes. Well-known validated scores of LUTS such as the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ), the Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire (ICI-QOL) and Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (F-LUTS) are used to assess the impact of incontinence. They have performed well in measuring the effects of treatments in clinical trials. Their utility in single, cross-sectional analyses is less assured because they use adjectival scaling such as "bothersomeness". People differ greatly in their semantic interpretation of adjectives. In longitudinal studies, the potential error from this variance can be avoided by the normalisation of within subject changes. This option is available to neither cross-sectional studies, nor to data collected at the time of diagnostic assessment. Additionally, scores such as the ICIQ were validated in patients after UTI had been excluded on the evidence of urine culture. Our interest lies in the symptoms associated with reliable indicators of UTI.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^116rprT9]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU — risk-change evaluation in neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) states that in patients with low-risk NLUTD who present with new onset signs and symptoms, new complications (e.g., autonomic dysreflexia, urinary tract infections, stones), and/or upper tract or renal function deterioration, the clinician should re-evaluate and repeat risk stratification (Clinical Principle). In patients with moderate- or high-risk NLUTD who experience a change in signs and symptoms, new complications (e.g., autonomic dysreflexia, urinary tract infections, stones), or upper tract or renal function deterioration, the clinician may perform multichannel urodynamics (Clinical Principle).
