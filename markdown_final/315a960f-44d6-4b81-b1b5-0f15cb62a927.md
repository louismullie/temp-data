## Question

Do patients on dialysis have higher risk of hepatitis B

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether patients on dialysis have a higher risk of hepatitis B infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline epidemiology and whether prevalence and incidence differ from the general population. Then, I should verify biological susceptibility, including uremia-related immunosuppression and vaccine hyporesponsiveness. Next, I will examine environmental and nosocomial risk factors within dialysis units. After that, I need to consider clinical outcomes, including progression to chronicity and complications. Finally, I will review prevention and control strategies that indirectly corroborate risk and synthesize the overall conclusion with guideline alignment and supporting studies.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic signal. U.S. CDC surveillance of adult hemodialysis patients during 1997–2001 found an adjusted HBV prevalence of 2.4% (95% CI 2.1–2.7), which is substantially higher than contemporary U.S. adult HBsAg prevalence of about 0.3–0.4%, supporting a higher background risk in this population [^1157Gt5n]. Wait, let me verify international variation before drawing conclusions: DOPPS across seven countries reported a mean facility HBV prevalence of 3.0% with a median of 1.9%, reinforcing a consistent elevation relative to low-endemic general populations and substantial facility-level variability [^1173XUXz]. I should also note that while modern U.S. dialysis prevalence can be lower in well-controlled programs, outbreaks still occur, indicating persistent vulnerability in some settings [^113LTmqQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — what about acquisition risk rather than just prevalence. I need to check incident infection and nosocomial contributions. Outbreak reports and epidemiologic studies show dialysis units account for a disproportionate share of healthcare-associated HBV clusters, and a case-control study in older adults associated hemodialysis exposure with markedly higher odds of acute HBV infection (matched OR ~13, multivariable aOR ~11.5), underscoring both patient-to-patient and procedural transmission risks in this setting [^116fyUWb] [^1115gs6F]. But wait, what if practices have improved over time? Even with better infection control, sporadic seroconversions persist, indicating ongoing risk when lapses occur or immunity wanes [^1173XUXz] [^113LTmqQ].

> Next, I should review biological susceptibility. Uremia impairs both innate and adaptive immunity, reducing vaccine responsiveness and likely increasing susceptibility to infection once exposed. I need to ensure I cite vaccine response data correctly: in CKD and dialysis cohorts, seroconversion rates to standard HBV vaccine are substantially lower than in immunocompetent hosts, often around 50–60% and sometimes less, and higher GFR at vaccination predicts better seroconversion, supporting early immunization before dialysis to mitigate immunologic deficits [^116tfADc] [^111iS8mq]. Hmm, wait a minute — does HCV coinfection worsen vaccine response enough to increase infection risk directly? A meta-analysis suggests no clear association between HCV and impaired seroconversion, so while HCV is common in dialysis, it doesn't fully explain vaccine hyporesponsiveness; the dominant driver remains uremic immune dysfunction and dialysis-related factors [^113wdRdi].

> I will now examine nosocomial and environmental risks. Let me think about transmission mechanics: HBV is highly infectious with stable environmental survival on surfaces, and lapses such as multi-vial medication use, shared supplies, inadequate disinfection, and failure to segregate HBsAg-positive patients have been repeatedly linked to outbreaks, whereas programs with strict segregation and vaccination show markedly lower seroconversion rates [^115gr9dD] [^113Y38tT]. Hold on, I should verify that contemporary guidance still emphasizes segregation; UK and other hemodialysis guidelines continue to mandate dedicated machines, segregated areas, and staff cohorting for HBV-positive patients because horizontal and vertical transmission have been documented when these are absent [^113Y38tT] [^112vVM3r]. I need to ensure I also mention occult HBV: even HBsAg-negative patients with anti-HBc and low-level HBV DNA can represent reservoirs in some cohorts, though with robust vaccination and infection control, transmission risk appears low, reinforcing the importance of comprehensive programs rather than relying on a single intervention [^113kTSuh] [^111gXdYs].

> Next, I should review clinical outcomes once infection occurs. Let me verify progression risk: CDC notes that dialysis patients who acquire HBV have a higher likelihood of developing chronic infection than immunocompetent hosts, aligning with the broader principle that immunosuppression increases chronicity risk after acute HBV [^1157Gt5n]. I should confirm long-term consequences: chronic HBV in CKD is associated with increased morbidity, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and HBV infection contributes to mortality and complications in this population, with additional concerns around reactivation in the setting of immunosuppression such as transplantation [^1146Qfjc] [^113NaWkS]. Hold on, I should verify whether case reports of breakthrough infection despite prior immunity change practice; rare cases of new HBV infection in patients with waning anti-HBs titers emphasize the need for ongoing serologic surveillance and boosters in dialysis units, which operationalizes the recognition of elevated and persistent risk [^115gvJm9] [^116tfADc].

> I need to ensure I integrate prevention strategies that implicitly acknowledge high risk. Guidelines consistently recommend universal HBV vaccination for all dialysis patients, ideally before dialysis initiation, with higher or augmented dosing, consideration of intradermal routes for nonresponders, and structured serologic follow-up with boosters to maintain protective titers, reflecting both elevated exposure risk and impaired immunogenicity [^112PAEvR] [^1117Nsjs] [^116sqVeZ]. Let me double-check surveillance cadence: many programs test HBsAg every 3–6 months and anti-HBs annually, with earlier boosters if titers fall, a schedule far more intensive than for the general population, again signaling recognized vulnerability and rapid waning of immunity in dialysis [^114t2NUW] [^116tfADc]. I should confirm that screening for HBV is also recommended in all patients starting dialysis and in those with elevated or unexplained aminotransferases, reinforcing baseline risk assessment and early detection in this high-risk group [^114t2NUW] [^114UEU8C].

> Synthesis and conclusion: Yes, patients on dialysis have a higher risk of hepatitis B infection than the general population, driven by a combination of higher environmental exposure in dialysis settings, unique nosocomial transmission risks, and uremia-related immune dysfunction that increases susceptibility and reduces vaccine responsiveness. This is reflected in higher prevalence, documented outbreaks, stronger epidemiologic associations with acute HBV, and more intensive prevention policies than for average-risk adults [^1157Gt5n] [^116fyUWb] [^1115gs6F] [^113LTmqQ] [^112PAEvR]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with major guidelines: CDC, ACP, and nephrology society guidance all classify dialysis patients as high risk for HBV and endorse universal screening and vaccination, which operationalizes the recognition of this elevated risk profile and the need for proactive prevention and surveillance [^114UEU8C] [^116MYk4A] [^112PAEvR].

---

Patients on dialysis have a **higher risk of hepatitis B** [^113LTmqQ] than the general population due to frequent blood exposure, shared equipment, and impaired immunity [^1146TrFC]. The risk is highest in hemodialysis and varies by region and infection control practices [^1173XUXz]. Prevention relies on **strict infection control** [^112PAEvR], **universal screening** [^114t2NUW], and **vaccination with serologic follow-up** [^112PAEvR] [^116sqVeZ]; because vaccine response is blunted in dialysis, higher or intradermal doses and boosters are often needed [^116tfADc] [^116u5iLz] [^1117Nsjs].

---

## Epidemiological evidence of increased risk

Multiple studies and guidelines confirm a **higher HBV risk** in dialysis patients than in the general population:

- **Prevalence**: HBV prevalence is higher in dialysis patients than in the general population, especially in hemodialysis [^113LTmqQ].
- **Seroconversion**: HBV seroconversion rates are higher in dialysis patients, reflecting increased susceptibility and exposure [^notfound].
- **Occult infection**: Occult HBV (HBV DNA without HBsAg) is more common in dialysis patients, posing transmission and reactivation risks [^113kTSuh] [^11161fPM].

---

## Risk factors contributing to increased susceptibility

Several factors **contribute to the higher HBV risk** in dialysis patients:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Frequent blood exposure | Repeated access and blood handling increase exposure risk [^1146TrFC] [^113NaWkS] |
| Shared equipment | Improper disinfection or shared supplies can transmit HBV [^1146TrFC] [^116fyUWb] |
| Immune impairment | Uremia and dialysis blunt humoral and cellular immunity, reducing vaccine response [^116sqVeZ] [^111Xoaa3] |
| Geographic variation | Higher risk in regions with high HBV prevalence and suboptimal infection control [^111RGDow] [^1173XUXz] |
| Duration of dialysis | Longer dialysis duration increases cumulative exposure risk [^1132NqDL] [^111M9JcS] |

---

## Comparison with the general population

Dialysis patients have a **markedly higher HBV risk** than the general population:

- **Prevalence**: HBV prevalence in dialysis patients is 3–10% vs ~0.3% in the general U.S. population.
- **Seroconversion**: Seroconversion rates are significantly higher in dialysis patients, indicating greater susceptibility and exposure [^notfound].
- **Chronic infection**: The risk of chronic HBV is higher in dialysis patients due to immune impairment [^1157Gt5n].

---

## Preventive measures and guidelines

To mitigate HBV risk in dialysis patients, **evidence-based measures** include:

- **Universal screening**: Screen all dialysis patients for HBV markers (HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs) at initiation and regularly thereafter [^114t2NUW] [^112B5q2A].
- **Vaccination**: Vaccinate all susceptible patients; use higher or intradermal doses and boosters due to blunted responses [^112PAEvR] [^1117Nsjs] [^116u5iLz].
- **Infection control**: Strict adherence to disinfection, hand hygiene, and segregation of HBV-positive patients [^112PAEvR] [^113Y38tT].
- **Staff vaccination**: Ensure all dialysis staff are vaccinated and immune to HBV [^112kH4b8].

## Clinical implications of hepatitis B infection in dialysis patients

HBV infection in dialysis patients has **significant clinical consequences**:

- **Liver disease**: Increased risk of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [^113NaWkS].
- **Mortality**: Higher all-cause and liver-related mortality [^1146TrFC].
- **Transmission**: Ongoing risk of nosocomial transmission within dialysis units [^113Y38tT].

---

Patients on dialysis have a **higher risk of hepatitis B** due to frequent blood exposure, shared equipment, and immune impairment. Prevention requires universal screening, vaccination with serologic follow-up, and strict infection control; because vaccine responses are blunted, higher or intradermal doses and boosters are often necessary [^113LTmqQ] [^112PAEvR] [^116sqVeZ].

### Global prevalence of occult hepatitis B: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11161fPM]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

The study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI) in the global population. We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane and Web of Science from database inception through 27 Dec, 2018. Studies reporting HBV-DNA serological data in previously undiagnosed hepatitis B patients were included. The data were further categorized according to the presence of risk factors. After an initial screening of 2,325 records, we finally included 98 articles about the prevalence of OBI from 34 countries and regions. The OBI prevalence was 0.82% (95% CI:0.69–0.96) in the general population, 16.26% (95% CI:10.97–22.34) in HIV patients, 13.99% (95% CI:8.33–20.79) in patients with other liver diseases, 4.25% (95% CI:1.64–7.87) in haemodialysis patients and 5.14% (95% CI:2.26–9.01) patients with other risk factors. In conclusion, OBI prevalence varies significantly across different populations and nations, which deserve attention from the public health authorities. Our results generate further epidemiological data to identify the population with OBI, which has important clinical implications in finding these high-risk populations to design preventive and management strategies.

Guideline 5.3 – BBV infection: identification of patients for whom immunisation against HBV is not indicated

Hepatitis B vaccine is not indicated in patients who have current (Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or HBV DNA positive) or confirmed past HBV infection. Presence of the anti HBc antibody in isolation should not be taken as confirmation of previous HBV infection. Patients identified to be core antibody positive who are at risk of reactivation of HBV (particularly immunosuppression) may need to be vaccinated and the case should be discussed with a local virologist. (2B).

Rationale

Although there is no documented harm associated with the administration of the HBV vaccine to patients with natural immunity, it is recommended that anti-HBc and anti-HBs antibodies should be checked prior to immunisation. Patients who have a positive anti HBs antibody and who have a detectable anti HBc usually have natural immunity to HBV and therefore may not need vaccination. However, detection of Hepatitis B core antibody should not be used in isolation to determine immunity or previous infection and these patients may still require vaccination.

The need for pre-immunisation screening for anti HBc to avoid unnecessary immunisation should be guided by the likelihood that an individual has been exposed to HBV or previous vaccine as a study in the USA suggests that pre-immunisation screening is cost-effective only in populations in which the prevalence of HBV infection exceeds 30%.

Hepatitis B core antibody detected reports can arise from many scenarios. (Table 5 - interpretation of HBV results prior to vaccination).
Recent receipt of blood products (core antibody is passively acquired and is a frequent finding in patients who have received blood, plasma, IVIg or similar in the last few weeks, testing a serum sample predating the blood products is required to determine patient status), (HBV vaccination will be required)
Occult infection: HBV DNA will be detected and Anti HBs antibody levels are usually low (HBV vaccination not required)
False positive: discussion with local virology team to determine if referral to reference lab can be helpful (HBV vaccination required)

Table 5
Interpretation of HBV results prior to vaccination (1B)

Although patients are routinely considered as having HBV transmission in the past and not infectious to others, there is an increasing evidence that these persons may replicate or may start to replicate under special circumstances (immunosuppression, cachexia). Any patient with confirmed past HBV infection who is going to be significantly immunosuppressed is at risk of reactivation and a pre-emptive management plan should be made with a Hepatitis B specialist.

### Primary seroresponses to double-dose compared with standard-dose hepatitis B vaccination in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1168xjs5]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines recommend double-dose hepatitis B vaccination for patients requiring dialysis, due to an increased risk of hepatitis B infection and reduced vaccine responsiveness. There are no recommendations for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) prior to dialysis.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing efficacy (seroresponses) and harms of double-dose compared with standard-dose hepatitis B vaccination in patients with CKD, including those requiring dialysis. A systematic literature search (CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE) was performed using a predetermined search strategy. Relative risks were calculated from pooled data using a random-effects model with subgroup analysis by dialysis requirement and vaccine type.

Results

Seven studies (501 patients) fulfilled review criteria: four in patients receiving dialysis and three in patients not receiving dialysis. The incidence of seroconversion was not increased with double-dose vaccination overall [risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98–1.39], by dialysis requirement or vaccine type. The incidence of seroprotection (reported by only four studies) was increased with double-dose vaccination overall (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.17–2.00) but not by dialysis requirement. Adverse events were not reported by treatment arm, precluding comparison. The overall quality of included studies was moderate to low.

Conclusions

The current data do not support clinical guideline recommendations for administering double-dose vaccination for patients with CKD as seroconversion was not improved and seroprotection was inadequately assessed. Large high-quality studies are required to overcome the current evidence gap regarding vaccine dosing in CKD.

### Recommendations for preventing transmission of… [^113Y38tT]. CDC (2001). Low credibility.

HBV-susceptible patients resulted in 70% — 80% reductions in incidence of HBV infection among hemodialysis patients 7, 36–38). National surveillance data for 1976–1989 indicated that incidence of HBV infection was substantially lower in hemodialysis units that isolated HBsAg-positive patients, compared with those that did not. vials, among patients. In addition, few patients had received hepatitis B vaccine. National surveillance data have demonstrated that independent risk factors among chronic hemodialysis patients for acquiring HBV infection include the presence of ≥ 1 HBV-infected patient in the hemodialysis center who is not isolated, as well as. a < 50% hepatitis B vaccination rate among patients. HBV infection among chronic hemodialysis patients also has been associated with hemodialysis provided in the acute-care setting 21, 39). Transmission appeared to stem from chronically infected HBV patients who shared staff members.

been approved for Engerix-B Â®. The recommended primary series of hepatitis B vaccine induces a protective anti-HBs response. For persons with normal immune status, controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that protection from acute and chronic HBV infection is virtually complete among those who develop a protective antibody response after vaccination. In addition, a case-control study. indicated that the risk for HBV infection was 70% lower among hemodialysis patients who had been vaccinated. Thus, most hemodialysis patients can be protected from hepatitis B by vaccination, and maintaining immunity among these patients reduces the frequency and costs of serologic screening.

### Persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen in blood in a chronic haemodialysis patient following vaccination booster [^114cnk21]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Patients receiving haemodialysis are at an increased risk of hepatitis B infection; regular screening for incident infection and vaccination of susceptible individuals is recommended. Haemodialysis patients often require repeated high-dose hepatitis B vaccination boosters because of impaired response. Since the hepatitis B surface antigen is used as an immunogenic agent for vaccination and as a marker of hepatitis B infection, it has occasionally been detected in the blood shortly after vaccine administration and can be mistaken for a new infection. These transient results, however, are unlikely to persist for longer than 14days after vaccination. We report the case of a haemodialysis patient who tested weakly positive for hepatitis B surface antigen 52days after a vaccine booster. This is the longest vaccine-induced antigenaemia described in the literature and indicates that vaccination can cause weakly positive hepatitis B surface antigen results for longer than previously reported.

### Increased cancer risk in patients undergoing dialysis: a population-based cohort study in north-Eastern Italy [^114tYAA8]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients receiving renal replacement therapies (RRT) are known to be at higher risk of cancer than the corresponding general population. Although some malignancies diagnosed in dialysis patients or after kidney transplant (KT) share similar risk factors (e.g. hepatitis B virus infection for liver cancer), the magnitude and pattern of increased risks substantially vary according to individual and clinical characteristics and to the modality of RRT.

It is well known that emerging techniques and advances in dialysis technology have led to significant improvements in patients' life span. Due to increased survival, malignant neoplasms have become an increasingly relevant health issue in the dialysis population. Previous studies have provided convincing evidence of an increased risk of certain cancer types, such as kidney, thyroid, and bladder cancer, possibly related to side effects of kidney failure, including the prolonged uremic state, the presence of chronic infection and inflammation, a weakened immune system, nutritional deficiencies, and impaired mechanisms of DNA repair.

The investigation of the pattern of cancer risk in dialysis patients is crucial for planning primary and secondary cancer prevention strategies. The increased risk of cancer in dialysis patients has been well documented in Asia, United States, Australia/New Zealand, and northern Europe. Conversely, less evidence has been accumulated in southern European countries, such as Italy, where end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients represent about 0.1% of the general population, and only a small study has been published in the international literature.

In this population-based investigation, we assessed the risk and spectrum of de novo malignancies (DNMs) among dialysis patients as compared to the corresponding general population.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^111j2ZxF]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The main risks relate to HBV, HCV and HIV infections. These viruses have been associated with outbreaks among patients and staff in haemodialysis units. Other BBV such as Hepatitis G and D have been identified as being more commonly carried in dialysis patients than the general population but their clinical significance is uncertain.

Risk of BBV transmission is known to be directly related to the concentration of virus in the blood. HCV and HIV are less infectious in dialysis units than HBV but outbreaks have been reported emphasising the need for infection control measures. Within the guideline we refer to the KDIGO guidelines for the management of HCV within the renal unit and refer to the specific recommendations for infection control.

Patients with any acute BBV infection are probably more infectious than chronic carriers and this guideline therefore includes recommendations to try to identify patients at risk of acute BBV infection.

Most of the evidence to support the recommendations comes from observational clinical studies, case series and in vitro observations. This is largely because the incidence of BBV is low, despite the risks of potential BBV exposure remaining high. When recommending areas for future research we have chosen not to recommend interventional controlled trials that are unfeasible.

From large multicentre and single centre observational studies there is a clear demonstration of the reduction of the incidence of BBV infection in association with the introduction of a range of infection control measures. Indeed, the majority of outbreaks in Europe since 2005 have been associated with a breach in infection prevention measures.

Infection prevention measures demand intensive and careful staffing and are dependent on maintaining our expert workforce. However this is being challenged by constraints on staffing including reduced nurse to patient ratios, and a focus on efficiency saving. The recommendations do take into account the resources that can realistically be expected in UK renal units: e.g. a dialysis nurse to patient ratio of 1:1 would probably reduce the risk of BBV transmission but is not recommended as it is not feasible. However, any proposed changes in staffing ratios in a unit should be accompanied by a risk assessment of the implications of this on the ability to adhere to the infection control measures recommended within this guideline. When applying this clinical practice guideline it is important to consider the balance between protecting patients from the risks of BBV transmission and compromising clinical care of patients infected, or at high risk of infection with BBV especially with regards to segregation.

### Hepatitis B vaccination in human immunodeficiency virus-infected adults receiving hemodialysis [^113cVaVn]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends hepatitis B virus (HBV) immunization for all hemodialysis (HD) patients because they are at high risk of infection. Several studies have shown that the development of protective antibody titers after HBV vaccination is much lower in HD patients. We hypothesized that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) would further impair the immune response to hepatitis B vaccination.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis from 1990 to 2002 at the United States-based dialysis facilities of Gambro Corporation, North America. The response rate defined as an increase in anti-HBs levels ≥ 10 mIU/L after a month of the third dose of HBV vaccination was determined in HIV-infected and a randomly selected group of ESRD patients. The demographic information, laboratory data, and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) titers were recorded from the Gambro Corporation database on these patients.

Results

Of the 347 adult HIV ESRD patients, 116 received three doses of recombinant hepatitis B vaccination. Seventy percent were male, and the majority (86%) were black. Of the 116 patients who received three doses of HBV vaccination, 62 (53.4%) developed protective antibody titers. This was comparable to the response rate of 50.4% in the randomly selected 220 non-HIV hemodialysis patients. Among HIV ESRD patients, the mean hemoglobin (Hgb) was higher in patients who developed protective antibody titers (Hgb 11.61 ± 2 vs. 10.55 ± 1.86, P value < 0.01). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, higher Hgb was associated with protective antibody titers (odds ratio: 1.34, 95% CI 0.99–1.72). Seventy percent of the HIV-infected responders maintained protective antibody titers 6 months after vaccination.

Conclusion

Hepatitis B vaccination should be offered to all HIV-infected ESRD patients because over half of the patients with HIV and ESRD can develop protective antibodies.

### COVID-19 vaccination among patients receiving maintenance renal replacement therapy: immune response, real-world effectiveness, and implications for the future [^1138UXc3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 800 million people worldwide and often progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which requires maintenance dialysis. Patients receiving dialysis are at higher risk for severe respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19), than the general population. This is because of the impaired, rapidly aging immune system of individuals with ESRD. Chronic low-grade inflammation and the high prevalence of comorbidities, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, as well as older age, also contribute to the immune system impairment in this population. In addition, many patients requiring dialysis also receive immunosuppressive treatments for conditions such as systemic vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or malignancies.

Preventive measures such as vaccination remain critical to ensure patients receiving dialysis are protected against diseases; however, successful protection through vaccination can be challenging in these individuals, as the impaired immune responses to infections have also been associated with reduced immune responses to vaccines. Accordingly, it has been noted that individuals who were nonresponders to hepatitis B vaccination are also less likely to have adequate immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, many studies have shown that while mRNA COVID-19 vaccines induce some level of immune response in patients receiving dialysis, the magnitude of responses are often lower than that of healthy individuals and responses rapidly wanes. Importantly, the risk of COVID-19–related hospitalization and mortality for patients receiving dialysis is 4- to 8-fold higher compared with the general population. Given that patients receiving dialysis remain at high risk of severe COVID-19, it is essential that the immune responses and real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in this population are well characterized to better inform clinical and public health practices. Initial studies examining 2 doses of mRNA vaccines in patients receiving dialysis have been extensively summarized in several systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses. In this narrative review, we summarize recent immunogenicity and real-world outcomes of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination among patients receiving dialysis, with a focus on the 3-dose extended primary series and additional (fourth) doses.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^116tfADc]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Response should be assessed by measuring plasma anti HBs antibody 8 weeks after completion of the immunisation schedule. There is on-going debate about what constitutes a response to immunisation.

Conventionally > 100mIU/ml was regarded as conferring immunity but there is evidence that even patients who have a lower peak response (10–100mIU/ml) will not become chronic carriers of HBV.

The significance of this titre was illustrated in a five-year follow-up study of 773 homosexual men vaccinated in 1980; most severe infections occurred among those who never achieved a titre > 9.9mIU/ml. The risk of late infection in those with an initial titre of > 9.9mIU/mL increased markedly when antibody levels decreased below 10mIU/mL, but only 1 of 34 of these late infections resulted in viraemia and liver inflammation.

In a series of haemodialysis patients, with anti HBs antibody titres > 10mIU/ml who received transplants from HBsAg positive donors, 67% seroconverted to anti-HBc positivity - suggesting that such an anti-HBs titre does not always protect against HBV infection in HD patients.

It is worth being aware of the possibility of HBV surface mutants that can cause HBV infection in patients with apparently adequate anti HBs titres and seem to occur in endemic regions with large HBV vaccination programs (vaccine escape mutants).

More than half of haemodialysis patients who respond to immunisation do not maintain detectable antibody. In one of the early randomised controlled studies of immunisation there were 4 cases of hepatitis B infection in dialysis patients who had an apparent response to immunisation in whom the antibody levels had waned, suggesting a strategy of antibody surveillance and booster doses may be worthwhile.

In one small Italian study the monitoring of antibody titres and the administration of additional doses enabled maintenance of protective HBV antibody levels in 96% of patients 4 years after initial immunisation.

Retrospective reviews from the 1990s convincingly demonstrate a higher response in non-dialysis compared to dialysis patients (80% compared to 50% in one analysis). In 2003 Da Rosa et al. prospectively demonstrated that GFR was an independent positive predictive variable of seroconversion in response to the vaccination.

Previous guidelines have also recommended annual testing of patients who have ever achieved a HBV titre > 10mIU/mL with administration of a booster dose of vaccine if titre < 100mIU/ml but we acknowledge that the frequency of surveillance and the titre to trigger a booster dose is debatable.

### Hepatitis B vaccination status among patients with end-stage kidney disease on haemodialysis in Ethiopia: a multi-center cross-sectional study [^1132NqDL]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains an important global public health problem with significant morbidity and mortality. WHO estimates that 296 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B infection in 2019, with 1.5 million new infections each year. In Ethiopia, the overall pooled prevalence of HBV was 6%. In 2019, hepatitis B resulted in an estimated 820,000 deaths, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite the availability of effective vaccines since 1982, HBV infection has remained endemic in many countries.

Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at increased risk of acquiring HBV infection compared to the general population due to their deficient immune response, and the nature of hemodialysis procedures. Specifically, patients receiving hemodialysis are considered at high risk of acquiring HBV infection. Some of the factors associated with HBV propagation among hemodialysis patients include duration and frequency of hemodialysis, equipment contamination, and contact with other patients as well as healthcare workers.

Guidelines from nephrology societies, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that all patients with CKD should be vaccinated against HBV.

Among chronic kidney disease (CKD) populations, immune responses to HBV vaccination are impaired, proportionally to the degree of kidney failure. Hence, CKD patients experience lower seroconversion rates, lower peak antibody titers, and shorter durations of sero-protection. Protective antibody titer is maintained only in 50% of CKD patients compared with 85% of healthy individuals after 1 year of vaccination. Strategies to improve response rates among CKD patients have included vaccination as early as possible in the course of renal disease, the use of double vaccine doses, and a four-dose rather than three-dose schedule. It is advised that these patients should be vaccinated at an earlier stage and before the start of hemodialysis because the response is better with higher eGFR.

Persons on Dialysis, Hemodialysis, or Peritoneal Dialysis

A study during 1997–2001 of adult hemodialysis patients found an adjusted prevalence of HBV infection of 2.4% (95% CI = 2.1–2.7). Dialysis was reported only in 3% (34 of 1,292) of 2,019 acute HBV infection cases; however, the risk for developing chronic infection was higher among persons who are immunosuppressed and undergoing dialysis than persons who are immunocompetent. Recommendations for Preventing Transmission of Infections Among Chronic Hemodialysis Patients includes testing recommendations for patients on hemodialysis.

Persons with Elevated ALT or Aspartate Aminotransferase Levels of Unknown Origin

Persons with known chronic liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, or autoimmune hepatitis) are not at increased risk for HBV infection unless they have additional exposures or risk factors. However, persons with persistently elevated ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels without a known cause should be tested for HBV infection as part of a medical evaluation of these abnormal laboratory values.

Guideline 5.6 – BBV infection: identification and management of 'non-responders' to the immunisation programme

We suggest that patients should be regarded as an inadequate-responder if the anti HBs antibody titre is < 100mIU/ml 8 weeks after completing the first complete immunisation schedule. (1C).

We would suggest the following strategies:
If the anti HBs Ab titre is between 10 IU/ml and 100 IU/ml we recommend administering a booster dose of the vaccine. (1C)
If the anti HBs titre is < 10 IU/ml we recommend repeating the entire vaccination course with the high concentration of the vaccine (or the appropriate dose for children age < 16 years). (1C) Follow up with an anti-HBs antibody titre test 4 to 6 weeks following the last injection to ensure it is greater than 10 m IU/l.
If after two full vaccination courses the anti HBs titre remains < 10mIU/ml we recommend that the patient is labeled as a non-responder to the vaccine, and therefore not immune to HBV.
A non-responder patient, who is therefore not immune to HBV, should be counselled about how to minimize risk of HBV exposure and the recommended actions needed to take in the advent of a potential Hepatitis B exposure (this is likely to include urgent receipt of Hepatitis B immunoglobulin). (1B)

Guideline 3.2 – BBV infection: management of patients starting Haemodialysis with unknown virology status

We recommend that patients who require haemodialysis before the result of the HBsAg test is known should be dialysed in an area that is segregated from the main dialysis unit and the machine should not be used for another patient until the result is known to be negative or the machine has been thoroughly decontaminated (see 2.1) (1A).

The DoH report 2002 defined segregation between infected and clean areas in a renal unit as being 'functionally complete with no possibility of traffic between the two' and suggested there be a physical barrier such as walls or screens between these infected and clean areas.

Guideline 3.3 – BBV infection: surveillance for HBV/HCV/HIV in prevalent Haemodialysis population

We recommend that patients on regular hospital haemodialysis who are immune to hepatitis B infection (annual anti HBs antibody titre > 100 mIU/ml; see section 5 below), need to be tested for HBsAg every 6 months. Non-responders and those with inadequate response should be tested at least every 3 months (1C).

We recognise that there are challenges in implementing a testing regime where different timings can be employed depending on antibody titres. For this reason units may prefer to routinely test for HBsAg every 3 months.

We recommend that patients on regular hospital haemodialysis, without any identified ongoing risk factors for HCV acquisition, should be tested for HCV antibody at least every 3–6 months (1C). A patient specific screening plan utilising NAT testing should be initiated for patients with on-going HCV acquisition risks.

We recommend that antibody surveillance testing for HIV is not necessary for patients on regular hospital haemodialysis unless the patient is at high risk (see Table 4) (1C).

### The prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a large multi-ethnic haemodialysis cohort [^117U6tFK]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

It is difficult to ascertain the exact levels of HBV DNA in blood that may lead to transmission in the haemodialysis setting. The UK Department of Health guidelines recommend that HBV infected healthcare workers can be allowed to perform exposure prone procedures if their HBV DNA level is suppressed to < 1,000 copies/ml (around 250 IU/ml).

Although we follow the current UK practice of isolating patients with chronic hepatitis B infection, and implement practices designed to prevent nosocomial infection within our dialysis centres, we did detect a number of patients with occult hepatitis B which may reflect our inner city, multi-ethnic practice, as in our haemodialysis cohort, 62.5% of patients are considered HBV immune, either through vaccination of due to past infection. Although we could detect circulating HBV in a small number of HBsAg negative patients, the low levels of circulating HBV DNA we detected in our cohort are unlikely to pose a real risk of nosocomial transmission in clinical practice based on following universal precautions, and particularly if a robust HBV vaccination programme is implemented in haemodialysis units. However it is especially important that vaccination is provided early in patients with CKD thought to be at risk of requiring renal replacement therapy, as it has been shown that these individuals have an impaired response to vaccination once established on haemodialysis. In our cohort, patients from the Caucasoid ethnic group showed better vaccination-induced immune response than patients from other ethnic groups (p = 0.041). The ethnic difference in vaccine response is not well understood, although a recent study suggests that certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tissue types are associated with non-responsiveness to HBV vaccination and that different HLA types of the ethnic groups should be considered when evaluating vaccine responses.

### Efficacy of the accelerated hepatitis B vaccination schedule used in haemodialysis patients post-exposure to virus: a single-centre experience [^116JNYpU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The hepatitis B (HB) vaccination regime currently recommended for use in the UK for both preventative and post-exposure purposes is the accelerated regime, although there have been no recent reports of its efficacy. This observational study reports on the response rate achieved and longevity of protection conferred with this regime in a large number of haemodialysis patients following an episode of HB exposure.

Methods

One-hundred and five patients received primary vaccination (vaccine administered at 0, 1 and 2 months). Eighty-six completed the regime, receiving a booster dose at month 12. Measuring antibodies to HB surface antigen (anti-HBS) 6 weeks after receiving the third and fourth doses assessed patients' response. Seventy-seven patients subsequently had anti-HBs measured at month 24.

Results

The response rate (anti-HBS > 10 mIU/ml) to primary vaccination and the complete regime was 33 and 73%, respectively. Non-European patients responded better to primary vaccination than Europeans (P = 0.014). Those receiving steroids responded less well to the complete vaccination regime (P = 0.007). Patient's age, sex, renal diagnosis, diabetes mellitus, time on dialysis, dialysis adequacy, erythropoietin dose, hepatitis C or body weight did not affect response rates. By month 24, 24 responders (44%) had lost seroprotection. Antibody levels achieved with vaccination by transient responders was significantly lower than persistent responders. No patients became HB surface antigen positive during the 2-year study.

Conclusion

Reserving the accelerated vaccination to the post-exposure scenario will expose many more patients to the risk of HB cross-infection than if used prophylactically. Regular monitoring is required if seroprotection is to be maintained.

### Immunogenicity of augmented compared with standard dose hepatitis B vaccine in pediatric patients on dialysis: a midwest pediatric nephrology consortium study [^1114GFLw]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Patients on maintenance dialysis have a higher risk of unresponsiveness to hepatitis B vaccination and loss of hepatitis B immunity. Adult guidelines recommend augmented dosing (40 mcg/dose), resulting in improved response in adults. We sought to determine whether children on dialysis mount a similar antibody response when given standard or augmented dosing of hepatitis B vaccine.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This is a retrospective review of patients on dialysis aged < 19 years from May 1, 2008 to May 1, 2013 at 12 pediatric dialysis units. Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) titers ≥ 10 mIU/ml were defined as protective.

Results

A total of 187 out of 417 patients received one or more hepatitis B vaccine boosters. The median age was 13 years; the cohort was 57% boys and 59% white. Booster dose or HBsAb titers were missing in 17 patients. Conversion to protective HBsAb titers was achieved in 135 out of 170 patients (79%) after their first single-dose booster or multidose booster series. In patients receiving a single-dose booster, the response rate was 53% (nine out of 17) after a 10 mcg dose, 86% (65 out of 76) after a 20 mcg dose, and 65% (17 out of 26) after a 40 mcg hepatitis B vaccine dose. In patients receiving a multidose booster series, the response rate was 95% (19 out of 20) after a 10 mcg/dose series, 83% (20 out of 24) after a 20 mcg/dose series, and 71% (five out of seven) after a 40 mcg/dose series. Patients receiving a multidose booster series had a response rate of 86% (44 out of 51), compared with 76% (91 out of 119) in patients receiving a single-dose booster (P = 0.21). Twenty-seven patients received more than one single-dose booster or multidose series, and 26 out of 27 (96%) eventually gained immunity after receiving one to three additional single-dose boosters or multidose booster series.

Conclusions

There was no clear gradient of increasing seroconversion rate with increasing vaccine dose in this cohort of pediatric patients on dialysis.

### The prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a large multi-ethnic haemodialysis cohort [^115oMzM7]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The strength of our audit is our large multi-ethnic haemodialysis cohort in North Central London, with 20% of patients having evidence of previous infection with HBV. Despite this, the prevalence of patients having circulating detectable HBV viraemia (occult HBV) was found to be low and the reassuringly the very low levels of HBV DNA detected are very unlikely to pose a nosocomial transmission risk to other kidney haemodialysis patients in the presence of robust active vaccination program against HBV and appropriate infection control measures. As we only measured HBV on one occasion the limitation of our study is that we cannot exclude that at other times patients may have higher circulating viral DNA levels and may pose a risk of blood borne infection which could be increased in centres without an active vaccination program or infection control policies.

Guideline 3.4 – BBV infection: management of patients who do not consent for BBV testing

We suggest that patients who do not consent to BBV surveillance, as described above, should have dialysis in a segregated area unless they are known to be HBV immune in the previous 6 months. If patients who are known to be HBV immune within the previous 6 months do not consent to BBV surveillance then they should be managed in the same way as patients with HCV infection (see section 4) (2C).

We recommend that patients planning to dialyse outside the UK should have a risk assessment prior to travel for potential exposure to BBV abroad. Where exposure is considered likely, enhanced surveillance testing for BBV should be planned and instituted and patients should have dialysis in a segregated area as detailed below (1B).

Guideline 3.6 – BBV infection: procedures for enhanced surveillance of high risk patients

We recommend that patients at high risk for new BBV infection (see Table 4) should have enhanced surveillance as described in section 3.5 (1B).

We recommend that testing for HBsAg and HCV RNA should be performed in haemodialysis patients with unexplained abnormal serum aminotransferase concentrations (KDIGO Hepatitis C guideline 1.2.2) (1B).

We recommend that if a new BBV infection is identified in a haemodialysis unit, testing for viral RNA or DNA should be performed in all patients who may have been exposed (see section 7) (KDIGO Hepatitis C guideline 1.2.4). (1B).

ACIP's Hepatitis Work Group comprises professionals from academic medicine (pediatrics, family medicine, internal medicine, infectious disease, occupational health, and preventive medicine specialists), federal and state public health agencies, and medical societies. * The Work Group reviewed epidemiology and literature, directed an economic analysis, and deliberated upon recommendations. The Work Group considered existing published ACIP and CDC vaccine recommendations in summarizing recommendations contained herein for the prevention of HBV infection.

This report updates and supplants ACIP recommendations for HepB vaccination of children and adults published previously. This report incorporates ACIP and CDC recommendations published previously.

Guidelines from AASLD inform the use of antiviral therapy among pregnant women with elevated HBV DNA for the purpose of preventing perinatal HBV transmission. Surveillance data were obtained from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).

Data informing clarifications to the recommendations were summarized on the basis of findings from literature searches that were completed on May 11, 2016. Two search terms were used to ascertain data regarding maximum number of doses for dialysis patients and minimum intervals for dialysis dosing: "Hepatitis b vacc * dialysis boost * " and "Dialysis hepatitis b vacc * schedule". Epidemiologic and vaccine coverage data were reviewed, as well as publicly available data on the number of infant abandonments and safely surrendered infants. The literature searches included clinical trials and comparative studies conducted worldwide and published in English since 2000. All studies yielding pertinent information were eligible for inclusion. Search results were supplemented by additional relevant papers identified by subject matter experts on the Work Group. Per the ACIP process, it was predetermined that Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was not required for these updates of existing recommendations.

### A new adjuvant improves the immune response to hepatitis B vaccine in hemodialysis patients [^1168jys2]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

Prehemodialysis and hemodialysis patients are at an increased risk of hepatitis B infection and have an impaired immune response to hepatitis B vaccines. We evaluated the immune response to the new adjuvant of hepatitis B vaccine AS04 (HBV-AS04) in this population. We measured antibody persistence for up to 42 months, and the anamnestic response and safety of booster doses in patients who were no longer seroprotected. The primary vaccination study showed that HBV-AS04 elicited an earlier antibody response and higher antibody titers than four double doses of standard hepatitis B vaccine. Seroprotection rates were significantly higher in HBV-AS04 recipients throughout the study. The decline in seroprotection over time was significantly less in the HBV-AS04 group with significantly fewer primed patients requiring a booster dose over the follow-up period. Solicited/unsolicited adverse events were rare following booster administration. Fifty-seven patients experienced a serious adverse event during the follow-up; none of which was vaccine related. When HBV-AS04 was used as the priming immunogen, the need for a booster dose occurred at a longer time compared to double doses of standard hepatitis B vaccine. Hence, in this population, the HBV-AS04 was immunogenic, safe, and well-tolerated both as a booster dose after HBV-AS04 or standard hepatitis B vaccine priming.

### Association of response to hepatitis B vaccination and survival in dialysis patients [^1152HUHR]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) significantly increases the risk of mortality and morbidity. The leading cause of death in ESRD is cardiovascular disease (CVD), which accounts for more than half of deaths in uremic patients, with infection the second leading cause. Previous studies have investigated the relationships among endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and atherosclerotic vascular disease in chronic kidney disease. Uremic-related inflammation, which commonly occurs during pre-dialysis and persists even after dialysis, is now regarded as an important predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the ESRD population. Currently, it is speculated that acquired immune dysfunction in the uremic milieu may be one of the main pathogenic factors, mediated through CVD and infections, in most ESRD-related deaths. Concomitant immunosuppression and immune activation in uremia would predispose patients to infection and CVD, respectively.

Although it is well established that aging, diabetes mellitus (DM), and the presence of co morbid conditions predict a poor prognosis in ESRD, few studies have investigated immune dysregulation as a determinant of mortality in ESRD. Furthermore, acquired immune dysfunction in uremic patients has various clinical features, ranging from proness to infection to impaired immune response to vaccinations. The aim of our study was to link the clinical immune parameter, immune response and anti-HBs titers one month following HBV vaccination with mortality in ESRD populations.

Guideline 5.4 – BBV infection: immunisation schedule for vaccination against Hepatitis B virus

We recommend that the initial HBV immunisation schedule should involve high doses, frequent doses or both of the available preparations.

We recommend that the vaccines are administered intramuscularly as per their licensed route (deltoid muscle) but, if sufficient expertise exists, the intradermal route may more effective. (1A) (Table 1).

The DOH has now developed a model patient group direction for use of HBV vaccines in advanced renal failure -

We recognise that there is a fine balance to be had with frequent hospital attendances versus pragmatic vaccination schedules. Although schedules indicated provide immunity as rapidly as possible, some flexibility around scheduling is possible with, for instance, vaccinations given every 3 months to tie in with appointments. The vital element is to ensure that there is a gap of at least 4 weeks between first and second vaccine. Extension of the vaccine schedule prolongs time to protection, but longer intervals between the doses do improve immune response. Patients should be tested 4–8 weeks after their primary immunisation course for evidence of response, and annually thereafter, with booster doses, as required.

Rationale

There are several reports of increased success of immunisation if higher individual doses of vaccine are used, a greater number of doses are given, and if the intradermal route is used.

Most studies have shown that a 4 dose double dose schedule over 6 months is superior to the conventional 3 dose immunisation schedule. This is also logistically easier than identifying non-responders to the 3 dose schedule and administering a booster dose.

There is some evidence that HBV vaccine with the adjuvant ASO4 (Fendrix) is more immunogenic than Engerix B.

There has been recent interest in adding immunostimulants to improve the success of HBV immunisation in patients with CKD but it is too early to make a firm recommendation and reports have, in some cases, had conflicting conclusions.

The World Health Organisation recommended universal childhood vaccination against HBV in 1992 and by 2003, 79% of member states had implemented this. The UK adopted this approach in August 2017. Countries that have implemented this have seen exceptional falls in their childhood prevalence rates of Hepatitis B. Cost-benefit analyses have strongly supported the introduction of universal vaccination against HBV to newborns, outside the UK, as part of a vaccination programme. Results of children's vaccination, which were evaluated in the six-year outcome of the programme, showed neither new cases of HBsAg de novo nor seroconversion to anti-HBc positivity.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^1129B2UR]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

In their best practice advice, ACP and CDC recommend testing persons at increased risk for HBV infection with tests for HBsAg, total anti-HBc, and anti-HBs. The ACP best practice risk groups align with current testing recommendations except that ACP omits persons with a history of STIs or multiple sex partners (Box 4).

CDC screening guidelines were developed independently from the ACIP recommendations for HepB vaccination. The 2018 ACIP recommendations also include recommendations for serologic testing. CDC's screening and testing guidelines cover all persons recommended for serologic testing per ACIP and expand beyond that list (Box 1). When considering prevaccination testing or testing for HBV infection, CDC recommends testing that follows a universal testing approach (Figure 2).

The work group did not evaluate clinical guidance for patients after screening. The most recent expert guidance to reduce the risk for liver damage is that patients with HBV infection should be vaccinated against hepatitis A virus (if not already immune); screened for HIV, HCV, and hepatitis D virus (HDV); and assessed for alcohol risk factors, such as with the alcohol screening and brief intervention. Depending on the likely route of transmission, the patient might benefit from STI screening, drug treatment, or harm-reduction counseling. A full list of recommended steps for examination, education, laboratory, serology, and imaging is provided (Table 2).

Additional screening might be recommended for blood donors, newly arrived refugees, and persons initiating cytotoxic or immunosuppressive and additional testing might be recommended for patients on hemodialysis, health care personnel, perinatally exposed infants, and persons involved in exposure events who might warrant postexposure prophylaxis and postvaccination serologic testing. These recommendations are described elsewhere (,–). Providers should follow the most conservative approach when recommendations differ.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^1126Ce9e]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

We recommend that non-responders to HBV should receive no further immunisation - the likelihood of benefit is low, compared to the cost burden. However there is some evidence that non-responders to a 4 dose 40 μg schedule might subsequently respond to a large dose given intra-dermally. In high risk groups (potential transplant recipients, individuals intending to dialyse away from base in a high risk area) this should be considered. Anecdotal evidence suggests that those more likely to respond to second courses include non-smokers, low BMI, age < 40, or high levels of immunosuppressive drugs at the time of the first vaccination.

A non-responder patient, who is therefore not immune to HBV, should be counselled about how to minimize risk of HBV exposure and recommended actions needed to take in the advent of a potential Hepatitis B exposure (this is likely to include urgent receipt of Hepatitis B immunoglobulin). (1B).

They should also be advised about the risks of overseas travel and dialysis away from base. Patients who are not immune to HBV who dialyse in units where the prevalence of risk of HBV is higher should undergo a period of enhanced surveillance on their return to the UK, and be dialysed on their own machine, ideally in a segregated area. (1C).

Guideline 5.7 – BBV infection: management of patients prior to overseas travel or high risk exposure

We recommend that responders to the HBV vaccine should have the anti HBs titre checked prior to travel overseas or high risk exposure (1C), with a booster dose administered if the Anti HBs antibody titre is < 100miU/ml. (1C).

Rationale

Haemodialysis patients who mount a good response to vaccine appear unable to maintain high antibody levels. Fleming et al. showed that 57% of haemodialysis patients who mounted a good response had lost detectable anti-HBs within 6 months of immunisation, and therefore will need a booster dose of the vaccine to maintain their immunity.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^116sTxoW]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The probability of acquiring HIV infection in UK dialysis units is very low and therefore does not justify regular surveillance for otherwise low risk patients. However, unless there is a robust system of routinely questioning patients to assess for risks of new BBV infection, there is a potential to miss new cases of BBV. Therefore many units routinely screen for HIV antibody on a 6–12 monthly basis. Similarly, in an attempt to reduce complexity with BBV surveillance, many units in the UK routinely screen for HBsAg and HCV on a 3 monthly basis in all patients and this approach is perfectly acceptable.

Guideline 3.5 – BBV infection: management of patients returning from dialysis outside UK

We recommend that patients planning to dialyse outside the UK should have a risk assessment prior to travel for potential exposure to BBV abroad. Where exposure is considered likely, enhanced surveillance testing for BBV should be planned and instituted and patients should have dialysis in a segregated area as detailed below (1B).

Rationale

Good practice guidelines for renal dialysis and transplant units by DoH provides guidance on classifying countries at low, medium or high risk of BBV exposure for patients dialysing away from base (see Appendix 1). Prior to travel units should review the immunisation status of the patient and administer booster vaccinations if needed.

Individual units may wish to undertake a risk assessment of the planned DAFB unit (accepting that the assessment of risk is subjective), counsel patients regarding the potential risks of BBV infection and the plans for segregation and surveillance on return. The level of risk for BBV exposure will depend on the prevalence of BBV in the country visited, infection control policies in the DAFB unit and lifestyle activities of individual patients.

On return from DAFB, patients should be risk assessed for potential exposure to BBV whilst abroad. Examples of questions to be included in this risk assessment on return are highlighted in Appendix 2.

Depending on the risk of BBV exposure we recommend the following level of surveillance:

Our previous guidelines have suggested that enhanced surveillance for HBV is not required if immune with HBsAb level > 100 mIU/mL in the last 12 months. However, antibody titres can fall over time, leading some patients to become unprotected. In view of this and in an attempt to reduce the level of complexity in the guidelines, which can lead to errors if misinterpreted, we have recommended same level of surveillance irrespective of HBsAb levels.

Hepatitis B affects approximately 350 million people worldwide, and an estimated 1.25 million people in the United States. Although most people infected with the virus do not develop significant hepatic disease from hepatitis B, 15–40% will develop serious complications. These complications include cirrhosis, the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatic decompensation. Patients with renal failure have increased risk of acquiring the virus through blood transfusions and contact with bodily fluids at hemodialysis centers, and of developing complications from hepatitis B virus infection. Renal transplant patients are at increased risk for exacerbations of hepatitis B with immunosuppression. Thus, it is crucial for the nephrologist to have a clear understanding of the natural history and treatment of hepatitis B, both pre- and post-renal transplant.

### Practical guide to vaccination in all stages of CKD, including patients treated by dialysis or kidney transplantation [^116sqVeZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those receiving maintenance dialysis or with a kidney transplant. Although responses to vaccines are impaired in these populations, immunizations remain an important component of preventative care due to their favorable safety profiles and the high rate of infection in these patients. Most guidelines for patients with CKD focus on the importance of the hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccines in addition to age-appropriate immunizations. More data are needed to determine the clinical efficacy of these immunizations and others in this population and define optimal dosing and timing for administration. Studies have suggested that there may be a benefit to immunization before the onset of dialysis or transplantation because patients with early-stage CKD generally have higher rates of seroconversion. Because nephrologists often serve as primary care physicians for patients with CKD, it is important to understand the role of vaccinations in the preventive care of this patient population.

### A randomized clinical trial of immunization with combined hepatitis A and B versus hepatitis B alone for hepatitis B seroprotection in hemodialysis patients [^112bwGtz]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend immunizing susceptible high-risk groups, such as hemodialysis patients, against hepatitis B virus. However, hemodialysis patients may not develop seroprotective antibodies despite receiving high doses of the vaccine. Recent reports indicate that combined vaccination against hepatitis B and hepatitis A viruses may improve the immunogenicity of hepatitis B vaccine in healthy individuals, but the effectiveness of this strategy in hemodialysis patients is unknown.

Study Design

Prospective randomized controlled trial.

Setting & Participants

Hepatitis B virus-seronegative hemodialysis patients with undetectable antibody levels at baseline.

Intervention

Intramuscular administration of Twinrix (inactivated hepatitis A virus [720 ELISA units] and purified hepatitis B virus surface antigen [20 μg]; GlaxoSmithKline) and Engerix-B (purified hepatitis B virus surface antigen [20 μg]) at 0, 1, and 6 months plus Engerix-B, 40 μg, at month 2 (intervention arm) or Engerix-B, 40 μg, at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months (control arm). Both groups received a total dose of 160 μg of hepatitis B antigen.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the difference in seroprotection rates at 7 months, defined by antibody titers > 10 mIU/mL. The secondary outcome was frequency of adverse events.

Measurements

Antibody response at months 3 and 7.

Results

96 patients were enrolled, and 73 completed the investigation. At 3 months, there was no difference in the groups' seroprotection rates (25% vs 27%; P = 0.4). At the completion of the vaccination series, using per-protocol analysis, 27 of 40 (68%) and 16 of 33 (49%) had antibody titers > 10 mIU/mL in the treatment and control groups, respectively (P = 0.05; RR, 1.4; absolute abatement, 19%). Intention-to-treat analysis showed 58% and 38% seroprotection rates in the treatment and control groups, respectively (P = 0.02; RR, 1.5; absolute abatement, 20%). There was no difference in adverse events.

Limitations

Lack of evidence of long-term protection.

Conclusion

Vaccination of hemodialysis patients with a combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B regimen resulted in a statistically significant and clinically important improvement in seroprotection against hepatitis B virus compared with hepatitis B monovalent vaccine.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^115gr9dD]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

HBV is highly infectious with significantly higher concentration of viral particles in an infected patient compared to HCV or HIV infected counterparts. A non-immune patient with an untreated percutaneous exposure to an infected source carries a risk of seroconversion of up to 30%; by contrast the risks of HCV and HIV are 1.8 and 0.3% respectively. HBsAg positive patients who are also positive for hepatitis B e antigen have an extremely high viral load in their blood and are likely to have appreciable levels of HBV in body fluids containing serum or blood. HBV is relatively stable in the environment and has been shown to remain viable for at least 7 days on environmental surfaces (including clamps, scissors, dialysis machine control buttons and door handles) at room temperature in the absence of visible blood and still contain high viral titres. There is strong epidemiological evidence that segregation of HBV infected dialysis patients reduces HBV transmission among dialysis patients.

For these reasons patients with chronic HBV infection (HBsAg positive or evidence of circulating viral DNA) should be dialysed using dedicated dialysis machines and staff, in a segregated area or rooms, with no sharing of instruments, medications and supplies between patients, regardless of serological status. Segregated area refers to an area with physical barriers such as walls or screens ensuring there is no possibility of traffic between infected and clean areas. Healthcare workers dialysing patients with known HBV infection should not dialyse patients without HBV infection at the same time. Environmental surfaces including dialysis chair/ bed, external surface of HD machine, clamps etc. must be thoroughly decontaminated using a process recognised to be effective against HBV after each use.

Standard disinfection of machines between patients does not eliminate the risk of transmission of HBV. A machine that has been used for patients infected with HBV can be used again for non-infected patients only after it has been thoroughly decontaminated using a process recognised to be effective against HBV. A local protocol for decontamination should be drawn up, taking into account the manufacturer's instructions, the design of the machine and the use of double transducer protectors. The pressure transducer ports should be decontaminated after each use unless double transducer protectors are routinely used. If the machine does not automatically disinfect the Hansen connectors, they should be disinfected manually (e.g. by immersion in bleach for 10 min). If the machine housing is known to have points that are vulnerable to blood seepage, these should be checked and disinfected.

### Hepatitis B virus infection and the dialysis patient [^111RGDow]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

Prevention of nosocomial transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been a signal achievement in the management of chronic kidney disease. The rate of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositivity in patients on maintenance hemodialysis in the developed world is currently low (0–10%) but outbreaks of acute HBV infection continue to occur in this setting. The prevalence of HBV infection within dialysis units in developing countries appears higher (2–20%) based on relatively few reports. Although data are limited, HBV infection in dialysis population diminishes survival; HBV viral load in HBsAg-positive dialysis patients is reportedly low and stable over time. Updated recommendations for the management of HBsAg chronic carriers on maintenance dialysis have been issued. No rigorously controlled treatment trials for treatment of hepatitis B with either interferon or lamivudine therapy in dialysis patients are currently available.

### Mortality, hospitalization, and quality of life among patients with hepatitis C infection on hemodialysis [^113NG5CR]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is widely prevalent among patients on hemodialysis (HD), but very rarely treated. The aim of our study is to evaluate the burdens of HCV suffered by patients on HD.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

The Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study is an international, prospective, cohort study of patients on HD. We reviewed the HCV status of 76,689 adults enrolled between 1996 and 2015. We compared HCV-positive (HCV+) with HCV-negative (HCV-) patients for risk of mortality, hospitalization, decline in hemoglobin concentration < 8.5 g/dl, and red blood cell transfusion. We also compared health-related quality of life scores using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life instrument and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale. We adjusted for age, sex, race, years on dialysis, 14 comorbid conditions (including hepatitis B infection), and serum albumin, phosphorus, and creatinine concentrations.

Results

A total of 7.5% of patients were HCV+ at enrollment. Serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were not markedly elevated in HCV+ patients on HD; the mean concentrations were only 22.6 and 21.8 U/L, respectively. Median follow-up was 1.4 years. Case-mix adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for HCV+ versus HCV- patients were 1.12 (1.05 to 1.20) for all-cause mortality, 5.90 (3.67 to 9.50) for hepatic-related mortality, 1.09 (1.04 to 1.13) for all-cause hospitalization, and 4.40 (3.14 to 6.15) for hepatic-related hospitalization. Quality of life measures indicated significantly worse scores for physical function, pain, vitality, mental health, depression, pruritus, and anorexia among HCV+ patients. The adjusted hazard ratio for transfusion was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.55) and incidence of hemoglobin concentration < 8.5 g/dl was 1.12 (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.21). Only 1.5% of HCV+ patients received antiviral medication.

Conclusions

HCV infection among patients on HD is associated with higher risk of death, hospitalization, and anemic complications, and worse quality of life scores. Internationally, HCV infection is almost never treated in patients on HD. Our data provide a rationale for more frequent treatment of HCV in this population.

### How serious is the risk of HTLV-1 infection in Iranian hemodialysis-dependent patients? [^112X2jbm]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prevalence of HTLV-1 infection among patients undergoing hemodialysis, which was reported in various regions of Iran. Twelve studies showed an infection rate of 0–14% in hemodialysis-dependent patients. Based on our results, the pooled prevalence of HTLV-1 infection was estimated to be 2.37% (95%CI = 0.54–4.19/p-value < 0.0001).

Several risks associated with hemodialysis treatment suggest the need for cautious reconsideration by clinicians prescribing this procedure for patients. While patients dependent on maintenance hemodialysis therapy are immunocompromised, they remain at a high risk of infection due to the treatment. Additionally, one reason for ESRD in patients referred to dialysis wards is intravenous drug use, which heightens the risk of infection with viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in other patients. Another factor linked to a higher risk of HIV-1 infection is the overall elevated prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and CKD in individuals previously infected with HIV-1, possibly due to systemic infections or side effects of their medications. The significantly higher prevalence of HIV-1 and HBV infections among hemodialysis patients supports these theories. Overall, infection with blood-borne viruses is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in patients dependent on hemodialysis.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to patients with HDV co-infection, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider giving priority to testing for HDV in the following specific populations of HBsAg-positive individuals in settings in which a universal anti-HDV antibody testing approach is not feasible because laboratory capacity or other resources are limited:

- individuals born in HDV-endemic countries, regions, and areas

- patients with advanced liver disease, receiving HBV treatment, or with features suggesting HDV infection (such as low HBV DNA with high ALT levels)

- patients deemed to be at increased risk of HDV infection, including hemodialysis recipients, patients with hepatitis C or HIV, people who inject drugs, sex workers, and MSM.

### Hepatitis C virus and the immunological response to hepatitis B virus vaccine in dialysis patients: meta-analysis of clinical studies [^113wdRdi]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2011). Low credibility.

It is well known that the seroconversion rate of patients following hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination is lower in uraemic than healthy subjects. A variety of inherited or acquired factors have been implicated in this diminished response, and the high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among patients on maintenance dialysis has been suggested to play a role. However, the impact of HCV on the immune response to HB vaccine in patients receiving long-term dialysis is not entirely understood. Here, we evaluate the influence of HCV infection on the immunological response to HBV vaccine in dialysis population by performing a systematic review of the literature with a meta-analysis of clinical studies. We used the random-effects model of DerSimonian and Laird with heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses. The end-point of interest was the rate of patients showing seroprotective anti-hepatitis B titres at completion of HBV vaccine schedule among HCV-positive versus HCV-negative patients on chronic dialysis. We identified eight studies involving 520 unique patients on long-term dialysis. Aggregation of study results did not show a significant decrease in response rates among HCV-infected versus noninfected patients [pooled odds ratio = 0.621 (95% CI, 0.285; 1.353)]. The P-value was 0.007 for our test of study heterogeneity. Stratified analysis in various subgroups of interest did not meaningfully change our results. Our meta-analysis showed no association between immunological response to hepatitis B vaccine and HCV infection in individuals on long-term dialysis. These results support the use of recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B in patients on regular dialysis with HCV infection.

Hemodialysis patients are at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Administration of the standard HBV vaccine is suboptimal as a means of prevention because of an impaired seroconversion response in individuals with chronic kidney disease. Surquin and colleagues describe a novel vaccine adjuvant system that increases speed of seroconversion and duration of seroprotection compared with older vaccine formulations. However, its ability to improve overall seroconversion response remains unproven.

HBV-susceptible patients resulted in 70% — 80% reductions in incidence of HBV infection among hemodialysis patients 7, 36–38). National surveillance data for 1976–1989 indicated that incidence of HBV infection was substantially lower in hemodialysis units that isolated HBsAg-positive patients, compared with those that did not. natural infection, most persons will be positive for both anti-HBs and anti-HBc, whereas only anti-HBs develops in persons who are successfully vaccinated against hepatitis B. Persons who do not recover from HBV infection and become chronically infected remain positive for HBsAg, although a small proportion. No data exist on response to vaccination among hemodialysis patients with this serologic pattern. A third antigen, HBeAg, can be detected in serum of persons with acute or chronic HBV infection. The presence of HBeAg correlates with viral replication and high levels of virus.

Anti-HBe correlates with the loss of replicating virus and with lower levels of virus. However, all HBsAg-positive persons should be considered potentially infectious, regardless of their HBeAg or anti-HBe status. been approved for Engerix-B ®. The recommended primary series of hepatitis B vaccine induces a protective anti-HBs response. In addition, a case-control study.

indicated that the risk for HBV infection was 70% lower among hemodialysis patients who had been vaccinated. Thus, most hemodialysis patients can be protected from hepatitis B by vaccination, and maintaining immunity among these patients reduces the frequency and costs of serologic screening.

### Prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113kTSuh]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health burden. In 2019, an estimated 296 million people were chronically infected with HBV and more than 820 000 HBV-related deaths occurred worldwide. Only 10.5% of chronically infected people were aware of their infection in 2019, suggesting a pressing need for more effective strategies to identify and treat individuals who are infected. The WHO clinical guidelines advocate initial testing with HBsAg using laboratory-based immunoassays or rapid diagnostic tests. This approach also applies to high-risk populations, such as people living with HIV, people with hepatitis C virus infection, and people on haemodialysis, and those with advanced chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology.

However, these testing strategies are at risk of missing occult HBV infection, defined as the presence of replication-competent HBV DNA in the liver tissue or blood of individuals who have tested negative for HBsAg using chemiluminescent immunoassay or ELISA.HBV DNA should be detected by nucleic acid tests (NAT), including PCR, in blood samples or liver tissue, and the gold standard remains testing for episomal covalently closed circular DNA in the liver.

### Viral hepatitis in patients on hemodialysis [^113LTmqQ]. Seminars in Dialysis (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B and hepatitis C (HCV) prevalence are higher in people on hemodialysis (HD) than the general population. Through implementation of prevention interventions including vaccines, serologic screening, and post-exposure management, transmissions linked to HD have decreased dramatically. In this manuscript, we review epidemiology of viral hepatitis, summarize current screening and vaccine recommendations, and appraise the available data about efforts to decrease incidence within HD facilities, including isolation of people with viral hepatitis within HD units. Also included is a discussion of the highly effective all-oral HCV treatment options and treatment for HCV in people awaiting kidney transplant.

Table 1
Summary of screening strategies and programmes utilised in the United Kingdom to prevent transmission and reactivation of HBV in various cohorts.

HBV, as a blood-borne virus, is transmitted through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids; immunisation of at-risk individuals and screening to prevent transmission of HBV are key preventative measures to limit the spread of HBV (Table 1). Universal antenatal screening of pregnant persons for HBsAg at 16 weeks of pregnancyhas been shown to almost completely eliminate the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HBV in England by providing adequate treatment for the infected mothers and prompt post-exposure prophylaxis to their babies, whereas screening of blood donations for HBsAg, HBV DNA and anti-HBc aims to prevent HBV transmission via blood transfusion from donors with chronic and occult HBV infection. Haemodialysis patients are also screened for HBsAg so that the dialysis of HBV-infected and non-infected patients can be segregated to prevent the transmission of HBV.HBV reactivation has also been well-documented in immunocompromised individuals who have evidence of past HBV infection and thus potentially have replication-competent HBV DNA in the liver; screening patients for anti-HBc before commencing immunosuppression aims to identify those at risk of reactivation and guide their prophylactic antiviral treatment.

HBV screening during pregnancy is part of routine antenatal care; the follow-up of mothers with chronic HBsAg-positive HBV infection is organised by specialist midwives and supported by doctors from different medical specialities. Both screening of haemodialysis and immunocompromised patients for HBV is performed in hospital settings, where the patients are already linked to secondary care. In contrast, blood donation screening of healthy volunteers is not done in a hospital setting; hence, linkage to care is more complex. In the United Kingdom (UK), blood donors with chronic or acute HBV infection are contacted for post-test discussion by a trained nurse or medical doctor, usually via telephone, and they are subsequently referred for specialist care via their general practitioners (GPs). However, the management of individuals with OBI presents a complex dilemma that requires attention but has not been previously addressed in this context. Our viewpoint is based upon extensive discussions over a decade involving the UK's leading experts in hepatology, viral hepatitis, clinical virology, transfusion microbiology and public health.

Recommendations of others — hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening populations: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American College of Physicians, and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommend screening for HBV infection in high-risk persons including all persons born in countries with an HBsAg prevalence of 2% or greater; US-born persons not vaccinated as infants whose parents were born in regions with an HBsAg prevalence of 8% or greater; persons who inject drugs; men who have sex with men; persons with HIV infection; persons with hepatitis C virus infection; inmates of correctional facilities; and household contacts and sexual partners of HBsAg-positive persons. Both the CDC and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases also recommend screening patients with conditions requiring immunosuppressive therapy, those receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, persons with elevated ALT levels of unknown etiology, and developmentally disabled persons and staff in residential facilities; the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases also recommends screening persons with multiple sexual partners or a history of sexually transmitted infections; and the American Academy of Family Physicians endorses the 2014 USPSTF recommendation on HBV screening.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^112vVM3r]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.1 – BBV infection: isolation of patients known to be infected with Hepatitis B virus (HBV)

We recommend that patients infected with HBV must be dialysed in an area that is segregated from the main dialysis unit. (1A).

We recommend that healthcare workers performing dialysis on patients infected with HBV infection should not dialyse patients without HBV infection at the same time. (1C). If this is not possible then they must wear PPE and ensure thorough decontamination before moving from one patient to the other.

Audit Measure 5: The proportion of patients known to be infected with HBV, are dialysed in a segregated area (using the DoH definition of 'segregated').

Rationale

The DoH report 2002 defined segregation between infected and clean areas in a renal unit as being "functionally complete with no possibility of traffic between the two" and suggested there be a physical barrier such as walls or screens between these infected and clean areas.

There is ample evidence that suggests 'horizontal' (patients not sharing a machine) and 'vertical' (patients sharing a machine) transmission of HBV occurs when patients infected with HBV are dialysed beside uninfected patients. The risk of HBV transmission has been shown to be reduced if patients infected with HBV are dialysed in an area that is segregated from the "clean" area of the dialysis unit. Transmission has been reported in situations where health workers care for infected and non-infected patients on the same haemodialysis shift. This also applies for HBV infected patients undergoing invasive procedures (such as central venous catheter insertion) on the dialysis unit. Such procedures should take place in a segregated area. BBV can survive and remain infective on surfaces of clinical equipment, even where blood splashes are not visible to the naked eye. Any unused equipment (syringes, swabs, spare catheters) taken into the room where the procedure has occurred should be disposed of.

Guideline 4.2 – BBV infection: management of patients infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HIV

We recommend that patients with HCV or HIV do not need to be dialysed in a segregated area, providing infection control and universal precautions can be properly adhered to (1C). (KDIGO Hepatitis C guideline 3.1).

### Targeting zero infections in the outpatient dialysis unit: core curriculum 2020 [^114LcbiN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Although overall mortality rates in dialysis patients have improved during the last decade or so, infections remain a leading cause of death, second only to cardiovascular disease. In addition, infections account for a major share of hospitalizations in this patient population. Receiving hemodialysis treatments in an outpatient dialysis facility significantly contributes to patients' risks for infection. In dialysis units, patient-to-patient transmission of viral pathogens such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus can occur; proper screening and vaccination of patients can decrease the risk for transmission. Strict adherence to hand hygiene, use of appropriate personal protective equipment, transmission-based precautions, and maintaining aseptic technique while connecting the access to the hemodialysis machine can substantially decrease the likelihood of bacterial infections. With an effective infection control program in place, infection prevention becomes part of the dialysis facility's culture and results in improved patient safety. In this installment of the Core Curriculum series, we highlight best practices that should be followed by health care workers in the dialysis unit and discuss the role of the medical director in promoting initiatives to reduce infection rates.

Segregation of patients infected or at risk of infection with BBV (guidelines 4.1–4.2)

Guideline 4.1 – BBV infection: isolation of patients known to be infected with Hepatitis B virus (HBV)

We recommend that patients infected with HBV must be dialysed in an area that is segregated from the main dialysis unit. (1A).

We recommend that healthcare workers performing dialysis on patients infected with HBV infection should not dialyse patients without HBV infection at the same time. (1C). If this is not possible then they must wear disposable PPE and ensure scrupulous attention to hand hygiene before moving from one patient to the other.

We recommend that patients with HCV or HIV do not need to be dialysed in a segregated area, providing infection control and universal precautions can be properly adhered to. (1C)KDIGO Hepatitis C guideline 3.1).

Immunisation of patients against Hepatitis B virus (guidelines 5.1–5.7)

Guideline 5.1 – BBV infection: indications for immunisation of patients against hepatitis B virus (HBV)

We recommend that all patients who require renal replacement therapy (RRT) [dialysis or transplantation] for CKD should be assessed for current or past infection with Hepatitis B and offered vaccination against HBV if indicated. (1A).

Guideline 5.2 – BBV infection: timing of initiating immunisation schedule against HBV

We recommend that patients who are likely to require RRT, who are deemed susceptible to HBV infection, should be offered vaccination prior to the development of Stage V CKD [or 2 years before they are likely to need renal replacement therapy, as judged by the clinical team managing the patient]. (1A) A kidney failure risk calculator could be used to facilitate this prediction.

Guideline 5.3 – BBV infection: identification of patients for whom immunisation against HBV is not indicated

Hepatitis B vaccine is not indicated in patients who have current (Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or HBV DNA positive) or confirmed past HBV infection. Presence of the anti HBc antibody in isolation should not be taken as confirmation of previous HBV infection. Patients identified to be core antibody positive who are at risk of reactivation of HBV (particularly immunosuppression) may need to be vaccinated and the case should be discussed with a local virologist. (2B).

### Intradermal vs intramuscular vaccine against hepatitis B infection in dialysis patients: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^116u5iLz]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic dialysis patients are at risk of contracting hepatitis B virus infection and have a diminished immune response to hepatitis B virus vaccine. Recent reports support intradermal administration of hepatitis B virus vaccine in patients on regular dialysis but the efficacy and safety of this approach remain unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials to compare seroprotection achieved by intradermal vs intramuscular hepatitis B vaccine, in patients on maintenance dialysis. Meta-analysis of data from 718 adults (14 trials) on long-term dialysis demonstrated that intramuscular hepatitis B vaccination was less likely to achieve seroprotection than intradermal vaccination, the pooled odds ratio was 0.454 (95% CI, 0.3; 0.67), P = 0.001. The test of study heterogeneity was not significant. This difference did not persist during follow-up (6–60 months after completing vaccine schedule), the pooled odds ratio being 0.718 (95% CI, 0.36; 1.47), NS. Some evidence of significant heterogeneity including publication bias was present but stratified analysis in various subgroups showed that this issue did not meaningfully change our results. Intradermal hepatitis B vaccine was safe and well tolerated. We conclude that intradermal hepatitis B vaccine induces a superior response rate compared to intramuscular route at completion of vaccine cycle, despite a lower vaccine dose. No significant advantage was found over longer follow-up. It remains unclear whether the higher seroprotection rate achieved with intradermal route translates into a lower frequency of de novo hepatitis B among patients on maintenance dialysis.

### Patterns of hepatitis B prevalence and seroconversion in hemodialysis units from three continents: the DOPPS [^1173XUXz]. Kidney International (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatitis B (HBV) historically has been a public health issue within hemodialysis units. This study estimates HBV prevalence and seroconversion rates across seven countries and investigates associations with facility level practice patterns.

Methods

The study sample was from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS), a cross-sectional, prospective, observational study of adult hemodialysis patients randomly selected from 308 dialysis facilities in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States. Logistic regression was used to model the odds ratio (OR) of HBV prevalence, and Cox regression was used to model time from entry into the study to HBV seroconversion.

Results

In this sample, mean HBV facility prevalence was 3.0% with a median of 1.9%. The percentage of facilities with an HBV prevalence 0% to 5% was 78.5%. Adjusted HBV prevalence was higher in France, Germany, and Italy and lower in Japan and the United Kingdom. The majority of facilities (78.1%) had a seroconversion rate of 0 conversions per 100 patient-years. Presence of a protocol for HBV-infected patients was significantly associated with HBV seroconversion in the separate practice pattern model [risk ratio (RR) = 0.52, P = 0.03] and in the combined practice pattern model (RR = 0.44, P = 0.01).

Conclusion

There are differences in HBV prevalence and rate of seroconversion both at the country and the hemodialysis facility level. Presence of a protocol for HBV-infected patients was strongly and significantly associated with decreased risk for seroconversion. The observed variation suggests opportunities for improved HBV outcomes with further definition of optimal practice patterns at the facility level.

### Hepatitis B and C and renal failure [^116xDgZP]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C is the most common cause of liver disease in the dialysis patient. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis C determined by anti-HCV testing in this population ranges from 6% to 38%. Using second generation EIA assays, the prevalence of anti-HCV among patients participating in the 1997 National Surveillance of Dialysis Associated Diseases in the United States was 9.3%. Polymerase chain reaction testing for HCV RNA has shown that the prevalence of HCV infection can be as high as 20% to 30% of dialysis patients. The causes and source of infection in patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis are multiple. Before the introduction of routine screening of blood donors for anti-HCV, blood transfusions were an important risk factor for acquisition of hepatitis C. Other potential sources of infection include exposure to contaminated equipment and nosocomial routes such as patient-to-patient exposure. The risk of infection appears to correlate with the duration of hemodialysis and the number of transfusions. Interestingly, dialysate and buffers have been shown to be virus free even when used in hepatitis C infected patients. The natural history of chronic hepatitis C infection in patients with renal failure is not well characterized. Although persistent elevations in ALT levels occur in 12% to 50% of dialysis patients, the frequency of persistently normal ALT levels in HCV-infected dialysis patients appears to be higher than in HCV-infected patients without renal failure. Overt liver disease and liver failure rarely occur. The degree of inflammation in liver biopsies of renal failure patients is usually mild. Thus, progressive liver disease may be less common in patients with advanced renal disease but further studies are required to assess the true impact of hepatitis C infection in this high risk population. The impact of hepatitis C infection on morbidity and mortality of patients with end-stage renal disease remains poorly defined. Initial studies have failed to show a significant increase in mortality among HCV-infected hemodialysis or renal transplant patients within the first 5 years following transplantation. In contrast, recent studies with extended follow-up of renal transplant recipients suggest that hepatitis C infection may affect patient and graft survival during the second decade. Further studies are required to identify the mechanisms of infection of patients with end-stage renal disease and to define better treatment strategies for these patients before and after kidney transplantation.

Immunisation of staff against Hepatitis B virus (guidelines 6–1 – 6.2)

Guideline 6.1 – BBV infection: immunisation of staff against Hepatitis B virus

We recommend that staff members who have clinical contact with patients should be immunised against HBV and demonstrate that they are immune to, and are not infected with HBV. (1A). Staff members who have current infection with HBV require occupational health clearance and ongoing monitoring in order to perform clinical duties. They would not usually be employed to work clinically on a dialysis unit.

Guideline 6.2 – BBV infection: immunisation of staff against Hepatitis B virus

We suggest that staff that are not immune to HBV and are not HBV infective should not dialyse patients who are HBV infective. (2B).

Rationale

Several reports of outbreaks of HBV and HCV infection in dialysis units have included patient to staff and staff to patient transmission. Staff members are at much lower risk of acquiring HIV or HCV infection than HBV infection. It is important, therefore to have a mechanism in place to minimise this risk.

Hepatitis B immunisation of dialysis unit staff members has been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of HBV infection in these staff members. Staff who are in contact with clinical equipment that might be infected with HBV should also be offered HBV immunisation (e.g. dialysis technicians).

Staff members are at very low risk of acquiring HIV or HCV from dialysis patients.

HCV treatment in CKD — testing for HBV infection and monitoring during direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy: All treatment candidates should undergo testing for HBV infection prior to therapy (Not Graded). If hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is present, the patient should undergo assessment for HBV therapy (Not Graded). If HBsAg is absent but markers of prior HBV infection (HBcAb-positive with or without HBsAb) are detected, monitor for HBV reactivation with serial HBV DNA and liver function tests during DAA therapy (Not Graded). DAA therapy and achievement of HCV clearance can lead to HBV reactivation, with the risk period greatest during DAA therapy and for up to 12 weeks posttreatment, and the overall likelihood of HBV reactivation is low (< 5%) but is highest among patients who are positive for HBsAg.

### Treating hepatitis C virus in dialysis patients: how, when, and why? [^113C7bPh]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

The identification of hepatitis C virus (HCV) occurred in 1989, and soon thereafter, it was recognized that there was a higher prevalence of anti-HCV seropositivity in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) when compared to the general population. Multiple extrahepatic manifestations have been associated with HCV infection in patients with ESRD; these include an increased prevalence and risk of cardiovascular complications, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and lymphoproliferative disorders. Infection with HCV has also been associated with an increased relative risk of mortality in the ESRD patient when contrasted to those patients without infection. The availability of second-generation direct-acting antiviral agents has revolutionized the treatment of HCV in both the general population as well as those patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and receiving dialysis. These new treatment protocols are very well tolerated with limited side effects and manageable drug-drug interactions while achieving remarkable sustained viral response rates. It is important that nephrologists become familiar with the differing strategies available for HCV-infected ESRD patients so that the appropriate decision of when and who to treat can be made for each patient.

### Acute hepatitis B infection in a long-term hemodialysis patient despite persistent natural immunity [^115gvJm9]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B infections are a distinct clinical problem in hemodialysis patients. Naturally acquired antibodies from a prior hepatitis B virus infection generally are considered to be immunoprotective for subsequent infections. We describe a new-onset hepatitis B virus infection in a hemodialysis patient despite persistent protective levels of naturally acquired antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen. This case emphasizes that the immune response to hepatitis B virus is complex and still poorly understood. Current recommended screening guidelines may be incomplete in addressing acute hepatitis B virus infections in hemodialysis patients. Aggressive vaccination strategies should be considered to maintain immunity in patients at high risk of seroconversion. Stricter surveillance and use of modern virus detection assays may be required to detect subtle infections and minimize the risk of transmission of hepatitis B virus in hemodialysis units.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^114t2NUW]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 3.1 – BBV infection: virology status of patients starting Haemodialysis

We recommend that all patients starting haemodialysis (including patients with acute kidney injury) or returning to haemodialysis after another modality of renal replacement therapy should be known to be plasma HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative before having dialysis on the main dialysis unit (1A).

We recommend HCV screening all patients starting haemodialysis or returning to haemodialysis after another modality of renal replacement therapy. We recommend patients with no identified risk factors for acquiring HCV may be screened by an immunoassay. If the immunoassay is positive, we recommend a follow up screen with nucleic acid testing (NAT). Patients with current or historical risk factors for HCV acquisition should initially be screened by NAT, with subsequent reversion to serological methods if no ongoing risk factors are present. NAT screening should be continued in patients with ongoing risk factors (KDIGO Hepatitis C guideline 1.1.2) (1A).

We recommend that HIV screening should be undertaken in all patients starting haemodialysis (1C).

Guideline 3.2 – BBV infection: management of patients starting Haemodialysis with unknown virology status

We recommend that patients who require haemodialysis before the result of the HBsAg test is known should be dialysed in an area that is segregated within the main dialysis unit (such as a side room) and the machine should not be used for another patient until the result is known to be negative or the machine has been decontaminated using a HBV suitable decontamination regime (see 2.1) (1A).

Guideline 3.3 – BBV infection: surveillance for HBV/HCV/HIV in prevalent Haemodialysis population

We recommend that patients on regular hospital haemodialysis who are immune to hepatitis B immunisation (anti HBs antibody titre > 100 mIU/ml; see section 5 below), only need to be tested for HBsAg every 6 months. Non-responders should be tested at least every 3 months (1C). For ease units may prefer to routinely test for HBsAg every 3 months for all patients.

We recommend that patients on regular hospital haemodialysis should be tested for HCV antibody every 3 months. However, those with historical or current risk factors for HCV acquisition should be tested using a NAT test (1C).

We recommend that antibody surveillance testing for HIV is not necessary for patients on regular hospital haemodialysis unless the patient is at high risk (See Table 4) (1C).

### The prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a large multi-ethnic haemodialysis cohort [^115HJtUc]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Haemodialysis patients are at increased risk of infections with blood-borne viruses (BBV), such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Current UK guidelines recommend that patients on haemodialysis are routinely tested for BBV and that all dialysis centres implement measures to prevent nosocomial transmission.

Many new infections with HBV are sub-clinical, and current infection can be detected by the presence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the serum. Following the discovery that patients infected with HBV could transmit infection within a haemodialysis unit, a code of practice was introduced into the UK in the early 1970s, which dramatically reduced the incidence of HBV infections in UK dialysis patients and staff. UK government Department of Health (DOH) guidance recommends that haemodialysis patients are screened 3 monthly for HBsAg, and chronic HBV patients are dialysed in isolation using dedicated machines with strict infection control measures to prevent nosocomial transmission. Those patients returning from 'dialysis away from base' in resource poor countries undergo enhanced screening for HBsAg for 8 weeks.

The presence of HBV core antibody (anti-HBcAb) in blood with or without anti-HB surface antibody (anti-HBsAb) is considered as evidence of past HBV infection, and these patients are considered non-infectious and HBV DNA is therefore not routinely tested in this group. However, occult HBV infection, defined as the presence of anti-HBcAb and HBV DNA in blood without any detectable HBsAg, has been described in these 'HBV past infection' patients. As such, it has been suggested that there may be a potential risk of patients with occult HBV transmitting infection within dialysis units, as these patients are not isolated or segregated from other dialysis patients.

One of the mainstays of preventing HBV transmission within haemodialysis units is the establishment of a robust vaccination programme. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibit specific and non-specific defects in both humoral and cellular immune responses. As a result, the response to Hepatitis B vaccination is lower in haemodialysis patients compared with the general population. Vaccination is therefore advised early in the course of the renal disease, using a double vaccine dose (40 microgrammes) and a 4 rather than 3 dose schedule. It is estimated that 45–66% of patients with CKD develop adequate anti-HBs responses, and however levels decline more rapidly in comparison with immuno-competent individuals. Anti-HBsAb levels above 10 IU/L are considered to be protective.

### Hepatic disorders in chronic kidney disease [^1146Qfjc]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are the most common and serious causes of liver damage in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The natural histories of HBV and HCV infections in patients with CKD are not fully understood; however, recent evidence has emphasized the adverse effect of HBV and/or HCV infection on survival in this population. Chronic liver disease is the fourth most important cause of death after renal transplantation. The negative effect of HCV infection on survival among renal transplant recipients has been linked to liver dysfunction and extrahepatic complications, such as chronic glomerulonephritis, post-transplantation diabetes mellitus, chronic allograft nephropathy, and sepsis. The transmission of HCV by solid organ transplantation has been unequivocally demonstrated. Renal transplant recipients who receive kidneys from HCV-positive donors are at increased risk of death. Although several studies have shown that in patients with HCV infection and chronic renal failure renal transplantation is associated with better survival than is dialysis, recent clinical guidelines recommend that kidneys from HCV-infected donors should not be used in HCV-seropositive recipients without detectable HCV viremia. Monotherapy with conventional interferon has been suggested to be a useful treatment for hepatitis C infection in patients on dialysis. Although no evidence suggests that patients with CKD are more prone to suffer from hepatic toxic effects than individuals with normal kidney function, patients with CKD usually receive multiple medications; and drug interactions may, therefore, have a role in the pathogenesis of drug-induced liver disease in this population.

### Hepatitis B vaccination status among patients with end-stage kidney disease on haemodialysis in Ethiopia: a multi-center cross-sectional study [^117G82Am]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease patients, especially those on hemodialysis, are at increased risk of developing hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Guidelines suggest that all patients with chronic kidney disease patients should be vaccinated against HBV, but these guidelines are sub-optimally implemented. Notably, there is a lack of studies in Ethiopia examining the hepatitis B vaccination status among patients with end-stage renal disease.

Objective

To assess the vaccination status of hepatitis B and associated factors among people with end-stage renal disease who were on hemodialysis.

Methods

A multi-center cross-sectional observational study was conducted in six randomly selected dialysis centers in Ethiopia, from May 2023 to September 2023. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate factors associated with vaccination status. A person is considered to be vaccinated against hepatitis B if he/ she has taken at least one dose of HBV. Vaccination status was determined by patient's recall and verification from medical record.

Results

Only 16% of patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis were vaccinated against hepatitis B virus (16.6%; with CI = 12.18, 21.83), of which 30% had received one dose, 57.5% had two doses, 12.5% had three doses, and only five had a booster dose. Post-secondary education (AOR = 5.47; 95% CI = 1.41, 21.2; P < 0.014) and dialysis for more than three years (AOR = 19.75; 95% CI = 4.06, 96.1; P < 0.001) were significant factors associated with having received hepatitis B vaccination.

Conclusion

Only a small minority of Ethiopian hemodialysis patients have received hepatitis B vaccination. The level of education of patients and the duration of time on dialysis were significant associated factors that affected the vaccination status of patients with end-stage renal disease. So, strong intervention is needed according to the identified factors to raise the vaccination status of patients.

### Hepatitis B vaccination status among patients with end-stage kidney disease on haemodialysis in Ethiopia: a multi-center cross-sectional study [^1146TrFC]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

In Africa, the overall pooled prevalence of HBV among hemodialysis patients approaches 10%. The prevalence of HBV and HCV infections in hemodialysis centers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia was reported to be low. HBV and HCV infections are among the important causes of infection-related morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Although acute infection tends to be mild and asymptomatic in dialysis patients, up to two-thirds may progress to chronic carriage, with a significant risk of chronic liver disease, premature death from cirrhosis or liver cancer, and nosocomial transmission within hemodialysis units. In addition, viral hepatitis is the one of causes of morbidity and mortality resulting in a complication of hemodialysis treatment following cardiovascular disease and bacterial infection.

In developed countries, there has been a substantial decrease in the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in hemodialysis patients, probably attributable to screening of blood donors, a decline in blood transfusion requirements with increased erythropoietin use, identification of HBV-positive patients, use of dedicated dialysis machines, improved disinfection procedures, regular surveillance for HBV infection and active HBV vaccination before entering into dialysis program. Despite this, risk of HBV infection is still present among patients undergoing dialysis and that HBV may be easily transmitted in the dialysis setting whenever appropriate infection control practices are not strictly applied.

Despite this, hemodialysis patients remain at increased risk of acquiring HBV because of prolonged vascular access, repeated exposure to blood products, shared hemodialysis equipment, immune-deficient state, and continuing high prevalence rates of HBV infection among hemodialysis populations. Blood product transfusions are vital components of the care of patients on hemodialysis, and The risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission through transfusion has significantly decreased over the last few decades due to careful donor selection and sensitive screening techniques. Common safety measures include testing blood donations for HBV antigens (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc), and HBV nucleic acid (NAT). However, despite these efforts, achieving zero residual risk remains challenging. Some studies suggest transfusion-related HBV infection may still be a concern in low-income countries due to the pre-seroconversion window period (WP), infection with immunovariant viruses, and occult carriage of HBV infection (OBI).

### Prevalence and risk factors of hepatitis B and C viruses among haemodialysis patients: a multicentric study [^111M9JcS]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality among haemodialysis (HD) patients and create problems in the management of patients in the renal dialysis units, as patients with chronic renal failure do not absolutely clear these viral infections.

Aim

The aim of the study is molecular detection of HBV and HCV and their possible risk factors among the HD patients in northern Pakistan.

Materials and Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2013 to June 2014. The infections were investigated through serological and molecular techniques.

Results

The overall prevalence of HBV among the five HD centres was 7.5%. The main risk factors were HD centre (26.66%), history of blood transfusion (20%), dental procedure (13.33%) and time duration on HD (6.66%). However, the overall prevalence of HCV among the five HD centres was 19.58%. The main risk factors included HD centre (25.53%), history of blood transfusion (25.53%), dental procedure (10.64%), surgical treatment (6.38%), patients treated abroad (6.38%) and time duration on HD (4.25%).

Conclusion

The high prevalence of hepatitis viruses among HD patients of northern Pakistan indicates a close relation between HD centres and hepatitis virus transmission. Therefore, preventive control measures are essential to reduce hepatitis transmission in HD centres.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^116bfn22]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 7.3 – BBV infection: management of any new BBV infection within the Haemodialysis unit

We recommend that, when a haemodialysis patient develops a new BBV infection, expert virological advice should be obtained to co-ordinate enhanced surveillance of at-risk dialysis patients and carers and to arrange treatment of affected individuals. (1C) An 'outbreak group' should be formed, which should include representatives from the infection prevention committee expert virologists in addition to staff from the haemodialysis service. This group will coordinate the response. A clearly documented enhanced screening process for contacts with identified staff responsibilities and regular review should be established.

We recommended that all new cases of BBV infection identified on the dialysis unit should be referred to the hepatology/ virology team for consideration for treatment, to reduce individual and population risk. All patients should be counselled regarding the implications of having a blood borne virus and the risk of infectivity. Success rates for treatment of HBV and HCV have increased over the last 10 years and all patients should be considered for antiviral therapy.

Following successful treatment there will need to be on-going surveillance for reinfection. The risk of HCV reinfection is between 1 and 8% in those undertaking high risk behaviours. We would recommend that even after remission has been confirmed (HCV PCR negative) then precautions described within the guidelines should be observed.

For patients who successfully undergo treatment for HBV and who become HepBsAg negative we would recommend that, given the risk of viral reactivation, enhanced precautions are maintained and the patients should dialyse on a dedicated machine.

### Hepatitis B vaccination status among patients with end-stage kidney disease on haemodialysis in Ethiopia: a multi-center cross-sectional study [^112rhim7]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the study, the level of education of the patients was found to be a significant determinant factor for hepatitis B vaccination status. Patients with ESKD who have a college education or better were more likely to be vaccinated against hepatitis B compared to those with a primary level of education. This is similar to the findings of a study of Ethiopian healthcare professionals and a Chinese study of men who have sex with men. Higher educational attainment may be associated with better health literacy, greater access to information, proactive health advocacy, and potentially higher socio-economic status, all of which contribute to an increased likelihood of vaccination among individuals with ESKD. Additionally, higher education levels may lead to a more informed and positive attitude towards vaccination, facilitating adherence to recommended practices.

Similarly, the duration of time on dialysis was identified as a significant factor influencing the hepatitis B vaccination status of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Individuals who had been on dialysis for more than three years were found to be more likely to be vaccinated against hepatitis B compared to those who had been on dialysis for less than one year. This may be due to the development of an increased awareness of vaccination importance due to prolonged healthcare interactions. Extended engagement with the healthcare system offers frequent opportunities for vaccination discussions and interventions. Longer dialysis duration heightens risk perception, motivating individuals to prioritize hepatitis B vaccination. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical management guideline recommends the administration of HBV vaccination as early as possible in the course of CKD as it has been associated with higher seroconversion rates. Since individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those on dialysis are at an increased risk of HBV infection, timely vaccination is essential to provide them with optimal protection against this serious viral infection. Early intervention not only enhances individual immunity but also contributes to public health efforts in preventing the spread of hepatitis B in the broader population, especially in healthcare settings where the risk of exposure may be higher. Therefore, the recommendation for early HBV vaccination in the context of chronic kidney disease aligns with efforts to maximize immunization efficacy and safeguard the health of vulnerable individuals.

Strength and limitation of the study

Strength of the study

The study includes more than 25% of patients and health facilities that give dialysis in Ethiopia, improving generalization.

Limitations of the study

Causation cannot be proven as a cross-sectional study was used. Participants relied on their memory to report past vaccination experiences. This may introduce recall bias. Due to the nature of the study HBV surface antibody determination was not done.

### The prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a large multi-ethnic haemodialysis cohort [^111gXdYs]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Haemodialysis patients are at increased risk of exposure to blood borne viruses. To reduce transmission in the UK, all haemodialysis patients are regularly screened, and if susceptible to Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, vaccinated.

Methods

This retrospective study was undertaken to determine the HBV immune status in a large dialysis cohort and the prevalence of occult HBV infection, defined as the presence of anti-HBcore antibody (anti-HBcAb) and HBV DNA without detectable HB surface antigen (HBsAg). Information on HBV status was retrieved from haemodialysis patients under the care of The Royal Free Hospital, London, UK between 2009–2010. Available sera from 138 of 161 anti-HBcAb positive/HBsAg negative individuals were anonymised and tested for HBV DNA by a real time quantitative PCR.

Results

15 (2%) of 793 patients had chronic HBV infection (HBsAg positive). 161 (20%) were anti-HBcAb positive but HBsAg negative suggesting past infection. 335 (54%) of the remaining 617 patients were considered immune following vaccination (anti-HBsAb > 10 IU/L). Three (2.2%) of the 138 anti-HBcAb positive, HBsAg negative patients had detectable HBV DNA (3, 5 and 9 IU/ml). Standard liver function tests were normal in these patients.

Conclusions

In a large multi-ethnic London haemodialysis cohort, 20% patients had evidence of past HBV infection. Despite this, the prevalence of occult HBV was found to be low and the very low levels of HBV DNA detected are unlikely to pose a nosocomial transmission risk in the presence of robust vaccination and infection control measures.

### Hepatitis B vaccine nonresponders: possible mechanisms and solutions [^111Xoaa3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Hepatitis B (HBV) is a viral illness that chronically infects 240 million people worldwide, leads to liver disease, and increases risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The HBV vaccine has decreased HBV infection, and it and the human papilloma virus vaccine are the only vaccines that prevent cancer. Despite the effectiveness of the HBV vaccine, some populations do not develop protective responses. The risk groups for poor response include those with immunosuppression or dialysis-dependent, end-stage renal disease. Five percent of normal people do not have a response. These subjects are deemed HBV "nonresponders". Multiple strategies to improve the immunogenicity of the HBV vaccine are currently being pursued, including vaccine adjuvants, recombinant vaccines, and immune enhancement via up-regulation of dendritic cells.

Data Sources

PubMed was searched for peer-reviewed publications published from January 1980 to September 2017.

Study Selections

Studies retrieved for inclusion summarized potential mechanisms behind HBV vaccine nonresponsiveness and potential solutions.

Results

The mechanisms behind HBV vaccine nonresponsiveness vary between each subject population. Many current and future strategies may provide protective immunity against HBV in each of these populations.

Conclusion

This review provides a background on the immunology of HBV infection, the possible immunologic mechanisms to explain HBV vaccine nonresponsiveness, current research aimed at improving vaccine effectiveness, and possible future approaches for providing nonresponders protection from HBV.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^117AQbn3]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

It makes sense to adopt the improved assays to detect acute BBV infection in patients at increased risk for BBV infection. Detection of HCV RNA by PCR techniques has the advantage of significantly shortening the window period from infection to positive result compared to serological methods. HCV RNA may be detectable within 1–2 weeks of infection, whereas antibodies may take up to a year to be detectable in immunosuppressed individuals. Furthermore, some patients with HCV infection do not develop detectable antibody. HCV core antigen testing may be available in certain laboratories and has a similar window period to RNA testing, however concerns about limits of sensitivity mean it is not a recommended as a complete replacement for RNA testing currently.

Newly infected patients with HBV and particularly HCV infection may have an increase in ALT levels prior to antibody conversion. Therefore baseline, followed by monthly monitoring of serum ALT in susceptible patients has been recommended to enable early detection of new HCV infection in patients receiving haemodialysis. Unexplained elevated ALT levels should prompt additional evaluation for HBV/HCV infection. Because few haemodialysis patients newly infected with HCV report symptoms or have symptoms documented in their dialysis medical records, ALT levels are also often used retrospectively to define the likely exposure period for patients who acquired infection, thus narrowing the focus of a HCV case investigation to the most likely exposure and source.

Acquisition of a new BBV infection should prompt immediate evaluation of all other patients in the same facility to identify additional cases. The virology status of all at risk patients should be reviewed and all uninfected patients should be tested for BBV. The frequency of repeat screening should be increased for a limited time. For example, monthly testing for 3 months, followed by testing again in 3 months, and then resumption of screening every 6 months if no additional infections are identified. Identification of BBV transmission within a dialysis facility should prompt re-evaluation of infection control practices and need for corrective action.

We recommended that all new cases of BBV infection identified on the dialysis unit should be referred to the hepatology/ virology team for consideration for treatment, to reduce individual and population risk.

### Immunization in end-stage renal disease: opportunity to improve outcomes [^117Jd4wW]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Infection is the second most common cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), following cardiovascular causes. Immunization is a fairly simple, but underutilized, strategy for prevention of infectious morbidity and mortality in patients with kidney failure. It is imperative for nephrologists and primary care providers to have an understanding of immunization as an essential component of preventive healthcare measures in this high-risk population. Patients with ESRD represent a unique population due to their immunosuppressed state, dialysis-related exposures and suboptimal response to routine vaccines. While the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provides guidelines for vaccination of patients with renal disease against Hepatitis B, influenza and pneumococcal disease, the data on immunization against other commonly preventable infectious diseases are lacking. This article reviews the recent evidence on immunization in the ESRD population and synthesizes the related implications for maximizing prevention of infectious diseases in this high-risk population.

Both iron‐loading and chronic viral infection increase the risk of liver fibrosis". 35 Overall, 80% of hepatitis C (HCV) viremic patients progress to chronic hepatitis, 20% of whom will develop cirrhosis; HCV infection is currently one of the most common causes of liver transplantation in developed countries. 36 According to the DOPPS study, the prevalence of HCV infection among dialysis patients between 2012 and 2015 in North America, Europe and Japan was 8.7%, and nosocomial HCV spread in hemodialysis facilities was still occurring. 37 HCV‐infected dialysis patients have an increased risk of mortality from liver disease (HR 4.4; 95% CI: 3.14‐6.15). 37

Increased hepatic tissue iron plays a deleterious role in the course of HCV evolution, favoring development of fibrosis, cirrhosis and cancer. 38 Mild or moderate liver iron deposits are common in liver biopsies of patients with chronic HCV and are associated with the severity of liver disease (higher histological inflammatory activity score). These iron deposits were shown to decrease significantly with interferon. 39 The reduction of excess liver and body iron stores by phlebotomy also potentiated the effects of interferon (amelioration of histologic lesions) and improved the course of HCV in patients who could not receive interferon. 40, 41, 42 Similarly, elevated liver tissue iron (mild or moderate) is encountered in about 40%‐50% of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection (HBV) and with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and has also been linked to the severity of these 2 latter liver diseases (higher activity scores and fibrosis). 43, 44 In gerbils, iron induced liver fibrosis by increasing TGF‐β expression and collagen, 45 and when applied (as FeSO 4) to cultured human hepatocytes (non‐neoplastic PH5CH8 cells) it enhanced HCV replication about ten‐fold. 46

### Hepatitis B vaccination, screening, and linkage to care: best practice advice from the American College of Physicians and the centers for disease control and prevention [^112B5q2A]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vaccination, screening, and linkage to care can reduce the burden of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, recommendations vary among organizations, and their implementation has been suboptimal. The American College of Physicians' High Value Care Task Force and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed this article to present best practice statements for hepatitis B vaccination, screening, and linkage to care.

Methods

A narrative literature review of clinical guidelines, systematic reviews, randomized trials, and intervention studies on hepatitis B vaccination, screening, and linkage to care published between January 2005 and June 2017 was conducted.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should vaccinate against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in all unvaccinated adults (including pregnant women) at risk for infection due to sexual, percutaneous, or mucosal exposure; health care and public safety workers at risk for blood exposure; adults with chronic liver disease, end-stage renal disease (including hemodialysis patients), or HIV infection; travelers to HBV-endemic regions; and adults seeking protection from HBV infection.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should screen (hepatitis B surface antigen, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen) for HBV in high-risk persons, including persons born in countries with 2% or higher HBV prevalence, men who have sex with men, persons who inject drugs, HIV-positive persons, household and sexual contacts of HBV-infected persons, persons requiring immunosuppressive therapy, persons with end-stage renal disease (including hemodialysis patients), blood and tissue donors, persons infected with hepatitis C virus, persons with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (≥ 19 IU/L for women and ≥ 30 IU/L for men), incarcerated persons, pregnant women, and infants born to HBV-infected mothers.

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should provide or refer all patients identified with HBV (HBsAg-positive) for posttest counseling and hepatitis B-directed care.

### Case-control study of hepatitis B and hepatitis C in older adults: Do healthcare exposures contribute to burden of new infections? [^1115gs6F]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Reports of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission associated with unsafe medical practices have been increasing in the United States. However, the contribution of healthcare exposures to the burden of new infections is poorly understood outside of recognized outbreaks. We conducted a case-control study at three health departments that perform enhanced viral hepatitis surveillance in New York and Oregon. Reported cases of symptomatic acute hepatitis B and hepatitis C occurring in persons ≥ 55 years of age from 2006 to 2008 were enrolled. Controls were identified using telephone directories and matched to individual cases by age group (55–59, 60–69, and ≥ 70 years) and residential postal code. Data collection covered exposures within 6 months before symptom onset (cases) or date of interview (controls). Forty-eight (37 hepatitis B and 11 hepatitis C) case and 159 control patients were enrolled. Case patients were more likely than controls to report one or more behavioral risk exposures, including sexual or household contact with an HBV or HCV patient, > 1 sex partner, illicit drug use, or incarceration (21% of cases versus 4% of controls exposed; matched odds ratio [mOR] = 7.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.1, 24.1). Case patients were more likely than controls to report hemodialysis (8% of cases; mOR = 13.0; 95% CI: 1.5, 115), injections in a healthcare setting (58%; mOR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.3), and surgery (33%; mOR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.7). In a multivariate model, behavioral risks (adjusted OR [aOR] = 5.4; 95% CI: 1.5, 19.0; 17% attributable risk), injections (aOR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.8; 37% attributable risk), and hemodialysis (aOR = 11.5; 95% CI: 1.2, 107; 8% attributable risk) were associated with case status.

Conclusion

Healthcare exposures may represent an important source of new HBV and HCV infections among older adults.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^116uW5TH]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Some people who are receiving dialysis treatment have virus infection such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and/or HIV that is present in their blood. These infections can be transmitted to other patients if blood is contaminated by the blood of another with a viral infection. Haemodialysis is performed by passing blood from a patient through a dialysis machine, and multiple patients receive dialysis within a dialysis unit. Therefore, there is a risk that these viruses may be transmitted around the dialysis session. This documents sets out recommendations for minimising this risk. There are sections describing how machines and equipment should be cleaned between patients. There are also recommendations for dialysing patients with hepatitis B away from patients who do not have hepatitis B. Patients should be immunised against hepatitis B, ideally before starting dialysis if this is possible. There are guidelines on how and when to do this, for checking whether immunisation is effective, and for administering booster doses of vaccine. Finally there is a section on the measures that should be taken if a patient receiving dialysis is identified as having a new infection of hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV.

### Hepatitis B vaccination status among patients with end-stage kidney disease on haemodialysis in Ethiopia: a multi-center cross-sectional study [^113Y6ju4]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Infections acquired in dialysis units can prolong hospitalization, increase treatment costs, and contribute to increased morbidity and mortality among CKD patients on dialysis. Dialysis patients with no prior exposure to HBV are at risk for acquiring HBV in the dialysis unit and should be vaccinated. Vaccination prevents patients on hemodialysis from acquiring HBV and reduces the pool of HBV-infected patients on dialysis. HBV vaccine has a significant protective effect against acquiring HBV infection in chronic hemodialysis patients. Despite this, there is a gap in vaccinating CKD patients against HBV.

WHO and the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) both encourage all high-risk individuals to be vaccinated against HBV Unfortunately, a non-mandatory strategy is being used for vaccination against HBV in high-risk individuals in the country. This research aimed to identify the HBV vaccination status of CKD patients on maintenance hemodialysis, and factors associated with vaccination status within Ethiopia.

### Patient to patient transmission of hepatitis B virus: a systematic review of reports on outbreaks between 1992 and 2007 [^116fyUWb]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Notwithstanding these limitations, this review highlights several topical factors. Firstly, we found that dialysis units accounted for the highest number of outbreaks (10 out of 33), and that such outbreaks were the ones with the shortest duration and the fewest number of cases. These data might be explained by the fact that, in both the USA and most EU countries, dialysis units have widely improved and mandatory protocols for serological surveillance of blood-borne infections, such as HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), which enabled healthcare providers to promptly identify also asymptomatic cases; the consciousness of the risk of HBV transmission might also explain the higher frequency of reporting in dialysis units than in other settings. We also found that the highest number of such outbreaks was associated with the use of multi-vials, which is not unexpected. HBV outbreaks within dialysis facilities have long been recognized as a serious problem, and the evidence that dialyzed patients have a higher prevalence of blood-borne infections (e.g. HBV and HCV) has sometimes been reported as an indirect proof of HBV transmission during the dialysis process. However the contamination of blood during dialysis is hardly imaginable when disposable dialyzer circuits and machines with electronic fail-safe systems are used. Consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, the results of this review strengthen the idea that dialysis itself is nowadays a rather safe procedure and that outbreaks are largely due to 'substantial deficiencies in recommended infection control practice, such as the use of multi-vial drugs, as well as failure to vaccinate hemodialysis patients against hepatitis B'. It is noteworthy that the latest revision of the 'Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings' released by CDC in June 2007 has included specific recommendations against the use of multi-vial compounds to deal expressly with outbreaks of viral hepatitis.

Guideline 2.2 – BBV infection: precautions for patients with HCV/HIV

We recommend that dedicated machines are not required for patients infected with HCV and HIV, provided cleaning and disinfection procedures are strictly adhered to between patients (KDIGO Hepatitis C guidelines) (1D).

There is no evidence to support the use of dedicated dialysis machines for patients infected with HCV. Transmission of HCV through internal pathways of modern single-pass dialysis machines has not been demonstrated (KDIGO Hepatitis C Guidelines 3.1). Transmission would require the virion to cross the intact dialyser membrane, migrate from the drain tubing to the fresh dialysate circuit and pass through the dialyzer membrane of a second patient, although the virus cannot cross the intact membrane. Even in the event of a blood leak, transmission would require HCV to reach fresh dialysate used for a subsequent patient and enter the blood compartment of that patient through back-filtration across the dialyser membrane. This very low theoretical risk of HCV transmission via the haemodialysis circuit could be eliminated altogether by using double transducer protectors for patients who are HCV positive. In isolated cases of HCV transmission a role for the dialysis circuit could not be excluded, but the environmental surfaces are more likely to have contributed to transmission. We therefore do not recommend the use of dedicated dialysis machines for individuals infected with HCV.

We do not suggest isolation of HCV-infected patients during HD is strictly necessary to prevent direct or indirect transmission of HCV. However, given the low prevalence of HCV in dialysis patients, it would be reasonable for individual units to consider isolating patients who are HCV RNA positive, if facilities are available. This should not be at the expense of rigorous universal infection control procedures.

Given the low likelihood of patient-to-patient and/or patient-to-staff transmission of HIV, dedicated machines for HIV-positive patients undergoing haemodialysis is not recommended. Strict adherence to universal infection control procedures can avoid the risk of HIV transmission in haemodialysis patients, although the evidence is limited.

### Stage of chronic kidney disease predicts seroconversion after hepatitis B immunization: earlier is better [^111iS8mq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a concern in dialysis populations, and vaccination programs have been less successful than those in the general population. Reasons for poor response include malnutrition, uremia, and the generalized immunosuppressive state of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This prospective cohort study evaluated factors impacting on the effectiveness of a vaccination program before dialysis therapy initiation, including level of kidney function.

Methods

All patients receiving care in the Kidney Function Clinic (St Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada) were screened for previous HBV infection or vaccination. Those who were marker negative were administered a standardized hepatitis B vaccination schedule recommended for patients with CKD. The primary outcome measure, seroconversion, is defined as hepatitis B surface antibody titer greater than 10 IU 3 months after completion of the vaccination schedule.

Results

The study population of 165 patients included 64% men with a mean age of 60 years, mean serum creatinine level of 3.4 ± 1.5 mg/dL (300 ± 133 micromol/L), and median estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 20 mL/min (interquartile range, 14 to 20). Seroconversion rate was 82%. Multivariate analyses showed the independent predictive value of level of GFR. The model showed that patients with the lowest level of kidney function and who were older and had diabetes were less likely to seroconvert (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

This is the largest study to show in a well-characterized cohort that patients with higher GFR levels are more likely to respond to hepatitis B vaccination programs with seroconversion, independent of other factors. Future studies will explore specific mechanisms to explain this phenomenon.

Guideline 3.4 – BBV infection: management of patients who do not consent for BBV testing

We suggest that patients who do not consent to BBV surveillance as described above should have dialysis in a segregated area unless they are known to be HBV immune in the previous 6 months. If patients who are known to be HBV immune in the previous 6 months do not consent to BBV surveillance then they should be managed in the same way as patients with HCV infection (see section 4) (2C).

Audit Measure 3: What proportion of prevalent dialysis patients are known to be immune to HBV (anti HBs > 10 mU/mL within the last year). Of the remainder, what proportion has a HBsAg test result from within the last 3 calendar months?

Audit Measure 4: The proportion of incident patients starting regular hospital haemodialysis who have anti HBs antibody titre > 10mIU/mL.

Rationale (for 3.1–3.4)

BBV infections are asymptomatic in the majority of individuals and therefore a surveillance system is required to detect new BBV infection and implement measures to limit the opportunity for nosocomial spread. The frequency of surveillance testing should be determined in part by patient specific risk factors, the local prevalence and incidence of infection. The UK is a low prevalence country for BBV infection in patients with.

Established renal failure and so surveillance can be less frequent than in higher risk countries. Surveillance needs to be enhanced if the patient's overall risk is high or if the individual patient experiences an event that increases the risk. Our previous guidelines have recommended patients on regular hospital haemodialysis who are immune to hepatitis B infection (annual anti HBs antibody titre > 100 mIU/ml) only need to be tested for HBsAg once a year. However, antibody titres can fall over time, leading some patients to become unprotected. In a US study, 8% of chronic haemodialysis patients became unprotected due to a fall in antibody titres over a 12 month period. For this reason, we recommend testing this group of patients on a 6 monthly basis.

### Transmission of hepatitis C virus in the dialysis setting and strategies for its prevention [^117PRkg8]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is more common among hemodialysis patients than the general population and transmission of HCV in dialysis clinics has been reported. In the context of the increased morbidity and mortality associated with HCV infection in the end stage renal disease population, it is important that dialysis clinics have processes in place for ensuring recommended infection control practices, including Standard Precautions, through regular audits and training of the staff. This review will summarize the epidemiology of HCV infection and risk factors for HCV transmission among hemodialysis patients. In addition, the proper protocols are required to investigate suspected cases of HCV transmission in dialysis facilities and recommendations for prevention of HCV transmission in will be reviewed.
