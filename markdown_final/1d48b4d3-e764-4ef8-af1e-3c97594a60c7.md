## Question

Colic abdominal discomfort after eating

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing colicky abdominal discomfort after eating. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the symptom terminology and distinguishing colic from cramping pain. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis by organ system and mechanism, including functional, structural, motility, and post-surgical causes. Next, I will review red flags and the initial diagnostic workup, followed by targeted testing based on suspected etiologies. After that, I need to outline management strategies tailored to the underlying cause, including diet, medications, and procedural options. Finally, I should consider special populations and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check each step against current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. Colicky abdominal discomfort typically refers to intermittent, crampy pain that comes in waves, often reflecting increased luminal pressure and peristalsis against partial obstruction or visceral hypersensitivity, whereas functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) is recurrent, undulating cramping without red flags or a strong association with defecation, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) requires abdominal pain associated with altered stool form or frequency by Rome IV criteria, so I need to ensure I'm not mislabeling IBS as mere colic or FACP [^112MCvSf] [^114vQ7P2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should build a prioritized differential organized by mechanism. Functional and motility disorders include IBS, functional dyspepsia, FACP, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and abdominophrenic dyssynergia, while structural causes include adhesions, hernias, strictures, gallstones, and post-bariatric complications; malabsorption and maldigestion such as celiac disease, bile acid diarrhea, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency can also present with postprandial pain or cramping, so I need to keep these buckets in mind as I proceed [^114vQ7P2] [^113r8xZ1] [^116dX1bu] [^115bKxNk] [^116i2341].

> Wait, let me verify the red flags and initial assessment so I don't miss an urgent process. I should screen for weight loss, GI bleeding, anemia, fever, nocturnal pain, persistent vomiting, or a family history of IBD or colorectal cancer; on exam I will check for distension, masses, abnormal bowel sounds, rebound or guarding, and perform a digital rectal exam when appropriate, because these findings would pivot me toward urgent imaging or specialty referral rather than empiric functional management [^112QDC5r] [^111Nz5Uz].

> I will now examine the core history elements that sharpen pretest probabilities. Timing relative to meals, meal composition, association with bloating or distension, stool form and frequency, weight change, prior abdominal surgery, and medication use (especially opioids, GLP-1 agonists, or agents that alter motility) are critical; I should also ask about psychosocial stressors and screen for eating disorders when relevant, since these can shape both symptoms and treatment response in disorders of gut–brain interaction [^114bfdyR] [^111mt8sa] [^113r9xnM].

> Next, I should review the first-line diagnostic workup when no red flags are present. Targeted labs can include CBC, CMP, ESR/CRP, celiac serology, and thyroid tests; stool studies for fecal calprotectin or occult blood are reasonable if diarrhea or bleeding is reported; abdominal ultrasound is a low-cost, noninvasive modality to evaluate for gallstones, biliary disease, or masses; I need to ensure I do not over-order advanced imaging or endoscopy in low-risk patients up front [^114bfdyR] [^111Nz5Uz].

> Let me consider IBS carefully, since it is common and often postprandial. Rome IV requires abdominal pain at least one day per week on average over three months, associated with two or more of: change in stool frequency, change in stool form, or pain related to defecation; absence of alarm features supports a clinical diagnosis, and I should remember that postprandial exacerbation is compatible with IBS, particularly IBS-D or IBS-M, and that stress and enteric infection history increase risk [^114vQ7P2] [^114PwBRW].

> But wait, what if the pain is upper abdominal and meal-related without IBS features? Functional dyspepsia presents with bothersome postprandial fullness or early satiety and may include epigastric pain or burning; I should confirm the absence of alarm features and consider that up to 80% report meal-related worsening, and I need to avoid indiscriminate ultrasound unless biliary colic features are present or symptoms are new and concerning [^113qea4V] [^112ZKTRB].

> I should double-check for SIBO when there are risk factors or compatible symptoms. Hydrogen/methane breath testing or small-bowel aspirate can be considered in patients with IBS-like symptoms, risk factors such as prior abdominal surgery or structural lesions, or refractory bloating; recent data suggest abdominal pain immediately after eating and excessive belching or regurgitation may increase the likelihood of a positive test, but I must interpret results in clinical context given test limitations [^113r8xZ1] [^112YcNQ1].

> Let me think about abdominophrenic dyssynergia when visible distension occurs during or right after meals with minimal gas. CT can demonstrate the paradoxical diaphragmatic descent and anterior abdominal wall relaxation; treatment focuses on diaphragmatic breathing and behavioral strategies rather than dietary restriction alone, so I should not misattribute this to excess intestinal gas without considering the viscerosomatic reflex component [^112GuzMN] [^113r8xZ1].

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm not missing an obstruction or adhesion-related problem. Intermittent colicky pain with distension, loud bowel sounds, and occasional vomiting suggests partial small-bowel obstruction; a history of prior abdominal surgery strengthens suspicion, and cross-sectional imaging during an episode can reveal a transition point, though imaging may be normal between episodes, so clinical correlation is key [^116dX1bu] [^1128mSfh].

> I need to ensure I consider post-bariatric complications in the right surgical context. After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, rapid small-bowel emptying can cause early dumping, while late dumping from reactive hypoglycemia occurs 1–3 hours post-meal; internal hernias can cause intermittent colicky pain and warrant a low threshold for laparoscopic exploration when imaging is nondiagnostic, so I should ask about timing relative to meals and any prior bariatric surgery [^1164G49T].

> Let me reconsider malabsorption and maldigestion when diarrhea or steatorrhea accompany cramping. Celiac disease, bile acid diarrhea, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency can mimic IBS-D; targeted testing such as tissue transglutaminase IgA with total IgA, fecal elastase, and consideration of a therapeutic trial of bile acid sequestrants or pancreatic enzymes can be both diagnostic and therapeutic in the right clinical setting [^116i2341].

> Next, I should review management principles for IBS and related functional disorders. Education and reassurance are foundational; dietary strategies include soluble fiber, a structured low-FODMAP approach with dietitian guidance, and attention to meal patterns; pharmacologic options are tailored to predominant symptoms, such as antispasmodics, secretagogues for IBS-C, minimally absorbed antibiotics for IBS-D in selected cases, and central neuromodulators for refractory pain; psychological therapies like CBT or gut-directed hypnotherapy improve symptoms and quality of life, so I should integrate these early when feasible [^114vQ7P2] [^113r9xnM] [^114PwBRW] [^113XfEs6].

> For functional dyspepsia, I should confirm symptom subtype and tailor therapy. Postprandial distress syndrome may respond to dietary modification, acid suppression when epigastric burning is present, and prokinetics such as acotiamide where available; I need to avoid unnecessary cholecystectomy unless biliary colic criteria are met, and I should reassess for overlapping IBS or psychosocial drivers if response is limited [^112ZKTRB].

> If SIBO is suspected or confirmed, I should treat with appropriate antibiotics guided by breath test results and local practice patterns, address underlying motility or structural contributors, and consider dietary strategies to reduce recurrence, recognizing that breath testing has limitations and clinical response should guide ongoing management [^113r8xZ1].

> For abdominophrenic dyssynergia, I should prioritize diaphragmatic breathing retraining and biofeedback rather than restrictive diets; if symptoms persist, I can consider central neuromodulators or brain–gut behavioral therapies, recognizing the strong viscerosomatic component that dietary restriction alone will not correct [^112GuzMN] [^113r8xZ1].

> When obstruction or adhesions are suspected, I should escalate promptly. Acute episodes may require IV fluids, nasogastric decompression, and surgical consultation; elective adhesiolysis may be considered for recurrent, debilitating episodes, and a trial of low-residue or liquid diets can both mitigate symptoms and serve as a supportive diagnostic test in chronic partial obstruction [^116dX1bu] [^1128mSfh].

> For post-bariatric patients with dumping or internal hernia, I should counsel on smaller, lower-glycemic meals, adequate protein, and separation of solids and liquids; for late dumping, acarbose can blunt the carbohydrate surge; for suspected internal hernia with nondiagnostic imaging, I should maintain a low threshold for diagnostic laparoscopy given the risk of volvulus and ischemia [^1164G49T].

> I should double-check medication contributors that can worsen postprandial discomfort. GLP-1 receptor agonists used for obesity or diabetes commonly cause nausea, indigestion, and early satiety; dose titration, smaller and slower meals, and dietary adjustments can mitigate symptoms, and I need to ask explicitly about these agents during medication reconciliation [^116i7HSD].

> Let me first confirm special populations so I don't overgeneralize. In pediatrics, infantile colic is common and usually self-limited; parental education and reassurance are primary, with limited evidence for specific dietary changes; in older adults, I should have a lower threshold for imaging and endoscopy when alarm features or new symptoms are present; in patients with eating disorders, GI symptoms often reflect standard FGIDs but require coordinated care and cautious use of restrictive diets [^111QYvgd] [^111Nz5Uz] [^111mt8sa].

> I will now synthesize a practical algorithm while keeping it flexible. Start with a careful history and exam to screen for red flags; if none are present, obtain targeted labs and consider abdominal ultrasound based on symptoms; if symptoms suggest IBS, apply Rome IV and initiate education, diet, and symptom-targeted therapy; if upper GI symptoms predominate, evaluate for functional dyspepsia and treat accordingly; if bloating with visible distension is prominent, consider abdominophrenic dyssynergia and initiate behavioral therapy; if diarrhea or steatorrhea are present, evaluate for celiac disease, bile acid diarrhea, and pancreatic insufficiency; if intermittent colic with distension or vomiting occurs, consider obstruction or internal hernia and image during symptoms; throughout, reassess in 4–6 weeks and escalate testing or referral if symptoms persist or evolve [^114bfdyR] [^111Nz5Uz] [^114vQ7P2].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to order a CT for any patient with postprandial pain, but I should correct that impulse; routine cross-sectional imaging is not indicated in low-risk patients with functional symptoms, and I should reserve CT for alarm features, persistent or evolving symptoms, or when obstruction or other structural disease is suspected, aligning with guideline-based selective testing [^111Nz5Uz].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses modifiable drivers and follow-up. Shared decision-making about diet, realistic expectations, and early integration of psychological therapies for disorders of gut–brain interaction improve outcomes; I should schedule follow-up to track response, adjust therapy, and remain vigilant for new alarm features that would warrant a change in direction [^114vQ7P2] [^113r9xnM].

Colic abdominal discomfort after eating is most often due to **functional GI disorders** (IBS, functional dyspepsia) [^114vQ7P2] [^113LDsrW], **gallstones** [^111MYfrD], or **gastroparesis** [^114YP3yu], with red flags (weight loss, bleeding, anemia, nocturnal pain) requiring urgent evaluation [^112QDC5r]. Initial workup includes a **focused history, exam, and selective labs/imaging** (CBC, CMP, TSH, celiac serology, abdominal ultrasound) [^114bfdyR]; endoscopy or CT is reserved for alarm features or refractory symptoms [^111Nz5Uz]. Management is cause-specific: dietary changes (low-FODMAP, lactose-free, smaller meals) [^113r8xZ1], antispasmodics, prokinetics, or neuromodulators for IBS/FD [^114vQ7P2]; ursodeoxycholic acid or cholecystectomy for gallstones; dietary modification and prokinetics for gastroparesis [^113r8xZ1]. Persistent or severe symptoms despite initial therapy warrant gastroenterology referral [^112QDC5r].

## Diagnostic approach

### Initial evaluation

- **History**: Characterize pain (location, duration, quality, triggers), associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea, constipation), dietary habits, weight changes, and family history [^114bfdyR].
- **Physical examination**: Assess for abdominal tenderness, distension, masses, and signs of dehydration or malnutrition [^114bfdyR].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CMP, TSH, celiac serology, stool studies (fecal calprotectin, occult blood) as indicated [^114bfdyR].

---

### Imaging studies

Use **ultrasound** as the first-line modality to evaluate for gallstones, biliary obstruction, or pancreatic lesions, and reserve **CT scan** for suspected obstruction, malignancy, or complex cases [^notfound]. Employ **endoscopy** when alarm symptoms are present or when initial studies are inconclusive [^112ZKTRB].

---

## Management strategies

### Dietary modifications

- **Low-FODMAP diet**: Effective for IBS and functional symptoms [^notfound].
- **Lactose-free diet**: For lactose intolerance.
- **Smaller, frequent meals**: Helpful for gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacological treatments

- **Antispasmodics**: Hyoscine, dicyclomine for IBS and functional pain [^114vQ7P2].
- **Prokinetics**: Metoclopramide, domperidone for gastroparesis [^notfound].
- **Neuromodulators**: Amitriptyline, SSRIs for functional GI disorders [^114vQ7P2].
- **Pancreatic enzymes**: For exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^116i2341].

---

### Surgical interventions

Surgical options include **cholecystectomy** for symptomatic gallstones and surgical management for **obstruction** or refractory structural disease [^116dX1bu].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation

- **Weight loss**
- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**
- **Anemia**
- **Nocturnal pain**
- **Persistent vomiting**
- **Family history of GI malignancy** [^111Nz5Uz]

---

Colic abdominal discomfort after eating is most often due to functional GI disorders, gallstones, or gastroparesis, with a structured history, exam, and selective testing guiding diagnosis. Management is **tailored to the cause**, with dietary changes, medications, and surgery for refractory cases.

Mechanisms of Complications

The rise in the number of RYGB procedures has also increased the absolute number of complications associated with this procedure even though the percentage of patients with complications has reduced due to better surgical experience.

Postprandial hypoglycaemia, even in patients who never had type 2 diabetes, can occur several hours after a meal and is distinct from early dumping syndrome which occurs within minutes after eating. Early dumping is an outcome of rapid emptying of food into the jejunum due to the lack of a pylorus presumably causing neural activation in the proximal alimentary limb. Late dumping, or 'postprandial hypoglycaemia', happens 1–3 h after ingesting a meal and is a result of the exaggerated insulin response to high glycaemic index carbohydrates in the meal. The proposed mechanisms involve increased β-cell mass and improved β-cell function and non-β-cell mechanisms, which may include a lack of ghrelin (a counter-regulatory measure to hypoglycaemia). In addition, the sustained weight loss can reduce insulin resistance which renders the previous insulin responses needed pre-surgery to suddenly become excessive. The aetiology of hypoglycaemia is likely to be different for individual patients and is also probably a mixture of the anatomic, hormonal and metabolic changes after RYGB. Although treatment of this complication can be difficult, pancreatectomies are no longer advised, but rather a multimodal medical approach is favoured.

Unexplained Abdominal Pain

Up to 10% of the patients complain of unexplained chronic abdominal pain which can be difficult for both the treating clinician and patient to acknowledge. Mild abdominal pain is reported by up to 95% of patients at some point after RYGB. Symptom severity fluctuates between vague discomfort and severe colicky pain. Vomiting and nausea, especially if prolonged, are symptoms of pathology and are not part of the normal postoperative course after RYGB; nonetheless, up to 80% of patients report the symptoms at some point after surgery. Abdominal pain may be recurrent, and it should be remembered that internal hernias may spontaneously reduce causing intermittent pain. Early investigation when acute symptoms of abdominal pain first presents is mandatory due to the risk of obstruction, volvulus and ischaemia of the herniated bowel. Cross-sectional imaging is often unhelpful and the use of laparoscopy is frequently required for diagnosis. Management protocols for chronic unexplained abdominal pain are not clearly defined, but the jejunal-jejunal anastomosis is currently receiving more attention as a possible cause for these chronic problems.

Irritable bowel syndrome often appears following gastrointestinal infection and is marked by diarrhea, dysbiosis, fever, and intestinal pain following eating. A recent study by Aguilera-Lizarraga et al. now demonstrates that a breakdown in intestinal immunotolerance sparks an inflammatory response to typically tolerated food antigens and causes visceral pain.

### Review: management of postprandial diarrhea syndrome [^116i2341]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Unexpected, urgent, sometimes painful bowel movements after eating are common complaints among adults. Without a clear etiology, if pain is present and resolves with the movements, this is usually labeled "irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea" based solely on symptoms. If this symptom-based approach is applied exclusively, it may lead physicians not to consider treatable conditions: celiac disease, or maldigestion due to bile acid malabsorption, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, or an a-glucosidase (sucrase, glucoamylase, maltase, or isomaltase) deficiency. These conditions can be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea (or functional diarrhea, if pain is not present). Limited testing is currently available to confirm these conditions (antibody screens for celiac disease; fecal fat as a surrogate marker for pancreatic function). Therefore, empirical treatment with alpha amylase, pancreatic enzymes, or a bile acid-binding agent may simultaneously treat these patients and serve as a surrogate diagnostic test. This review will summarize the current evidence for bile acid malabsorption, and deficiencies of pancreatic enzymes or a-glucosidases as potential causes for postprandial diarrhea, and provide an algorithm for treatment options.

The straightforward management of this condition relays on dietary restriction avoiding the offending foodstuff, but this is cumbersome and in the long run may result unpractical. Disentangling the conditioned behavior may be a better strategy. Currently, deconditioning of these patients may be achieved focussing on the somatic mechanism of distension by biofeedback; however, the identification of the specific origin of conditioning and the triggering factor would allow a more selective and effective alternative.

Review of currently available guidelines, recommendations and algorithms

A number of groups have provided recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of constipation;, however, no standardized treatment guidelines have gained acceptance in general medical practice. Although the evidence for a number of interventions (including modifications to diet and lifestyle) is weak or contradictory, all the guidelines recommend that these be tried before pharmacological intervention. In general, where treatment pathways are recommended, the sequence is:

Exclude other pathologies and secondary causes.,
Begin treatment with dietary and lifestyle adjustments.,
Move to osmotic laxatives, stool softeners and bulk-forming agents – there is no consensus on the order in which these should be tried.
Move to stimulant laxatives, suppositories and/or enemas,– some guidelines recommend medical supervision at this stage.
Surgery should be used as a last resort or to treat identified disorders that require surgical correction.

Although prokinetic agents feature in the two sets of US guidelines (Grade A recommendation), these are now out of date. Tegaserod has now been limited to emergency use in the US and has not received licensing approval in the EU. Prucalopride has recently received EU approval for the treatment of chronic constipation in women in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief; this is not mentioned in the guidelines.

Once organic disorders and obstructions have been excluded, a functional bowel disorder is the most likely explanation for the constipation. Most patients with chronic constipation report minimal abdominal bloating or discomfort associated with their other symptoms of chronic constipation; however, in some patients, as symptoms often overlap, it may be difficult to distinguish chronic constipation and IBS-C. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Chronic Constipation Task Force defined IBS-C as clinically important abdominal discomfort associated with symptoms of constipation. National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for IBS indicate a positive diagnosis only if the person has abdominal pain/discomfort that is either relieved by defecation, or associated with altered bowel frequency or stool form, and at least two of the following: altered stool passage; abdominal bloating, distension, tension, or hardness, symptoms made worse by eating and passage of mucus.

CAUSES OF FACP

Statement:

The causes of FACP in FGIDs are unclear but are probably multifactorial.

Comments

Although there is little information on the causes of FACP, it is the consensus view of the panel that mechanisms that underlie these symptoms are probably similar to those reported for the IBS spectrum. As in IBS, FACP, which may be peripherally and/or centrally mediated, may result from an interplay between psychological stress (leading to a dysregulated gut-brain interaction), mucosal immunity (immune activation resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation), visceral hypersensitivity, dysbiosis, and gut dysmotility (Fig. 1).–The susceptibility of individuals to FACP and their experience of symptoms may depend on both genetic predisposition and external aggravators.

FIGURE 1
Current understanding of the pathophysiology of abdominal pain in functional gastrointestinal disorders. A peripheral signal is a prerequisite, that is, the pain is not merely a psychological event. This signal may originate from the intestinal contents (food or gas) or from changes in gastrointestinal motility and sensitivity; the latter may be altered by stress. To be recognized by the individual, the signal must overcome some thresholds: sensation within the gut wall, spinal synapsis, and — to be experienced as "uncomfortable" — the affective rating (the latter again being impacted by stress). Gut wall sensation and spinal synapsis may be lowered by the microbiota and anticipation or chronicity, respectively.

Data in FGIDs indicate that one of the most important external factors affecting gastrointestinal function and symptoms, including FACP, is stress.–Although it is beyond the scope of this article to review this topic, there is evidence that stress promotes delayed gastric emptying and accelerated colonic transit, and that the stress response in the gut is mediated, largely, by corticotropin-releasing factor and its downstream signaling pathways.

Gastrointestinal function and symptoms can also be affected by eating habits and food intake. Although it is currently unknown whether FACP itself relates directly to eating patterns and/or the ingestion of specific trigger foods or food components, it is worth noting that, in many patients with IBS-related abdominal pain, diet and nutrition seem to have some role in evoking and sustaining the low-grade inflammation in the abdominal tissues and in altering the gut microbiota.

### Reduced crying in term infants fed high β-palmitate formula: a double-blind randomized clinical trial [^116uVCCP]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Crying is a basic, instinctive response governed by basic neuro-chemical mechanisms that are similar to those that control feeding. Although crying is a common spontaneous behavior, it can induce parental concern, which often results in requests for assistance from health services. Most infants follow a universal crying pattern during the first few months of life, in which crying peaks at 6 weeks of age and then declines until 3 months of age. Crying also has a typical diurnal pattern: 40% of crying episodes occur between 1600 and 2200 h, and after the third month of life, crying episodes are more distributed throughout the day. Infant crying is usually believed to be related to abdominal discomfort, whereas crying for more than 3 hours per day (cumulative), without relation to a medical problem, is termed infantile colic. The prevalence of abdominal discomfort, colic, and their associated potential effects demonstrates the importance of identifying determinants of infant crying behavior, particularly for determinants that can be modified (e.g. feeding choice).

### A 7-year-old boy with recurring episodes of abdominal pain [^113vnKCh]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Recurrent abdominal pain is a relatively common complaint in children who present to the emergency department. The etiology is often thought to be psychogenic, with an underlying organic cause present in less than 10% of patients. Intermittent ureteropelvic junction obstruction is usually not considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent acute abdominal pain in children, which can cause a significant delay in diagnosis. In this condition, intermittent obstruction of the flow of urine from the renal pelvis to the proximal ureter occurs, which causes intermittent acute colicky abdominal pain and vomiting. This acute event, often referred to as a Dietl's crisis, either subsides after several hours or prompts a visit to the emergency department. Management often focuses on the identification of psychosocial issues or constipation, and routine abdominal imaging is not a common practice. The frequency of these events over time and the duration of each acute event are 2 components that factor into determining the loss of function in the affected kidney. The purpose of this case report is to increase awareness of intermittent ureteropelvic junction obstruction as a cause of recurring episodes of acute abdominal pain in children. Emphasis in this case report is on Dietl's crisis, how it presents, and how it is diagnosed and managed.

### Infantile colic: new insights into an old problem [^113nyX14]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Infant colic is a characteristic group of behaviors seen in young infants. The most prominent feature is prolonged crying. Additional characteristics, including clenching of the fists and flexion of the hips, have led to the suggestion that these behaviors are related to abdominal discomfort. In this article, we show emerging evidence to support the concept that infant colic could represent gut inflammation and microbial dysbiosis that impacts brain function and even brain development.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^116UPRpu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is needed in order to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article will discuss some of these diagnoses, including can't miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

### The abdominal wall: an overlooked source of pain [^111WSypB]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

When abdominal pain is chronic and unremitting, with minimal or no relationship to eating or bowel function but often a relationship to posture (i.e., lying, sitting, standing), the abdominal wall should be suspected as the source of pain. Frequently, a localized, tender trigger point can be identified, although the pain may radiate over a diffuse area of the abdomen. If tenderness is unchanged or increased when abdominal muscles are tensed (positive Carnett's sign), the abdominal wall is the likely origin of pain. Most commonly, abdominal wall pain is related to cutaneous nerve root irritation or myofascial irritation. The pain can also result from structural conditions, such as localized endometriosis or rectus sheath hematoma, or from incisional or other abdominal wall hernias. If hernia or structural disease is excluded, injection of a local anesthetic with or without a corticosteroid into the pain trigger point can be diagnostic and therapeutic.

### Evaluation and management of intestinal obstruction [^116dX1bu]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Acute intestinal obstruction occurs when there is an interruption in the forward flow of intestinal contents. This interruption can occur at any point along the length of the gastrointestinal tract, and clinical symptoms often vary based on the level of obstruction. Intestinal obstruction is most commonly caused by intra-abdominal adhesions, malignancy, or intestinal herniation. The clinical presentation generally includes nausea and emesis, colicky abdominal pain, and a failure to pass flatus or bowel movements. The classic physical examination findings of abdominal distension, tympany to percussion, and high-pitched bowel sounds suggest the diagnosis. Radiologic imaging can confirm the diagnosis, and can also serve as useful adjunctive investigations when the diagnosis is less certain. Although radiography is often the initial study, non-contrast computed tomography is recommended if the index of suspicion is high or if suspicion persists despite negative radiography. Management of uncomplicated obstructions includes fluid resuscitation with correction of metabolic derangements, intestinal decompression, and bowel rest. Evidence of vascular compromise or perforation, or failure to resolve with adequate bowel decompression is an indication for surgical intervention.

### The effect of CFTR modulators on a cystic fibrosis patient presenting with recurrent pancreatitis in the absence of respiratory symptoms: a case report [^115ULGQG]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 24-year-old white male with past medical history of recurrent acute pancreatitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and obesity presented for evaluation following a referral from an outside hospital after a 3-week hospitalization due to refractory acute pancreatitis. The patient reported gastrointestinal symptoms including colicky discomfort and reflux as a teenager that evolved into sharp, severe abdominal pain requiring over 20 hospitalizations for pancreatitis in the last 10 years. Hospitalizations for recurrent acute pancreatitis ranged in severity from multi-day hospitalizations for pain management, anti-emetic therapy, bowel rest, and supportive care to one- and two-day hospitalizations where symptoms severity was less intense; less severe episodes that did not require hospitalization were also increasingly common. With the initial episodes, alcohol use increased the likelihood of symptoms occurring, but complete abstinence for the last two years did not alter the likelihood of recurrence. While episodes occurred initially every 6–12 months, the frequency increased over recent years to approximately every 3 months. He denied episodes correlated to diet, but alcohol use did increase the frequency of pancreatitis events. Prior ultrasound and computed tomography imaging for pancreatitis ruled out gallstones or anatomical etiologies. The patient was treated with proton-pump inhibitors and avoided spicy foods and alcohol with minimal resolution of symptom severity or frequency.

### Do the digestive tract symptoms in eating disorder patients represent functional gastrointestinal disorders? [^115u9Z7o]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common in patients with eating disorders. The aim of this study was to determine, using factor analysis, whether these GI symptom factors (clusters) in eating disorder patients hold true to the Rome II classification of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs).

Methods

Inpatients in a specialised eating disorder unit completed the Rome II questionnaire. Data from 185 patients were analysed using factor analysis of 17 questions cited as present in 30% to 70% of the patients.

Results

Five factors emerged accounting for 68% of the variance and these were termed: 'oesophageal discomfort', 'bowel dysfunction', 'abdominal discomfort', 'pelvic floor dysfunction', and 'self-induced vomiting'. These factors are significantly related to the Rome II FGID categories of functional oesophageal, bowel and anorectal disorders, and to the specific FGIDs of IBS, functional abdominal bloating, functional constipation and pelvic floor dyssynergia. Both heartburn and chest pain were included in the oesophageal discomfort factor. The 'pelvic floor dysfunction' factor was distinct from functional constipation.

Conclusions

The GI symptoms common in eating disorder patients very likely represent the same FGIDs that occur in non-ED patients. Symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction in the absence of functional constipation, however, are prominent in eating disorder patients. Further investigation of the items comprising the 'pelvic floor dysfunction' factor in other patient populations may yield useful results.

### Global prevalence and burden of meal-related abdominal pain [^111MviHR]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Within the study sample, we aimed to identify and characterize subjects with meal-related abdominal pain. We identified participants who reported experiencing abdominal pain by selecting respondents who did not answer "Never" on the question "In the last 3 months, how often did you experience pain anywhere in your abdomen?" The GI symptom assessed in this question is referred to here as "general abdominal pain". Among the subjects who reported general abdominal pain, we focused on how frequently the general abdominal pain was meal-related. Participants reporting general abdominal pain were asked a second question: "How often did your pain start or get worse after eating a meal?" Answers were scored from 0% of the time with pain to 100% of the time with pain on an 11-point scale (10% steps, with no response options in between). Respondents were then categorized into three subgroups of meal-related abdominal pain: the "no" meal-related abdominal pain group (0% of the abdominal pain episodes were meal-related), the "occasional" meal-related abdominal pain group (10–40% of the abdominal pain episodes were meal-related), and the "frequent" meal-related abdominal pain group (≥ 50% of the abdominal pain episodes were meal-related). We used these specific cutoffs of the frequency of meal-related abdominal pain to make the variable more comprehendible, which makes the interpretation of results more relatable to daily life.

Questionnaires

DGBI diagnoses

The Adult Rome IV Diagnostic Questionnaire and a self-reported checklist of organic diseases and surgeries that can cause GI symptoms were used to diagnose DGBI in the global study population. Participants with a self-reported history that could represent organic or structural reasons for their symptoms were excluded from all the Rome IV DGBI diagnoses. Subjects with a history of peptic ulcer disease were excluded from the esophageal, gastroduodenal, and biliary diagnoses; participants who reported diverticulitis or bowel resection were excluded from the bowel and anorectal diagnoses; and subjects reporting celiac disease, GI cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) were excluded from all Rome IV DGBI diagnoses.

### Polyethylene glycol-3350 and electrolytes (Gavilyte g) [^112b4m53]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

How should I take GaviLyte-G?

You must read, understand, and follow these instructions to take GaviLyte-G the right way.

Take GaviLyte-G exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take it.
See the "Instructions for Use" on the bottle label for instructions on how to mix, take or give Gavilyte-G.
Do not take undissolved GaviLyte-G powder that has not been mixed with water (diluted), it may increase your risk of nausea, vomiting and fluid loss (dehydration).
Do not take other laxatives while taking Gavilyte-G.
Drink reconstituted solution at a rate of 8 ounces (240 ml) every 10 minutes. Rapid drinking of each portion is better than drinking small amounts.
Do not eat or drink anything colored red or purple.
Do not eat solid foods at least 2 hours before taking Gavilyte-G. You may eat a light breakfast 2 hours before taking Gavilyte-G. For best results, do not consume solid food for 3 to 4 hours before drinking Gavilyte-G.
Drink only water and clear liquids:
the day before your colonoscopy
while taking Gavilyte-G
after taking Gavilyte-G until 2 hours before your colonoscopy.
Drink clear liquids before, during, and after you take Gavilyte-G to avoid fluid loss (dehydrated). Examples of clear liquids are:
water
clear broth
clear fruit juices without pulp including apple, white grape, or white cranberry
clear soda
strained limeade or lemonade
gelatin (without added fruit or topping)
coffee or tea (Do not use any dairy or non-dairy creamer)
popsicles without pieces of fruit or fruit pulp
You may experience some abdominal bloating and distention before the bowels start to move. If severe discomfort or distention occur, slow or temporarily stop (discontinue) drinking the solution and contact your healthcare provider.
The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after you start drinking the solution.
Continue drinking until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter.

### Gastrointestinal trichobezoars in the pediatric population: a retrospective study [^111YL4TW]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The symptoms and physical signs were based on the size and location of the trichobezoar and the presence of complications. In the early stage, most patients may be asymptomatic. That is, they do not experience pathological signs or symptoms. If the size increases, the patient may experience abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bloating, early satiety, weight loss, hematemesis, diarrhea, and constipation. As obstruction progresses, post prandial vomiting and colicky abdominal pain may occur. In our series, the most common presenting signs and symptoms were abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and palpable abdominal mass. In children with explicit hair eating, symptoms usually appear after 1–6 years. The symptoms of patients with gastric trichobezoars can be significantly relieved after vomiting and fasting and can be aggravated after eating. According to other reports, the major complications included stomach or intestinal perforation, intussusception, volvulus, obstructive jaundice, protein-losing enteropathy, pancreatitis, and even mortality. In this study, three cases of intestinal trichobezoars were complicated with small intestinal obstruction, and the symptoms were abdominal pain and biliary vomiting. However, there were no other serious complications.

A history of hair eating or presence of hair in the vomit or feces is commonly helpful in diagnosing trichobezoar. Lack of a proper data on medical history may affect the identification of a preoperative diagnosis. In our series, the parents of some patients (n = 15) provided us with data regarding a history of hair eating or presence of hair in the vomit or feces. Therefore, the possibility of trichobezoar should be considered initially. However, the diagnosis of trichobezoar is still dependent on abdominal radiological examinations.

Gastroscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing gastric trichobezoar. Under gastroscopy, direct observation is possible to obtain a clear diagnosis. However, it may not confirm the presence of a co-existing Rapunzel syndrome duo to a large mass, nor is it suitable for intestinal trichobezoar.

### Dietary modifications for infantile colic [^114kGb7F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Infantile colic is typically defined as full-force crying for at least three hours per day, on at least three days per week, for at least three weeks. This condition appears to be more frequent in the first six weeks of life (prevalence range of 17% to 25%), depending on the specific location reported and definitions used, and it usually resolves by three months of age. The aetiopathogenesis of infantile colic is unclear but most likely multifactorial. A number of psychological, behavioural and biological components (food hypersensitivity, allergy or both; gut microflora and dysmotility) are thought to contribute to its manifestation. The role of diet as a component in infantile colic remains controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects of dietary modifications for reducing colic in infants less than four months of age.

Search Methods

In July 2018 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 17 other databases and 2 trials registers. We also searched Google, checked and handsearched references and contacted study authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating the effects of dietary modifications, alone or in combination, for colicky infants younger than four months of age versus another intervention or placebo. We used specific definitions for colic, age of onset and the methods for performing the intervention. We defined 'modified diet' as any diet altered to include or exclude certain components.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was duration of crying, and secondary outcomes were response to intervention, frequency of crying episodes, parental/family quality of life, infant sleep duration, parental satisfaction and adverse effects.

Main Results

We included 15 RCTs involving 1121 infants (balanced numbers of boys and girls) aged 2 to 16 weeks. All studies were small and at high risk of bias across multiple design factors (e.g. selection, attrition). The studies covered a wide range of dietary interventions, and there was limited scope for meta-analysis. Using the GRADE approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. Low-allergen maternal diet versus a diet containing known potential allergens: one study (90 infants) found that 35/47 (74%) of infants responded to a low-allergen maternal diet, compared with 16/43 (37%) of infants on a diet containing known potential allergens. Low-allergen diet or soy milk formula versus dicyclomine hydrochloride: one study (120 infants) found that 10/15 (66.6%) breastfed babies responded to dicyclomine hydrochloride, compared with 24/45 (53.3%) formula-fed babies. There was little difference in response between breastfed babies whose mother changed their diet (10/16; 62.5%) and babies who received soy milk formula (29/44; 65.9%). Hydrolysed formula versus standard formula: two studies (64 infants) found no difference in duration of crying, reported as a dichotomous outcome: risk ratio 2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 5.10; very low-quality evidence. The author of one study confirmed there were no adverse effects. One study (43 infants) reported a greater reduction in crying time postintervention with hydrolysed formula (104 min/d, 95% CI 55 to 155) than with standard formula (3 min/d, 95% CI -63 to 67). Hydrolysed formula versus another hydrolysed formula: one study (22 infants) found that two types of hydrolysed formula were equally effective in resolving symptoms for babies who commenced with standard formula (Alimentum reduced crying to 2.21 h/d (standard deviation (SD) 0.40) and Nutramigen to 2.93 h/d (SD 0.70)). Hydrolysed formula or dairy- and soy-free maternal diet versus addition of parental education or counselling: one study (21 infants) found that crying time decreased to 2.03 h/d (SD 1.03) in the hydrolysed or dairy- and soy-free group compared with 1.08 h/d (SD 0.7) in the parent education or counselling group, nine days into the intervention. Partially hydrolysed, lower lactose, whey-based formulae containing oligosaccharide versus standard formula with simethicone: one study (267 infants) found that both groups experienced a decrease in colic episodes (secondary outcome) after seven days (partially hydrolysed formula: from 5.99 episodes (SD 1.84) to 2.47 episodes (SD 1.94); standard formula: from 5.41 episodes (SD 1.88) to 3.72 episodes (SD 1.98)). After two weeks the difference between the two groups was significant (partially hydrolysed: 1.76 episodes (SD 1.60); standard formula: 3.32 episodes (SD 2.06)). The study author confirmed there were no adverse effects. Lactase enzyme supplementation versus placebo: three studies (138 infants) assessed this comparison, but none reported data amenable to analysis for any outcome. There were no adverse effects in any of the studies. Extract of Foeniculum vulgare, Matricariae recutita, and Melissa officinalis versus placebo: one study (93 infants) found that average daily crying time was lower for infants given the extract (76.9 min/d (SD 23.5), than infants given placebo (169.9 min/d (SD 23.1), at the end of the one-week study. There were no adverse effects. Soy protein-based formula versus standard cows' milk protein-based formula: one study (19 infants) reported a mean crying time of 12.7 h/week (SD 16.4) in the soy formula group versus 17.3 h/week (SD 6.9) in the standard cows' milk group, and that 5/10 (50%) responded in the soy formula group versus 0/9 (0%) in the standard cows' milk group. Soy protein formula with polysaccharide versus standard soy protein formula: one study (27 infants) assessed this comparison but did not provide disaggregated data for the number of responders in each group after treatment. No study reported on our secondary outcomes of parental or family quality of life, infant sleep duration per 24 h, or parental satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently, evidence of the effectiveness of dietary modifications for the treatment of infantile colic is sparse and at significant risk of bias. The few available studies had small sample sizes, and most had serious limitations. There were insufficient studies, thus limiting the use of meta-analysis. Benefits reported for hydrolysed formulas were inconsistent. Based on available evidence, we are unable to recommend any intervention. Future studies of single interventions, using clinically significant outcome measures, and appropriate design and power are needed.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^112GuzMN]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Abdominophrenic dyssynergia (APD) — pathophysiology and clinical features: APD is a "paradoxical viscerosomatic reflex response" characterized by a compensatory pattern in which "the diaphragm paradoxically contracts (goes down), and the anterior abdominal wall muscles relax, leading to increased abdominal girth". Computed tomography (CT) scans "demonstrate the APD response even with small increases in intraluminal gas (approximately 10%)", and, in contrast to severe intestinal dysmotility, patients there "do not exhibit an APD pattern". For many patients, "the APD distention occurs during or immediately after a meal".

### Derivation and identification of questions that act as predictors of abdominal pain of musculoskeletal origin [^1126sLNk]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Although most causes of abdominal pain have a visceral origin, the musculoskeletal system must be considered when the cause is not obvious. This prospective study aimed to identify questions that would aid the diagnosis of patients with abdominal pain of musculoskeletal origin.

Design

Assessment of consecutive patients with abdominal pain recruited from gastroenterological outpatient clinics to develop diagnostic pointers to identify abdominal pain arising from musculoskeletal disorders.

Participants

Subjects with benign abdominal pain, with or without a change in bowel habit, were recruited from gastroenterological clinics. Patients with inflammatory or neoplastic disease were excluded.

Setting

The study was conducted in the Physiotherapy Department, Addenbrooke's NHS Trust Hospital, Cambridge.

Main Outcome Measures

A set of questions developed to indicate a musculoskeletal cause of a patient's abdominal symptoms. RESULTS The questions 'Does taking a deep breath aggravate your symptoms?' and 'Does twisting your back aggravate your symptoms?' had a significant positive indication of abdominal symptoms of musculoskeletal origin. The questions 'Has there been any change in bowel habit since onset of your symptoms?', 'Does eating foods aggravate your symptoms?' and 'Has there been any weight change since onset of symptoms?' had a significant negative indication for abdominal symptoms not of musculoskeletal origin. A combination of these questions gave 96% specificity and 67% sensitivity.

Conclusion

These questions may help with the early identification of patients with abdominal pain of musculoskeletal origin and will be tested in further studies.

### Severe colic mimicking intussusception: a new phenomenon [^1162T42Y]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Constipation is by far the commonest cause of abdominal pain. However, the pain associated with constipation is usually chronic in nature and never presents with acute episodes of severe abdominal colic that warrants urgent attention. Rectal faecal impaction may present with severe pain, but is readily excluded by PR examination. In 1981, we reported a case of severe abdominal pain diagnosed clinically and radiologically as intussusception, but it proved during exploration to be a case of impacted caecal faecalith. This has prompted us to think twice before labelling patients with severe abdominal colic as intussusception before excluding faecal impaction at the caecum and terminal ileum. The pathognomonic clinical presentation in this group of patients is severe abdominal colic with screaming and contorting. No analgesic or anticholinergic have had any effect on alleviating these episodes of severe colicky pain. Many of the parents questioned our working diagnosis as simply related to caecal impaction, but were pleased to see the dramatic response to enemas. The explanation might be related to the fact that the faecalith at the terminal ileum and/or caecum acts as intermittent bowel obstruction causing the bouts of abdominal colic. The mass that was palpable in three patients at the right iliac fossa is different from the classic intussusception where the right iliac fossa is empty and mass felt at right subhepatic area or epigastrium. The fresh bleeding that was encountered in two of our patients may be related to the mechanical effect of the hard stool against the bowel mucosa. As far as we can ascertain, we have not come across any similar pathology in the literature. We hope that highlighting this condition will attract attention among doctors towards this new phenomenon, thus avoiding unnecessary investigation and/or surgery.

### Abdominal distension after eating lettuce: the role of intestinal gas evaluated in vitro and by abdominal CT imaging [^116gcpJx]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

2.2.1 Participants

Twelve women (age range 24‐58 years) who complained of abdominal distension after eating lettuce participated in the study. Only patients who reported episodes of visible distension related to ingestion of lettuce in contrast to basal periods with mild or no distension were included in the study. The entry criteria required lettuce as the primary offending foodstuff, regardless that other green leafy vegetables could have a deleterious effect as well. All patients had a functional disorder diagnosis based on Rome III criteria 12: 8 functional bloating (7.1 ± 0.5 bowel movements per week; 3.2 ± 0.3 score on the Bristol stool form scale) and four constipation‐predominant irritable bowel syndrome (2.2 ± 0.3 bowel movements per week, 2.0 ± 0.4 Bristol score). Symptom duration was 6 ± 4 years.

The study protocol had been previously approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Hospital Vall d'Hebron, and all subjects gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. This study is an exploratory arm of a larger study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01205100) involving a subset of patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria described above, and hence, no power calculation was performed; data on abdominal CT imaging have not been previously published.

2.2.2 Experimental procedure

After having recognized lettuce as the reproducible offending meal, ie patients knew that eating lettuce would give them abdominal distension, two visits were scheduled within a 2‐day interval: patients were instructed to report in the laboratory (a) during fasting when they felt minimal or no abdominal distension (basal conditions), (b) and within 1 hour after eating the offending foodstuff (lettuce salad dressed at taste). During each condition (basal and distension) the subjective sensation of abdominal distension and abdominal girth were measured, and a CT scan was taken, as detailed below. Afterward, patients were offered a biofeedback treatment to correct abdominal distension.

2.2.3 Subjective sensation of abdominal distension

The patient's subjective sensation of abdominal distension was measured on a 6‐score graphic rating scale graded from 0 (no distension) to 6 (extremely severe distension).

### Rumination syndrome: pathophysiology, diagnosis and practical management [^117Pq1jC]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology

Studies have shown that following the ingestion of food or fluids, patients with rumination syndrome frequently subconsciously and habitually contract their intercostal and anterior abdominal muscles. Contraction of the intercostal muscles results in costal expansion, while contraction of abdominal muscles including the rectus sheath and internal and external obliques increases intra-abdominal pressure. In conjunction with this, the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) relaxes. This is a reversal of the normal gastro-oesophageal pressure profile where at rest, intragastric pressure is normally low and LOS pressure is high. These resultant pressure changes result in gastric contents being propelled cranially into the oropharynx (figures 1 and 2).

Figure 1
Illustration of the sequence of events that occur in rumination syndrome. LOS, lower oesophageal sphincter.

Figure 2
A simplified illustration of pressure and impedance traces during an episode of rumination. As can be seen, there is a postprandial increase in gastric pressure and a decrease in impedance (demonstrating cranial movement of gastric contents).

Rumination syndrome is an acquired behavioural disorder and, in some cases, a detailed history can reveal a particular priming episode of psychological stress or gastrointestinal (GI) upset (eg, gastroenteritis) which occurred prior to rumination being noticed. This event may be relatively minor and swiftly forgotten but it is theorised it prompts patients to tense their abdominal walls in order to relieve discomfort. This initial priming episode, later maintained and reinforced, leads to patients habitually tensing their abdomen postprandially. While rumination is almost always a primary condition, it is recognised that rumination can occasionally be a secondary response to gastro-oesophageal reflux episodes (secondary rumination), where the rumination behaviour is thought to be a conditioned, maladaptive response to oesophageal discomfort caused by GORD. Similarly, patients with established rumination often report postprandial fullness or discomfort occurring before their episodes of regurgitation. Subsequent abdominal tensing and regurgitation may also be due to a subconscious, maladaptive method of discomfort reduction.

Complications

When severe, rumination syndrome can lead to malnutrition and dehydration which, in turn, can lead to electrolyte imbalances and the occurrence of refeeding syndrome when nutrition improves. Malnutrition and dehydration arise due to either a possible reduced desire to eat or drink so as to avoid episodes of regurgitation or spitting of food and fluids, reducing nutritional intake below what is required for good health.

Additional complications in children and adults include failure to thrive, dental erosions, an increased likelihood of aspiration, halitosisand stigma due to the rumination itself or its associated complications.

### Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pediatricians on infantile colic in the middle east and north Africa region [^115iyuwR]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are defined as a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms not explained by organic abnormalities. The exact pathophysiology underlying these disorders is unclear and several factors are thought to be involved in their expression. FGIDs in childhood are age dependent, and the Rome Foundation has established two pediatric committees to identify the criteria for diagnosis of FGIDs: the Infant/Toddler (up to 4 years) Committee and the Child/Adolescent Committee (aged 4–18 years). During infancy, infantile colic and gastroesophageal reflux are probably the most common FGIDs that lead to referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist.

Infantile colic, as per the classical Wessel's definition, appears at a very early age in otherwise healthy infants who experience unexplained and inconsolable crying episodes lasting for more than 3 h per day, for 3 or more days per week, and for 3 or more weeks (for at least 1 week in Rome III Criteria). Crying episodes, which usually peak around 6–8 weeks and gradually resolve spontaneously by 3–4 months of age, are accompanied by painful expression, flushing, flexing of the hips, and distended abdomen with flatulence. The precise etiology of colic is still unknown, but food allergy and gut function immaturity and dysmotility are thought to have some causative contribution. Although not considered a serious problem by many pediatricians, infantile colic is the cause of 10–20% of all pediatrician visits in the first 4 months of life, and can lead to excessive parental anxiety, exhaustion, and stress. Although a wide range of infant colic prevalence (2–73%) has been reported, experts generally agree on a 20% prevalence rate worldwide. Furthermore, there is evidence of intestinal neutrophilic infiltration and different microbiota in colicky infants compared with non-colicky infants, resulting in low-grade intestinal inflammation that may lead to gastrointestinal disorders reported later in life.

### Concomitant intestinal obstruction: a misleading diagnostic pitfall [^1115hLCw]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A 78-year-old man presented to the casualty department, complaining of recurrent and worsening constipation for the previous 2 months. This was associated with central, colicky abdominal pain and melena. In the last days, the symptoms worsened and the patient became partially obstructed, with nausea, vomiting and passing flatus but not stools for 72 h. The past medical history was unremarkable. The radiological findings of the plain abdominal film were consistent with mechanical small-bowel obstruction. CT scan revealed an intraluminal mass in the small bowel, which drew attention away from gross thickening of the caecal wall that was also present. A careful review of the images should not be omitted. One must be aware of a polymorphous appearance and the multiple causes of intestinal obstruction and avoid underestimating even the minor and less evident radiological findings.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of chronic constipation [^114qR5WZ]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Chronic constipation — history and physical examination emphasize history of urinary symptoms and obstetric history, including "number of pregnancies, history of hysterectomy, injuries, and repairs", and "Consideration should be given for inquiring about a history of sexual assault or the presence of an eating disorder", with "a careful assessment of symptoms and frequency and consistency of bowel movements (BMs) [that] may help distinguish among constipation subtypes". The text notes that "Patients with infrequent, hard stools may be more likely to have colonic inertia, whereas those with incomplete evacuation and straining may be more likely to have pelvic floor dysfunction, and the presence of abdominal pain may indicate IBS", but "the history alone may be inadequate to clearly establish a diagnosis because many patients will have symptoms associated with more than 1 subtype". For examination, "The physical examination is directed at the abdominal and anorectal components", the abdomen is "nontender but may be remarkable for distention or discomfort on palpation", "Special attention should be paid to the presence of palpable abdominal masses", and "External anorectal inspection should include specific attention to the presence of distorted anatomy or a bulky lesion, such as a neoplasm". Digital rectal examination can reveal "anal hypertonia, paradoxical puborectalis contraction, rectocele, anorectal mass, [and] stricture".

### Opioids in gastroenterology: treating adverse effects and creating therapeutic benefits [^113U2zLE]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Narcotic bowel syndrome (NBS) — a pain syndrome in patients using opiates — is described as persistent moderate to severe daily abdominal pain of more than 3 months' duration occurring in patients requiring more than 100 mg morphine equivalent per day; the abdominal pain does not respond and may actually increase in response to escalating doses of narcotics. There are at least 5 postulated mechanisms or hypotheses to explain this paradoxical increase in pain, and in a study of 39 patients with NBS, Drossman et al demonstrated a high prevalence of psychological traits and traumatic exposures that have been linked to altered brain processing of pain signals. It is likely a more common syndrome than realized, but a 2009 epidemiologic study in Olmsted County estimated the prevalence at 4%, and NBS is suggested by the personal experience of a patient on chronic opiates with chronic generalized, colicky abdominal pain, despite escalating doses of opiates, and worsening of pain with tapering of the dose.

### New insights into bloating and abdominal distension: is it all outlet obstruction? [^1122xuZa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

The sensation of bloating, a common but poorly understood problem, is the subject of two papers in this issue. The first study showed that patients with bloating as their main complaint have delayed clearance of infused gas from the colon, while the second study showed that bloaters had impaired defecation. Together, these studies suggest that behavioral factors may be important in this important symptom complex and propose novel approaches to its treatment.

### Do the digestive tract symptoms in eating disorder patients represent functional gastrointestinal disorders? [^111tJL99]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Contrary to our hypothesis, the main finding of this study was that the Rome II classification of specific FGIDs and of FGID regional categories generally holds up to factor analysis of the GI symptoms present in a large sample of ED patients. This was particularly evident for the specific FGIDs of pelvic floor dyssynergia, IBS, functional abdominal bloating and functional constipation, and for three of the FGID regional categories, namely functional oesophageal disorders, functional bowel disorders and functional anorectal disorders. The one exception was the functional gastroduodenal category. Because ED patients exhibit behaviors and psychopathology distinct from non-ED populations, we had hypothesized that the range of GI symptoms prevalent in this group may not conform to the Rome classification of the FGIDs. The clinical relevance of our results is that the GI symptoms in ED patients, once appropriate investigations have been performed as indicated, are very likely to represent the same FGIDs seen in non-ED patients.

The factor we termed 'oesophageal discomfort' emerged as a separate factor, and consisted of heartburn and chest pain of presumed oesophageal origin. This factor was associated with excessive exercise only and this is entirely consistent with reports of heartburn and chest pain, and disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux and altered oesophageal motility, occurring in runners. The factor 'self-induced vomiting' was to be expected in this sample of ED patients, and not surprisingly was more common in patients with bulimia nervosa, as this phenomenon is included in the diagnostic criteria for ED. In the Rome II questionnaire, if vomiting is self-induced it is discounted for the diagnosis of functional vomiting. This factor, not part of the Rome classification, was associated with vomiting questions only and not with other oesophageal symptoms.

The two separate factors we termed 'bowel dysfunction' and 'abdominal discomfort' were both significantly associated with the FGID category of functional bowel disorder. The factor termed 'bowel dysfunction' related to a change in stool pattern rather than bloating and appeared to be consistent with IBS. This is confirmed by the highly significant relationship between 'bowel dysfunction' and IBS (Table 4). The factor 'abdominal discomfort', although also associated with IBS, was specifically associated with the FGID category of anorectal disorder. This finding is consistent with our recent report of a relationship between prolonged rectal balloon expulsion time and abdominal distension in patients with constipation

### Association between maternal migraine and infantile colic: a narrative review [^117F2PNp]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infantile colic, characterized by excessive crying and fussiness in otherwise healthy infants, is a common condition that affects up to 20% of infants during the first three months of life. This abdominal discomfort is presented with excessive high-pitch crying, irritability, and fussiness behaviour accompanied by clenched fists, drawn-up legs, and a red face because of an unknown cause. Symptoms usually resolve after three to four months of age. There are so many definitions for colic but the most widely used one states colic as excessive crying that lasts more than three hours a day for more than three days a week for more than three weeks. Despite its self-limiting nature, infantile colic can be highly distressing for caregivers and is often associated with significant parental stress, anxiety, and fatigue. Although the cause of colic is unknown, perhaps there is a relationship between the mode of feeding, neurodevelopmental, gastrointestinal, and psychosocial factors, and IC.

IC can have short and long-term outcomes. In a short time, it can cause early cessation of breastfeeding, and family anxiety and can be associated with severe outcomes like child abuse or shaken baby syndrome​.​ In a long time, IC might lead to behavioral problems during childhood or adolescence, lower IQ scores, hyperactivity, and also sleeping. In addition, IC can lead to functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDS) during childhood or adolescence, it can increase the prevalence of childhood migraine, allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic eczema, and food allergy.

Maternal health and its influence on infant outcomes have been the subject of increasing scientific interest. Among maternal conditions, migraine is a prevalent neurological disorder affecting approximately 15–20% of women of reproductive age have been hypothesized as a potential contributor to infantile colic. Migraines are characterized by recurrent attacks of severe headache, often accompanied by nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, and are believed to involve complex interactions between genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. Interestingly, both migraine and infantile colic share overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms, including dysregulation of the trigeminovascular system, hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli, and altered gastrointestinal function.

### The management of adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal dysmotility [^1128mSfh]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

5.1 Organic obstruction

A major problem, that is often not diagnosed, is a localised bowel obstruction as a result of adhesion formation. This may be suspected clinically when a patient has had a number of abdominal operations (with or without extensive adhesion division). A history of intermittent colicky abdominal pain with abdominal distension, loud bowel sounds, no bowel or stoma action and vomiting suggest this. A distal obstruction is suggested if the vomit is faeculent, while a more proximal one by green/yellow vomit. During an obstructive episode the bowel secretes more fluid, and when the obstruction resolves, diarrhoea follows (or a high stomal output). If a patient sticks to a low residue diet or even a liquid diet, the obstructive episodes may reduce or even be abolished. This approach, if successful, can be a useful supportive diagnostic test.

Radiologically, the clue to an organic obstruction is the demonstration of a distinct transition point between dilated and normal sized bowel, but this may not be apparent either because the obstruction has resolved or the bowel is fixed by adhesions and thus cannot dilate. It can be helpful to obtain an abdominal CT scan when the patient has an episode of severe pain. Contrast follow through studies or MRI scans, although useful when positive, may not be tolerated in the acute setting and do not always demonstrate the obstruction. Unsuspected diagnoses may be revealed (eg, small bowel volvulus from a band adhesion or an intussusception). Further clues to an organic obstruction are visible small bowel peristalsis, worse pain after prokinetic drugs or giant jejunal contractions on manometry.

Multiple laparotomies themselves may result in secondary dysmotility, especially if the bowel becomes encased in fibrous tissue as can occur with sclerosing peritonitis. In addition, upper gut surgery (eg, a vagotomy, Whipple's resection, gastro-enterostomy, bariatric procedures or any bowel anastomosis) can result in secondary small bowel dysmotility.

Radiation damage can cause strictures and a localised obstruction and/or a generalised secondary dysmotility. Problems caused by radiation damage tend to be progressive over many years.

### Anxiety and depression in patients with gastrointestinal cancer: does knowledge of cancer diagnosis matter? [^115ieLEG]. BMC Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

There was no significant relationship between anxiety, depression and marital status, educational status and gender. A weaker association between demographic parameters and psychiatric morbidity has previously been noted in the presence of physical illness. It has been suggested that demographic differences that predispose to anxiety disorders after life events in the general population become less relevant when a very severe stressor such as cancer occurs.

There were no significant association between anxiety and depression and different gastrointestinal cancer site. In general when tumors develop in gastrointestinal tract, special problems in psychological adjustment are posed. Both patient and family may have to cope with severe eating problems, significant weight lost, nausea and vomiting, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea or constipation, as well as other disease related events that are difficult to manage. These problems result in immediate emotional distress and concerns. Since the sample in this study was consisted of heterogeneous gastrointestinal cancer patients, common symptoms and discomfort in these people can be a possible reason for lack of relationship between anxiety, depression and different types of the cancer studied. In addition the number of some cancers in the current study were very small and thus to have a better understanding we recommend that for future studies to include patients from only one type of gastrointestinal tract.

A significant relationship was observed between anxiety and age. This is in accordance with previous studies demonstrating that young people are more distressed than elderly patients by serious illnesses such as cancer.

In general, because of the frightening and potentially stigmatizing nature of the cancer and high prevalence of psychological distress among cancer patients, physicians should be aware of how much difficulties the patients experience. They should detect and treat problems earlier or refer the patient to the psychiatrists more appropriately. Untreated psychiatric disorder in the presence of co-morbid conditions may result in more frequent clinic visits, increased costs, extended hospitalizations, and reduce compliance and quality of life.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^112QDC5r]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSIS AND INVESTIGATION OF FACP IN PRIMARY CARE

Ruling Out Organic Pathology

Recommendations:

When evaluating FACP in primary care, the first step is to rule out "red flags" (alarm signals) of structural organic disease, which necessitate referral to a specialist.

Comments

When a patient first presents to primary care with symptoms of FACP, the first step is to rule out potentially serious organic disease. Key red flag signs and symptoms that could indicate structural disease are summarized in Table 1. Patients presenting with any indicators of organic disease require referral to a specialist for further investigation.

TABLE 1
Red Flag (Alarm) Signs That May Be Present in Patients With Functional Abdominal Cramping Pain (List Not Exhaustive),–

Investigations and Diagnosis

Recommendations:

A detailed evaluation of family history, medication, characteristics of pain, and eating/bowel habits should be undertaken in all patients presenting to primary care with FACP symptoms.
In selected cases and at the discretion of the doctor, a physical examination (including bowel sounds and digital rectal examination), laboratory tests, and psychosocial assessment may also be appropriate. Abdominal ultrasound investigations may be helpful.

### Early-life risk factors for both infant colic and excessive crying without colic [^1143qmSg]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Infantile colic may represent gastrointestinal distress, yet most definitions emphasize excessive crying. Each may have distinct etiologies.

Design/Methods

In a pre-birth cohort, we used maternal reports of infant crying and apparent abdominal discomfort at 6mos to categorize infants as (1) unaffected (no excessive crying or colic), (2) excessive crying only, and (3) colic (abdominal discomfort ± excessive crying). We examined associations of potential risk factors in separate models with excessive crying and colic (each vs. unaffected) using unadjusted multinomial logistic regression, and associations between count of risk factors and colic using logistic regression.

Results

Of 1403 infants, 140 (10%) had excessive crying, and 346 (25%) colic. Infants that were non-Hispanic white, low birthweight, firstborn, or had a maternal history of atopy, high postpartum depressive symptoms, or persistent prenatal nausea, had a 40–80% higher relative risk of colic. Preterm birth was associated with double the risk. Being firstborn, low birthweight, and preterm birth predicted excessive crying. Infants with ≥ four (vs. 0–1) of the seven identified risk factors had 3.9 times (95% CI: 2.6, 6.1) higher odds of colic.

Conclusions

Colic characterized by apparent abdominal discomfort can be phenotypically distinguished from excessive crying only. Multiple risk factors may further increase colic risk.

Impact

Infant colic characterized by apparent gastrointestinal distress may be phenotypically distinct from excessive crying only. Literature that defines colic only based on crying behaviors may miss important predictors. Mother-reported colic and excessive crying appear to have overlapping risk factors, with additional risk factors identified for colic. The presence of multiple risk factors increases the risk of colic, supporting a multifactorial etiology.

### Functional abdominal pain: time to get together and move forward [^116i2Awn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Intestinal motility and abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) involve strong contractions of the intestinal circular muscle causing intestinal power propulsion that underlie the sensation of cramping abdominal pain, and power propulsion occurs more frequently in patients with IBS than in healthy subjects with contractions significantly stronger than normal. Moreover, postprandial power propulsion is more prevalent in the colons of patients with IBS than in normal individuals and is often associated with their diarrheal state. The pain and discomfort of patients with IBS during powerful contractions may be explained in 3 ways, either separately or in combination: exceptionally powerful contractions activating high-threshold mechanoreceptors; mechanoreceptor sensitization with erroneously coded input to spinal and brain processing centers; and accurately coded spinal afferent information misinterpreted in the spinal cord and central processing centers of the brain.

### Infant colic: mechanisms and management [^111QYvgd]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Infant colic is a commonly reported phenomenon of excessive crying in infancy with an enigmatic and distressing character. Despite its frequent occurrence, little agreement has been reached on the definition, pathogenesis or the optimal management strategy for infant colic. This Review aims to delineate the definitional entanglement with the Rome IV criteria, which were published in 2016, as the leading, most recent diagnostic criteria. Moreover, neurogenic, gastrointestinal, microbial and psychosocial factors that might contribute to the pathophysiology of infant colic are explored. This Review underlines that a comprehensive medical history and physical examination in the absence of alarm symptoms serve as guidance for the clinician to a positive diagnosis. It also highlights that an important aspect of the management of infant colic is parental education and reassurance. Management strategies, including behavioural, dietary, pharmacological and alternative interventions, are also discussed. Owing to a lack of large, high-quality randomized controlled trials, none of these therapies are strongly recommended. Finally, the behavioural and somatic sequelae of infant colic into childhood are summarized.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed or treated symptomatically or this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit. We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can clue one in about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders, to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

Symptoms had started within two to three hours of eating an omelette made with wild mushrooms the family had picked — what they thought were "parasols" (fig 1, top panel), but on the basis of their description by the patient were probably another mushroom species (fig 1, bottom panel). The patient did not report any confusion, excess sweating, hallucinations, blurred vision, difficulty breathing, or discomfort. She had no history of medical conditions. On examination she showed no signs of dehydration or skin abnormalities. Heart rate and blood pressure were within normal limits. The patient's husband and young daughter had similar gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient's son had not eaten the omelette or any wild mushrooms and was asymptomatic.

### Diagnosing the patient with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits: is it irritable bowel syndrome? [^1116jvCm]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Diagnosing a patient who presents with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits can be challenging. Although serious organic illnesses can cause these symptoms, irritable bowel syndrome is commonly responsible. It can be difficult to properly evaluate these patients without overusing diagnostic tests and consultation. A practical approach for diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome is suggested, using the Rome II criteria and the presence of alarm symptoms such as weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, fever, or frequent nocturnal symptoms as starting points. If there are no alarm symptoms and the Rome II criteria are not met, it is acceptable to reevaluate the patient at a later date. If there are no alarm symptoms and the Rome II criteria are met, the patient should be categorized on the basis of age: patients 50 years or younger can be evaluated on the basis of predominant symptoms — constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. Patients older than 50 years should be fully evaluated and considered for gastroenterology referral. If alarm symptoms are present, a full evaluation should be performed (and gastroenterology referral considered), regardless of the patient's age.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^112MCvSf]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF STATEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Background

Functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) is a common complaint that may present on its own or as a predominant symptom of a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID). Despite the studies suggesting a high prevalence of FACP in the general population, the Rome classification for FGIDs does not consider it to be a discrete symptomatic entity.

Definition

The expert panel proposes the following definition for FACP, as reported by patients with or without a diagnosed FGID:

"FACP refers to the sudden occurrence of mild-to-moderate, undulating, and recurring cramping pain in any part of the abdomen, lasting for seconds to minutes or up to a few hours, in the absence of any "red flag" signs/symptoms of structural organic disease or any strong association with defecation (which might indicate irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]), and typically not significantly interfering with daily activities".

FACP could be perceived as reflecting part of the IBS spectrum but without a strong association with bowel irregularities. In situations where FACP is tightly linked with abnormalities of bowel evacuation, a diagnosis of IBS should be suspected, provided that patients fulfill the Rome IV diagnostic criteria.

The etiology is unknown although many hypotheses have been proposed. Colic can be very frustrating for parents to deal with, thus it is important to provide reassurance and resources. Also, there are therapeutic interventions available that have shown some efficacy in reducing the symptoms of colic, but more evidence is needed to support their use.

### The effect of behavioral therapy based counseling with anxious mothers on their infants' colic: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^113WVHTv]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colic is often the first challenge that parents and infants face. This problem greatly affects their lives. According to Wessel, infantile colic is defined as uncontrollable crying in infants less than three months old that lasts at least three hours a day, three days a week, and three weeks a month. Other common symptoms include experiencing abdominal contractions, drawing legs up towards the abdomen, difficulty in defecation, arching back, and kicking. According to Talachian et al.'s study on 321 infants in Tehran, 20.2% of them met the criteria for colic based on Wessel's law. Globally, approximately one in five infants under three months of age suffers from colic, and only 5% of infants with colic are diagnosed with gastrointestinal disease.

Two hypotheses have been suggested about the cause of colic including "abnormal gastrointestinal movements and pain signals from the sensitive areas of the intestine", and "insufficient amounts of lactobacilli and increased levels of coliform bacteria that increase intestinal gas formation ". In addition, behavioral problems such as anxiety, family tensions, and inadequate parent-infant interactions have been noticed in the etiology of colic.

The brain may affect intestinal microbes through the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and the autonomic nervous system. Studies suggest that intestinal microbes interact with the central nervous system (CNS) probably through neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, and consequently affect brain function and behavior, and play role in the regulation of anxiety, mood, cognition, and pain. The high correlation between psychiatric symptoms and gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disorder) highlights the importance of this axis in the pathophysiology of colic.

### Can symptoms and medical history predict outcomes for hydrogen and methane breath testing? [^112YcNQ1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydrogen and methane breath testing (HMBT) is used to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO). There are limited data on whether symptoms and medical history can predict outcomes on lactulose HMBT.

Methods

A large survey-based study was conducted in 731 subjects who completed lactulose HMBT at a single tertiary centre in the UK. The 32-item survey included questions relating to symptoms and medical history. Survey items were statistically interrogated to determine associations with SIBO, IMO or breath gas production using fisher's exact tests and regression models. SIBO was determined by a rise of ≥ 20 ppm in breath hydrogen from baseline within 90-minutes and IMO by the presence of ≥ 10 ppm methane in any breath sample.

Results

Abdominal pain (p = 0.022), excessive belching (p = 0.041) and regurgitation (p = 0.034) were associated with SIBO, as well as daily abdominal pain with diarrhoea (P = 0.035), and abdominal pain or discomfort immediately after eating (OR 2.20 [95% CI: 1.29, 3.79]). Patients reporting at least one skin condition were more likely to test positive for SIBO, with a trend towards significance for eczema (p = 0.051) and rosacea (p = 0.067). IMO was associated with constipation (p < 0.001) and with fatty/greasy stools that tend to float (p < 0.001).

Discussion

This large questionnaire study demonstrated that IBS-like symptoms, refractory gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, and skin conditions are associated with outcomes on HMBT. These findings support the use of HMBT in accordance with current clinical guidelines.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: straightening the road from the Rome criteria [^115WB1rB]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Medium credibility.

A sequence of consensus-based Rome criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been published since 1989. The fundamental definition based on abdominal pain in association with bowel dysfunction has been consistent. However, two major changes occurred in the Rome II and IV criteria. The former change involved "splitting off" of symptoms that were not consistently associated with pain, such as functional, constipation, diarrhea, and bloating. In Rome IV, the main changes were the exclusion of discomfort (in contrast to pain) and the more stringent frequency criteria for the pain to be eligible for diagnosis of IBS (specifically, on average, at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months). Validation studies of the consensus, symptom-based criteria have identified multiple deficiencies that question the rationale for "splitting" the different syndromes, and favor a simpler identification of the classical symptoms of abdominal pain, bowel dysfunction, and bloating, and exclusion of alarm symptoms. Advances in the identification of actionable biomarkers related to the symptoms suggestive of functional gastrointestinal disorders have the potential to usher a change in practice from positive diagnosis of symptom complexes followed by empirical treatment to identification of the mechanisms causing the symptoms and targeted therapy.

Comments

As with FGIDs in general, a comprehensive patient assessment is needed to rule out red flags and to characterize the FACP. We recommend that the assessment includes an evaluation of family history (especially for malignancy, gastrointestinal diseases, and other conditions that could affect their management), current and recent medication, characteristics of pain (nature, location, duration, quality, frequency, and severity), and eating/bowel habits (including known food allergies, intolerances, and triggers). In selected patients and at the discretion of the doctor, a physical examination (including bowel sounds and digital rectal examination) and limited laboratory tests may be appropriate, and psychosocial assessment may also be helpful, particularly if the patient has preexisting psychiatric comorbidities or there are indicators of significant psychological stress. The physical examination should assess the pain location and whether there is a palpable mass, abnormal or absent bowel sounds, rebound tenderness, rigidity/resistance, distension, and/or guarding. Experience in IBS shows that relevant laboratory tests might include complete blood cell counts and other targeted blood tests (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and/or celiac serology), thyroid and liver function tests, and stool studies (eg, fecal calprotectin and/or occult blood test), as indicated. Abdominal ultrasound investigations can sometimes be helpful and are cheap and simple to undertake in most settings. There are also certain other signs and symptoms that may require additional evaluation. For example, for pain in women that seems to be related to the menses, a gynecologic evaluation should be considered. Similarly, for pain brought on by physical exertion, a cardiology assessment should be sought. If the initial investigations raise concerns or are equivocal, referral for a computerized axial tomography scan might be considered.

Assuming none of the red flag signs/symptoms are present and no abnormalities are identified at the physical examination, laboratory tests, or other investigations, a diagnosis of FACP may be considered if the symptoms are described by the present definition. If the FACP is tightly related to changes in bowel evacuation, IBS is the most probable diagnosis and should be confirmed using the Rome IV criteria.

### Chronic abdominal discomfort syndrome (CADS): defining and discussing a novel diagnosis [^113NoKFB]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Currently, a diagnostic subclassification of Complex Abdominal Discomfort Syndrome (CADS) does not exist. Given the wide prevalence of chronic abdominal pain, a consensus to define CADS and to establish diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis is imperative. We propose a set of diagnostic criteria that includes a range of symptoms, imaging results, and response to diagnostic blocks. Where we believe the pathophysiology will be neuronally modulated. Additionally, we hope to facilitate primary care physicians' and gastroenterologists' utilization of our criteria to provide guidance for selecting which patients may benefit from further interventions or evaluation by a pain physician. For pain physicians, we hope that the disease definition and the set of diagnostic criteria will allow proper categorization of patients with CADS and use of available interventions to provide pain relief.

### "One time I fell, but I didn' T have to cry". A qualitative study on everyday physical complaints in children [^1171fAEG]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Theme 1: Causes of complaints

The first theme that emerged from the interviews was the causes of complaints (quotes related to theme 1 are in Table 2). Almost all children reported ideas about causes of abdominal pain and all children reported causes of visible complaints. When talking about causes of abdominal pain, most children mentioned a situation or possible behavior as cause of abdominal pain.

Table 2
Quotes theme 1 Causes of complaints

Everyday reasons were more often suggested as cause for abdominal pain than illness-related causes. Children mentioned many own behaviors that might cause abdominal pain or had caused abdominal pain in the past, for example eating too much, too little, or bad food. (quote 4 & 5) A couple of children gave a disease-related cause for abdominal pain, such as 'sickness' or concussion. They did not further elaborate on these disease-related causes, but just mentioned the term. Very few children, all five-year-olds, mentioned something about stress or nerves causing abdominal pain. (quote 6)

When speaking of causes of visible complaints, all children mentioned a clear cause for injuries like bloody knees or scratches. Some children kept it simple by just saying that they fell, but many others were able to give more details about the circumstances. (quote 7) Some children added that falling on a stone pavement or playground caused their injury. A few children mentioned a culprit caused their visible injury, such as a peer or a sibling. (quote 8)

### Psychological illness is commonly associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders and is important to consider during patient consultation: a population-based study [^111LhY6X]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Definitions of symptoms from the ASQ

(See Figure 2).

Dyspepsia was defined as one or more of the symptoms (reflux episodes, heartburn, retrosternal pain, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, uncomfortable feeling of fullness after meals, abdominal distension), and one or more of the pain modalities (burning sensation, aching, pain, tenderness, sinking feeling, "butterflies", cramp, twinge, stitch, colic, gripes) with any abdominal location except the lower part, but no concomitant IBS.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) was defined as one or more of the symptoms (abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort or pain on defecation, abdominal discomfort or pain relieved by defecation, feeling of incomplete defecation, mucous stools) and one or more of the symptoms (diarrhea, constipation, alternating diarrhea and constipation) together with one or more of the pain modalities (burning sensation, aching, pain, tenderness, sinking feeling, "butterflies", cramp, twinge, stitch, colic, gripes), with any location.

When using these definitions of dyspepsia and IBS, responders with only reflux symptoms, i.e. heartburn and/or retrosternal pain but no abdominal pain or discomfort, were classified as having GERS and not dyspepsia, while those with such symptoms and abdominal pain or discomfort fell into the dyspepsia group. Also, IBS, as defined below, was given priority over dyspepsia. Thus, concomitant occurrence of both led to a diagnosis of IBS. This definition is in accordance with published guidelines.

Functional Gastrointestinal Disorder, FGID

FGID was defined as either dyspepsia or IBS.

Minor symptoms refer to symptoms not fulfilling the criteria of dyspepsia or IBS. By definition, those with GERS were included in this group

"Strictly Symptom Free" (SSF) is defined as having no reported symptoms at all in the Abdominal Symptom Questionnaire in the 1995 survey, and subjects stating that they had not even been troubled previously with abdominal symptoms. Those subjects who had participated in the two former surveys in 1988 and 1989 (n = 265) should also have reported no symptoms in each of those two investigations.

"Prior symptomatics" were those with no symptoms in the 1995 survey but with GI symptoms reported in the prior studies of 1988 and 1989.

Additionally, we focused on defecation status and QOL before and after elobixibat administration in subgroups after excluding patients who had at least one fasting period. The SBMs in weeks 1, 2, and 4 had significant changes compared with baseline (supplemental online Fig. 2); SBMs increased from 0.4 to 1.2 (p < .0001), SBMs response rate was 31 (86%), CSBMs increased from 0.2 to 0.6 (p < .0001), BSFS decreased 1.9 to 3.6 (p = .01), respectively. Overall, PAC‐QOL scores also improved from 1.10 to 0.57 (p = .0004). The subscale of JPAC‐QOL showed that psychosocial discomfort and worries/concerns after elobixibat treatment were greatly reduced compared with baseline (psychosocial discomfort: 0.94 vs. 0.30; p = .0008; worries/concerns: 1.14 vs. 0.39; p = .0009; supplemental online Table 4).

Adverse Events

A total of 21 patients discontinued elobixibat administration during the study. The reasons for cessation included adverse events in five patients (6%) (abdominal pain, two; diarrhea, one; abdominal bloating, one; nausea, one), difficulty in oral intake (15 patients, 18%), and patient refusal (one patient, 1%). No serious adverse events were observed. Adverse events are shown in Table 4.

There were no significant associations of the factor scores with the patient diagnoses, except for the self-induced vomiting factor where bulimia nervosa was significantly different from the anorexia nervosa and EDNOS patients (F(2,182) = 11.550, p < 0.001).

Correlations of the factors with the behaviors and current BMI are shown in Table 3. 'Oesophageal discomfort' correlated only with excessive exercise, 'self-induced vomiting' correlated with binge eating, laxative use and current BMI, while the other three factors correlated only with laxative use. Relationship with the FGID categories and post hoc ANOVA with IBS, functional abdominal bloating and pelvic floor dyssynergia are shown in Table 4.

### Infantile colic [^1121vMFA]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Infantile colic can be distressing to parents whose infant is inconsolable during crying episodes. Colic is often defined by the "rule of three": crying for more than three hours per day, for more than three days per week, and for longer than three weeks in an infant who is well-fed and otherwise healthy. The physician's role is to ensure that there is no organic cause for the crying, offer balanced advice on treatments, and provide support to the family. Colic is a diagnosis of exclusion that is made after performing a careful history and physical examination to rule out less common organic causes. Treatment is limited. Feeding changes usually are not advised. Medications available in the United States have not been proved effective in the treatment of colic, and most behavior interventions have not been proved to be more effective than placebo. Families may turn to untested resources for help, and the physician should offer sound advice about these treatments. Above all, parents need reassurance that their baby is healthy and that colic is self-limited with no long-term adverse effects. Physicians should watch for signs of continuing distress in the child and family, particularly in families whose resources are strained already.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic criteria context for trials notes that the Rome IV criteria differ from Rome III by deleting abdominal discomfort and requiring abdominal pain to be present at least 1 day per week on average during the preceding 3 months, resulting in fewer individuals meeting Rome IV than Rome III. For randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that generally measure changes in abdominal pain, Rome IV criteria are described as more applicable, but it is not known whether these diagnostic changes would alter the efficacy and safety of IBS treatments in RCTs.

### Further evidence for plausible transmission of fishborne trematodiases in the United States: game fish carry human-infectious trematodes and are eaten raw [^1168PPqv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Although fishborne trematodiases are globally important, local transmission has not been a general concern in the United States (US). This is because cases have been rarely reported, and because first intermediate host snails that transmit known human-pathogenic fishborne trematodes have historically been lacking in the US. However, this situation has changed. First, the widespread invasion of an exotic snail (Melanoides tuberculata) has brought 2 human-pathogenic fishborne trematodes to the US. Second, the snail and its fishborne parasites occur where people catch and eat fish. Third, along with the recent increased popularity of culturally diverse foods, there has been an apparent nationwide spike in the consumption of raw fish (eg, as sushi, ceviche, and poke). These factors augment the likelihood of local transmission of fishborne trematodes in the US, warranting further assessment.

At least 11 species of human-infecting trematode use the M tuberculata snail as first intermediate host. Native to Asia and Africa, the snail is now globally introduced, along with at least 3 zoonotic trematodes in the US. Two of these, Haplorchis pumilio and Centrocestus formosanus, are fishborne. Their free-swimming stages (cercariae) exit infected snails and encyst in second intermediate host fish as metacercariae, which transmit to final hosts (birds and mammals, including humans) that eat infected fish. The adult trematodes, typically 1–2 mm long, infect the small intestine, causing symptoms ranging from mild abdominal discomfort to diarrhea, weight loss, lethargy, and possibly death (see and references therein). Given their impacts and wide distribution, particularly in eastern Asia and the western Pacific, these trematodes are recognized as globally important human pathogens.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^111nkKSU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — diagnostic criteria and early CT use: Diagnosis is most often established by identification of 2 of the 3 criteria — abdominal pain consistent with the disease, serum amylase and/or lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and/or characteristic findings from abdominal imaging. Patients with AP typically present with epigastric or left upper quadrant pain that is usually constant with radiation to the back, chest, or flanks, whereas pain described as dull, colicky, or located in the lower abdominal region is not consistent with AP and suggests an alternative etiology. Abdominal imaging is often helpful to determine the diagnosis of AP in patients with atypical presentations. Due to limitations on sensitivity and negative predictive value, serum amylase alone cannot be used reliably for the diagnosis of AP, and serum lipase is preferred. Regarding early imaging, "We suggest that early at/admission routine computed tomography (CT) not be performed for the purpose of determining severity in AP and should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically within the first 48–72 hours after hospital admission and intravenous hydration".

Results

The clinical details and ED behaviors of the patients are shown in Table 2. The prevalences of regional FGID categories were: functional esophageal disorder 72 (39%), functional gastroduodenal disorder 31 (17%), functional bowel disorder 159 (86%), functional abdominal pain 7 (5%), and functional anorectal disorder 63 (34%). The prevalences of the most common specific FGIDs were: functional heartburn 43 (23%), IBS 77 (42%), functional abdominal bloating 58 (31%), functional constipation 49 (27%), functional proctalgia fugax 37 (20%), and pelvic floor dyssynergia 10 (5%).

Clinical details and behaviors of 185 eating disorder patients for 3 months prior to admission to hospital

Factor analysis of the patients' Rome II responses revealed five factors explaining 68% of the variance. This was confirmed by Scree plot. The KMO was 0.76 and Bartlett's test of Sphericity was significant (p < 0.001). The five factors were termed 'oesophageal discomfort', 'self-induced vomiting', 'bowel dysfunction', 'abdominal discomfort', and 'pelvic floor dysfunction'. The factors, the factor loadings and the percentage of patients responding positively to the Rome II questions that contributed to each factor are shown in Table 1.

The percentage of patients responding positively to all questions for each of the factors was: 'pelvic floor dysfunction' 22% (5 questions, as 'need to press' loading < 0.500), 'bowel dysfunction' 34% (3 questions), 'abdominal discomfort' 20% (3 questions), 'self-induced vomiting' 46% (2 questions) and 'oesophageal discomfort' 27% (3 questions). For 'pelvic floor dysfunction' 56% of patients reported at least 3 of the 5 questions as present.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^112ZKTRB]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Prompt endoscopy is, therefore, not required for most patients with dyspepsia and should be reserved for those with other risk factors, defined above. However, there is variation in age-based gastric cancer risks, which are lower in the majority of Western populations, excluding African-Americans and Latin-Americans, and higher in South-east Asian countries, such as China, Japan and Korea. A reduction in the age threshold is also required in patients with a family history of gastro-oesophageal cancer.

As pancreaticobiliary disease can present with upper gastrointestinal symptoms, this may need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of dyspepsia. However, a previous systematic review demonstrated that gallstones are only associated with abdominal pain with the characteristics of biliary colic, not with symptoms suggestive of dyspepsia. Moreover, response following cholecystectomy for uncomplicated gallstones, in terms of the resolution of abdominal pain, appears to be associated with the presence of episodic pain with a duration of less than 1 year prior to surgery. This suggests that indiscriminate use of abdominal ultrasound in patients with symptoms suggestive of dyspepsia should be avoided, unless the upper abdominal pain has the characteristics of biliary colic, and has been present for less than 1 year. NICE states that imaging should be considered in patients ≥ 60 years old with new onset abdominal pain and weight loss to exclude the possibility of pancreatic cancer.

Abnormal results warrant further testing. If test results do not suggest an alternate diagnosis, then empiric treatment of CVS is recommended.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^112Hgsxb]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Abdominal bloating and distention — Rome IV definitions and diagnostic scope indicate that abdominal bloating is a subjective sensation, whereas abdominal distention is a visible increase in abdominal girth; the Rome IV criteria define functional bloating and distention as DGBIs with recurrent symptoms of abdominal fullness or pressure or a visible increase in abdominal girth with symptoms at least 1 day per week and active for 3 months, with onset of 6 months, and without a predominance of pain and alteration in bowel habits. Rome IV has an abdominal bloating and distention category that is separate from other DGBIs. A large global population-based study found a prevalence as high as 3.5% (4.6% in women and 2.4% in men), and bloating and distention are much more prevalent (> 50%) when associated with other DGBIs such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), constipation, and FD. When the Rome IV diagnostic criteria are met, the patient should not fulfill criteria for a diagnosis of IBS, functional constipation, functional diarrhea, or FD, and diagnostic testing will depend on an algorithmic approach based on presumptive causes.

Both Saxenda® and Victoza® may make your stomach feel upset; if this happens, it may help to eat smaller meals and eat slower, eat small meals or snacks throughout the day instead of one large meal, and take about 15–20 minutes to eat your meal. Eat about half of what you usually eat. Add fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins to meals and snacks. Limit foods that are spicy, greasy or fried. Limit packaged snacks like cookies, chips, cakes, doughnuts, ice cream. Drink water instead of sweet drinks like soda, lemonade, sports drinks. Avoid alcohol. Take Saxenda® and Victoza® with food to help decrease stomach upset. Pay attention to how you are feeling when you eat. When you feel full, stop eating. This will give your stomach time to empty.

Diagnostic testing and imaging for bloating and distention — testing is selective and guided by alarm features and examination. "Symptoms of bloating and distention do not routinely require laboratory testing or obtaining radiologic imaging or endoscopy unless the history discloses concerning symptoms, an abdominal physical examination, or alarm features". The authors "advise ordering tests with worsening dyspepsia or abdominal pain, particularly of recent onset; vomiting; GI bleeding; unintentional weight loss > 10% of body weight; chronic diarrhea; or a family history of GI malignancy, CD, or inflammatory bowel disease". If visible abdominal distension is present, "an abdominal examination will help to evaluate for an abdominal mass", and with abnormal findings, "Any abnormalities would lead to a computed tomography scan or ultrasound of the abdomen to evaluate for ascites or a mass or to identify increased bowel gas due to ileus, obstruction, or pseudo-obstruction". The text adds, "Bloating and abdominal fullness are often presenting symptoms in patients with ovarian cancer; the highest risk is in women 50 years or older".

Functional abdominal pain: the basic science — mechanisms of nociception in the digestive tract emphasize distension and contractions. Primary causes of abdominal pain of digestive tract origin are distension and excessively strong contractions of the musculature, whereas other stimuli such as pinching and burning of the mucosa do not evoke pain. Hypersensitivity of the mechanoreceptors detecting stretch (distension) and contractile force is described as a pain factor in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), and hypersensitivity to distension is found in a substantial subset of patients that meet Rome III symptom-based criteria for diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

### Irritable bowel syndrome [^114vQ7P2]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disorder with symptoms including abdominal pain associated with a change in stool form or frequency. The condition affects between 5% and 10% of otherwise healthy individuals at any one point in time and, in most people, runs a relapsing and remitting course. The best described risk factor is acute enteric infection, but irritable bowel syndrome is also more common in people with psychological comorbidity and in young adult women than in the rest of the general population. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome is incompletely understood, but it is well established that there is disordered communication between the gut and the brain, leading to motility disturbances, visceral hypersensitivity, and altered CNS processing. Other less reproducible mechanisms might include genetic associations, alterations in gastrointestinal microbiota, and disturbances in mucosal and immune function. In most people, diagnosis can be made on the basis of clinical history with limited and judicious use of investigations, unless alarm symptoms such as weight loss or rectal bleeding are present, or there is a family history of inflammatory bowel disease or coeliac disease. Once the diagnosis is made, an empathetic approach is key and can improve quality of life and symptoms, and reduce health-care expenditure. The mainstays of treatment include patient education about the condition, dietary changes, soluble fibre, and antispasmodic drugs. Other treatments tend to be reserved for people with severe symptoms and include central neuromodulators, intestinal secretagogues, drugs acting on opioid or 5-HT receptors, or minimally absorbed antibiotics (all of which are selected according to predominant bowel habit), as well as psychological therapies. Increased understanding of the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome in the past 10 years has led to a healthy pipeline of novel drugs in development.

### Intractable abdominal pain following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding [^112Ewxjg]. Obesity Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

A 42-year-old woman presented with intractable crampy abdominal pain continuing for 1 year. The pain worsened after eating and improved when walking. She had undergone laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding 4 years previously, with re-banding 18 months later because of anterior band slippage. The patient underwent numerous examinations, all with normal findings. A scintigraphy finally showed some tracer enrichment in the terminal ileum, which led to the assumption that a Meckel's diverticulum was causing her discomfort. Subsequent diagnostic laparoscopy showed no Meckel's diverticulum but instead displaced tubing, which was wrapped around the mesenteric root. The mesenteric root showed scarred alterations from chronic strangulation. After replacing the tubing from the band the abdominal pain immediately vanished. In retrospect, the contrast study of the gastric band shows unnatural traction of the tubing towards the lower abdomen, allowing suspicion of the intraoperative findings.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: an algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^112Rbjc6]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common cause of diarrhea in the developed world, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 4% to 9%, based on Rome III/IV criteria. Although patients can present with IBS at any age, it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years, with women being diagnosed about twice as often as men (14% vs. 8.9%).

According to Rome IV clinical criteria, IBS may be diagnosed if abdominal pain is present at least 1 day per week, is associated with changes in visceral perception with defecation and/or alterations in stool form/frequency, and the symptoms affect patients' quality of life or their abilities to carry out normal activities of daily living. While these clinical criteria do not require symptoms to be present for a specific period of time, the practitioner must be confident that other diagnoses have been appropriately excluded. The Rome IV research-based criteria are more stringent, requiring symptoms to be present for the previous 3 months with onset > 6 months before diagnosis (Table 1). Symptoms not included in the definition of IBS-D, but commonly identified at presentation, include abdominal bloating and/or distension, fecal urgency, sensations of incomplete evacuation, and the passage of mucus in stools. Stools are characteristically watery (Bristol Stool Form Scale 6–7, Fig. 1) and passed during waking hours. Stress is a well-known mediator. Importantly, the development of symptoms in those older than 50 years, unintentional weight loss, acute unexplained symptom changes, recurrent bleeding and/or anemia, and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or colorectal cancer are considered alarm features or 'red flags' necessitating further diagnostic evaluation for organic causes other than IBS (Figs. 2 and 3).

The Rome criteria

If symptoms were a good discriminator for the likelihood of a patient with dyspepsia having an underlying organic pathology, this would aid the physician greatly in their clinical assessment; however, unfortunately, this is not the case. A previous systematic review of diagnostic test studies demonstrated, convincingly, that a physician's opinion, based on symptoms reported by the patient, had limited diagnostic ability to discriminate between organic causes of dyspepsia and FD.

Historically, FD was referred to as nonulcer dyspepsia, creating the impression that the diagnosis was based on the absence of specific underlying organic pathology, and therefore encouraging the use of investigations in all patients. Although more recently the terminology has changed, FD still remains a diagnosis of exclusion. The Rome Foundation, the expert group responsible for the classification of all functional GI disorders, defines FD using the Rome IV criteria as bothersome postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, or epigastric burning, in the absence of structural disease, including at upper GI endoscopy, which would explain the symptoms. According to these criteria the condition is subgrouped into two separate syndromes: the epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), and the postprandial distress syndrome (PDS). EPS consists of intermittent pain or burning in the epigastrium, occurring at least once per week. The pain may be either induced or relieved by eating but may also occur while fasting; however, it should not fulfil biliary pain criteria. Postprandial epigastric bloating, belching, and nausea can also be present, but are not specific to dyspepsia. PDS is defined as bothersome postprandial fullness after normal-sized meals, or else early satiety that prevents someone finishing a regular-sized meal, with such episodes occurring at least several times per week. Postprandial epigastric pain or burning, epigastric bloating, belching, or nausea may also be present. But are not specific to dyspepsia. These definitions were determined based on a study of dyspeptic symptom groupings, and also on the fact that up to 80% of patients with dyspepsia report that their symptoms are made worse by eating.

A previously healthy 16-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with 1 week of severe, diffuse abdominal pain and constipation, as well as several episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. Her symptoms began several days after she decreased her caloric intake in an attempt to lose weight. She had been drinking 48 to 60 oz of water per day for several days before admission in an attempt to ameliorate her constipation. She also admits to drinking alcohol the night before her pain began. She had visited several other emergency departments before her presentation to our hospital, and she had been sent home on a bowel regimen without amelioration of her symptoms. On arrival to our emergency department, she described severe diffuse abdominal pain. Her abdomen was tender to palpation throughout but soft with no rebound tenderness or peritoneal signs. The remainder of her physical examination yielded normal results. She was found to have hyponatremia with a sodium level of 122 and no neurologic sequelae. Abdominal radiograph showed moderate constipation but her abdominal pain continued even after bowel cleanout. The home, education, activities, drugs, sex, suicide, and safety assessment revealed several stressors, including a recent suicide in the family and a history of disordered eating and anxiety. Here, we present her case, diagnostic evaluation, ultimate diagnosis, and complications.

### Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense infection linked to chilled salmon consumption [^1114e1ZU]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

This is a case of a 40-year-old Japanese adult male who had acute onset watery diarrhoea with intermittent abdominal discomfort. Several days later, he found a 1 metre of tape-shaped object emerged from his anus and was eventually admitted to our hospital for further investigation. Stool examination revealed eggs of Diphyllobothrium with characteristic shape in his stool. After oral praziquantel administration, segments of proglottids were expelled from his anus. The proglottids were sent to the Infectious Disease Surveillance Centre of Japan, and DNA analysis of the proglottids proved to be those of Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense. The patient confessed that he had an eating habit of chilled salmon. His diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort were completely diminished after 1 day of oral praziquantel administration. He was successfully discharged from the hospital a few days later admission without any complication of the disease and the side effect of treatment.
