## Question

A noncirrhotic patient presents with upper GI bleeding and splenomegaly. Doppler ultrasound shows thrombosis with occlusion of the extrahepatic portal vein and cavernous transformation. What ICD-10 code should be used for billing the portal vein obstruction?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for a noncirrhotic patient with extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis, occlusion, and cavernous transformation presenting with upper GI bleeding and splenomegaly. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core diagnosis and whether it maps to a specific ICD-10 category. Then, I should verify whether cavernous transformation changes the coding choice. Next, I will check for any excluded or more specific codes that might apply. Finally, I will confirm the exact ICD-10-CM code and ensure it aligns with authoritative coding sources and clinical terminology used in the literature.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis with occlusion and cavernous transformation is, by definition, portal vein thrombosis, and in ICD-10-CM this falls under I81 Portal vein thrombosis, which explicitly covers thrombosis of the portal vein regardless of cirrhosis status or the presence of cavernous transformation, so the base code is I81 [^113ZEAAa].

> Wait, let me verify whether cavernous transformation warrants a different code or modifier. Cavernous transformation is a chronic sequela of portal vein thrombosis characterized by collateral venous channels replacing the occluded portal vein; it does not change the fundamental diagnosis code, and there is no separate ICD-10-CM code for cavernous transformation itself, so I should not add a secondary code for the cavernoma unless documenting a complication separately [^113ZEAAa] [^116XxkjL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about specificity. I should confirm whether any more specific subcategory exists for extrahepatic versus intrahepatic PVT or for chronicity. ICD-10-CM I81 is a single, non-billable category with no subdigits for location or chronicity, so I81 is the most specific code available for portal vein thrombosis in this scenario, and I should not try to force a subcategory that doesn't exist in the index [^116XxkjL].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking an exclusion or a competing diagnosis. INCPH (idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension) is a separate entity defined by portal hypertension without cirrhosis, portal vein obstruction, or hepatic vein thrombosis; here, there is documented portal vein obstruction, so INCPH is excluded and should not be coded, which reinforces that I81 is the correct choice for the vascular obstruction itself [^114FNwGM] [^111HDsqM].

> Let me consider the complications. Upper GI bleeding and splenomegaly are consequences of portal hypertension from PVT; they are clinically important but do not change the primary diagnosis code. I should document them separately and may add K92.2 for gastrointestinal hemorrhage and R16.1 for splenomegaly if needed for billing, while keeping I81 as the principal diagnosis for the portal vein thrombosis [^notfound].

> Final answer: I should use I81 Portal vein thrombosis for the portal vein obstruction in this noncirrhotic patient with extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis, occlusion, and cavernous transformation, and I will add separate codes for the bleeding and splenomegaly if required by payer policy [^116XxkjL].

---

The correct ICD-10 code for portal vein obstruction due to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation in a noncirrhotic patient is **I81** (Portal vein thrombosis) [^116XxkjL]. This code applies regardless of cirrhosis status and covers thrombosis with cavernous transformation. For the upper GI bleeding, add **K92.2** (Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, unspecified), and for splenomegaly, add **R16.1**. If the cavernous transformation is specifically documented, you may also use **I81.9** (Portal vein thrombosis, unspecified) to capture the chronic sequelae, but I81 is sufficient and most specific.

---

## ICD-10 code for portal vein obstruction

The primary ICD-10 code for portal vein obstruction due to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation is **I81** (Portal vein thrombosis) [^116XxkjL]. This code encompasses thrombosis of the portal vein, including cases with cavernous transformation, and is applicable regardless of cirrhosis status.

---

## Additional ICD-10 codes for associated conditions

To fully capture the clinical scenario, include the following **additional ICD-10 codes**:

| **Condition** | **ICD-10 code** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Upper gastrointestinal bleeding | K92.2 | Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, unspecified |
| Splenomegaly | R16.1 | Splenomegaly, not elsewhere classified |

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding relies on thorough clinical documentation. Ensure the following elements are **clearly documented** in the patient's medical record:

- **Confirmation of portal vein thrombosis**: Document the diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis, including the presence of cavernous transformation, as confirmed by Doppler ultrasound or other imaging modalities [^113S5PWu].
- **Extent and location of thrombosis**: Specify whether the thrombosis involves the extrahepatic portal vein, and note any extension into the mesenteric or splenic veins [^112Y7eRo].
- **Presence of cirrhosis**: Clearly state the absence of cirrhosis, as this differentiates the condition from cirrhotic portal vein thrombosis and may influence management decisions [^115dQwVN].
- **Associated complications**: Document the presence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and splenomegaly, as these are common complications of portal vein thrombosis and cavernous transformation [^1163W5vk].

---

## Clinical implications and management considerations

Portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation in a noncirrhotic patient can lead to significant complications, including portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, and hypersplenism. Management typically involves:

- **Anticoagulation therapy**: Indicated in noncirrhotic patients with acute or recent portal vein thrombosis to prevent thrombus progression and promote recanalization [^112TCs5b] [^117Tea6x].
- **Endoscopic management**: Variceal band ligation or sclerotherapy may be required for management of variceal bleeding [^1163W5vk].
- **Surgical or interventional radiology procedures**: In select cases, surgical shunting or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) may be considered for refractory portal hypertension or variceal bleeding [^111i9j6L].

---

## Conclusion

The correct ICD-10 code for portal vein obstruction due to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation in a noncirrhotic patient is **I81** (Portal vein thrombosis) [^116XxkjL]. Additional codes for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (K92.2) and splenomegaly (R16.1) should be included to accurately reflect the clinical presentation. Accurate documentation and coding are essential for appropriate clinical management and billing.

Methods

Sixty-seven patients were identified in the computerised hospital administrative registration system by the ICD10 classification code I81.9. All cases from January 1992 to December 2005 of extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis or intrahepatic portal vein thrombosis were included. All registered diagnoses were based on either ultrasound with Doppler, CT-angiography or MRI. Diagnostic inclusion criteria were partial or complete thrombosis with the extension of the thrombus defined. Follow-up elapsed from the time of admission, and lasted to either death or December 31 st 2.005000000000000e+03

The following data were extracted from the clinical records: sex, age, risk factors (prothrombotic tendency, cirrhosis, cancer, abdominal inflammation, infection, surgical abdominal intervention, none), clinical presentation; abdominalia (= abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea), splenomegaly, fever, ascites (tense/soft, diagnosed by clinical evaluation or ultrasound), haemorrhage (= haematemesis, melaena or rectal bleeding), presentation of PVT (acute < 60 days or chronic > 60 days), complications (oesophageal- and gastric varices, variceal haemorrhage, portal hypertensive gastropathy, ascites), extension of the thrombus (intra- and/or extrahepatic, superior mesenteric vein or splenic vein), information on coagulation disorders, imaging methods (Doppler ultrasound, CT angiography, MRI, and endoscopy), treatment (anticoagulation, thrombolysis, sclerotherapy, banding, β-blockade, long-acting nitrates and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS)), the course of varices, recanalization and finally the cause of death.

Diagnosis of portal hypertensive gastropathy and grading of oesophageal- and gastric varices was made by means of endoscopy. Thrombophilia investigation was performed by using citrated plasma and heparin-flouride containing plasma collected by venipuncture and kept at -80°C until analysis. The protocol for sample collection and processing, as well as data interpretation, has been reported in previous publications.

Thrombophilia testing included collection for antithrombin (AT), homocystein, protein C, free protein S, factor V (FV) Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, Von Willebrand-factor, activated protein C resistance, β-2 glycoprotein-1 (APA), phospholipid antibody, and lupus anticoagulant (LA). The spontaneous fibrinolytic capacity was determined by a routine fibrin plate technique.

### Mesenteric vein thrombosis can be safely treated with anticoagulation but is associated with significant sequelae of portal hypertension [^113rAzAh]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) is a relatively uncommon but potentially lethal condition associated with bowel ischemia and infarction. The natural history and long-term outcomes are poorly understood and under-reported.

Methods

A single-institution retrospective review of noncirrhotic patients diagnosed with MVT from 1999 to 2015 was performed using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and radiology codes. Patients were excluded if no radiographic imaging was available for review. Eighty patients were identified for analysis. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic data on presentation and at long-term follow-up were collected. Long-term sequelae of portal venous hypertension were defined as esophageal varices, portal vein cavernous transformation, splenomegaly, or hepatic atrophy, as seen on follow-up imaging.

Results

There were 80 patients (57.5% male; mean age, 57.9 ± 15.6 years) identified; 83.3% were symptomatic, and 80% presented with abdominal pain. Median follow-up was 480 days (range, 1–6183 days). Follow-up radiographic and clinical data were available for 50 patients (62.5%). The underlying causes of MVT included cancer (41.5%), an inflammatory process (25.9%), the postoperative state (20.7%), and idiopathic cases (18.8%). Pancreatic cancer was the most common associated malignant neoplasm (53%), followed by colon cancer (15%). Twenty patients (26%) had prior or concurrent lower extremity deep venous thromboses. Most patients (68.4%) were treated with anticoagulation; the rest were treated expectantly. Ten (12.5%) had bleeding complications related to anticoagulation, including one death from intracranial hemorrhage. Four patients underwent intervention (three pharmacomechanical thrombolysis and one thrombectomy). One patient died of intestinal ischemia. Two patients had recurrent MVT, both on discontinuing anticoagulation. Long-term imaging sequelae of portal hypertension were noted in 25 of 50 patients (50%) who had follow-up imaging available. Patients with long-term sequelae had lower recanalization rates (36.8% vs 65%; P = 0.079) and significantly higher rates of complete as opposed to partial thrombosis at the initial event (73% vs 43.3%; P < .005). Long-term sequelae were unrelated to the initial cause or treatment with anticoagulation (P = NS).

Conclusions

Most cases of MVT are associated with malignant disease or an inflammatory process, such as pancreatitis. A diagnosis of malignant disease in the setting of MVT has poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival of only 25%. MVT can be effectively treated with anticoagulation in the majority of cases. Operative or endovascular intervention is rarely needed but important to consider in patients with signs of severe ischemia or impending bowel infarction. There is a significant incidence of radiographically noted long-term sequelae from MVT related to portal venous hypertension, especially in cases of initial complete thrombosis of the mesenteric vein.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) without cirrhosis — traditional anticoagulants: In a 2010 prospective trial of 95 consecutive patients, anticoagulation achieved complete recanalization in 38% and thrombosis progressed in 6%, with 9 patients developing bleeding on therapy; given portal hypertension risk, current recommendations suggest endoscopic evaluation to assess and risk‑stratify gastroesophageal varices when initiating anticoagulation, and registry analyses indicate higher morbidity and mortality from thrombotic events in noncirrhotic PVT while overall bleeding risk from anticoagulation is low.

### Vascular liver disorders, portal vein thrombosis, and procedural bleeding in patients with liver disease: 2020 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115dQwVN]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

PVT prevalence and risk factors: patients without cirrhosis — PVT without cirrhosis is a rare disease, with an autopsy study showing a PVT prevalence of 0.05% and likely overestimation due to post mortem thrombosis. A combined evaluation by an experienced hematologist and hepatologist of every patient without cirrhosis who develops PVT is recommended. The thrombophilia workup is similar to that for hepatic vein thrombosis (HVT), and in contrast to cirrhosis, a detailed thrombophilia workup is warranted in most patients without cirrhosis who develop PVT. Obstruction of the extrahepatic portal venous system without cirrhosis is mostly related to myeloproliferative neoplasia, surgery, or inflammatory conditions affecting the digestive system organs or the spleen; contributors include bariatric surgery, splenectomy, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, appendicitis, and diverticulitis, and ~30% of these patients also have a systemic thrombophilic disorder.

2. Methods

This study was a retrospective analysis undertaken at Siriraj Hospital which is the largest hospital in Thailand comprising of more than 2,500 inpatient beds and more than 2 million outpatient visits a year. Patients diagnosed with thrombosis of the portal system and other abdominal veins from January 2000 to December 2009 were identified through the hospital's computerized medical records based upon the Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) coding system. The study was approved by the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital Ethical Committee.

The following data were extracted from the medical records: demographic data (age and gender), clinical presentations (abdominal pain, abdominal distension, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, splenomegaly, fever, jaundice, ascites, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage), complications (esophageal and gastric varices, variceal hemorrhage, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and ascites), extension of the thrombus (main, right or left branch of portal vein, mesenteric vein, splenic vein, vena cava), imaging methods used to diagnose PVT (ultrasound with or without Doppler, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance venography (MRV)), and hepatitis serology (HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV)). Diagnosis of portal hypertensive gastropathy and grading of esophageal- and gastric varices was made by means of esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD). Owing to the severity of cancer and cirrhosis, the patients were classified into 2 groups: group 1) patients with cancer or cirrhosis and group 2) patients without cancer and cirrhosis. Patients were also categorized into 4 groups according to respective ages: group 1) < 20 years, group 2) ≥ 20 to 40 years, group 3) ≥ 40 to 60 years, and group 4) ≥ 60 years. Statistical analyses of continuous variables (mean, standard deviation (SD), and range) and categorical variables (number and percentage) were performed. A p-value was calculated when indicated.

### Current outcome of portal vein thrombosis in adults: risk and benefit of anticoagulant therapy [^115chaSe]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The outcome of portal vein thrombosis in relation to associated prothrombotic states has not been evaluated. We assessed current outcome and predictors of bleeding and thrombotic events in a cohort of 136 adults with nonmalignant, noncirrhotic portal vein thrombosis, of whom 84 received anticoagulant therapy.

Methods

Multivariate Cox model analysis for event-free survival and analysis taking into account multiple events were used.

Results

Median follow-up was 46 months. The incidence rate of gastrointestinal bleeding was 12.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 10–15) per 100 patient-years. Large varices were an independent predictor for bleeding. Anticoagulant therapy did not increase the risk or the severity of bleeding. The incidence rate of thrombotic events was 5.5 (95% CI, 3.8–7.2) per 100 patient-years. Underlying prothrombotic state and absence of anticoagulant therapy were independent predictors for thrombosis. In patients with underlying prothrombotic state, the incidence rates of splanchnic venous infarction were 0.82 and 5.2 per 100 patient-years in periods with and without anticoagulant therapy, respectively (P = 0.01). Two nonanticoagulated patients died of bleeding and thrombosis, respectively.

Conclusions

In patients with portal vein thrombosis, the risk of thrombosis is currently as clinically significant as the risk of bleeding. The benefit-risk ratio favors anticoagulant therapy.

### Portal vein thrombosis; risk factors, clinical presentation and treatment [^1163W5vk]. BMC Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is increasingly frequently being diagnosed, but systematic descriptions of the natural history and clinical handling of the condition are sparse. The aim of this retrospective study was to describe risk factors, clinical presentation, complications and treatment of portal vein thrombosis in a single-centre.

Methods

Sixty-seven patients were identified in the electronic records from 1992 to 2005. All data were obtained from the patient records.

Results

One or more risk factors (e.g. prothrombotic disorder or abdominal inflammation) were present in 87%. Symptoms were abdominalia, splenomegaly, fever, ascites, haematemesis, and weight loss. Abdominalia and fever occurred more frequently in patients with acute PVT. Frequent complications were splenomegaly, oesophageal- and gastric varices with or without bleeding, portal hypertensive gastropathy and ascites. Varices and bleeding were more frequent in patients with chronic PVT. Patients who received anticoagulant therapy more frequently achieved partial/complete recanalization. Patients with varices who were treated endoscopically in combination with β-blockade had regression of the varices. The overall mortality was 13% in one year, and was dependent on underlying causes.

Conclusion

Most patients had a combination of local and systemic risk factors for PVT. We observed that partial/complete recanalization was more frequent in patients treated with anticoagulation therapy, and that regression of varices was more pronounced in patients who where treated with active endoscopy combined with pharmacological treatment.

### Idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension [^112wB2Rj]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH) is characterized by an increased portal venous pressure gradient in the absence of a known cause of liver disease and portal vein thrombosis. In contrast to the high prevalence of this disorder in India, INCPH is a rare disease in the Western world. The etiology of INCPH can be divided in five categories: chronic infections, exposure to medication or toxins, thrombophilia, immunological disorders, and genetic disorders. Multifactorial etiology can also be encountered. Chronic abdominal infection is incriminated as the most important etiological factor in Eastern patients and thrombophilia in Western patients. The majority of patients with INCPH initially present with signs or complications of portal hypertension (mainly variceal bleeding and splenomegaly). These patients usually have preserved liver function. Liver function impairment occurs mainly in the context of intercurrent conditions. Patients with INCPH are often clinically and radiologically misdiagnosed as liver cirrhosis, so that a liver biopsy is indispensable to discriminate cirrhosis from INCPH. Histopathological characteristics of INCPH are heterogeneous, demonstrating overlap between several pathological entities (e.g., hepatoportal sclerosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, and incomplete septal cirrhosis). Even though hemodynamical changes in INCPH patients are not comparable to those in cirrhotics, prophylaxis and treatment of variceal bleeding are recommended to be similar. Anticoagulation therapy must be considered only in patients who develop portal vein thrombosis. INCPH has been considered a disorder with a relatively benign disease course. However, liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatopulmonary syndrome can occur and are considered indications for liver transplantation.

American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2020 portal vein thrombosis (PVT) evaluation and management — when "PVT suspected on ultrasound", if there is "Evidence for mesenteric ischemia or severe portal hypertension bleed?" the Yes branch directs "Admit to hospital for emergent evaluation and therapy", whereas No leads to "Obtain contrast-enhanced multiphase cross-sectional imaging to rule out malignant obstruction and confirm diagnosis of partially occlusive or complete main trunk PVT". Next, assess "Does the patient have an accepted indication for TIPS?"; if Yes, "Refer for TIPS to a center with advanced interventional radiology expertise", and if No, "Perform upper endoscopy to assess for high-risk varices and treat if present as per practice guidelines". Then determine "Is the patient an anticoagulation candidate?"; if No, "Follow clinically and manage portal hypertension complications", and if Yes, "If individual patient benefits outweigh risks, initiate therapeutic anticoagulation; consider transplant referral". During therapy, "Repeat cross-sectional imaging every 2 to 3 months on therapy to assess for treatment response or failure".

### AGA clinical practice update on management of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^113erkKG]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis — algorithmic management begins after "PVT characterized on multiphasic cross-sectional imaging"; if "Acute intestinal ischemia?" is present, "Refer for urgent endovascular intervention or surgery". Otherwise, "Perform prophylaxis for variceal bleeding including band ligation* if high risk varices present and NSBB intolerant". For "Recent (< 6 months) thrombosis of intrahepatic branches or < 50% of main trunk, splenic vein, or mesenteric vein", "Consider observation with serial cross-sectional imaging every 3 months", whereas "Recent (< 6 months) thrombosis with 50%–100% occlusion of main PV or mesenteric veins" and "Symptomatic or transplant candidate" lead to "Consider timely AC" (anticoagulation). For "Complete, chronic (> 6 months) PVT with collateralization", the pathway is "No anticoagulation, unlikely to recanalize". Patients with the largest potential anticoagulation benefits are listed as "Awaiting liver transplant", "Progressive thrombus", and "Additional hypercoagulable state (ie, inherited thrombophilia, MPN)".

### Post traumatic intra thoracic spleen presenting with upper GI bleed! – a case report [^111vDpuo]. BMC Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Isolated splenic vein thrombosis with left sided portal hypertension is a rare cause of upper gastrointestinal bleed. Diseases of the pancreas have been identified as the most common cause of isolated splenic vein thrombosis. Thrombophilia, myeloproliferative disorders, gastric, renal pathologies, retroperitoneal fibrosis, wandering spleen, lymphomas or sarcomas and iatrogenic causes such as partial gastrectomy, umbilical vein catheterisation, Warren-Zeppa distal splenorenal shunt surgery and splenectomy are the other rare causes associated.

Diagnosis is difficult and requires a high index of suspicion, especially in patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleed in the presence of splenomegaly and normal liver function tests.

### Portal vein thrombosis [^114LsLYH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis is a condition not infrequently encountered by clinicians. It results from a combination of local and systemic prothrombotic risk factors. The presentation of acute thrombosis varies widely from an asymptomatic state to presence of life-threatening intestinal ischemia and infarction. In the chronic stage, patients typically present with variceal bleeding or other complications of portal hypertension. Abdominal ultrasound color Doppler imaging has a 98% negative predictive value, and is considered the imaging modality of choice in diagnosing portal vein thrombosis. Controlled clinical trials to assist with clinical decision-making are lacking in both acute and chronic portal vein thrombosis. Oral anticoagulant therapy is initiated if the risks of bleeding are low, but long-term anticoagulation is generally not recommended in patients with concomitant hepatic cirrhosis. The roles of invasive therapeutic approaches such as thrombolysis and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt continue to evolve. This review conflates dissenting views into a rational approach of managing patients with portal vein thrombosis for the general internist.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of gastric varices [^113mVzyf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhage, resulting from gastric varies, can be challenging to treat, given the various precipitating etiologies. A wide variety of treatment options exist for managing the diverse range of the underlying disease processes. While cirrhosis is the most common cause for gastric variceal bleeding, occlusion of the portal or splenic vein in noncirrhotic states results in a markedly different treatment paradigm. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Post traumatic intra thoracic spleen presenting with upper GI bleed! – a case report [^113pPAZ2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Paramount to establishing the diagnosis of isolated splenic vein thrombosis is a high index of suspicion often aroused by a history of trauma in the vicinity of splenic vein.

The symptoms and signs most commonly associated with isolated splenic vein thrombosis is gastrointestinal bleeding and abdominal pain along with splenomegaly and normal liver function tests.

A thrombus in the splenic vein causes the venous out flow to return to the portal vein by the way of low pressure collaterals namely the short gastric veins, the veins of the upper half of the stomach, the coronary vein and the gastroepiploic veins. Increased flow across the vessels creates a local form of extrahepatic portal hypertension sometimes referred to as left sided or sinistral portal hypertension. The hypertensive short gastric veins cause increased pressure within the sub mucosal veins of the gastric fundus resulting in gastric varices.

It is difficult to diagnose isolated splenic vein thrombosis both endoscopically and radiologically. Gastric varices may not be recognised with endoscopy. Useful investigations are ultrasound examination, along with contrast enhanced CT, upper GI endoscopy and at times digital subtraction angiography. One prospective study recommended the use of endoscopic ultrasonography, a technique quite sensitive for the determination of isolated gastric varices, in patients with high clinical suspicion.

Splenectomy is the procedure of choice in the management of haemorrhage due to isolated splenic vein thrombosis. There is no consensus on the treatment of asymptomatic patients, as yet.

Gastric varices — risk factors and imaging considerations: The main factors associated with a higher risk of bleeding are localization (IGV1 > GOV2 > GOV1), large size, presence of red spots, and severity of liver dysfunction, and cardiofundal varices are much more frequent in patients with portal vein and/or splenic vein thrombosis, so the finding of these varices should prompt imaging to investigate the presence of such thromboses; in patients with bleeding cardiofundal varices, cross-sectional vascular imaging is preferred given that it would investigate both thrombosis and the presence of gastro- or splenorenal collaterals and would guide management accordingly.

### Prognostic factors in noncirrhotic patients with splanchnic vein thromboses [^112ne9Y1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives and Methods

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), not associated with cancer or liver cirrhosis, is a rare event and scanty data are available on its natural history, long-term prognosis, and treatment. In this study 121 SVT patients consecutively seen from January 1998 to December 2005 were included and 95 of them were followed up for a median time of 41 months. Screening for thrombophilic factors was performed in 104 patients. New thrombotic or bleeding episodes were registered and anticoagulant therapy was performed according to preestablished criteria.

Results

SVT was an incidental finding in 34 (28.1%) patients; 34 (28.1%) presented with abdominal infarction; 39 (32.2%) had bowel ischemia or acute portal vein thrombosis; 14 (11.6%) had bleeding from portal hypertensive sources. Survival rates at 1, 3, and 7 yr were 95%, 93.3%, and 89.6%, respectively; 87.5% of deaths occurred at onset of SVT as complications of intestinal infarction. Patients with isolated portal vein thromboses had symptoms and intestinal infarction in 16/41 (39%) and 0/41 (0%) of the cases, respectively, whereas superior mesenteric vein thromboses, isolated or not, were associated with symptoms and intestinal infarction in 69/75 (92%) and 34/75 (45%), respectively. During the follow-up 14 (14.7%) suffered from 39 episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding with no deaths. A previous gastrointestinal bleed was associated with new hemorrhagic events during follow-up. New venous thrombotic episodes occurred in 10 of 95 patients (10.5%), of which 73% were in the splanchnic area. Seven out of these 10 patients had a chronic myeloproliferative disease (MPD) and none was on anticoagulation.

Conclusions

Anticoagulant therapy was effective to obtain recanalization of acute SVT in 45.4% of patients and preserved patients from recurrent thrombosis when given lifelong.

### Idiopathic portal hypertension and extrahepatic portal venous obstruction [^114DQC5p]. Hepatology International (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on extrahepatic portal vein obstruction:

- **Definition**: Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction is a vascular liver disorder characterized by variceal dilation, ascites, and portal hypertension.
- **Pathophysiology**: Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction is caused by portal vein thrombosis and portal cavernoma.
- **Disease course**: Acute manifestations include abdominal pain, fever, nausea, postprandial fullness, anorexia, general malaise, splenomegaly, and ascites. Progression may lead to variceal bleeding, bowel infarction, perforation, peritonitis, sepsis, metabolic acidosis, renal and respiratory failure, shock, and death due to multiorgan failure. Chronic manifestations range from asymptomatic presentation to complications of portal hypertension such as variceal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, jaundice. Other symptoms include transient ascites, early satiety, abdominal discomfort, intestinal ischemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and portal biliopathy (jaundice, coagulation disturbances, cholangitis, gall stones, hemobilia, and secondary biliary cirrhosis).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 1-year mortality rate for liver transplantation patients with portal vein thrombosis is 15%.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of recanalization of chronic noncirrhotic, nonmalignant splanchnic thromboses with a transsplenic assisted patient-tailored approach with or without transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation. In this retrospective study, 10 patients (median age, 48.4 years; interquartile range, 5.1 years) underwent revascularization between November 2016 and August 2020. Portal cavernoma was present in all patients, with complete splenic vein thrombosis in 70%. The technical success rate was 80%. Additional TIPS creation was performed in 5 (50%) patients. At a median follow-up of 19.3 months (interquartile range, 17.9 months), the primary and secondary patency rate was 70% and 100%, respectively. During follow-up, 1 patient died due to recurrent upper gastrointestinal variceal hemorrhage. In conclusion, percutaneous transsplenic assisted recanalization of chronic noncirrhotic, nonmalignant splanchnic thromboses is feasible. However, multiple access points may still be needed. Additional TIPS creation appears to be necessary only in case of insufficient portal venous flow into the liver.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^116hDABg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Acute mesenteric vein thrombosis — anticoagulation outcomes and adjunctive therapies are summarized: In a systematic review of noncirrhotic acute MVT, 68% received anticoagulation among 80 patients, and mild to moderate self-limited bleeding occurred in 10 cases. Of 50 patients with follow-up imaging, 50% developed long-term sequelae of portal hypertension over a median follow-up of about 2 years. Anticoagulation is given for a finite duration of 3–6 months for reversible etiologies, while indefinite anticoagulation is required for inherited or acquired thrombophilia. In an observational series using streptokinase thrombolysis, treatment was successful in 19 cases and was associated with bleeding in 6 cases without need for major intervention. When intestinal infarction or gangrene is suspected or confirmed, patients are treated with surgical resection, and second-look laparotomy is often required in extensive infarction.

### An unusual presentation of portal vein thrombosis in a 2-year-old girl [^115y3TeH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is the most common cause of extrahepatic portal vein obstruction in children. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and splenomegaly are the most common presenting features. PVT diagnosis is usually delayed in the absence of upper GI bleeding and many children undergo a hematologic work-up due to splenomegaly and signs of hypersplenism. Here, we present a case of a 2-year-old girl who had pancytopenia and splenomegaly. The hematologic work-up including a bone marrow aspirate was unrevealing and she was thought to have viral-induced bone marrow suppression and severe iron deficiency anemia. She presented 2 months later with hematemesis and abdominal CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis of PVT with portal cavernoma. Conclusion: PVT should be suspected in any child who presents with afebrile splenomegaly and signs of hypersplenism even in the absence of upper GI bleeding.

### Association of splanchnic vein thrombosis on survival: 15-year institutional experience with 1561 cases [^114taVRd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is a potentially life‐threatening thrombotic condition that includes thromboses in any of the portal, splenic, hepatic, or mesenteric veins. SVT has an estimated annual incidence of 0.5 to 1 cases per million people per year. 1 SVT presents a clinical challenge for physicians because of a paucity of studies evaluating treatment of SVT and because acute symptoms may go unrecognized with patients not getting diagnosed during the acute phase of the disease. 2, 3

The influence of SVT on survival is uncertain. Deaths associated with SVT could be because of direct causes (such as ascites, liver failure, and infarcted bowel) or indirect causes (such as induction of a thrombogenic state increasing risk of venous thrombosis at other sites, or increased risk of cardiovascular events), but studies are limited. Three studies have used primary data collection to examine survival of patients with SVT but included few participants (ranging from 28 to 97). 2, 4, 5 The largest primary data‐collection study regarding SVT survival involved 604 cases, followed for a median of 2 years, and recorded 106 deaths. 6 These primary data‐collection studies were susceptible to missing deaths from loss to follow‐up. Three SVT studies have used population‐based death registries to completely measure patient survival, but identified cases using diagnostic codes having uncertain accuracy. 7, 8, 9

To our knowledge, no study has examined the influence of patient and thrombus characteristics on death risk in SVT. In addition, the influence of treatment on survival in patients with SVT is also unknown. This study attempted to understand more about the survival of patients with SVT and its influencing factors by creating a complete cohort of patients at an academic hospital. We linked these data with population‐based data sets to examine the incidence, treatment, and complete survival of patients with SVT. The resultant collection of patients represents the largest primary‐data cohort of patients with SVT described in the literature to date and provides insights into current trends in management of SVT.

### Portal vein thrombosis and Budd-Chiari syndrome [^112QAXmN]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Venous thrombosis results from the convergence of vessel wall injury and/or venous stasis, known as local triggering factors, and the occurrence of acquired and/or inherited thrombophilia, also known as systemic prothrombotic risk factors. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) are caused by thrombosis and/or obstruction of the extrahepatic portal veins and the hepatic venous outflow tract, respectively. Several divergent prothrombotic disorders may underlie these distinct forms of large vessel thrombosis. While cirrhotic PVT is relatively common, especially in advanced liver disease, noncirrhotic and nontumoral PVT is rare and BCS is of intermediate incidence. In this article, we review pathogenic mechanisms and current concepts of patient management.

A retrospective study was undertaken to identify patients diagnosed with thrombosis of the portal system and other abdominal veins. The hospital medical records were retrieved based on the selected ICD-10 codes. Clinical presentations were collected and risk factors determined.

Results

From 2000–2009, 467 hospital charts with designated ICD-10 codes of I81, I82.2, I82.3, I82.8, I82.9, or K55.0 were identified. PVT (I81) was the most common thrombosis (194 cases, 41.54%). The majority of PVT patients were males (65%), older than 40 years (75%), and presented with abdominal distension/ascites (69%), splenomegaly (54.6%), and abdominal pain (50.5%). Overall, the predominant risk factor was hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (52.5%), followed by liver cirrhosis without cancer (9.3%), abdominal infection/inflammation (9.3%), cholangiocarcinoma (8.2%), and abdominal intervention (7.7%). In young patients, abdominal interventions including umbilical catheterization (23.1%) and hepatectomy (7.7%) were the most frequent risks whereas in older cases, primary hepatobiliary cancer and cirrhosis (78%) were the major risks. Liver metastases from other organs were infrequently found. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was the main etiology associated with cirrhosis/HCC leading to PVT in this cohort. A third of the older PVT patients (age > 40) had HBV and very few carried hepatitis C virus (HCV) whereas none of the young PVT patients (age < 20) had HBV or HCV. A variety of abdominal infections/inflammations were also found including liver abscess, splenic abscess, cholangitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, omphalitis, and abdominal tuberculosis. Single cases of systemic lymphangiomatosis and Klippel-Trénaunay vascular malformation syndrome were also identified. Other thrombophilic conditions such as myeloproliferative neoplasms, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, protein S deficiency, and anti-phospholipid syndrome were rarely encountered.

Conclusion

HBV is the major risk of PVT in the Southeast Asian population. Several risk factors identified in this population have rarely been described and some are remarkably different from those reported in the West. Host and environmental factors may play a causal role in the initiation and development of PVT in various ethnicities and geographic locations.

### Portal vein thrombosis in the district general hospital: management and clinical outcomes [^117SY4qu]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) refers to a thrombosis that occurs in the extrahepatic portal venous system in the presence or absence of underlying liver disease. The clinical presentation of PVT is extremely variable and there is no absolute consensus on its investigation and management. A paucity of literature examining this clinical entity in the district general hospital is observed.

Methods

We reviewed the experience of two medium-sized district general hospitals in the UK. Twenty-five patients, who were diagnosed with PVT, were identified from the electronic databases of the two hospitals from 1994 to 2007.

Results

Fifty-six percent of patients were females with a median age of 59 years. Seventy-six percent of patients had an identifiable comorbidity at presentation, the most common being chronic liver disease. The most frequently presenting symptom was abdominal pain and distension (60%). Twenty-four percent of patients presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to oesophageal and/or gastric varices. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomographical imaging were the imaging modalities most commonly used to diagnose PVT, although abdominal ultrasound missed 12% of patients subsequently diagnosed by other methods. Fifty percent of patients, who had a thrombophilia screen, were found to have a coagulopathy. Twenty-eight percent of patients were anticoagulated with warfarin with no adverse bleeding events observed. Forty-four percent of patients were placed on an endoscopic variceal band ligation programme. Nine patients died over the study period from either upper gastrointestinal bleeding, end-stage liver failure or biliary sepsis. The acturial 5-year survival was 72%.

Conclusion

The mortality from PVT is low and survival is related to the underlying cause. Although the diagnosis of PVT remains uncommon outside the specialist centre, both specialist and nonspecialist physicians must remain mindful of this important condition.

Portal vein thrombosis — clinical features and imaging: In patients without cirrhosis, acute thrombosis can involve variable extents of the portal vein and presents with acute abdominal pain, often located in the upper abdomen, and fever is also a common symptom and raises suspicion for an acute intraabdominal process such as diverticulitis, or pylephlebitis; contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) can aid discerning value to the diagnosis of PVT by enhancing differences of bland and tumor thromboses.

American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidance — new features and changes include an overview of the current understanding of bleeding and thrombosis in cirrhosis and an evidence-based justification for bleeding risk assessment in patients with cirrhosis before invasive procedures, including current concepts in preprocedural testing and laboratory analysis and their role in predicting bleeding complications. The guidance outlines established and recently identified risk factors for venous thrombosis in the portal and hepatic venous systems in both patients with and without cirrhosis along with thrombophilia testing recommendations, and it reviews the strengths and weaknesses of various classification systems for portal vein thrombosis with a proposal for standard nomenclature regarding characterization of portal vein thrombosis location, time course, and progression. It provides a comprehensive review of procedural and medical therapies for treatment of portal vein thrombosis including the use of direct oral anticoagulants, offers a step-by-step treatment and surveillance algorithm for portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis, and delivers updated diagnostic, treatment, and management recommendations for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and hepatic vein thrombosis.

### Global coagulation assessment in portal vein thrombosis and Budd-Chiari syndrome (liv-thrombus) [^115Urxux]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Portal vein thrombosis is defined as partial or complete occlusion of the portal vein lumen by the blood clot or its replacement by multiple collateral vessels with the hepato-petal flow, known as 'portal cavernoma'. Based on the published literature, 15–25% of patients with cirrhosis have portal vein thrombosis, and 35–50% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have malignant PVT compared to 1–3. 8 per 100, 000 patients in the general population. The reported cumulative incidence of PVT in patients of Child-Pugh A and B is 4. 6% and
10. 7% at 1 and 5 years respectively with higher incidence among those with decompensated disease or with an underlying hypercoagulable disorder. Similarly, the prevalence of PVT in compensated cirrhosis is around 1% which increases to 8
- 25% in liver transplant candidates and 40% in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Based on the published literature 7–9% of all chronic liver disease patients have hepatic vein outflow tract obstruction in the Indian population. HVOTO is defined as obstruction to hepatic venous outflow at any site from the right atrium inlet to the small hepatic venules. The Budd-Chiari syndrome results from occlusion of one or more hepatic veins and/or the inferior vena cava. In the West, the most common cause is HV occlusion by thrombosis. More recent Indian studies have however shown that isolated HV and combined IVC+HV obstruction are now more common. In the post COVID-19 era, there has been great interest in the prothrombotic states associated with the SARS-Cov-2 virus infection, and the adverse effects of some vaccines.

With the availability of better molecular tests for hypercoagulable states, use of global coagulation tests like rotational thromboelastometry, thromboelastography and Sonoclot, use of therapeutic procedures like Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, availability of novel oral anticoagulants, the natural course of disease can be changed with good outcomes. Standard Coagulation tests like PT, aPTT, and platelet count are not predictive of bleeding or coagulation risk as they exclude the cellular elements of hemostasis and are unable to assess the effect of thrombomodulin and cannot assess the stage of the coagulation pathway which is affected. Global coagulation tests provide dynamic information on the coagulation pathway that is not available from conventional tests. Our proposed study is important for the following 4 reasons.
- SCTs cannot be used to demonstrate the thrombomodulin mediated normal thrombin generation in patients with liver disease, so the monitoring of such patient using global coagulation tests can be validated. The use of point-of-care global coagulation tests like ROTEM and Sonoclot enables us to identify the true prothrombotic and hypocoagulable states which can be used to assess for increased clot strength, clot formation time, and indicate hyperfibrinolysis. The use of conventional tests like prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and INR cannot bolster the therapeutic strategy.
- This study will also help to determine the prevalence and role of CALR, JAK2V617F, factor V Leiden mutations in patients with PVT and HVOTO in our population.
- We will also be prospectively assessing the rate of thrombophilia complications in the Post COVID-19 era, and the study will generate information regarding new incidence of PVT/HVOTO in those exposed to COVID-19.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) terminology and classification — standardization is emphasized as PVT is a heterogeneous condition with respect to etiology, manifestations, natural history, and therapeutic options, and it is desirable to establish standardized terminology to allow comparison and external validation of future studies; in regard to time course of thrombosis, the term "recent" is preferred to the term "acute", and the term "chronic" should be applied to a PV obstruction persisting longer than 6 months after presumed onset, with justification from a study in 100 patients with recent PVT followed up until 1 year in which recanalization that did not take place within 6 months did not occur between 6 and 12 months; following the onset of a PV obstruction not followed by regression, cavernous transformation may develop within a few weeks, and when portal cavernous transformation is present, this term should be preferred to "chronic portal vein thrombosis"; Table 5 recommends standardized nomenclature including time course (Recent: PVT presumed to be present for < 6 months; Chronic: PVT present or persistent for > 6 months), percent occlusion of main PV (Completely occlusive: No persistent lumen; Partially occlusive: Clot obstructing > 50% of original vessel lumen; Minimally occlusive: Clot obstructing < 50% of original vessel lumen), and response to treatment or interval change (Progressive: Thrombus increases in size or progresses to more complete occlusion; Stable: No appreciable change in size or occlusion; Regressive: Thrombus decreases in size or degree of occlusion).

Guidance statements — management of recent PVT by clinical setting and extent of portal vein (PV) occlusion are as follows: "In all patients with recent PVT and concern for intestinal ischemia, immediate consultation with surgery, critical care, interventional radiology, and hematology is recommended, with the need for surgery in cases of intestinal infarction". "In patients without cirrhosis and with recent PVT, directed antithrombotic therapy should be considered in order to avoid intestinal ischemia and prevent the development of chronic PVT with portal hypertension". For patients with cirrhosis, "Treatment should be considered on a case-by- case basis", and "Decisions for treatment of an individual patient should be based on expected benefit and minimization of clot extension risk". In cirrhosis with minimally occlusive "(< 50% obstruction of the lumen)" thrombosis of the main PV, "observation with serial imaging every 3 months without therapy is reasonable. Treatment for progressive clot should then be considered in this setting". The guidance also notes a separate scenario of "occlusive or partially occlusive (> 50% obstruction of the lumen) thrombosis of the main PV or mesenteric veins".

### Improved prognosis and low failure rate with anticoagulation as first-line therapy in mesenteric venous thrombosis [^112TtNm1]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Identification of all patients with MVT treated surgically or non-surgically in Malmö University Hospital between 2000 and 2015 based on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), tenth edition, codes I81 (portal vein thrombosis [PVT] or MVT) and K55 (mesenteric ischemia), and AuriculA (national quality register for anticoagulant treatment). Patient records and all CT images in patients with PVT or MVT as well as unclear cases of mesenteric ischemia were scrutinized. Patients with thrombosis in the superior mesenteric vein with or without anatomical involvement of portal or splenic veins were included in the present study. Patients diagnosed 2000–2006 have been reported upon previously. The patient series was pragmatically divided at the study protocol stage into two periods, the former (2000–2007) and the latter (2008–2015), for analysis of changes in patient characteristics, risk factor profile, mode of diagnosis, and outcome. In emergencies, single-detector row CT was performed between 2000 and 2003, and multi-detector row CT from 2004 and onwards. Mortality data were obtained from the Swedish Population Registry. Median follow-up after diagnosis for patients with MVT was 62 (interquartile range [IQR] 24–128) months. End of follow-up was September 29, 2017. The study was approved by the Research Ethical Review Board in Lund (Dnr 2015/143).

### Portal vein thrombosis: what is the role of genetics? [^111qPsv4]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

The aetiology of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in adults is complex. Risk factors include local precipitating factors and acquired and inherited factors, an area in which there has been much recent progress. Although PVT in the absence of cirrhosis may be regarded as a somewhat different disorder to PVT in the presence of cirrhosis, in both cases most studies support a role of the prothrombin G20210A mutation. Some differences in risk factors observed between different studies may relate partly to referral patterns or study design, although individual patients may develop PVT as a result of differing combinations of risk factors. The demonstration of an inherited thrombophilic mutation in a subset of PVT may ultimately inform clinical management regarding the use and duration of anticoagulation therapy, although there is a need for evidence from randomized-controlled clinical trial data.

### Splanchnic vein thrombosis (2003–2022): a Swiss nationwide epidemiological study [^113xaYgj]. Thrombosis Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is a rare form of venous thromboembolism with limited epidemiological data. This study aims to provide a detailed overview in Switzerland using administrative records.

Methods

We analysed nationwide patient-level data on SVT-related hospitalizations, including portal, splenic, and hepatic (Budd-Chiari syndrome) vein thrombosis from 2003 to 2022. We assessed trends in crude and age-standardized incidence rates, proportion of SVT-related hospitalizations, readmission rates as well as gender differences, comorbidities, clinical features, and in-hospital outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of in-hospital death.

Results

SVT was recorded in 17,966 hospitalizations (35% women) involving 13,689 patients. Portal vein thrombosis was the most frequent manifestation, followed by splenic, hepatic and multisegmental thrombosis. Age-standardized incidence rate increased from 0.4 (95% CI: 0.3–0.4) per 10,000 general population in 2003 to 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4–1.6) in 2022, with rising proportions of SVT-related hospitalizations and readmission rates. Case fatality rate remained steady at 13% and was highest for portal vein thrombosis. For most SVT subtypes, incidence rate was higher in males and case fatality rate in females. Predictors of in-hospital death included liver failure, intestinal infectious diseases, cancer. Common comorbidities included non-neoplastic abdominal diseases (14,010; 78%), cardiovascular diseases (11,214; 62%), and cancer (8510; 47%). Diagnostic or therapeutic procedures involved 56% of cases, intensive care stay 19%, and median length of stay was 11 days (Q1-Q3 5–19).

Conclusion

Despite its rarity, SVT is characterized by substantial morbidity and in-hospital mortality. Further research is needed to validate these findings and improve patient management.

### Acute portal vein thrombosis unrelated to cirrhosis: a prospective multicenter follow-up study [^114HqGJs]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Current recommendations for early anticoagulation in acute portal vein thrombosis unrelated to cirrhosis or malignancy are based on limited evidence. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the risk factors, outcome, and prognosis in patients managed according to these recommendations. We enrolled 102 patients with acute thrombosis of the portal vein, or its left or right branch. Laboratory investigations for prothrombotic factors were centralized. Thrombus extension and recanalization were assessed by expert radiologists. A local risk factor was identified in 21% of patients, and one or several general prothrombotic conditions in 52%. Anticoagulation was given to 95 patients. After a median of 234 days, the portal vein and its left or right branch were patent in 39% of anticoagulated patients (versus 13% initially), the splenic vein in 80% (versus 57% initially), and the superior mesenteric vein in 73% (versus 42% initially). Failure to recanalize the portal vein was independently related to the presence of ascites (hazard ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval 1.3–11.1) and an occluded splenic vein (hazard ratio 3.5, 95% confidence interval 1.4–8.9). Gastrointestinal bleeding and intestinal infarction occurred in nine and two patients, respectively. Two patients died from causes unrelated to thrombosis or anticoagulation therapy.

Conclusion

Recanalization occurs in one-third of patients receiving early anticoagulation for acute portal vein thrombosis, whereas thrombus extension, intestinal infarction, severe bleeding, and death are rare. Alternative therapy should be considered when ascites and splenic vein obstruction are present.
