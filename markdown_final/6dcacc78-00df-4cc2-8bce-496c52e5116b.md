## Question

Which diagnostic tests should be ordered for a patient worried about Lyme disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnostic tests should be ordered for a patient worried about Lyme disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when a clinical diagnosis is sufficient versus when laboratory testing is required. Then, I should verify pretest probability and epidemiologic exposure to avoid false positives. Next, I will review the standard two-tier serologic algorithm, including timing of IgM versus IgG, and the CDC-accepted modified two-tier option. After that, I need to check syndrome-specific testing for neuroborreliosis, arthritis, and carditis. Finally, I should confirm key caveats such as the serologic window period, avoidance of unvalidated tests, and interpretation nuances in low-incidence areas, and then summarize an algorithmic workflow based on the guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the role of erythema migrans (EM). If a patient has a characteristic EM lesion (gradually expanding annular lesion > 5 cm) and plausible tick exposure in an endemic area, the diagnosis is clinical, and I should treat without laboratory testing; if the rash is atypical but suspicious, I should obtain acute-phase serology and, if negative, repeat convalescent serology in 2–4 weeks to capture seroconversion, rather than using direct-detection tests on blood or skin that are not recommended for routine diagnosis in this setting [^1124NaRM] [^114AGEKL] [^113h87yb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before assessing pretest probability. I need to consider residence or travel to a high-incidence region and objective clinical findings because in low-incidence settings the positive predictive value can be as low as about 10%, and many apparent positives may actually reflect background seropositivity or cross-reactivity; travel history is essential, as a large fraction of true cases in low-incidence states are travel-related [^112EnP9F] [^112rbLM8] [^112x6bzw].

> Next, I should review when testing is and is not indicated. I should not test asymptomatic patients, those with classic EM (because diagnosis is clinical), patients seeking a test of cure (antibodies can persist for years), or those with only nonspecific symptoms without objective signs; conversely, I should test patients with high pretest probability and objective findings suggestive of disseminated disease such as arthritis, certain neurologic syndromes, or carditis, and I need to counsel that prior seropositivity may persist and complicate interpretation on repeat testing [^114bGYmQ] [^113h87yb] [^1115SAyz].

> I will now examine the standard testing algorithm. For patients without EM, I should order standard two-tier serology: a sensitive first-tier EIA/ELISA/IFA, with reflex immunoblot only if positive or equivocal; within the first 4 weeks of illness, I should interpret both IgM and IgG, but after 4 weeks I should rely on IgG only because isolated IgM is prone to false positives; I need to remember that early sensitivity is limited (roughly 30–40%) during the window period and rises substantially in disseminated disease; and wait, let me verify the update — CDC also accepts modified two-tier EIA/EIA algorithms as an alternative to immunoblot-based confirmation [^113h87yb] [^1139tBpJ] [^116awJTo].

> For suspected Lyme neuroborreliosis, I should confirm that testing targets the right compartment. I need to obtain serum and CSF simultaneously to calculate a CSF:serum antibody index when CNS involvement is suspected, avoid ordering CSF serology alone without the index, and not routinely order PCR or culture of CSF or serum; testing is indicated for patients with epidemiologically plausible exposure and specific neurologic syndromes such as acute meningitis, painful radiculoneuritis, mononeuropathy multiplex, certain acute cranial neuropathies (especially VII), or objective spinal cord or brain inflammation with compatible features [^113h87yb] [^111Ed33Q] [^114bGYmQ].

> For suspected Lyme arthritis, I should confirm that serum antibody testing remains first-line and that synovial PCR is reserved for select cases. Specifically, I should obtain standard two-tier serum antibody testing; if the patient is seropositive but the diagnosis remains uncertain and the result would change management, I can consider PCR of synovial fluid or tissue rather than culture; I should not rely on PCR or culture of blood or routine synovial testing in seronegative patients with low suspicion [^114R3x6K] [^1179ikyu].

> For suspected Lyme carditis, I need to ensure prompt cardiac evaluation. If a patient has dyspnea, dizziness, syncope, palpitations, or evidence of AV block or myocarditis/pericarditis in an appropriate epidemiologic context, I should obtain a screening ECG and order standard two-tier serology; in cases of unexplained acute myocarditis or pericarditis with plausible exposure, Lyme testing should be considered [^114mQrsK] [^112969yZ] [^114dYEPt].

> Let me consider important caveats and counseling. If early disease is suspected but initial serology is negative, I should arrange convalescent-phase testing 2–4 weeks later to catch seroconversion; I should also warn against unvalidated or non–FDA-cleared tests, including alternative culture methods, urine antigen tests, and routine PCR of blood, which risk false positives and misdiagnosis; only FDA-cleared tests should be used to inform routine care [^113h87yb] [^114iK2Vr].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about testing or identifying the removed tick. Initially, I might say that species identification of the tick is not recommended for management decisions because it rarely changes clinical care and tick testing for Borrelia should not guide treatment; but hold on, I should verify that some guidance does suggest sending the removed tick for species identification, even though in practice this generally does not alter immediate patient management and should not substitute for clinical risk assessment and appropriate serologic testing when indicated [^113h87yb] [^112giUEn].

> I should double-check interpretation in low-incidence areas. Positive results may represent false positives due to cross-reactive conditions or background seropositivity, so I need to anchor on exposure history and objective signs, recognize look-alikes such as Southern tick–associated rash illness in the Southeast, and remember that many confirmed cases in low-incidence states are travel-associated, which should shape pretest probability and posttest interpretation [^112EnP9F] [^113AMmuK] [^112x6bzw].

> Let me now summarize the algorithm to ensure fidelity to the guidelines. EM present with risk exposure means diagnose clinically and treat without testing; no EM but high suspicion warrants standard two-tier serology with attention to timing and potential convalescent testing; neurologic signs compatible with Lyme in an exposed patient call for serum testing and, when CNS involvement is suspected, CSF and serum for an antibody index; cardiac symptoms suggestive of Lyme carditis warrant an ECG plus serology; arthritis merits serum antibodies first and selective synovial PCR in seropositive but uncertain cases; in low pretest probability scenarios, I should counsel about false-positive risks and often defer testing, documenting shared decision-making [^114bGYmQ] [^113h87yb] [^111Ed33Q] [^114mQrsK].

Order testing based on clinical presentation and exposure risk [^112EnP9F]: **do not test when classic erythema migrans is present** [^1124NaRM] [^113h87yb]; use **two-tier serology for other symptoms** [^1139tBpJ] [^116awJTo]; add synovial PCR only when indicated [^1179ikyu]; and avoid CSF PCR [^1139tBpJ] [^114bGYmQ].

- **Classic erythema migrans (EM)**: Diagnose clinically [^1124NaRM]; do not order serologic tests [^113h87yb].
- **Other symptoms with plausible exposure**: Order two-tier serology [^113h87yb] (EIA/ELISA or IFA, then Western blot if positive/equivocal) [^1139tBpJ] [^116awJTo].
- **Neurologic symptoms**: If CSF is obtained, test CSF and serum for intrathecal antibody index [^114bGYmQ]; avoid CSF PCR/culture [^112rbLM8].
- **Lyme arthritis**: Use serum antibody testing [^114R3x6K]; consider synovial fluid PCR if diagnosis remains uncertain [^1179ikyu].
- **Lyme carditis**: Obtain ECG [^114dYEPt] if cardiac symptoms are present [^114mQrsK].
- **Do not order**: Standalone IgM [^112rbLM8], unvalidated tests [^114iK2Vr], or PCR/culture of blood/serum [^117FpJFv].

Testing should be **guided by symptoms** [^117UB8f9], **exposure risk** [^112EnP9F], and **timing** [^113h87yb] to avoid false results and unnecessary costs [^111PRmP6].

### Current guidelines, common clinical pitfalls, and future directions for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease, United States [^1139tBpJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In the United States, Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted to humans by blacklegged ticks. Patients with an erythema migrans lesion and epidemiologic risk can receive a diagnosis without laboratory testing. For all other patients, laboratory testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but proper interpretation depends on symptoms and timing of illness.

The recommended laboratory test in the United States is a two-tiered serologic analysis consisting of an enzyme-linked immunoassay or immunofluorescence assay, followed by reflexive immunoblotting. Sensitivity of two-tiered testing is low (30%-40%) during early infection while the antibody response is developing (window period). For disseminated Lyme disease, sensitivity is 70%-100%. Specificity is high (> 95%) during all stages of disease. Use of other diagnostic tests for Lyme disease is limited.

We review the rationale behind US testing guidelines, appropriate use and interpretation of tests, and recent developments in Lyme disease diagnostics.

### Concerns regarding a new culture method for Borrelia burgdorferi not approved for the diagnosis of Lyme disease [^114iK2Vr]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

In 2005, CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning regarding the use of Lyme disease tests whose accuracy and clinical usefulness have not been adequately established. Often, these are laboratory-developed tests (also known as "home brew" tests) that are manufactured and used within a single laboratory and have not been cleared or approved by the FDA. Recently, the CDC has received inquiries regarding a laboratory-developed test that uses a novel culture method to identify Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochete that causes Lyme disease. Patient specimens reportedly are incubated using a two-step pre-enrichment process, followed by immunostaining with or without polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Specimens that test positive by immunostaining or PCR are deemed "culture positive".

Published methods and results for this laboratory-developed test have been reviewed by the CDC. The review raised serious concerns about false-positive results caused by laboratory contamination and the potential for misdiagnosis. The CDC recommends that laboratory tests cleared or approved by the FDA be used to aid in the routine diagnosis of Lyme disease. A complete searchable list of such tests is available online.

When evaluating testing options, providers and their patients might be confused by the distinction between Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification of laboratories and FDA clearance or approval of specific tests. CLIA certification of a laboratory indicates that the laboratory meets a set of basic quality standards.

### Convergence and divergence of empathic concern and empathic happiness in early childhood: Evidence from young infants and children [^116Ssm1e]. Child Development (2024). Low credibility.

We tested our hypotheses using a path model, in which empathic happiness, hypothesis testing to happiness, empathic concern, and hypothesis testing to distress were allowed to covary. Covariates, such as child age and sex, were included in the model. The model was estimated using Mplus version 8.5 with FIML estimation. Statcheck did not detect any errors in statistical reporting.

- **Results**: The descriptive statistics and first-order correlations appear in the relevant tables. The results of the path analysis are depicted in a figure showing that hypothesis testing to happiness correlated with hypothesis testing to distress (β = .310, p < 0.001, 95% CI [.020, .086]). Additionally, hypothesis testing to distress and empathic concern were correlated (β = .453, p < 0.001, 95% CI [.075, .199]).

The path model of the relationships between emotional and cognitive empathy to happiness and distress showed significant paths in bold. Sex was controlled in the analysis.

### Estimating the frequency of Lyme disease diagnoses, United States, 2010–2018 [^111uwogA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The estimates we report are influenced by the uncertainties of clinical practice, in which patients are often treated presumptively, inevitably resulting in some degree of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In contrast, cases reported through national Lyme disease surveillance meet a standardized case definition and are more likely to represent actual infections. However, routine surveillance is subject to substantial underreporting, previously estimated at between 3- and 12-fold for Lyme disease. The difference between our estimate and the ≈35,000 cases reported annually through surveillance is a result of the combined effects of underreporting of infections and overdiagnosis in clinical practice. Our analysis does not enable us to discern the relative contribution of each. Although we implemented restrictions to mitigate inclusion of retreatment for nonincident diagnoses, overdiagnosis could account for the proportionally higher number of diagnoses in residents of low-incidence states (19%) compared to what is typically seen in public health surveillance (≈5%).

Our findings underscore the large clinical burden associated with Lyme disease diagnoses in the United States. Evolving electronic medical and laboratory systems should help fill demonstrable data gaps and enable more robust and reliable monitoring of changes in the magnitude and spread of the disease. Effective interventions are needed, and improved awareness among clinicians and the public is paramount to foster early and accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Rating the Efficacy of Diagnostic Imaging Studies Conducted for the Workup of Musculoskeletal Tumors [^116uWaG3]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Concerns for missed diagnoses have led to increased ordering of diagnostic imaging. Patients with suspected musculoskeletal tumors may undergo nondiagnostic and unnecessary imaging studies before referral to a musculoskeletal oncologist. This can result in patients receiving excessive radiation exposures, accruing unnecessary costs, delays in treatment, and an unnecessary burden on healthcare systems.

Purpose

The purposes of this study were to (1) internally rate the usefulness of imaging tests completed for musculoskeletal oncology patients undergoing evaluation using a novel scoring system, (2) determine the inter-rater reliability of providers who rated imaging tests, and (3) assess the costs incurred for imaging studies based on Medicare reimbursement rates.

Methods

A single-center, retrospective study was conducted on 112 patients who presented to our musculoskeletal oncology clinic for workup of a suspected mass from February 2021 to May 2021. After obtaining institutional review board approval, information regarding all radiographic images pertinent to the patient's workup was collected through a manual chart review. Patient information and images were sent to six fellowship-trained physicians for review. Providers then graded the appropriateness of each study using a five-point rating system. Final diagnoses were divided into three categories: bone lesions, soft-tissue lesions, and metastatic skeletal lesions. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using interclass correlation coefficient tests. The cost of wasteful tests was calculated using Medicare

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria**: Advise patients of the risk of serious infection. Inform patients of the need to complete or update their vaccinations against encapsulated bacteria at least two weeks prior to receiving the first dose of Fabhalta or to receive antibacterial drug prophylaxis if Fabhalta treatment must be initiated immediately and they have not been previously vaccinated. Inform patients of the requirement to be revaccinated according to ACIP recommendations for encapsulated bacteria while on Fabhalta therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

	Inform patients that vaccination may not prevent serious infection and to seek immediate medical attention if the following signs or symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]:
	- Fever with or without shivers or chills
	- Fever and a rash
	- Fever with chest pain and cough
	- Fever with breathlessness/fast breathing
	- Fever with high heart rate
	- Headache with nausea or vomiting
	- Headache and a fever
	- Headache with a stiff neck or stiff back
	- Confusion
	- Body aches with flu-like symptoms
	- Clammy skin
	- Eyes sensitive to light

Inform patients that they will be given a Patient Safety Card for Fabhalta that they should carry with them at all times during and for two weeks following treatment with Fabhalta. This card describes symptoms which, if experienced, should prompt the patient to seek immediate medical evaluation.

### To test or not to test? Laboratory support for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis: a position paper of ESGBOR, the ESCMID study group for Lyme borreliosis [^1133s75b]. Clinical microbiology and infection (2018). Low credibility.

Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a tick-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The most frequent clinical manifestations are erythema migrans and Lyme neuroborreliosis. Currently, a large volume of diagnostic testing for LB is reported, whereas the incidence of clinically relevant disease manifestations is low. This indicates overuse of diagnostic testing for LB with implications for patient care and cost-effective health management.

- **Aim**: The recommendations provided in this review are intended to support both the clinical diagnosis and initiatives for a more rational use of laboratory testing in patients with clinically suspected LB.

- **Sources**: This is a narrative review combining various aspects of the clinical and laboratory diagnosis with an educational purpose. The literature search was based on existing systematic reviews, national and international guidelines, and supplemented with specific citations.

- **Implications**: The main recommendations according to European case definitions for LB are as follows. Typical erythema migrans should be diagnosed clinically and does not require laboratory testing. The diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis requires laboratory investigation of the spinal fluid, including intrathecal antibody production, and the remaining disease manifestations require testing for serum antibodies to B. burgdorferi. Testing individuals with non-specific subjective symptoms is not recommended because of a low positive predictive value.

### Current guidelines, common clinical pitfalls, and future directions for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease, United States [^114KAdGe]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The discovery of B. burgdorferi as the causative agent of Lyme disease in 1982 prompted the development of numerous tests by clinical and private laboratories. Because spirochetes only transiently enter the bloodstream of infected persons in small numbers, direct detection of B. burgdorferi by PCR or culture has been challenging. For this reason, most diagnostic test development has focused on the indirect detection of infection by assessing the antibody response of the patient.

Initially, the variety of serologic tests and lack of concordance among different methods necessitated standardization. In 1994, leading experts convened to review the evidence and devise a standard testing strategy. After evaluating the evidence, it became clear that no single test was sufficient on its own. To maximize clinical utility and specificity, the conference diagnostic working group ultimately decided on a two-tiered serologic testing algorithm.

- **Two-tiered testing algorithm**:
	- The first tier uses a highly sensitive EIA or IFA that, if the result is positive or equivocal, is followed by a highly specific Western immunoblot as the second-tier test.
	- Western immunoblot was included in response to a multicenter evaluation of laboratories performing Lyme disease testing, which found that using Western immunoblot in addition to EIA increased specificity to > 98%, reducing false-positive results produced by the first-tier EIA.

### Common misconceptions about Lyme disease [^1178z7RT]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Lyme disease, an infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, is a focally endemic tick-transmitted zoonosis. Over the three decades since the responsible spirochete was identified, a series of misconceptions and misunderstandings have become widely prevalent. This has led to frequent misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.

- **Diagnostic tools**: Persistent misconceptions concern the reliability of available diagnostic tools. Misunderstandings about the signs and symptoms of nervous system involvement are also common.
- **Antimicrobial therapy**: There is confusion regarding the appropriate choice and duration of antimicrobial therapy.
- **Curability**: Debates continue over the curability of the infection.
- **Persistent symptoms**: Some symptoms may persist in patients after treatment, causing further misconceptions.

Concern about disparate perspectives led the Institute of Medicine to review the subject. In this article, we review the principal misconceptions, discussing their origins and the best available scientific evidence related to each one.

### Suspicion of Lyme borreliosis in patients referred to an infectious diseases clinic: What did the patients really have [^116hneF3]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Low credibility.

To evaluate the conditions behind the symptoms in patients with suspected Lyme borreliosis (LB) who were referred to an infectious diseases clinic, a retrospective, population-based study was conducted. Data was collected from the medical records of all patients referred for infectious disease consultations in 2013 due to presumed LB from a population of 1.58 million. Patients were classified according to the certainty of LB based on their symptoms, signs, and laboratory results. Data on outcomes and subsequent alternative diagnoses during the 4-year follow-up period were reviewed from all available patient records from public, private, and occupational healthcare providers.

A total of 256 patients (16 per 100000) were referred as a result of suspicion of LB. Among these, 30 (12%) were classified with definite LB, 36 (14%) with probable LB, and 65 (25%) with possible LB. LB was deemed unlikely in 121 (47%) patients. A novel diagnosis was discovered in the background symptoms in 73 (29%) of patients. Previously diagnosed comorbidities caused at least some symptoms in 48 (19%) patients. Other explanations for symptoms were found in 81 (67%) of 121 of unlikely and 22 (34%) of 65 of possible LB patients. The spectrum of conditions behind the symptoms was quite broad and most often included musculoskeletal, neurological, psychological, or functional disorders.

In conclusion, LB was unlikely in half of the patients with presumed LB. In most cases, the patients had other conditions that explained their symptoms.

### Prospective comparison of two enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays for the diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis [^112MevEa]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

No data are provided in the instruction manual of the LymeSpot assay with regard to the diagnostic performance of this assay. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has investigated the diagnostic capacity of the LymeSpot assay for the diagnosis of active LNB. The diagnostic performance of the LymeSpot assay for other manifestations of LB has not yet been investigated thoroughly and remains unclear. Hopefully, more validation studies will be performed, which will include other manifestations of LB, as well as follow‐up studies to understand more clearly the diagnostic potential for treatment monitoring.

### Diagnosing onychomycosis [^1132RRBY]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of onychomycosis may require the use of mycological diagnostic testing to supplement the clinical presentation. To verify the presence of onychomycosis, the viability, penetrance, and species of the fungal infection should be determined. The most common diagnostic tests are mycological culture, direct microscopic examination, histopathologic study, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests. Each of these tests has individual strengths in satisfying the three criteria, with a minimum of two positive diagnostic tests being the gold standard for confirming all three diagnostic criteria.

### Notes from the field: Reference laboratory investigation of patients with clinically diagnosed Lyme disease and babesiosis - Indiana, 2016 [^112EK5TQ]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Lyme disease and babesiosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients with clinically compatible illness and potential exposure to I. scapularis ticks in areas where the pathogens are present. Physicians in low-prevalence states can increase the positive predictive value of laboratory testing by carefully selecting patients for testing, following established diagnostic recommendations, and using certified or accredited laboratories.

### When diagnostic testing leads to harm: A new outcomes-based approach for laboratory medicine [^114kXCBE]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Low credibility.

An outcomes-based approach to measuring testing-related diagnostic error represents an important shift for many laboratory personnel, clinicians, and others interested in improving the quality of testing procedures. This approach requires the development of measures linked to each of the five causes of testing-related diagnostic error. While examples of such measures are sprinkled throughout the medical literature, more systematic development is necessary.

Ordering inappropriate tests is a recognized problem, typically considered in relation to cost savings and reducing test volume. With few exceptions, the impact of inappropriate testing on patient outcomes is rarely reported, and the impact on diagnostic error remains undocumented. Some laboratories have addressed the risk of false positives by monitoring the ordering of tests that are prone to misordering, such as certain thyroid tests. Moreover, some have developed methods to detect inappropriate repetition of test orders, usually associated with standing orders.

- **Development and implementation of measures**: These measures reflect the failure to order appropriate tests during a diagnostic work-up. This will be more straightforward in some instances than in others. For presenting complaints with standard protocols, such as troponin tests for chest pain, measuring compliance should be relatively clear-cut. However, limitations in information technology may still impede implementation. In scenarios where standard protocols do not exist, developing measures for the failure to order appropriate tests is more complex.

### Is it possible to make a correct diagnosis of Lyme disease on symptoms alone? Review of key issues and public health implications [^114yENZC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

There is much confusion and misinformation about the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease. This review explains why it is not possible to make a correct diagnosis of Lyme disease based solely on symptoms. It also provides evidence supporting the validity of two-tier testing for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease. The public health consequences of neglecting these issues are discussed.

### Lyme disease testing practices, Wisconsin, USA, 2016–2019 [^1115SAyz]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Although serologic testing on persons who previously tested positive for Lyme disease is often not clinically relevant because antibodies to B. burgdorferi may persist years after infection, we found that up to 15% of persons with positive serologic tests per year also tested positive in a previous calendar year. The frequency of such repeat positives increased with patient age.

Our findings provide evidence that a percentage of reported Lyme disease cases each year may not reflect incident Lyme disease, and that percentage increases with patient age. This might explain the substantial increase in reported Lyme disease cases among older adults beginning in 2022. Knowledge of the frequency and characteristics of repeat testing among persons who have previously tested positive improves our ability to interpret national Lyme disease surveillance data in a more appropriate context.

### Cefuroxime axetil [^1147HkLw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Two adequate and well-controlled trials were performed on subjects with early Lyme disease. All subjects presented with physician-documented erythema migrans, with or without systemic manifestations of infection. Subjects were assessed at one month post-treatment for success in treating early Lyme disease (Part I) and at one year post-treatment for success in preventing the progression to the sequelae of late Lyme disease (Part II).

A total of 355 adult subjects (181 treated with cefuroxime axetil and 174 treated with doxycycline) were randomized in the two trials, with a diagnosis of early Lyme disease confirmed in 79% (281/355). The clinical diagnosis of early Lyme disease in these subjects was validated by: 1) blinded expert reading of photographs, when available, of the pretreatment erythema migrans skin lesion, and 2) serologic confirmation using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot assay ("Western" blot) of the presence of antibodies specific to Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease. The efficacy data in Table 11 are specific to this "validated" patient subset, while the safety data below reflect the entire patient population for the two trials. Clinical data for evaluable subjects in the "validated" patient subset are shown in Table 11.

Cefuroxime axetil and doxycycline were effective in the prevention of the development of sequelae of late Lyme disease. While the incidence of drug-related gastrointestinal adverse reactions was similar in the two treatment groups (cefuroxime axetil - 13%; doxycycline - 11%), the inci

### Evaluation of the child with acute ataxia: A systematic review [^115XCJEi]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute ataxia in a child poses a dilemma for the clinician in determining the extent and timing of initial screening tests. This article reviews the evidence concerning the diagnostic yield of commonly ordered tests in evaluating the child with acute ataxia. The literature revealed the following frequencies of laboratory screening abnormalities in children with acute ataxia: CT (∼2.5%), MRI (∼5%), lumbar puncture (43%), EEG (42%), and toxicology (49%). In most studies, abnormalities detected by these screening tests were nondiagnostic.

There are insufficient data to assess yields of testing for autoimmune disorders or inborn errors of metabolism. A toxicology screen should be considered in all children presenting with acute ataxia. Neuroimaging should be considered in all children with new-onset ataxia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis has limited diagnostic specificity unless clinically indicated. Studies to examine neurophysiology testing did have sufficient evidence to support their use.

There is insufficient evidence to establish a role for autoantibody testing or for routine screening for inborn errors of metabolism in children presenting with acute ataxia. Finally, in a child presenting with ataxia and opsoclonus myoclonus, urine catecholamine testing for occult neuroblastoma is recommended. A nuclear scan may be considered; however, there is insufficient evidence for additional body imaging.

### Do malpractice concerns, payment mechanisms, and attitudes influence test-ordering decisions [^1122DtMv]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Greater understanding is needed of nonclinical factors that determine neurologists' decisions to order tests. The authors surveyed 595 US neurologists and utilized demographic information, attitude scales, and clinical scenarios to evaluate the influence of nonclinical factors on test-ordering decisions. Greater test reliance, higher malpractice concerns, and receiving reimbursement for testing were all associated with a higher likelihood of test ordering. These findings have implications for training needs and suggest malpractice worries may inflate health care costs.

### Current guidelines, common clinical pitfalls, and future directions for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease, United States [^117UB8f9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

- **Clinical considerations and common pitfalls**: As with all serologic tests, clinicians must consider the timing of a patient's illness when ordering and interpreting Lyme disease tests. Serologic analysis has low sensitivity during the first few weeks of infection while the antibody response is still developing. This period is known as the window period and is common to all serologic tests. Patients with illnesses suspicious for early Lyme disease but lacking typical erythema migrans (EM) can present a diagnostic dilemma because serologic test results might be negative at this point. In these cases, treatment can be administered at the discretion of the clinician, but serologic analysis is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

- **Figure 3**: Clinical approach to diagnosis of early Lyme disease, United States. *See Figure 1. †Given the gradual geographic expansion of Lyme disease, testing may be warranted for patients with signs and symptoms of Lyme disease who were exposed in areas that border known disease-endemic regions. ‡For a more detailed discussion of symptoms as they relate to pretest probability, see section on exposure and pretest probability. §For recommended 2-tiered testing protocol, see Figure 2. STARI, Southern tick-associated rash illness; EM, erythema migrans.

- **Background seropositivity**: Background seropositivity is a major consideration when testing for Lyme disease. In a seroepidemiologic study conducted in New York, 5% of study participants were found to have antibodies against B. burgdorferi.

### Analysis of daily laboratory orders at a large urban academic center: A multifaceted approach to changing test ordering patterns [^11254yyC]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

We sought to address concerns regarding recurring inpatient laboratory test order practices through a multifaceted approach to changing ordering patterns. Our method involved interdepartmental collaboration to foster mindful test ordering through clinical policy creation, electronic clinical decision support, and continuous auditing and feedback.

Annualized daily order volumes decreased from approximately 25,000 to 10,000 during a 33-month post-intervention review, representing a significant change from pre-intervention order volumes (95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.64; P < 10⁻¹⁶). Notably, total inpatient test volumes were not affected.

We conclude that durable changes to inpatient order practices can be achieved through a collaborative approach to utilization management that includes shared responsibility for establishing clinical guidelines and electronic decision support. Our experience suggests auditing and continued feedback are crucial components to changing ordering behavior. However, curtailing daily orders alone may not be a sufficient strategy to reduce in-laboratory costs.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, more specifically in relation to laboratory tests, the EAN/PNS 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining a confirmatory test with ELISA (using human recombinant proteins) or teased-nerve immunohistochemistry after nodal and paranodal autoantibody testing. It is important to recognize that the order of assays can be interchanged. Additional confirmatory tests should be applied to the protocol for low-titer sera or dubious staining on the cell-based assay to avoid false positives.

### Current guidelines, common clinical pitfalls, and future directions for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease, United States [^112EnP9F]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

When determining whether to test for Lyme disease, clinicians must consider a patient's pretest probability. Even highly specific tests can show false-positive results when performed for patients with low pretest probability. The most crucial factor governing pretest probability for Lyme disease is exposure history. A recent retrospective cohort study by Lantos et al. reported a positive predictive value for Lyme disease serologic analysis in the Duke University hospital system in North Carolina (a low-incidence state) of only 10% for patients with no history of recent travel to a disease-endemic region. In addition, only 0.7% of patients without recent travel history who had potential signs of disseminated infection (arthritis, cranial neuropathies, or meningitis) were ultimately given a diagnosis of Lyme disease, indicating that even clinical signs consistent with Lyme disease have poor predictive value in low-incidence regions. Furthermore, even EM-like lesions — once considered pathognomonic for Lyme disease — can be caused by other conditions, such as Southern tick-associated rash illness, a tickborne illness found primarily in the southeastern United States for which an infectious etiology has not been identified.

### Ecology and epidemiology of tickborne pathogens, Washington, USA, 2011–2016 [^1136pncv]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Several limitations exist with our study. Field surveillance was conducted at a small number of sites because of limited resources and efforts to determine temporal tick activity, resulting in inconsistent and largely convenience-based tick surveillance coverage across the state. There remains a paucity of understanding of what specific reservoirs drive the maintenance of these pathogens in nature. However, several known, competent reservoirs for B. burgdorferi s.s. exist in counties where pathogens were detected in the tick population. Little is currently known about the epidemiology of R. rickettsii in Washington.

All human case reports described here arose from passive surveillance systems; locally acquired cases required positive laboratory results. Underdiagnosis and underreporting of tickborne disease are likely, as patients might not seek healthcare and healthcare providers might be unaware of the possibility. In addition, common laboratory tests might be negative early in the course of illness and true cases could be missed, particularly if serologic testing is ordered early, rather than nucleic acid detection tests. In contrast, many of the diagnostic tests used for tickborne diseases have poor specificity (e.g. Lyme disease antibody testing) and might cross-react with other species (e.g. Rickettsia testing). The application of these tests in a low-incidence setting decreases their positive predictive value, and some of the cases included in this analysis likely represent false-positive results.

### Two-tier Lyme disease serology test results can vary according to the specific first-tier test used [^116XbTpn]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Low credibility.

Variability in two-tier Lyme disease test results according to the specific first-tier enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in children has not been examined rigorously. In this study, we compared paired results of clinical two-tier Lyme disease tests to those of the C6 peptide EIA followed by supplemental immunoblotting (C6 two-tier test).

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective cohort study of children aged ≥ 1 to ≤ 21 years who were undergoing evaluation for Lyme disease in the emergency department at one of six centers located in regions in which Lyme disease is endemic. The clinical first-tier test and a C6 EIA were performed on the same serum sample with supplemental immunoblotting if the first-tier test result was either positive or equivocal. We compared the results of the paired clinical and C6 two-tier Lyme disease test results using the McNemar test.

- **Results**: Of the 1714 children enrolled, we collected a research serum sample from 1584 (92.4%). The clinical two-tier EIA result was positive in 316 (19.9%) children, and the C6 two-tier test result was positive or equivocal in 295 (18.6%) children. The clinical and C6 two-tier test results disagreed more often than they would have by chance alone (P = 0.002). Of the 39 children with either a positive clinical or C6 two-tier test result alone, two children had an erythema migrans (EM) lesion, and 29 had symptoms compatible with early disseminated Lyme disease.

- **Conclusions**: Two-tier Lyme disease test results differed for a substantial number of children on the basis of the specific first-tier test used. In children for whom there is a high clinical suspicion of Lyme disease, it is important to consider the variability in test results based on the first-tier test utilized.

### Current guidelines, common clinical pitfalls, and future directions for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease, United States [^113AMmuK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease caused by spirochetes within the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species complex. In the United States, it is caused by B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. mayonii and is transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes scapularis or I. pacificus ticks (commonly known as blacklegged ticks). Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States, causing an estimated 300,000 illnesses annually. Cases occur primarily in the northeast and upper Midwest regions; however, ecological and environmental changes have catalyzed a gradual geographic expansion.

There are three stages of B. burgdorferi infection: early localized, early disseminated, and late disseminated. The classic sign of localized infection is erythema migrans (EM), which is defined as a gradually expanding annular lesion greater than 5 cm in diameter. Approximately 70%–80% of individuals with Lyme disease exhibit EM. Accompanying signs and symptoms may include fever, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, or arthralgias. If the infection is not treated, the bacteria may spread hematogenously, causing early disseminated Lyme disease, which can manifest as multi-organ involvement.

### Drivers of low-value diagnostic tests in emergency medicine practice: a qualitative descriptive study [^1134uwQA]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Six themes of low-value test drivers — four systemic and two individual — emerged from the interviews: efficiency, resources, complexity, culture, consequences, and abilities. Drivers were similar across participant experience levels (doctor in EM training vs. senior EM doctor) and sex (male vs. female). Participants perceived the contemporaneous influence of multiple drivers on the performance of low-value tests. The six drivers either hindered (barriers) or facilitated (enablers) the de-implementation of low-value tests. Efficiency and consequences were the most perceived barriers, while culture was the most multifaceted.

- **Efficiency**: The timely completion of emergency care was felt to be the most complex barrier. Participants sought efficiency through front-loading (i.e. performance of tests early in the patient's care journey, sometimes based on triage notes) and automation (i.e. performing multiple tests with a single click, as exemplified by chest pain test panels). Adequate patient assessment before ordering tests was highlighted as a better alternative to achieve efficiency.

Participant-level drivers, coding trees, and coding density are presented in the online supplemental appendices 2–5. Illustrative quotes are presented in the online supplemental appendices as well.

### Macrilen [^115XHSnJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

One hundred and fifty-seven subjects underwent at least one of the two tests in this study; 59% were male, 41% female, and 86% of white origin. The median age was 41 years, with a range of 18 to 66 years, and the body mass index was 27.5 kg/m², ranging from 16 to 40 kg/m². The study employed a cross-over design, with each participant undergoing both diagnostic tests and serving as their own control. Data for both tests were available for 140 subjects: 38 (27%) in Group A, 37 (26%) in Group B, 40 (29%) in Group C, and 25 (18%) in Group D. One out of 154 Macrilen tests (0.6%) failed due to a technical error, and 27 out of 157 ITTs (17.2%) failed because the induction of severe hypoglycemia (the stimulus) could not be achieved.

Two-by-two tables presenting the pre-specified primary analysis results for the ITT and Macrilen tests are shown below for all subjects (Groups A, B, C, and D combined) and for each group separately. The estimates for negative and positive agreement between Macrilen and the ITT in the overall study population were 94% and 74%, with lower 95% confidence interval bounds of 85% and 63%, respectively. Negative and positive agreement between Macrilen and the ITT in subjects with intermediate or low risk (Groups B and C) were 93% and 61%, with lower 95% confidence interval bounds of 80% and 43%, respectively. These results are based on peak GH values (maximum GH concentrations across all measurement time points).

Repeatability was tested in a subset of 34 subjects who underwent two Macrilen tests. Agreement between the results of the first test and the subsequent test was confirmed within the study parameters.

### Appropriateness of Lyme disease serologic testing [^113nfupx]. Annals of Family Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Although rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease is essential for effective treatment, there is concern about inappropriate testing. We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional survey of clinicians to assess the use and appropriateness of Lyme disease serologic tests (LDSTs).

- **Methods**: LDSTs performed at two large Wisconsin reference laboratories were systematically sampled for 12 consecutive months. A standardized questionnaire was used to gather data about the submitting clinician and the patient tested. Tests were categorized as appropriate, inappropriate, or discretionary. Associations were assessed using logistic regression analysis. A test was defined as inappropriate if the patient was asymptomatic, had erythema migrans, was treated empirically, or if the test was ordered as a test of cure.

- **Results**: We surveyed 303 clinicians regarding 356 LDSTs: 72 tests (20%) were appropriate, 95 (27%) were inappropriate, and 189 (53%) were discretionary. Tests were more likely to be inappropriate if they were ordered by an emergency or urgent care physician compared with other specialists (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 5.2, 95% confidence interval, 1.3–20.6) or if preceded by a known tick bite (AOR 6.8, 95% CI, 2.6–17.6). The patient, rather than the clinician, requested 26% of tests, which were more likely to be inappropriate than clinician-requested tests (crude odds ratio [COR] 5.8, 95% CI, 2.5–13.6). Tests were more likely to be patient-requested if they were ordered by an internist (AOR 2.6, 95% CI, 1.4–4.8) or if the patient was 40 years or older (AOR 2.2, 95% CI).

### Positive skin test control - histamine [^112XJLRK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For each skin testing method, the reaction to Positive Skin Test Control-Histamine (6 mg/mL Histamine Base) is considered valid when erythema exceeds the negative control by 4 mm (∑E). A wheal reaction is not required unless a wheal reaction also occurs with the negative control. In such cases, the wheal of the positive control must exceed the negative control by 4 mm (∑W) to be deemed appropriate. Record the measurements of erythema and wheal diameters.

Tables 1 and 2 summarize the skin testing results with histamine base and controls in atopic and non-atopic subjects using four different devices and methods.

- **Scratch, prick or puncture test**: Positive Skin Test Control-Histamine, 6.0 mg/mL Histamine Base. The Scratch, Prick, or Puncture test should be read in 15 minutes. If a large wheal reaction occurs before that time, wipe the excess histamine solution from the test site.

	- **Use a sterile scarifier for each patient**. Hold the scarifier between the thumb and index finger, press the sharp edge against the skin, and twirl the instrument rapidly. The scratch should disrupt the outer layers of the epidermis down to the germinal layer but should not produce immediate oozing of blood. The amount of pressure needed varies according to the thickness or fragility of each patient's skin.

	- **Apply one drop of Positive Skin Test Control-Histamine to the scratch test site**.

- **Prick or puncture test**: Prick tests are performed by placing a drop of extract on the skin before reading the reaction.

### Current guidelines, common clinical pitfalls, and future directions for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease, United States [^113h87yb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Patients who have a lesion consistent with erythema migrans (EM) and live in or have traveled to Lyme-endemic areas can be given a diagnosis without laboratory testing. In the absence of EM, all other manifestations of Lyme disease require serologic analysis to confirm the diagnosis. The recommended approach for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease is a two-tiered serologic test comprised of an enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA or ELISA) or immunofluorescence assay (IFA), followed by a reflex Western immunoblot.

When used in accordance with testing guidelines, two-tiered serologic testing is a valuable and highly specific clinical tool for the diagnosis of disseminated Lyme disease. Confusion exists, however, among patients and clinicians concerning the appropriate use and interpretation of this and other diagnostic tests for Lyme disease. In this article, we review the rationale behind United States testing guidelines, as well as the use and interpretation of two-tiered serologic analysis and other tests in the clinical setting. We also explore recent developments in the field of Lyme disease diagnostics.

### Clinical decision support to reduce unnecessary diagnostic testing for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^116zL3sy]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Low credibility.

Appropriate evaluation of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is imperative because of the potentially life-threatening complications. However, overtesting and overdiagnosis of HIT are common. Our goal was to evaluate the impact of clinical decision support (CDS) based on the HIT computerized-risk (HIT-CR) score, designed to reduce unnecessary diagnostic testing.

This retrospective observational study evaluated CDS that presented a platelet count versus time graph and a 4Ts score calculator to clinicians who initiated a HIT immunoassay order in patients with predicted low risk (HIT-CR score 0–2). The primary outcome was the proportion of immunoassay orders initiated but cancelled after firing of the CDS advisory. Chart reviews were conducted to assess anticoagulation usage, 4Ts scores, and the proportion of patients who had HIT.

In a 20-week period, 319 CDS advisories were presented to users who initiated potentially unnecessary HIT diagnostic testing. The diagnostic test order was discontinued in 80 (25%) patients. Heparin products were continued in 139 (44%) patients, and alternative anticoagulation was not given to 264 (83%). The negative predictive value of the advisory was 98.8% (95% CI: 97.2–99.5). HIT-CR score-based CDS can reduce unnecessary diagnostic testing for HIT in patients with a low pretest probability of HIT.

### Current guidelines, common clinical pitfalls, and future directions for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease, United States [^114bvG7y]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

When developing new tests or assessing their performance, researchers must have access to well-characterized positive and negative controls. Moreover, it is essential to include samples from patients with diseases that have overlapping clinical features and are known to be serologically cross-reactive because sensitivity and specificity are heavily dependent on the types of patient samples used. However, collecting and characterizing a wide variety of clinical samples for this purpose can be challenging, costly, and time-consuming.

To improve the availability of serum sample sets for evaluating novel diagnostic tests, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Fort Collins, CO, USA) and the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) have developed a repository of well-characterized serum samples from patients with Lyme disease. This repository includes samples from patients with various stages of Lyme disease; patients with cross-reactive conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and infectious mononucleosis; and healthy controls from both disease-endemic and non–disease-endemic areas. Panels of serum, along with accompanying clinical and laboratory testing results, are now available to researchers for the validation of novel diagnostic testing.

### Lyme disease testing by large commercial laboratories in the United States [^111PRmP6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Laboratory testing is helpful when evaluating patients with suspected Lyme disease (LD). A two-tiered antibody testing approach is recommended, though single-tier and nonvalidated tests are also used. We conducted a survey of large commercial laboratories in the United States to assess laboratory practices. We used these data to estimate the cost of testing and the number of infections among patients from whom specimens were submitted.

- **Methods**: Large commercial laboratories were asked to report the type and volume of testing conducted nationwide in 2008, as well as the percentage of positive tests for four LD-endemic states. The total direct cost of testing was calculated for each test type. These data, along with test-specific performance parameters available in published literature, were used to estimate the number of infections among source patients.

- **Results**: Seven participating laboratories performed approximately 3.4 million LD tests on around 2.4 million specimens nationwide, at an estimated cost of $492 million. Two-tiered testing accounted for at least 62% of assays performed, while alternative testing accounted for less than 3% of assays. The estimated frequency of infection among patients from whom specimens were submitted ranged from 10% to 18.5%. Applied to the total number of specimens, this yielded an estimated 240,000 to 444,000 infected source patients in 2008.

- **Discussion**: LD testing is common and costly, with most testing in accordance with diagnostic recommendations. These results highlight the importance of considering clinical and exposure history when interpreting laboratory results.

Borrelia burgdorferi was identified as the causative agent of Lyme disease in 1983, leading to the development of seroassays. The 1994 serodiagnostic testing guidelines were established before the full understanding of key B. burgdorferi antigens and have several shortcomings. These serologic tests cannot differentiate between active infection, past infection, or reinfection. While reliable direct-detection methods for active B. burgdorferi infection have been unavailable in the past, there is a demonstrated need for their development, which now appears achievable. New strategies have been successfully applied to other emerging infections and show promise for the direct detection of B. burgdorferi infections.

In the United States, 2-tiered serologic analysis is currently the diagnostic test of choice for all patients with signs of extracutaneous Lyme disease. When considering testing, clinicians must take into account the patient's history, timeline of symptoms, and pretest probability to accurately order the test and interpret the test result. Moreover, clinicians should understand the hazards of alternative laboratory tests and only use FDA-cleared diagnostic tests. Ongoing and published research promises to improve diagnosis of early Lyme disease and reduce subjectivity of the second-tier Western immunoblotting.

### Diagnosis of Lyme disease [^114wYu5y]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Use of serologic testing and its value in diagnosing Lyme disease remain confusing and controversial for physicians, particularly for individuals at low risk for the disease. The approach to diagnosing Lyme disease varies based on the probability of the disease, which depends on endemicity and clinical findings, and the stage of the disease.

In patients from endemic areas, Lyme disease may be diagnosed on clinical grounds alone in the presence of erythema migrans. These patients do not require serologic testing, although it may be considered according to patient preference. When the pretest probability is moderate, such as in a patient from a highly or moderately endemic area with advanced manifestations of Lyme disease, serologic testing should be performed using a complete two-step approach. This means a positive or equivocal serology is followed by a more specific Western blot test.

Samples drawn from patients within four weeks of disease onset are tested using the Western blot technique for both immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies. Samples drawn more than four weeks after disease onset are tested for immunoglobulin G only. Patients who exhibit no objective signs of Lyme disease have a low probability of the disease, and serologic testing in this group should be minimized due to the high risk of false-positive results.

When unexplained non-specific systemic symptoms such as myalgia, fatigue, and paresthesias have persisted for a long time in a person from an endemic area, serologic testing should be performed with the complete two-step approach.

### Impact of providing fee data on laboratory test ordering: A controlled clinical trial [^111Tbh9D]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Inpatient care providers often order laboratory tests without an appreciation for the costs of the tests. The objective of this study was to determine whether presenting providers with test fees at the time of order entry could decrease the number of laboratory tests ordered in a tertiary care hospital, without adding extra steps to the ordering process.

- **Design**: Controlled clinical trial.
- **Setting**: Tertiary care hospital.

Participants included all providers, both physicians and nonphysicians, who ordered laboratory tests through the computerized provider order entry system at The Johns Hopkins Hospital.

- **Intervention**: We randomly assigned 61 diagnostic laboratory tests to an "active" arm (fee displayed) or a control arm (fee not displayed). During a 6-month baseline period (November 10, 2008, through May 9, 2009), no fee data were displayed. Then, during a 6-month intervention period one year later (November 10, 2009, through May 9, 2010), fees, based on the Medicare allowable fee, were displayed for active tests only.

- **Main outcome measures**: We examined changes in the total number of orders placed, the frequency of ordered tests (per patient-day), and total charges associated with the orders according to the time period (baseline vs. intervention period) and by study group (active test vs. control).

For the active arm tests, the rates of test ordering were reduced from 3.72 tests per patient-day in the baseline period to 3.40 tests per patient-day in the intervention period (a decrease of 8.59%; 95% CI, -8.99% to -8.19%). For control arm tests, ordering increased from 1.15 to 1.

### Current guidelines, common clinical pitfalls, and future directions for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease, United States [^112x6bzw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

For these reasons, positive results for Lyme serologic analysis provide little diagnostic value for patients in areas to which this disease is not endemic and with no history of recent travel to disease-endemic areas. When assessing whether an area is endemic for Lyme disease, it is essential to note that surveillance guidelines classify cases based on the patient's permanent residence rather than the location of exposure (National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System). A recent study of Lyme disease in low-incidence states found that 84% of infected patients reported recent travel to high-incidence regions. Thus, although cases have been reported in all 50 states, this finding does not indicate that Lyme disease is endemic to all states.

In addition to exposure history, patient signs and symptoms provide useful information regarding pretest probability. Patients with erythema migrans (EM) who live in or have traveled to Lyme disease–endemic areas can be given a diagnosis without serologic testing. For patients without EM, headache and arthralgias are the most common symptoms of early Lyme disease. However, such symptoms are nonspecific and do not justify serologic testing unless clinical suspicion is high. Signs such as cranial nerve palsy, meningitis, carditis, and migratory large joint arthritis are more suggestive of Lyme disease and improve pretest probability for patients with epidemiologic risk for Lyme disease. Such signs in at-risk patients generally justify serologic testing. Conversely, gastrointestinal or upper respiratory symptoms are rarely seen in Lyme disease.

Lyme disease is a tickborne zoonosis for which serologic testing is the principal means of laboratory diagnosis. In 1994, the Association of State and Territorial Public Health Laboratory Directors, CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards convened the Second National Conference on Serologic Diagnosis of Lyme Disease.

### Rystiggo [^111sv28B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Infections and serious reactions associated with Rystiggo require careful consideration and monitoring.

- **Infections**: Delay administration of Rystiggo to patients with an active infection. During treatment, monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. If a serious infection occurs, administer appropriate treatment and consider withholding Rystiggo until the infection has resolved.

- **Aseptic meningitis**: Serious events of aseptic meningitis have been reported. Monitor for symptoms; diagnostic workup and treatment should be initiated according to the standard of care.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Angioedema and rash have occurred. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue the infusion and institute appropriate therapy.

- **Infections**

Rystiggo may increase the risk of infection. Delay Rystiggo administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. During treatment, monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of infection. If a serious infection occurs, administer appropriate treatment and consider withholding Rystiggo until the infection has resolved.

- **Immunization**

Immunization with vaccines during Rystiggo treatment has not been studied. The safety of immunization with live or live-attenuated vaccines and the response to immunization with any vaccine are unknown. Since Rystiggo causes a reduction in IgG levels, vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment. Evaluate the need to administer age-appropriate vaccines according to immunization guidelines before the initiation of a new treatment cycle.

### Lyme disease testing practices, Wisconsin, USA, 2016–2019 [^1115xyZF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Patterns of positive laboratory tests mirrored the demographics and seasonality of Lyme disease as demonstrated through decades of public health surveillance, showing more positive results among male individuals, children, and during the summer months. However, testing more commonly occurred among older adults and females. The largest discrepancy we observed between test ordering frequency and positive results occurred among middle-aged women, as documented elsewhere. Excess negative tests in this group might indicate a greater frequency of healthcare visits for signs and symptoms that overlap with Lyme disease or have the potential to be misdiagnosed as Lyme disease. It may also reflect possible differences in the serologic response to B. burgdorferi by age and sex. Additional studies are needed to understand the drivers of increased testing frequency and lower positivity rate in this group.

In 2022, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists implemented a revised Lyme disease surveillance case definition in high-incidence states based on positive laboratory results alone. The revision in the subset of the most affected states was intended to reduce the human resource burden on health departments in high-incidence states and improve standardization of data captured across states.

### Development and introduction of the filariasis test strip: A new diagnostic test for the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis [^112LZWKz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

With effective partner coordination at the global level, field testing was soon completed, demonstrating the FTS's lower cost and improved performance. Both the WHO and GPELF supported the transition from the BinaxNOW card test to the new FTS, integrating the test into existing guidelines and recommending it for decision-making surveys within programs. This transition occurred within 5 years of the initial 2010 investment aimed at developing an improved test.

However, it was wrongfully assumed that the transition would be smooth. Simply replacing the card test with the FTS in LF programs did not guarantee rapid uptake by country LF programs. These programs were unfamiliar with the new FTS and hesitant to adopt a diagnostic with different performance characteristics. A major concern was the increased sensitivity of the FTS, which might delay the achievement of elimination goals. The slow adoption by national programs and the low volume of tests required at the time presented a logistical challenge for the manufacturer.

The unique low-cost design of the FTS required its own production run. Facing competition from higher volume tests for infections such as influenza and HIV, Alere struggled to schedule production of low volume, one-off orders of the FTS, resulting in long delays. Additionally, the BinaxNOW card test remained available and in use by LF programs. A solution was needed to facilitate the transition to the FTS in country programs and streamline the order process.

Arthritis Care & Research (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Lyme disease, particularly concerning testing for erythema migrans, the AAN/ACR/IDSA 2021 guidelines recommend considering antibody testing, instead of currently available direct detection methods (such as PCR or culture performed on blood or skin samples). This recommendation applies to patients with one or more skin lesions suggestive of, but atypical for, erythema migrans. The antibody testing should be performed on an acute-phase serum sample, followed by a convalescent-phase serum sample if the initial result is negative.

### Delayed diagnosis of locally acquired Lyme disease, central North Carolina, USA [^111JgotE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The next month, the patient reported more back pain with spasms that radiated into the cervical spine and neck. She underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the spine, which demonstrated degenerative changes but no findings that would explain her symptoms. Her children remained concerned about her cognitive status, anorexia, and unintentional 10-pound weight loss, and they requested additional consultations, including with a subspecialist in infectious diseases.

The patient was seen in an outpatient infectious diseases clinic ≈2 months after the onset of symptoms. Although the patient did not recall any insect bites, her adult son recalled a small punctate lesion in the central part of the initial rash. Other than the bike rides, her only risk factor for tick or mosquito exposure was working in the flower garden in her yard. She did note that there were frequently deer on the property and that the family dog often slept in her bed. She had not traveled outside the local area during the previous year. Vital signs were within reference limits, and her examination was notable only for slow responses to questions and difficulty recalling recent events. Laboratory tests for tickborne and other infectious diseases, including Lyme disease, spotted fever rickettsiosis, ehrlichiosis, and α-gal syndrome, were ordered; no antibiotics were prescribed during the visit.

Results of the Lyme disease enzyme immunoassay were positive; the sample was reflexed to a Western blot, which showed positive results (6 of 10 IgG bands reactive). The patient was prescribed a 28-day course of oral doxycycline.

### Lyme disease testing practices, Wisconsin, USA, 2016–2019 [^1179c4mi]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Positive laboratory results are increasingly used for Lyme disease surveillance in the United States. We found that 6% to 15% of persons with a positive test each year had tested positive in a previous year; the frequency of repeat testing increased with patient age. Repeat testing of individuals with previous seropositivity could affect the interpretation of surveillance data.

### Ehrlichia infections, North Carolina, USA, 2016 [^117TqDWe]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Doxycycline was prescribed for half of all patients for whom treatment was known (94/188, 50.0%). Patients with acute SFGR serologic results that were positive were more likely than those with negative results to receive doxycycline (odds ratio [OR] 7.52, 95% CI 2.73–20.8; p < 0.001). However, this trend did not hold for patients with positive versus negative results for Ehrlichia. Notably, doxycycline was prescribed less frequently for patients with a positive retrospective Ehrlichia test result (30.4%) than for those with a positive provider-ordered test (77.8%) (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02–0.78; p = 0.03). Similarly, convalescent-phase serologic testing was performed less often for patients with a positive retrospective test result (16.0%) compared to those with a positive provider-ordered test result (55.6%) (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03–0.85; p = 0.03).

Our results demonstrate that Ehrlichia accounted for a large proportion of reactive antibodies among a cohort of patients suspected of having tickborne illness in central North Carolina. These findings provide strong, albeit circumstantial, evidence that Ehrlichia infection is as prevalent as SFGR infection. Yet, providers ordered Ehrlichia testing much less frequently than SFGR or even Lyme disease testing, despite the low incidence of Lyme disease in the state. This disparity may be attributable to unfamiliarity with local vector epidemiology and the greater attention given to RMSF and Lyme disease by the general population.

Our results show that testing strategies had a clear effect on patient care.

### Tracleer [^117DK8Tv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Based on data from animal reproduction studies, Tracleer may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Obtain a pregnancy test prior to Tracleer treatment, monthly during treatment, and for one month after stopping treatment. Advise females of reproductive potential to use two reliable forms of contraception during treatment with Tracleer and for at least one month after the last dose [see Dosage and Administration (2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

Tracleer is only available for females through a restricted program under REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Prescribing and distribution program for Bosentan**: Because of the risks of hepatotoxicity and birth defects, Tracleer is available only through a restricted program called the Bosentan REMS Program. As a component of the Bosentan REMS, prescribers, patients, and pharmacies must enroll in the program [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2), Contraindications (4.1)].

	- **Required components of the Bosentan REMS are**:
		- Healthcare professionals who prescribe Tracleer must review the prescriber educational materials, enroll in the Bosentan REMS Program, and comply with its requirements.
		- Healthcare professionals must (1) review serum aminotransferases (ALT/AST) and bilirubin, and agree to order and monitor these tests monthly; and (2) for females of reproductive potential, confirm that the patient is not pregnant, and agree to…

### Tobramycin [^112AqXCL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

- **Mechanism of action**: Tobramycin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of protein in bacterial cells. In vitro tests demonstrate that tobramycin is bactericidal.

- **Interactions with other antibiotics**: Although most strains of enterococci demonstrate in vitro resistance, some strains in this group are susceptible. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell-wall synthesis affects some enterococcal strains synergistically. The combination of penicillin G and tobramycin results in a synergistic bactericidal effect in vitro against certain strains of *Enterococcus faecalis*; however, this combination is not synergistic against other closely related organisms, such as *Enterococcus faecium*. Speciation of enterococci alone cannot be used to predict susceptibility. Susceptibility testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are emphasized.

- **Cross-resistance**: Cross-resistance between aminoglycosides may occur.

Tobramycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections:

- **Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms**: *Staphylococcus aureus*

- **Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative microorganisms**:
	- *Citrobacter* sp
	- *Enterobacter* sp
	- *Escherichia coli*
	- *Klebsiella* sp
	- *Morganella morganii*
	- *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*
	- *Proteus mirabilis*
	- *Proteus vulgaris*
	- *Providencia* sp
	- *Serratia* sp

Aminoglycosides have a low potential for cross-resistance.
