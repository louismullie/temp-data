## Question

Inflammatory myopathy with perimysial pathology

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about inflammatory myopathy with perimysial pathology, including its definition, histopathology, associated antibodies, clinical phenotype, pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and frame the entity within modern myositis taxonomy. Then, I should verify the key histopathologic features and how they differ from classic dermatomyositis. Next, I will correlate serologic associations and clinical phenotypes. After that, I need to consider pathophysiology and reconcile any conflicting data. Then, I should outline a practical diagnostic algorithm and explicitly check pitfalls and mimics. Finally, I will review treatment principles and prognosis, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together.

> Let me first confirm the definition and nomenclature. Immune myopathy with perimysial pathology, or IMPP, is a pathologically defined subset of acquired inflammatory myopathies characterized by damage to perimysial connective tissue and muscle fiber necrosis that is more prominent near the perimysium, often with histiocytic infiltrates and distinctive enzymatic staining patterns. Importantly, this pattern is not the classic perifascicular atrophy seen in dermatomyositis, and IMPP spans antisynthetase-associated myositis and anti-HMGCR myopathy, as well as some seronegative cases [^113FBWvF] [^116Zut7D].

> I will now examine the histopathologic hallmarks to ensure I am precise. On H&E, the perimysium is widened and fragmented, with histiocytic cells present; acid phosphatase and nonspecific esterase highlight these histiocytes, and alkaline phosphatase staining is increased in perimysial connective tissue, reflecting active remodeling and damage; muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration cluster near the perimysium, and complement C5b-9 may be deposited in necrotic fibers and occasionally in perimysium; MHC class I is often diffusely upregulated, sometimes with perifascicular accentuation, but perifascicular atrophy is not the defining feature as it is in DM [^116eg1B1] [^112QCZDU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibodies. I should double-check the serologic associations. IMPP is strongly linked to antisynthetase antibodies, particularly anti-Jo-1, and also to anti-HMGCR autoantibodies. However, a substantial fraction of IMPP patients are seronegative, underscoring that the diagnosis rests on pathology rather than serology alone. Importantly, HMGCR antibodies associate with myofiber necrosis across multiple IIM subsets, not uniquely with one pathologic group, which helps explain why HMGCR myopathy can be labeled IMNM in some schemes yet shares perimysial features in many cases [^115qbJhH] [^112U219o] [^116Zut7D].

> Next, I should review the clinical phenotype and make sure I capture the multisystem features. Patients typically have subacute, symmetric, proximal-predominant weakness with high CK, and frequent myalgias. Dysphagia is common. Extra-muscular features include interstitial lung disease, inflammatory arthritis, Raynaud phenomenon, and mechanic's hands. Importantly, malignancy association appears lower than in dermatomyositis with vascular pathology, and many patients show a sustained response to immunomodulation, although seronegative IMPP may behave variably [^112U219o] [^115kJady] [^117HBMv2].

> Let me consider pathophysiology, but I need to be cautious and reconcile differing data. One model posits a connective tissue–directed immune attack with humoral mechanisms, supported by histiocytic infiltrates, complement deposition, and perimysial damage. Another line of evidence emphasizes microangiopathy and ischemia in perifascicular regions, particularly in DM and some ASS subtypes, with capillary C5b-9 and reduced capillary density. Nuclear actin inclusions have been described as a hallmark of antisynthetase myopathy, though their specificity across all IMPP cases remains to be fully validated, so I should acknowledge this uncertainty explicitly [^116Zut7D] [^115uKZX5] [^113UXvGQ].

> I should confirm the diagnostic approach and explicitly check for pitfalls. Muscle biopsy is the cornerstone, with targeted sampling of clinically active muscle. Routine use of acid and alkaline phosphatase stains improves detection of perimysial pathology. Serologic testing for antisynthetase and HMGCR antibodies should be obtained, but negative results do not exclude IMPP. Chest imaging for ILD is essential given its frequency. I need to ensure I do not over-rely on EULAR/ACR classification scores, which can underperform when biopsy data are added and do not yet incorporate IMPP-specific features, so clinical–pathologic correlation remains paramount [^116eg1B1] [^112U219o] [^114ZFRak].

> But wait, what if the biopsy shows perimysial changes that are not IMPP? I should review the differential and mimics. DM with vascular pathology shows perifascicular atrophy and capillary C5b-9 without the perimysial fragmentation and histiocytosis of IMPP; IMNM shows scattered necrosis with pauci-immune inflammation and may lack perimysial pathology; IBM has endomysial CD8 invasion, rimmed vacuoles, and mitochondrial changes; eosinophilic perimyositis and granulomatous myopathies such as sarcoidosis can involve perimysium but have distinctive inflammatory cell types; noninflammatory myopathies, including dystrophies, can show secondary inflammation and MHC upregulation, so I need to integrate clinical, EMG, imaging, and genetic testing when indicated [^115uKZX5] [^116EwCNM] [^113nVnSZ] [^113Nv5rG].

> I need to ensure the treatment framework aligns with the pathobiology. High-dose glucocorticoids are first-line, with early addition of steroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate, particularly when ILD is present; IVIG and rituximab are reasonable for refractory disease or anti-HMGCR myopathy; importantly, I should avoid assuming IBM in older adults with proximal weakness and perimysial changes, as some IMPP cases respond to immunotherapy despite necrotic features; long-term monitoring for ILD progression and relapse risk is essential [^113W1gxS] [^112U219o] [^111GoyFk].

> Let me reconsider prognosis and make sure I qualify it appropriately. Compared with DM with vascular pathology, IMPP appears to have a lower malignancy risk but a higher burden of ILD and musculoskeletal complications; many patients demonstrate sustained responses to immunomodulation, though seronegative cases may be heterogeneous and require individualized assessment; early recognition and treatment likely mitigate irreversible muscle injury and fibrosis, but I should confirm that prospective data are still limited [^112U219o] [^115kJady].

> In summary, I should double-check that my synthesis is coherent. IMPP is a biopsy-defined inflammatory myopathy unified by perimysial connective tissue damage and perimysial-predominant myofiber necrosis, with histiocytic infiltrates and characteristic enzymatic staining; it links antisynthetase and anti-HMGCR autoimmunity but also includes seronegative cases; clinically it presents with proximal weakness, high CK, and frequent ILD and arthritis; pathogenesis likely combines humoral and microvascular mechanisms; diagnosis hinges on expert muscle biopsy interpretation integrated with serology and chest imaging; treatment is immunosuppression with escalation for refractory disease; and prognosis is often favorable regarding malignancy risk but guarded for lung disease, reinforcing the need for early, accurate recognition and management [^113FBWvF] [^112U219o] [^115qbJhH] [^113W1gxS].

---

Inflammatory myopathy with perimysial pathology (IMPP) is defined by **perimysial connective tissue damage** with histiocytic infiltration and **perifascicular necrosis**, often with minimal endomysial inflammation [^116Zut7D] [^116eg1B1] [^1134jpeM]. It is strongly associated with antisynthetase antibodies (especially anti-Jo-1) and anti-HMGCR antibodies, and presents with proximal weakness, high CK, and frequent ILD, Raynaud's, and mechanic's hands [^112U219o] [^116Zut7D]. Diagnosis relies on **muscle biopsy** with perimysial pathology and targeted autoantibody testing; **immunosuppression** is first-line, with IVIG or rituximab for refractory cases [^116eg1B1] [^114CKLM1] [^113W1gxS] [^113bdwrP]. Prognosis is generally favorable with treatment, but ILD risk mandates early detection and monitoring [^112U219o].

---

## Histopathological features

IMPP is characterized by the following **histopathological findings**:

- **Perimysial connective tissue damage**: Fragmentation and destruction of perimysial connective tissue, often with histiocytic infiltration [^116Zut7D].

- **Perifascicular necrosis**: Muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration, predominantly at the periphery of fascicles [^1134jpeM].

- **Minimal endomysial inflammation**: Sparse endomysial inflammatory infiltrates, distinguishing IMPP from polymyositis and inclusion body myositis [^notfound].

- **Complement deposition**: Membrane attack complex (C5b-9) deposition in perimysial connective tissue and occasionally in muscle fibers [^112FbBVj].

- **Alkaline phosphatase staining**: Increased alkaline phosphatase activity in perimysial connective tissue, indicating active tissue damage [^112QCZDU].

---

## Clinical associations and autoantibodies

IMPP is strongly associated with specific **autoantibodies** and clinical syndromes:

| **Autoantibody** | **Clinical associations** |
|-|-|
| Antisynthetase antibodies (e.g. anti-Jo-1) | - Interstitial lung disease (ILD) <br/> - Raynaud phenomenon <br/> - Mechanic's hands <br/> - Inflammatory arthritis [^112U219o] [^116Zut7D] |
| Anti-HMGCR antibodies | - Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy <br/> - Statin-associated myopathy [^113TgWgS] [^111HrUyp] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients with IMPP typically present with the following **clinical features**:

- **Proximal muscle weakness**: Symmetric, proximal muscle weakness affecting the limbs and trunk [^115kJady].

- **Elevated creatine kinase (CK)**: Markedly elevated CK levels, indicating significant muscle damage [^112U219o].

- **Systemic manifestations**: Frequent association with ILD, Raynaud phenomenon, mechanic's hands, and inflammatory arthritis [^112U219o] [^116Zut7D].

- **Statin exposure**: Anti-HMGCR-associated IMPP often occurs in patients exposed to statins, although statin-naive cases are also reported [^112jaHWo] [^111HrUyp].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

Diagnosis of IMPP relies on a combination of **clinical, laboratory, and histopathological findings**:

- **Muscle biopsy**: Essential for identifying perimysial pathology, perifascicular necrosis, and minimal endomysial inflammation [^113FBWvF] [^1134jpeM].

- **Autoantibody testing**: Detection of antisynthetase or anti-HMGCR antibodies supports the diagnosis [^116Zut7D].

- **Electromyography (EMG)**: Myopathic changes consistent with inflammatory myopathy [^113Nv5rG].

- **Imaging**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal muscle edema and inflammation, aiding in diagnosis and monitoring disease activity [^116H5huh].

---

## Differential diagnosis

IMPP must be differentiated from other **inflammatory myopathies** and muscle disorders:

- **Dermatomyositis**: Characterized by perifascicular atrophy, endomysial capillary damage, and characteristic skin rash [^1119uEFL] [^114hZmBB].

- **Polymyositis**: Features endomysial inflammation and CD8+ T-cell infiltration of muscle fibers [^115mxCJJ].

- **Inclusion body myositis (IBM)**: Presents with rimmed vacuoles, endomysial inflammation, and mitochondrial abnormalities [^1119uEFL] [^112Wojiw].

- **Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM)**: Characterized by scattered necrotic fibers with minimal inflammation, often associated with anti-SRP or anti-HMGCR antibodies [^113TgWgS].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment of IMPP involves **immunosuppressive therapy** tailored to disease severity and associated systemic manifestations:

- **Corticosteroids**: First-line therapy to control inflammation and muscle damage [^113RbX3n].

- **Immunosuppressive agents**: Methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil are commonly used as steroid-sparing agents, particularly in patients with ILD or refractory disease [^113W1gxS].

- **Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)**: Effective in refractory cases, particularly in anti-HMGCR-associated IMPP [^117VJRCc].

- **Rituximab**: Considered in severe or refractory cases, particularly with significant ILD involvement [^113bdwrP].

---

## Prognosis and complications

IMPP generally has a favorable prognosis with appropriate treatment, but complications may occur. Interstitial lung disease is a **significant complication**, requiring regular monitoring and aggressive immunosuppressive therapy [^112U219o]. Recurrent or chronic muscle weakness may persist despite treatment, particularly in anti-HMGCR-associated cases [^notfound]. Immunosuppressive therapy increases the risk of infections, necessitating careful monitoring and prophylactic measures [^notfound].

---

## Current research and future directions

Recent research has focused on elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms underlying IMPP, particularly the role of **antisynthetase and anti-HMGCR antibodies** in driving perimysial pathology and muscle necrosis [^115qbJhH]. Additionally, efforts are underway to standardize **diagnostic criteria and histopathological assessment** to improve diagnostic accuracy and facilitate early intervention [^116aDQ7G]. Studies are evaluating novel therapeutic agents, including **biologics and targeted therapies**, to improve outcomes in refractory cases [^113bdwrP].

---

Inflammatory myopathy with perimysial pathology (IMPP) is a distinct subtype of inflammatory myopathy characterized by perimysial connective tissue damage, **perifascicular necrosis**, and minimal endomysial inflammation. It is strongly associated with antisynthetase and **anti-HMGCR antibodies** and presents with proximal muscle weakness, elevated CK, and systemic manifestations such as ILD. Diagnosis relies on muscle biopsy and autoantibody testing, and treatment involves **immunosuppressive therapy**. Prognosis is generally favorable, but complications such as ILD require careful monitoring and management.

### Acquired immune and inflammatory myopathies: pathologic classification [^113FBWvF]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We discuss pathology-based characterization and classification of acquired immune and inflammatory myopathies (IIMs).

Recent Findings

Several types of IIMs do not fit well into the typical IIM subclassifications: dermatomyositis, polymyositis and inclusion body myositis (IBM). Myopathologic features that can provide additional diagnostic clarification in IIM are types of muscle fiber pathology; immune changes (cellular and humoral); and tissues with distinctive involvement (connective tissue, vessels and muscle fibers). Pathologic classification categories include immune myopathies with perimysial pathology (IMPP), a group that can be associated with antisynthetase antibodies; myovasculopathies, including childhood dermatomyositis; immune polymyopathies, active myopathies with little inflammation such as the myopathy with signal recognition particle antibodies; immune myopathies with endomysial pathology (IM-EP), illustrated by brachio-cervical inflammatory myopathy (BCIM); histiocytic inflammatory myopathies, like sarcoid myopathy; and inflammatory myopathies with vacuoles, aggregates and mitochondrial pathology (IM-VAMP), which have inclusion body myositis as a pathologic subtype and are poorly treatable. Some myopathologic features, like B-cell foci and alkaline phosphatase staining of capillaries or perimysium, are more likely to be present in treatable categories of IIM.

Summary

Myopathology can be used to classify IIM. Identification of distinctive myopathologic changes in IIM can improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy and focus treatment, therapeutic trials and studies of pathogenic factors.

### Muscle pathology of antisynthetase syndrome according to antibody subtypes [^114RC3eL]. Brain Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Using Bohan and Peter classification, ASS was likely categorized as polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM). Notably, a clustering analysis of autoimmune myositis based on clinico‐serological features showed that 95% and 5% of the "ASS‐corresponding cluster" were historically diagnosed with PM and DM, respectively. By this approach, the diagnosis of PM is obsolete. DM features including DM skin lesions (i.e. Gottron signs/papules and/or heliotrope rashes) and perifascicular atrophy (PFA) were reported in 15%–28% and 17.0%–44.4% of ASS patients at the time of diagnosis, respectively. Furthermore, ASS features including mechanic's hands and ILD, were reported in 42.7% and 76.5% of anti‐MDA5 DM, respectively. Pathological features originally described in ASS including perifascicular and perimysial pathology were also reported in DM, especially anti‐Mi‐2 DM. Thus, incomplete serology test and possible technical challenges could misclassify ASS as DM and vice versa. This study aimed to describe myopathological features of ASS to help identify patients in such situations. We also chose to explore myofiber human leukocyte antigen (HLA)‐DR expression as a potential diagnostic tool for ASS because (i) HLA‐DR has been reported mainly in inclusion body myositis (IBM) and ASS and less commonly present in other entities and (ii) other pathological features previously described in ASS can be present in other entities, especially DM.

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a heterogeneous group of disorders in which chronic inflammation of the skeletal muscle, leading to muscle weakness, is a common feature. Different phenotypes have been identified within the IIM spectrum based on extra-muscular manifestations, immunology, muscle histology, responsiveness to therapy, and prognosis. The pathogenesis, classification, treatment, and prognosis of the different IIM subtypes are subject to active discussion and research. This review highlights the most relevant literature published on this topic over the last year.

### Inflammatory myopathy with myasthenia gravis: thymoma association and polymyositis pathology [^111bKh9E]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Immunohistochemistry for CD45RA, which was performed in 9 frozen sample available patients, showed no endomysial CD45RA + cells, indicating that the endomysial CD8 + T-lymphocytes surrounding and sometimes invading non-necrotic muscle fibers were all CD45RA − cells (9/9). Two patients (nos. 3 and 8) showed perimysial accumulation of CD45RA + cells (figure e-1).

One thymomatous patient (no. 7) showed granulomatous inflammatory cell invasion with multinucleated giant cells (figure 2B). The granulomas and giant cells were positive for CD68. Two patients (nos. 3 and 8) showed focal perimysial accumulation of mononuclear cells, many of which were positive for CD20 (figure 2, C and D).

Immunohistochemistry for PD-1 and PD-L1 showed scattered endomysial PD-1 + cells (9/9) and overexpression of PD-L1 on the sarcolemma of muscle fibers near PD-1 + cells (7/9). Of interest, 2 patients (nos. 1 and 9) showed PD-L1 overexpression extending on non-necrotic fibers around the fibers invaded by the PD-1 + cells (figure 2, E and F). Immunohistochemistry for CTLA-4 demonstrated CTLA-4 + cells in endomysial infiltration (4/9) (figure e-2).

Associated thymoma

The World Health Organization classifications of invasive thymoma in 7 patients were B2 (n = 5), B3 (n = 1), and no data available (n = 1) (table 1). The mean age at thymoma diagnosis was 45 years (range: 36–56 years). Thymoma diagnosis was preceded to IM diagnosis more than 12 years (range: 12–17 years) in 5 patients (nos. 1, 2, and 4–6), and both thymoma and IM were codiagnosed in 2 patients (nos. 3 and 7). The disease statuses of thymoma at IM diagnosis were as follows: no recurrence or progression without therapy (n = 3), untreated (n = 2), recurrence (n = 1), and no progression under chemotherapy (n = 1).

### Deciphering the clinical presentations, pathogenesis, and treatment of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^111RWvvA]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies or myositis syndromes (the most common forms are polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis) are systemic autoimmune diseases defined by chronic muscle weakness and inflammation of unknown etiology and result in significant morbidity and mortality. Research suggests that categorizing heterogeneous myositis syndromes into mutually exclusive and stable phenotypes by using clinical and immune response features is useful for predicting clinical signs and symptoms, associated genetic and environmental risk factors, and responses to therapy and prognosis. Knowledge of myositis phenotypes should enhance clinicians' ability to recognize and manage these rare disorders.

### Myopathy with anti-HMGCR antibodies: perimysium and myofiber pathology [^112jaHWo]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

We retrospectively reviewed clinical and myopathology features of 49 patients with serum anti-HMGCR antibodies. Some clinical features in our patients with serum IgG binding to HMGCR were similar to those in previous studies. We observed a moderate female predominance. Onset ages varied widely from childhood to older adulthood. Presenting features often included proximal, symmetric weakness, myalgia, and a high serum CK. The disease course varied from acute to very chronic. Three patients with slowly progressive proximal weakness were initially thought to have limb-girdle muscular dystrophies but had no histologic or molecular diagnosis despite extensive testing. Patients with previous exposure to statin drugs were older, but clinical and laboratory findings were similar to those in patients without statin exposure.

Differences in our cohort from prior studies included a small group of HMGCR antibody patients who presented with myalgia, cramps, and elevated CK but no weakness. Systemic manifestations, including skin rash and interstitial lung disease, were more frequent than previously reported. Interstitial lung disease, ascertained by chest imaging, was found in 20% of our cohort. Other myositis-associated antibodies were identified in 33% of our patients. The wider spectrum of clinical and laboratory features seen in our series likely reflects our inclusive pattern of serum testing (i.e. most patients with acquired myopathies). The initial series of HMGCR antibody patients excluded patients with inflammation in the muscle biopsy and selectively studied patients referred to a myositis clinic. Another series analyzed only patients who had noninflammatory biopsies with active and prominent muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration.

### Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy: interrater variability in muscle biopsy reading [^116aDQ7G]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine interrater variability in diagnosing individual muscle biopsy abnormalities and diagnosis.

Methods

We developed a scoring tool to analyze consensus in muscle biopsy reading of an ad hoc workgroup of international experts. Twenty-four samples from patients with suspected idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) were randomly selected, providing sections that were stained with standard histologic and immunohistochemical methods. Sections were made available on an online platform, and experts were queried about myopathologic features within 4 pathologic domains: muscle fibers, inflammation, connective tissue, and vasculature. A short clinical presentation of cases was included, and experts were asked to give a tentative diagnosis of polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclusion-body myositis, antisynthetase syndrome-related myositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, nonspecific myositis, or other disease. Fleiss κ values, scoring interrater variability, showed the highest agreement within the muscle fiber and connective tissue domains.

Results

Despite overall low κ values, moderate agreement was achieved for tentative diagnosis, supporting the idea of using holistic muscle biopsy interpretation rather than adding up individual features.

Conclusion

The assessment of individual pathologic features needs to be standardized and harmonized and should be measured for sensitivity and specificity for subgroup classification. Standardizing the process of diagnostic muscle biopsy reading would allow identification of more homogeneous patient cohorts for upcoming treatment trials.

### Myositis mimics: how to recognize them [^1166QPyJ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To help clinicians to distinguish between myositis (and other immune-mediated and immunosuppressant-responsive disorders) and its many clinical mimics.

Recent Findings

Increasing experience has shown that findings from conventional investigations, such as muscle biopsy, can be misleading. More specialist investigations, notably autoantibody screening, immunocytochemical techniques, and evolving DNA technologies, are powerful tools but experience is currently largely limited to specialist centres - and even these techniques are open to misinterpretation.

Summary

Misdiagnosis is hazardous to the patient. Treatable conditions may be missed, or patients subjected inappropriately to potentially toxic drug treatments. Judicious use of clinical skills alone should help reduce these risks.

### Environmental triggers for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: unravelling the known and unknown [^114J9hJR]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a heterogeneous group of rare connective tissues diseases that usually share the common feature of immune-mediated muscle or lung injury. Whereas their pathogenesis is widely recognised as multifactorial, the specific triggers initiating their onset remain largely elusive. Factors such as infections, inhalants, or geoclimatic variables are implicated, yet due to the limitations inherent in studies involving small and non-homogeneous cohorts, findings often appear fragmented and inconclusive. This review endeavours to present the most updated evidence regarding the influence of environmental factors in determining the onset of IIM, with the aim of offering insight to optimise the routinary management of affected patients.

### Inflammatory myopathy with myasthenia gravis: thymoma association and polymyositis pathology [^115mxCJJ]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pathologic findings

We observed various amounts of necrotic fibers and inflammatory cells in both the perimysium and the endomysium. All patients showed different levels of overexpression of MHC class I on muscle fibers with various extent levels: 1+, n = 2; 2+, n = 2; and 3+, n = 6 (table 1). Overexpression of MHC class II on muscle fibers was observed in 9 patients (9/10). All patients showed the findings of endomysial CD8 + T-lymphocytes surrounding (10/10) and sometimes invading (5/10) non-necrotic muscle fibers expressing MHC class I antigen and therefore met the pathologic criteria of polymyositis (PM)(definite PM, n = 5; probable PM, n = 5; figure 2A).

### Myopathy with anti-HMGCR antibodies: perimysium and myofiber pathology [^111HrUyp]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Serum autoantibodies and myopathology features are useful for characterization and classification of acquired immune and inflammatory myopathy (IIM) syndromes. Serum IgG binding to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) has been identified in patients with presumed immune myopathies that usually have no lymphocytic cell foci. Myopathies with HMGCR antibodies have been suggested to be statin-induced, but statin histories are not universal and the strength of association with statin use varies among reports.

Previous pathologic descriptions of myopathies with HMGCR antibodies have noted active necrosis and regeneration of scattered muscle fibers without inflammation, but some series mainly screened for HMGCR antibodies in groups of patients with "necrotizing myopathies". Involvement of other components of muscle tissue has not been systematically evaluated. We have found that IIM syndromes often have characteristic pathology that involves several tissues in muscle, including muscle fibers, connective tissue, and vessels, and patterns of humoral and cellular immunity. In this study we evaluated clinical and pathologic features of 49 patients with acquired myopathies associated with serum IgG binding to HMGCR. Clinically, our patients had symmetric, proximal weakness and often had a high serum creatine kinase (CK). Only a minority had a history of statin use. Pathologic features in HMGCR antibody–associated myopathies often include damage to both perimysial connective tissue and muscle fibers.

### Recent developments in classification criteria and diagnosis guidelines for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^117GZhty]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

DIAGNOSIS

The newly developed classification criteria provide robust methods for identifying IIM cases for research purposes; however, their use is not designed nor recommended for use in clinical practice.

Accurate diagnosis of an IIM is key to appropriate treatment instigation, prognostication and prevention of complications. However, diagnosis and subtype identification in clinical settings can be challenging, in part due to potential multisystem involvement and wide variations between subtype manifestations. Currently, no clear diagnostic criteria for the IIMs exist. However, findings from clinically focused research studies can aid a clinician's diagnostic accuracy, identification of factors associated with prognosis and guide investigation of multisystem involvement.

### The performance of the European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology idiopathic inflammatory myopathies classification criteria in an expert-defined 10 year incident cohort [^114ZFRak]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

It is somewhat counterintuitive for classification criteria to perform with poorer sensitivity when more information is available, specifically in this case biopsy data, and we suggest several factors are at play here. First, muscle biopsy reports can be complex and challenging to reduce down to a binary decision between the presence or absence of a certain feature. Second, where the biopsy data reduced the probability of an IIM, the biopsies often showed myopathic features without other more specific findings. There is the potential for sampling error in biopsies, when either areas of affected muscle are inadvertently missed or the sample is obtained at a time when certain features may not be present (e.g. earlier in the course of IBM or in a patient already treated with immunosuppression). In clinical practice, non-specific biopsy findings do not make a diagnosis of IIM less likely in themselves. However, they do make a diagnosis of IIM less likely by default within the classification criteria because of consequently increased aggregate score cut-points when adding biopsy information. Finally, there are potential issues with the chosen biopsy criteria. In particular, the features associated with IMNM (e.g. pauci-immune appearances with occasional necrotic fibres), the perimysial-predominant pathology described in ASS or the IBM-suggestive features in addition to rimmed vacuoles (p62-positive inclusions, multiple COX-negative fibres, etc.) are not available to include in probability or subtype calculations. Consequently it may be appropriate to consider not including biopsy data in patients with suspected IMNM or in those cases of ASS and IBM where the biopsy findings are non-specific during EULAR/ACR criteria calculations of IIM probability, as this appears to reduce their sensitivity.

INTRODUCTION

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a group of autoimmune diseases characterised by chronic muscle inflammation (myositis), internal organ inflammation and significant morbidity and mortality. The wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, variable disease course and distinct subtypes makes accurate classification and diagnosis of paramount importance to ensure valid research and timely instigation of treatment.

This article aims to summarize recently published research pertinent to advances in IIM classification and diagnosis. A Medline search for research articles published between January 2017 and May 2018 was carried out using the MeSH term 'myositis'. Articles primarily focussing on myositis-specific autoantibodies were excluded, as they will be reviewed in detail in a separate article.

### Immune myopathies with perimysial pathology: clinical and laboratory features [^1114CReW]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Our results are the outcome of a retrospective study of muscles from patients, most of whom presented to neurologists with primary complaints of weakness. Prospective studies would be useful to test our findings that IMPP is associated with distinctive multisystem disorders in adults and children. Studies of the frequency and types of IMPP myopathy and lung and skin pathology in patients presenting with ILD or skin disorders could provide further information about systemic immune disorders affecting connective tissue. Larger series could also evaluate whether antisynthetase and other serum autoantibodies in IMPP patients such as anti-HMGCR are associated with specific subgroups of pathologic changes and clinical system involvement. A limitation of our study, given its retrospective nature, is that we could not guarantee that diagnostic testing, including MSA testing, was uniform across all subjects. While over 80% of the subjects in both cohorts did undergo some form of MSA testing, this study includes subjects evaluated over a 24-year period that coincided with a substantial increase in the number of myositis-specific autoantibodies available for clinical testing. Future prospective studies, ideally with serum banking to allow for retrospective testing of newly identified autoantibodies, are ultimately necessary to determine the actual prevalence of MSA in these disorders.

In any case, IMPP syndromes appear to be a distinctive subgroup of disorders that do not fit well into the current classifications of immune myopathies as polymyositis and dermatomyositis. The absence of myositis-specific autoantibodies in a large percentage of IMPP patients emphasizes an important role for myopathology in identifying these patients at an increased risk of ILD and distinguishing them from IIM patients with an increased risk of malignancy.

### Edematous myositis: a clinical presentation first suggesting dermatomyositis diagnosis [^116XrC5p]. Brain Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Edema of the limbs is uncommon in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM). The few reported cases have been associated with severe and refractory dermatomyositis (DM), sometimes in association with cancers. We aimed to determine if edematous myositis is a homogeneous subtype based on clinical, serological and pathological features.

Methods

This is a retrospective observational study performed between 2008 and 2015 in the French national referral center for myositis. All adult patients with an inflammatory muscle biopsy and upper limbs edema were included as well as IIM cases without limb edema as controls. Clinical, biological and pathological features were collected.

Results

Seventeen edematous myositis were included and compared to 174 IIM without edema, including 50 DM controls. Edema was the first manifestation in 23% of patients. Muscle weakness was severe and symmetric, 71% of patients presented dysphagia and a restrictive ventilatory pattern was found in 40%. Fifty-two percent of patients had a typical DM skin rash and 23% had cancer within 3 years of diagnosing myositis. Fifty-three percent of patients presented a myositis specific antibody and only DM-specific antibodies were detected. Classic pathological DM features (perifascicular atrophy, perifascicular/perimysial perivascular inflammation) were uncommon but capillary C5b-9 deposition and MxA expression were seen in 79% and 73% of cases, respectively. A perimysial edema was found in 82% of cases. Seventeen percent of patients died (median follow up of 18 months). Edematous myositis demonstrated more marked capillary C5b-9 deposition compared to IIM controls. There was no clinical, biological or pathological difference with DM controls except for limb edema.

Conclusion

Our study underlines that limb edema could be a symptom of IIM and that edematous myositis are mostly DM. The vasculopathy seems to play a key role in its pathophysiology. Limb edema associated with muscle impairment should suggest the diagnosis of DM in clinical settings.

### Regional ischemic immune myopathy: a paraneoplastic dermatomyopathy [^1137sBZY]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Necrosis and regeneration of scattered muscle fibers are common features of many active acquired and immune myopathies. We studied a series of patients with acquired myopathies with an unusual pattern of regional, rather than scattered, muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration. Retrospective review of records of 7 patients with acquired myopathies having regional muscle fiber necrosis on muscle biopsy. Clinical features of patients included proximal symmetric weakness in arms and legs with a subacute onset (100%) beginning at ages between 41 and 92 years, with dysphagia (83%), myalgias (100%), skin rash (67%), and associated malignancy (71%). Serum creatine kinase was often very high (> 1,600 U/L) (83%). Survival was less than 1 year in 43%. Myopathology included a regional distribution with muscle fiber necrosis and capillary loss in the border zones between intermediate-sized perimysial vessels, vascular pathology with damaged walls of intermediate-sized perimysial veins, and connective tissue with expression of the ischemia marker carbonic anhydrase IX but no mononuclear cell inflammatory foci. These data indicate that regional ischemic immune myopathies are likely caused by ischemia in border zones between damaged intermediate-sized perimysial blood vessels. Regional ischemic immune myopathies are a distinctive pathologic group of acquired, probably immune, noninflammatory dermatomyopathies with weakness and often a skin rash and systemic neoplasm.

### Pathology features of immune and inflammatory myopathies, including a polymyositis pattern, relate strongly to serum autoantibodies [^115qbJhH]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

We asked whether myopathology features of immune or inflammatory myopathies (IIM), without reference to clinical or laboratory attributes, correlate with serum autoantibodies. Retrospective study included 148 muscle biopsies with: B-cell inflammatory foci (BIM), myovasculopathy, perimysial pathology (IMPP), myofiber necrosis without perimysial or vessel damage or inflammation (MNec), inflammation and myofiber vacuoles or mitochondrial pathology (IM-VAMP), granulomas, chronic graft-versus-host disease, or none of these criteria. 18 IIM-related serum autoantibodies were tested. Strong associations between myopathology and autoantibodies included: BIM with PM/Scl-100 (63%; odds ratio [OR] = 72); myovasculopathies with TIF1-γ or NXP2 (70%; OR = 72); IMPP with Jo-1 (33%; OR = 28); MNec with SRP54 (23%; OR = 37); IM-VAMP with NT5C1a (95%; OR = 83). Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) antibodies related to presence of myofiber necrosis across all groups (82%; OR = 9), but not to one IIM pathology group. Our results validate characterizations of IIM by myopathology features, showing strong associations with some serum autoantibodies, another objective IIM-related marker. BIM with PM/Scl-100 antibodies can be described pathologically as polymyositis. Tif1-γ and NXP2 antibodies are both common in myovasculopathies. HMGCR antibodies associate with myofiber necrosis, but not one IIM pathology subtype. Relative association strengths of IIM-related autoantibodies to IIM myopathology features versus clinical characteristics require further study.

### Immune myopathies with perimysial pathology: clinical and laboratory features [^116eg1B1]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

We retrospectively reviewed charts, laboratory data, and muscle biopsies from 57 consecutive patients with muscle biopsies interpreted as having an IMPP (table 1 and figure) who had been clinically evaluated at Washington University School of Medicine in Saint Louis between 1990 and 2013. IMPP biopsies had acid phosphatase positive cells in perimysial connective tissue and evidence of myopathy defined as one of the following: abnormal variation in the muscle fiber size, necrosis or regeneration, or major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I upregulation by muscle fibers. Some patients in this group were previously reported. For comparison, we reviewed a consecutive series of 20 patients with biopsies interpreted as DM-VP (Table 1 and figure). DM-VP biopsies had vascular pathology, with abnormal endomysial capillaries or perivascular lymphocytic foci and perifascicular myopathy with muscle fiber atrophy, reduced cytochrome oxidase staining, or increased MHC Class I expression.

Table 1
Myopathology: IMPP and DM-VP groups

Figure
Comparative myopathology of immune myopathies with perimysial pathology (IMPP) and dermatomyositis with vascular pathology (DM-VP)

IMPP myopathology includes perimysium that is widened and damaged (A; H&E stain), occupied by histiocytic cells (C; acid phosphatase stain), and stained by alkaline phosphatase (E). Muscle fiber damage includes necrosis, (membrane attack complex [C 5b-9] deposited in fiber cytoplasm [G]), more prominent near the perimysium. DM-VP myopathology includes muscle fiber pathology with perifascicular atrophy without necrosis (B; H&E stain) and metabolic changes, including reduced staining on cytochrome oxidase (H). DM-VP vascular pathology includes perivascular (perimysial) lymphocytic inflammation (D; Congo red stain) and endomysial capillary changes with increased alkaline phosphatase staining (F). Scale bar = 100 μM (Panels A–H).

### Why so low? An unusual case of myositis in a child [^113Ryfci]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

This is the second reported case of granulomatous myositis associated with sarcoidosis in a pediatric patient, and the first to present with a chief complaint of leg pain. While the histopathology results eventually confirmed the diagnosis, we first considered many other diagnoses given the unusual presentation of pain and inflammation localized to bilateral calves in a child.

The differential diagnosis for myositis in children includes rheumatic diseases (e.g. juvenile dermatomyositis/polymyositis, vasculitis, eosinophilic fasciitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or IgG4-related disease), as well as infection, malignancy, paraneoplastic syndromes, and genetic, metabolic, neurologic, or toxic myopathies. Of all these conditions, only rare distal muscular dystrophies and inclusion body myositis are known to cause isolated lower leg myositis and inclusion body myositis is almost exclusively found in adults. When present in adults, symptomatic lower leg myositis is typically unilateral and involves the gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis, and adductor muscles. Systemic rheumatologic diseases such as juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis are often more proximal in nature, while vasculitis typically includes systemic symptoms and would be unlikely to cause regional muscle inflammation isolated to symmetric regions. Infectious myopathies are also unlikely to present in symmetric areas. Concern for IgG4-related disease was raised given her prior peri-orbital inflammation; however, staining of both biopsies excluded this. Her peri-orbital muscle inflammation and granulomatous myositis of her lower extremities also raised concern for granulomatosis with polyangiitis; however, she had no signs of vasculitis on histopathology, imaging, or exam and negative anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Lastly, the intermittent nature of her flares over the years was unusual for any of these diagnoses - though given the degree of atrophy seen, it is likely that some inflammation persisted between presentations.

### Disease spectrum of myopathies with elevated aldolase and normal creatine kinase [^111u43Ya]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

There were 1782 patients with electromyography evidence of myopathy and elevated aldolase with normal CK. Myopathic changes were observed on muscle biopsy in 296 patients from a total of 304 patients who underwent muscle biopsy. A total of 262 patients (242 patients with elevated CK at the time of muscle biopsy, 19 patients with concomitant liver diseases and one patient with autoimmune hemolytic anemia) were excluded (Figure 1). Thirty‐four patients were included (Figure 2; Table 1). Median aldolase level was 10.0 U/L (interquartile range 8.8, 11.8). Median CK level was 67.0 U/L (interquartile range 33.0, 116.5). The three most common etiologies were dermatomyositis (n = 8), overlap myositis (n = 4, including two systemic lupus erythematosus, one rheumatoid arthritis and one Sjögren's syndrome and sarcoidosis) and nonspecific myopathy (n = 4). Four patients were diagnosed with nonspecific myopathy, three of whom received prednisone 5–34 months prior to the muscle biopsy. Of note, a patient with immune mediated necrotizing myopathy had weakness and hyperCKemia 7.5 years before the diagnosis and was found to have end‐stage muscle on biopsy and elevated aldolase in isolation at the time of biopsy.

TABLE 1
Demographic data, clinical presentations, laboratory findings and clinical course of 34 patients with myopathy and isolated aldolase elevation.

All 34 patients had predominant proximal muscle weakness, eight of whom also had mild distal weakness. Eight patients were wheelchair dependent or had modified Rankin scale > 3. Muscle biopsy showed perimysial pathology in 17 patients, seven of whom had non‐dermatomyositis and non‐inflammatory myopathy with perimysial pathology diagnosis (one mixed connective tissue disease, one graft‐versus‐host disease, one vasculitic myopathy, one light chain amyloid myopathy, one myopathy with intramural calcification of the blood vessels, one eosinophilic fasciitis with rare necrotic fibers, and one perifascicular pathology without inflammation). Perifascicular pathology was observed in eight patients. Twenty‐four patients received immunomodulatory therapy, which led to improvement in 16 patients at 5–7 months from the diagnosis. Nine of 17 patients (52%) had normalization of aldolase by 6 months (Table S1).

### Sarcoidosis, granulomas and myopathy syndromes: a clinical-pathology review [^113nVnSZ]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Muscle involvement in sarcoidosis is common by pathologic analysis, but symptomatic disorders are less frequent. Sarcoidosis-related muscle pathology includes non-caseating granulomas, muscle fiber changes that are diffuse or anatomically related to granulomas, and perimysial connective tissue with histiocyte-associated damage. The mechanisms by which granulomas form, enlarge and damage muscle tissues are incompletely understood. Sarcoidosis-related clinical syndromes with muscle involvement include: chronic myopathies with proximal weakness; nodular disorders; subacute onset disorders involving proximal or eye muscles; myalgia or fatigue syndromes; and, possibly, inclusion body myositis-like disorders. Corticosteroid treatment may benefit some syndromes, but clinical trials are necessary.

### Recent developments in classification criteria and diagnosis guidelines for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^116H5huh]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review was to summarize key developments in classification and diagnosis of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs).

Recent Findings

The recently published European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) classification criteria for the IIMs provide a comprehensive, accurate and data-driven approach to identification of IIM cases appropriate for inclusion in research studies. Further, recent studies have advanced understanding of clinical manifestations of the IIMs and delineated the role of imaging, particularly magnetic resonance.

Summary

The recent publication of the EULAR/ACR classification criteria will potentially greatly improve IIM research through more accurate case identification and standardization across studies. Future inclusion of newly recognized clinical associations with the MSAs may further improve the criteria's accuracy and utility. Clear and comprehensive understanding of associations between clinical manifestations, prognosis and multisystem involvement can aid diagnostic assessment; recent advances include delineation of such associations and expansion of the role of imaging.

### Myopathy with anti-HMGCR antibodies: perimysium and myofiber pathology [^116dJkht]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

HMGCR antibody–associated myopathies can be considered in the context of the common clinical classification and our proposed pathologic groups of immune myopathies. Polymyositis and inclusion body myositis can be ruled out because there are few lymphocytic inflammatory foci or inclusion bodies in HMGCR myopathies. Dermatomyositis is not a useful diagnosis because skin changes were present in only a minority of our patients. Necrotic myopathies are a possible class within which to group HMGCR patients, but such a classification is misleading and lacks pathologic specificity. The term "necrotic myopathy" can be applied equally well to rhabdomyolysis and a variety of hereditary, ischemic, and toxic disorders. Denoting the HMGCR syndrome as a necrotic myopathy implies that myofiber necrosis is a constant feature and that the disorder involves mainly damage to muscle fibers. However, connective tissue in perimysium is also commonly damaged in HMGCR myopathies. The connective tissue damage includes distinctive cellular mechanisms with histiocytic, not lymphocytic, infiltration. In muscles in which necrosis is present, the myopathic features are often nonuniform and more prominent near the perimysium. An additional non-necrotic muscle fiber pathology, abnormal myonuclear morphology, was also observed in many biopsies.

The therapeutic response of some patients with HMGCR antibodies to immunomodulation supports the idea that these myopathies are autoimmune disorders. The absence of lymphocytic inflammation suggests that humoral mechanisms may be important. However, despite the presence of serum autoantibodies, intracellular molecules such as HMGCR have been difficult to implicate as pathogenic target antigens of humoral or cellular immune mechanisms in immune disorders. The specific molecular antigenic targets of the immune response in muscle and connective tissue in HMGCR antibody–associated myopathy remain to be defined.

### Neurologists are from mars. rheumatologists are from venus: differences in approach to classifying the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^1124gTHJ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Inflammatory myopathy (IIM) classification criteria have been the source of considerable debate. In the three decades since Bohan and Peter published their criteria which have long stood as the gold standard for diagnosis in clinical practice as well as inclusion into clinical trials, more sophisticated understanding of immunopathogenesis, histology, and specific autoantibody associations has broadened our understanding of these diseases. This editorial review examines the diverse approaches between different subspecialists in deriving appropriate IIM classification utilizing this updated knowledge.

Recent Findings

Several investigators have proposed improved IIM classification criteria. More recently, larger scale consensus efforts have been undertaken by various expert groups including the European Neuromuscular Centre (ENMC) and The International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group (IMACS). The intent is to refine the classification criteria utilizing our enhanced understanding which has matured since the original publication of Bohan and Peter's proposal in 1975.

Summary

Many diagnostic/classification criteria have been proposed for different forms of IIM over the last three decades. The majority of these have been based on clinical impressions rather than rigorous data analyses or expert consensus and none has been fully tested for sensitivity or specificity using appropriately powered studies that take into account relevant disease confounders. Different sets of criteria proposed and adopted by different specialties hamper the ability to compare clinical studies and assess clinical trials' outcomes. Large, multicentered, multispecialty studies are required to develop improved IIM criteria.

### Integrated diagnosis project for inflammatory myopathies: an association between autoantibodies and muscle pathology [^113TgWgS]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Inflammatory myopathies are a heterogeneous group of immune-mediated diseases that involve skeletal muscle as well as many other organs. The classification of inflammatory myopathies has been based on clinical diagnoses, pathological diagnoses, and autoantibodies, independently. The clinical phenotypes of inflammatory myopathies are characterized by various autoantibodies that are originally detected by RNA or protein immunoprecipitation. However, since the correlation between histological features and autoantibodies had not been fully elucidated, we created the "Integrated Diagnosis Project for Inflammatory Myopathies" in October 2010. Based on our work and previous studies, the three major subsets of inflammatory myopathies defined by autoantibodies are immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), antisynthetase syndrome, and dermatomyositis. IMNM is the pathological entity, characterized by significant necrotic and regeneration muscle fibers with minimal or no inflammatory cell infiltration. The detection of autoantibodies against signal recognition particles or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase is important for the diagnosis of IMNM. Antisynthetase syndrome, characterized by myositis, interstitial lung disease, skin rash, arthropathy, and Raynaud phenomenon, is the clinical entity based on the presence of aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetase antibodies. Perifascicular necrosis is a distinctive hallmark of antisynthetase syndrome in muscle pathology. The diagnosis of dermatomyositis is usually based on clinical features of typical skin rash. Several autoantibodies are associated with specific subsets of dermatomyositis. Myxovirus resistance A expression in the myofiber cytoplasm has a better sensitivity for the diagnosis of dermatomyositis compared to perifascicular atrophy. The screening of autoantibodies has clinical relevance for managing patients with inflammatory myopathies.

### Vascular pathology in dermatomyositis and anatomic relations to myopathology [^115uKZX5]. Muscle & Nerve (2010). Low credibility.

The causes of perifascicular myofiber atrophy and capillary pathology in dermatomyositis are incompletely understood. We studied 11 dermatomyositis muscles by histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and ultrastructure. We found that endomysial capillaries within regions of perifascicular atrophy are not entirely lost, but they have reduced size, endothelial loss, C5b9 complement deposits, and relatively preserved connective tissue molecules and pericytes. In all muscles, the perimysium varies regionally. Some areas contain intermediate-sized vessels. Others are avascular. In dermatomyositis, vascular perimysium contains abnormal vessel fragments, perivascular inflammation, and increased PECAM-1. Perifascicular myofiber atrophy and capillary pathology are concentrated near the avascular perimysium. We conclude that both perimysial intermediate-sized vessels and endomysial capillaries within regions of perifascicular myofiber atrophy are abnormal in dermatomyositis. Capillary damage and myofiber atrophy are concentrated in regions distant from intermediate-sized perimysial vessels. Chronic immune vascular damage and insufficiency in dermatomyositis may cause ischemia, myofiber atrophy, and capillary damage in "watershed" regions of muscle near the avascular perimysium.

### Inflammatory myopathies: clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects [^113W1gxS]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

The three major forms of immune-mediated inflammatory myopathy are dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), and inclusion-body myositis (IBM). They each have distinctive clinical and histopathologic features that allow the clinician to reach a specific diagnosis in most cases. Magnetic resonance imaging is sometimes helpful, particularly if the diagnosis of IBM is suspected but has not been formally evaluated. Myositis-specific antibodies are not helpful diagnostically but may be of prognostic value; most antibodies have low sensitivity. Muscle biopsy is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of an inflammatory myopathy and to allow unusual varieties such as eosinophilic, granulomatous, and parasitic myositis, and macrophagic myofasciitis, to be recognized. The treatment of the inflammatory myopathies remains largely empirical and relies upon the use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and intravenous immunoglobulin, all of which have nonselective effects on the immune system. Further controlled clinical trials are required to evaluate the relative efficacy of the available therapeutic modalities particularly in combinations, and of newer immunosuppressive agents (mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus) and cytokine-based therapies for the treatment of resistant cases of DM, PM, and IBM. Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of muscle injury in the inflammatory myopathies should lead to the development of more specific forms of immunotherapy for these conditions.

### Immune myopathies with perimysial pathology: clinical and laboratory features [^116Zut7D]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Acquired immune and inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders. Classification schemes have been based on clinical, autoantibody, or myopathologic features. Serum antibodies to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are associated with a multisystem syndrome that includes IIM. Clinical manifestations include myopathy, interstitial lung disease (ILD), arthritis, Raynaud phenomenon, and skin rash. The commonest antisynthetase antibody, anti-Jo-1, is directed against histidyl tRNA synthetase. Myopathology in patients with anti-Jo-1 antibodies includes damage to perimysial connective tissue and muscle fibers. Perimysial connective tissue pathology includes damaged structures with fragmentation and scattered histiocytic cells. Muscle fiber pathology includes necrosis and regeneration, more prominent in regions neighboring the perimysium. We have termed myopathies with this combined pattern of damage, immune myopathies with perimysial pathology (IMPP). IMPP also occurs with serum antibodies to hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), a nonaminoacyl-tRNA synthetase antigen. Other patients with IMPP have no associated myositis-specific antibodies (MSA).

This study examined clinical and laboratory features of a cohort of consecutive patients with IMPP evaluated at our institution. We compared IMPP patients with a cohort of patients with a different immune myopathy syndrome, dermatomyositis with vascular pathology (DM-VP). DM-VP differs pathologically from IMPP, as it is a myovascular disorder. Muscle fiber changes are generally atrophy, rather than the necrosis seen in IMPP. Our results show that IMPP is associated with myopathy syndromes having multisystem features involving muscle, lungs, skin, and joints.

### Histopathological features of systemic sclerosis-associated myopathy: a scoping review [^114iab5M]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Scleromyositis (SM) is an emerging subset of myositis associated with features of systemic sclerosis (SSc) but it is currently not recognized as a distinct histopathological subset by the European NeuroMuscular Center (ENMC). Our aim was to review studies reporting muscle biopsies from SSc patients with myositis and to identify unique histopathological features of SM.

Methods

A scoping review was conducted and included all studies reporting histopathological findings in SSc patients with myositis searching the following databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and EBM-Reviews. Clinical, serological, and histopathological data were extracted using a standardized protocol.

Results

Out of 371 citations, 77 studies that included 559 muscle biopsies were extracted. Fifty-seven percent (n = 227/400) had inflammatory infiltrates, predominantly T cells, which were endomysial (49%), perimysial (42%) and perivascular (41%). Few studies (18%, n = 8/44) evaluated the presence of B-cells. Myofiber atrophy was present in 48% (n = 104/218) of biopsies, and was predominantly perifascicular in 19% (n = 6/31), with necrosis reported in 56% (n = 162/290) of cases. Sarcolemmal MHC-I upregulation was found in 72% (n = 64/89) of biopsies. Non-specified C5b-9 deposition was described in 39% of muscle biopsies (n = 28/72). Neurogenic features were present in 23% (n = 44/191); endomysial fibrosis was reported in 35% (n = 120/340); and rimmed vacuoles were observed in 32% (n = 11/34) of biopsies. Capillaropathy, such as capillary dropout and/or ultrastructural endothelial abnormalities, was reported in 33% (n = 43/129) of cases. Reported ENMC categories were mainly polymyositis (21%), non-specific myositis (19%), immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (16%), and dermatomyositis (8%). Histopathological features were analyzed according to serological subtypes in 28 studies, including anti-PM-Scl (n = 48), -Ku (n = 23) and -U1RNP (n = 90). Most of these biopsies demonstrated inflammatory infiltrates (range 49–85%) as well as MHC-I expression (range 63–81%). Necrosis was associated with anti-Ku (85%) and anti-U1RNP (73%), while anti-Ku was also associated with neurogenic features and rimmed vacuoles in 57% and 25% of cases, respectively.

Conclusion

Our review suggests that SM is characterized by heterogeneous pathological features using definitions included in current histopathological criteria. Whether a distinct histopathological signature exists in SM remains to be determined. SSc-specific and SSc-associated autoantibodies may help define more homogeneous histopathological subsets.

### High aldolase with normal creatine kinase in serum predicts a myopathy with perimysial pathology [^113qr5gT]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the clinical and pathological correlations of neuromuscular patients with a high aldolase and normal creatine kinase (CK) in serum at presentation or during a symptomatic exacerbation.

Methods

Records and muscle biopsies were retrospectively reviewed in a consecutive series of 12 patients. Pathological results were compared to 75 abnormal muscle biopsies associated with acquired immune or inflammatory myopathy syndromes and 14 muscle biopsies from patients with myopathies associated with serum anti-Jo-1 antibodies.

Results

All patients with selectively elevated serum aldolase had muscle discomfort (92%), weakness (proximal and distal) (50%), or both. Frequent systemic features included joint pain (75%), skin disorders (75%) and pulmonary involvement (50%). Electromyography patterns included normal (36%), non-irritable myopathy (45%) and irritable myopathy (18%). Jo-1 antibodies were not found in the five patients tested. The distinctive feature of muscle biopsies was perimysial pathology (92%), including acid phosphatase positive cellularity (83%) and fragmented connective tissue (75%).

Conclusions

Selectively elevated serum aldolase is associated with syndromes including myopathies with discomfort and weakness, systemic disorders and myopathology in perimysial connective tissue. The myopathy with perimysial pathology and the associated clinical syndromes seen in our patients are similar to disorders associated with antisynthetase antibodies. In patients with muscle discomfort or mild weakness and a normal CK, measurement of serum aldolase can be useful in the evaluation of possible myopathies.

### Dermatomyositis-like muscle pathology in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease [^1147CbUw]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Myositis is a rare complication of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Almost all such patients have been reported to have polymyositis (PM). We describe clinical, pathologic, and molecular studies of 3 patients with cGVHD following allogeneic HSCT who developed myopathy. In each case, perifascicular atrophy, the pathognomonic histologic feature of dermatomyositis (DM), was observed.

### Advances in the therapy of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^113bdwrP]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review progress in areas pertinent to the development of better therapies for the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.

Recent Findings

New classification criteria for the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies have been proposed in an effort to define disease subsets with more uniform prognoses and responses to therapy. Diseases that may mimic the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies can be differentiated more accurately with molecular testing and biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis of muscle tissue. Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies have served to identify potential new therapeutic targets. International collaborative study groups have reached consensus on outcome measures and on the optimal design of clinical trials in the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists, rituximab, and the calcineurin inhibitors are being used to treat the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, but their efficacy has not yet been tested in randomized clinical trials.

Summary

Future advances in the development of therapies for the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies have been enabled by recent progress in myositis classification, differential diagnosis, basic science, and clinical trial design. Preliminary studies suggest that calcineurin inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor antagonists, and rituximab may be effective treatments.

### Including myositis-specific autoantibodies improves performance of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies classification criteria [^114HXxNF]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

, The 2017 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) were developed to identify homogeneous populations of IIM patients for research purposes. The presence or absence of certain disease features contribute to an IIM probability score, with ⩾50% indicating 'possible', ⩾55% 'probable' and ⩾90% 'definite' IIM. Using the 'probable IIM' probability cut-off, sensitivity remains high (93%). However, while classification as 'definite IIM' is the suggested threshold for inclusion in studies where high specificity levels are required, sensitivity is lower (around 70%), limiting the number of patients eligible for enrolment.

Those with 'definite IIM' or 'probable IIM' can be further distinguished using a classification tree into one of four IIM subtypes: PM, IBM, amyopathic dermatomyositis and DM. As immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) was only recently recognized as a distinct entity, only small numbers of these cases were included in the classification design process. The authors were thus unable to distinguish PM from IMNM in the classification tree.

Inflammatory Myopathies and Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

The topic of inflammatory myopathies is an evolving one with different perspectives on the diseases and their classifications, see for example Pestronk (39), Allenbach et al (10), and Tanboon and Nishino (40). Older terms, such as dermatomyositis and polymyositis, are now largely replaced by terms like immune myopathy with perimysial pathology, dermatomyositis spectrum disorders, antisynthetase syndrome myositis, sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM), and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM).

### Revisiting idiopathic eosinophilic myositis: towards a clinical-pathological continuum from the muscle to the fascia and skin [^112rwbHy]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic eosinophilic myositis (IEM) is a rare acquired idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, first described in 1977 and defined by myositis with unusual eosinophilic infiltration into the muscle and/or blood eosinophilia. IEM aetiology is unknown and no autoantibody has been associated with this disease. Regarding pathogenesis, it has been proposed that the eosinophil-containing granules (major basic proteins and eosinophil cationic proteins) are elevated in the muscles of eosinophiles-associated myopathies, likely inducing cytotoxic consequences. Advances in the understanding of eosinophil functions demonstrate that eosinophils are involved in dysimmune disease pathogenesis through a maladaptive response called 'eosinophilic immune dysfunction', thus impacting T cell, plasma cell and B cell functions, and providing a partial explanation of the remote actions of eosinophils.

Based on previous case reports, Selva-O'Callaghan et al. proposed the distinction of three IEM subtypes. Focal IEM consists in a limited form, characterized by pain, swelling, deep mononuclear cell infiltration (with eosinophils) and necrosis on muscle biopsy. Eosinophilic polymyositis is characterized by muscle weakness and a widespread deep infiltration of eosinophils in the muscle associated with necrosis. Patients with eosinophilic perimyositis present with myalgia, and the eosinophilic infiltrate is limited to the fascia and the superficial perimysium; necrosis is absent from the muscle biopsy. Blood eosinophilia can occur in the three subtypes, while elevated serum levels of creatine kinase (CK) are inconstantly reported. A comprehensive review of the literature showed that eosinophils infiltrating the muscle have also been reported in a few rare cases of EF (also known as Shulman syndrome, first described in 1975). A 1979 pathological study also identified clear muscle damage in 20 patients with EF. Indeed, most studies define EF as the association of evocative skin involvement (induration, swelling, oedema, groove sign), a thickening of the fascia with inflammatory infiltrate; blood eosinophilia is considered as a minor criterion. While muscle involvement in EF remains elusive, one descriptive study performed in 1990 had proposed that EF, eosinophilic perimyositis, focal eosinophilic myositis and eosinophilic polymyositis (including respectively 15, 7, 1 and 1 cases, respectively) appeared on a nuanced spectrum of overlapping clinical and histopathological features. Since the latter study was based on a rather small number of cases and given the current definition of EF in which muscle is not considered, the possible consideration of a continuum remains pending. To date, IEM classification is mainly based on the histological analysis of the muscle without consideration of the fascia while the opposite approach is applied for EF. In each case, the diagnosis definition does not consider the overall clinical and investigational features of the patient, thus potentially providing an incomplete definition of these diseases.

### Nuclear actin aggregation is a hallmark of anti-synthetase syndrome-induced dysimmune myopathy [^113UXvGQ]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze antisynthetase syndrome-associated myositis by modern myopathologic methods and to define its place in the spectrum of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs).

Methods

Skeletal muscle biopsies from antisynthetase syndrome-associated myositis and other IIMs from different institutions worldwide were analyzed by histopathology, quantitative PCR, and electron microscopy.

Results

Myonuclear actin filament inclusions were identified as a unique morphologic hallmark of antisynthetase syndrome-associated myositis. Nuclear actin inclusions were never found in dermatomyositis, polymyositis, sporadic inclusion body myositis, autoimmune necrotizing myopathy associated with signal recognition particle or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase autoantibodies, or nonspecific myositis associated with other systemic diseases, harboring myositis-associated autoantibodies, and presenting myofiber necrosis. We show that molecules involved in actin filament formation and actin shuttling mechanisms are altered in antisynthetase syndrome, and may thus be involved in pathologic myonuclear actin aggregation. In addition, we have identified a typical topographic distribution of necrotic myofibers predominantly located at the periphery of muscle fascicles accompanied by inflammation and destruction of the perimysial connective tissue.

Conclusion

Antisynthetase syndrome-associated myositis is characterized by distinctive myonuclear actin filament inclusions, including rod formations and a typical necrotizing perimysial myositis. This supports the hypothesis that antisynthetase syndrome-associated myositis is unique and should not be grouped among dermatomyositis, polymyositis, sporadic inclusion body myositis, necrotizing autoimmune myositis, or nonspecific myositis.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with IIMs, the presence of myonuclear actin filament inclusions accurately identifies patients with antisynthetase syndrome-associated myositis (sensitivity 81%, specificity 100%).

### Classification criteria in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: is It time for an update? [^1122BVFm]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Since Bohan-Peter criteria, several classification criteria for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) have been proposed reflecting the advancements in understanding of these diseases over the years. This created a strong foundation for development of the first data-derived IIM criteria. Since its publication in 2017, European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR)-American College of Rheumatology (ACR) IIM criteria have been widely used in studies, demonstrating good performance across various populations. However, the emergence of new IIM subtypes and advancements in diagnostics have exposed gaps in the criteria, necessitating a revision. This article summarizes the historical evolution of the IIM classification criteria and outlines the key reasons for revision of the EULAR-ACR criteria.

### Myopathy with anti-HMGCR antibodies: perimysium and myofiber pathology [^112QCZDU]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Myopathology.

Common myopathic features involved muscle fibers and perimysial connective tissue (table; figures 1–3). Muscle fiber pathology included evidence of ongoing damage, with fibers in varied stages of necrosis (52%) and regeneration or immaturity (66%) (figure 1). C 5b-9 complement stained the cytoplasm of some necrotic muscle fibers but was not typically deposited on the surface of non-necrotic muscle fibers. Large clusters of contiguous damaged fibers were not present. In some muscles, immature fibers and necrosis were most prominent at the edge of fascicles near damaged or cellular perimysial connective tissue (figure 3, C and F). Focal invasion of muscle fibers by cells was present in a few patients (7%). Myonuclear pathology (43%) (figure 2) included enlargement, irregular shapes, empty central regions, and clusters. Perimysial connective tissue pathology was present in 61% of biopsies, with diffuse alkaline phosphatase staining (figure 1C), histiocytic (acid phosphatase- and esterase-positive) cells (figure 3, B and E), or damaged structure (figure 3D). The most common general pathologic pattern (57%; 25/44) was for both muscle fiber and perimysial pathology to be present. Muscles with neither muscle fiber nor perimysial pathology occurred in 25% (11/44). Weakness was more common (p = 0.017) in patients with perimysial damage (100%) than in those without perimysial damage (77%). Anti-HMGCR antibody titers were higher in patients with muscle biopsies showing muscle fiber necrosis (19,748 ± 4,509 vs 6,538 ± 1,249; p = 0.001) and connective tissue damage (17,841 ± 3,998 vs 6,459 ± 1,027; p = 0.03). Some biopsies contained lymphocytic cell foci (27%), generally surrounding intermediate-sized perimysial vessels. MHC class I was diffusely upregulated by all muscle fibers in some biopsies (30%). In some cases MHC class I expression was more prominent on fibers at the edge of fascicles near perimysium. There were no differences in biopsy features between patients with or without statin use. Endomysial connective tissue was increased in a few biopsies (8%), mostly in patients with longer histories of disease (figure 1). Vacuoles in muscle fibers were not observed.

### A review of inflammatory idiopathic myopathy focusing on polymyositis [^113RbX3n]. European Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Inflammatory idiopathic myopathies are a group of autoimmune diseases affecting predominantly the proximal skeletal muscles, with raised muscle enzymes, with or without skin involvement and extramuscular organ involvement. Autoantibodies help to characterize patients into different clinical phenotypes. Successful treatment necessitates controlling inflammation early with corticosteroids and invariably requires additional immunosuppressive therapy. This review focuses on the aetiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, investigations and management of patients presenting with inflammatory idiopathic myopathies, predominantly focusing on polymyositis and antisynthetase syndrome.

### An overview of polymyositis and dermatomyositis [^1157Hdr8]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are inflammatory myopathies that differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. Treatment relies mainly upon empirical use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. A deeper understanding of the molecular pathways that drive pathogenesis, careful phenotyping, and accurate disease classification will aid clinical research and development of more efficacious treatments. In this review we address the current knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic evaluation, classification, pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis of polymyositis and dermatomyositis.

### Disease spectrum of myopathies with elevated aldolase and normal creatine kinase [^112a22yN]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our findings expand the spectrum of myopathies with elevated aldolase and normal CK levels to include not only dermatomyositis and other inflammatory myopathies but also a variety of other acquired myopathies, as shown in Figure 1, most of which are treatable diseases. This emphasizes the importance of measuring aldolase levels in patients with suspected myopathy, which helps increase the sensitivity of myopathy detection, especially in patients with normal CK levels. It is also important to note that aldolase may remain elevated even in the advanced stage of immune‐mediated necrotizing myopathy or in steroid‐treated patients who had normal CK levels.

Nozaki and Pestronk identified perimysial pathology in 11/12 (92%) patients with myopathy featuring selective elevation of aldolase. In our cohort, combining all conditions that affect the perimysium including any perimysial inflammation, amyloid deposition and vasculitis, such pathology was observed in only 17/34 (50%) patients. Fibrillation potentials were observed in 80% of our patients compared to 18% of patients reported by Nozaki and Pestronk. These discrepancies of myopathology and electrodiagnostic findings could be due to a broader spectrum of myopathies included in our cohort.

In dermatomyositis, CK can be normal in about 10%–26% of patients. Comparing dermatomyositis patients with and without hyperCKemia, few significant differences were found between these two groups. In our cohort, cutaneous involvement was more common in the hyperCKemia group (100% vs. 50%), which is opposite to what was observed in the prior study that all dermatomyositis patients with normal CK (9/9) had rashes. This difference could stem from the different diagnostic criteria for dermatomyositis applied in the study. A pathological diagnosis was used, whilst the previous study used Bohan and Peter criteria. In the Bohan and Peter criteria, rashes are a must for a definitive diagnosis of dermatomyositis if no muscle pathology is available, whilst in fact dermatomyositis patients may have myositis without cutaneous manifestations.

### Current efforts and historical perspectives on classification of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^111j6RkZ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The classification of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies is challenging due to the large number of clinical, serological, histopathological and genetic findings, as well as the latest findings and developments in the field of myositis research. The latest official classification criteria are the 2017 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for adult and juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, which have been extensively reviewed in recent years for their applicability, sensitivity and specificity.

Recent Findings

The sensitivity and specificity of the 2017ACR/EULAR criteria are sometimes performing better, but usually at the same level as the previous criteria. A large number of further suggestions for amendments to the criteria have been made. In particular there is a need to revise the criteria with regard to the addition of new myositis-specific autoantibodies, newly defined subgroups (especially antisynthetase syndrome, immune medicated necrotizing myopathy and overlap myositis) and possibly the addition of further diagnostic procedures (for instance, muscle MRI or PET CT) to improve the accuracy and timeliness of the criteria.

Summary

Efforts to optimize the myositis classification criteria have been extensive in recent years and a new global interdisciplinary collaboration of clinicians is currently taking place based on the previous results with the aim of revising the 2017EULAR/ACR classification criteria.

### Diagnosis and classification of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^114CKLM1]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases, collectively termed myositis, sharing symptoms of muscle weakness, fatigue and inflammation. Other organs are frequently involved, supporting the notion that these are systemic inflammatory diseases. The IIMs can be subgrouped into dermatomyositis, polymyositis and inclusion body myositis. The myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) identify other and often more distinct clinical phenotypes, such as the antisynthetase syndrome with antisynthetase autoantibodies and frequent interstitial lung disease and anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR autoantibodies that identify necrotizing myopathy. The MSAs are important both to support myositis diagnosis and to identify subgroups with different patterns of extramuscular organ involvement such as interstitial lung disease. Another cornerstone in the diagnostic procedure is muscle biopsy to identify inflammation and to exclude noninflammatory myopathies. Treatment effect and prognosis vary by subgroup. To develop new and better therapies, validated classification criteria that identify distinct subgroups of myositis are critical. The lack of such criteria was the main rationale for the development of new classification criteria for IIMs, which are summarized in this review; the historical background regarding previous diagnostic and classification criteria is also reviewed. As the IIMs are rare diseases with a prevalence of 10 in 100 000 individuals, an international collaboration was essential, as was the interdisciplinary effort including experts in adult and paediatric rheumatology, neurology, dermatology and epidemiology. The new criteria have been developed based on data from more than 1500 patients from 47 centres worldwide and are based on clinically easily available variables.

### Immune myopathies with perimysial pathology: clinical and laboratory features [^117HBMv2]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have proposed that IIMs are usefully classified according to patterns of involvement of different tissues in muscle and types of cellular and humoral immune features. In this study, we compared patients with IMPP, whose distinctive myopathologic features include damage to perimysial connective tissue, muscle fiber necrosis, and histiocytic inflammatory cellularity, to DM-VP, a disorder with large and small vessel damage, muscle fiber atrophy, but not necrosis, and lymphocytic perivascular inflammation (Table 1; figure). The distinctive pathologic features of IMPP and DM-VP in this study are consistent with previously reported patterns.,

Several systemic and laboratory features of patients with IMPP differed from DM-VP. IMPP patients more often had joint disorders and ILD. Neoplasm occurrence and cancer-related deaths were less frequent in IMPP. The type of skin pathology differed between the groups. Mechanic's hands and Raynaud phenomenon were nearly exclusive to IMPP. Serum Jo-1 antibodies were also more frequent in IMPP (37% vs 6% in DM-VP).

### Sporadic inclusion body myositis: pathogenic considerations [^111UTVA4]. Annals of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Sporadic inclusion body myositis is the commonest acquired disease of skeletal muscles after 50 years of age, and as such it has commanded a great deal of attention of investigators over the past 25 years. As a result, a large amount of information has accumulated concerning its clinical profile, myopathology, and immunopathology. In the myopathology and immunopathology, there is general agreement that the characteristic features could be divided into a degenerative and an inflammatory group. However, there has been controversy about the possible role of these changes in the pathogenesis of muscle fiber damage. In particular, there is no agreement whether a cause-and-effect relationship exists between these two groups of changes, and if so, which is the primary one. In this brief overview, we examine the validity of the various controversial observations and critically review the justification for the two major hypotheses for the primary role of inflammation versus degeneration.

### Muscle weakness in myositis: microRNA-mediated dystrophin reduction in a myositis mouse model and human muscle biopsies [^114RpdJs]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are a heterogeneous group of systemic connective tissue diseases characterized by chronic muscle inflammation and weakness. This group of diseases, which includes dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis, and inclusion body myositis (IBM) (collectively referred to as myositis), affects both adults and children. Although rare, there is evidence that disease incidence is increasing 1. Histologic features of myositis include the following: 1) endomysial, perimysial, or perivascular infiltration by inflammatory cells, consisting predominantly of macrophages and T cells 2, 3; 2) myofiber‐specific expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules; and 3) bouts of muscle degeneration/regeneration, fibrosis, and fat deposition 4. Of these, the most striking feature is the overexpression of MHC class I in the muscle of patients with myositis 5, 6.

The role of the innate and adaptive immune systems in myositis is well known, but results recently reported suggest that nonimmune mechanisms also contribute to the disease (for review, see refs 7 and 8), as there is not a strong correlation between the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration and muscle weakness in patients with myositis 9. Interestingly, myositis muscle seems primed for inflammatory signaling events, since it inappropriately expresses Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) 10, 11 and MHC class I 5, 6, which act as receptors that are normally confined to immune cells. Stimulation of TLR‐7 and MHC class I activates the proinflammatory transcription factor NF‐κB. In addition, TLR‐7 is a potent inducer of type I interferon (IFN) genes 12; this gene expression signature correlates with disease severity both in patients with DM 13, 14, 15, 16 and in those with juvenile DM 15, 17.

### Is it really myositis? A consideration of the differential diagnosis [^113Nv5rG]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are an important and treatable group of disorders. However, the potential toxicity associated with the immune therapeutic regimens used to treat these disorders may be significant; therefore, accurate diagnosis before such treatment is essential. The differential diagnosis is potentially large. Accurate diagnosis usually depends on a combination of careful clinical assessment in conjunction with detailed laboratory investigations. Muscle biopsy remains essential in achieving an accurate diagnosis that will then guide treatment. This review describes the diagnostic approach used.

Recent Findings

There has been debate over the requirements for an accurate diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy (i.e., polymyositis and dermatomyositis). It is increasingly recognized that there can be clinical and muscle histopathologic overlap between the features of inflammatory myopathies and those of other muscle disorders, in particular, the genetic muscular dystrophies. Pathologic findings of inflammation and major histocompatibility complex upregulation, although typical of inflammatory myopathies, have been shown to occur in some muscular dystrophies, complicating the diagnostic process. Inclusion body myositis is much less responsive to immunotherapy and is now recognized as the most common acquired muscle disease in those older than 50 years of age. It is likely that genetic muscular dystrophies and inclusion body myositis account for some cases of apparently "treatment-resistant" myositis.

Summary

A thorough clinical assessment, including a detailed family history, complemented by electromyography and creatine kinase measurements, should be undertaken in any patient with presumed idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. In addition, a muscle biopsy remains essential in all cases. A precise tissue diagnosis confirming features of an active inflammatory process should be achieved before immunosuppressive treatment is commenced. An increasing array of immunocytochemical and histioenzymatic stains now allows a full analysis and will help to confirm or exclude virtually all the differential diagnostic possibilities considered in this review. Electron microscopy may also be valuable in selected cases. Close collaboration between clinicians and muscle pathologists is essential in allowing the most accurate interpretation of myopathologic findings in the clinical context.

Inflammatory Myopathies

Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy that affects both adult and pediatric populations and often features skin manifestations, such as papules (Gottron papules) or erythema over the dorsal digits, heliotrope erythema surrounding the orbit, and erythematous macules, among other dermatological manifestations. Muscle weakness, often proximal in distribution, and myalgia are also present. On H&E evaluation, an inflammatory infiltrate may be found predominantly in a perimysial, perivascular distribution. Perifascicular atrophy with or without myonecrosis and regeneration is the signature histopathologic change readily evident in H&E-stained sections (Fig. 3D). Additional autoimmune disorders share the perifascicular and perimysial pattern of pathology and fall into the categories of dermatomyositis spectrum disorders or the antisynthetase myositis spectrum.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy that typically affects middle-aged to older individuals. Clinical signs include difficulty with ambulation and standing, handgrip, and swallowing. Myofibers with rimmed vacuoles, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions, endomysial inflammation, and atrophic fibers (sometimes mimicking neurogenic atrophy) are seen on H&E-stained sections in IBM (Fig. 3E).

The finding of granulomas on H&E sections of a muscle biopsy (Fig. 3F) should raise the possibility of myopathic involvement by sarcoidosis, a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology and diagnosis of exclusion.

Congenital Myopathies

Centronuclear myopathies are a group of genetic diseases classified under the larger category of congenital myopathies and include X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance. Symptoms, severity of disease, etiology, and age of onset vary, but central nuclei are seen on H&E sections (Fig. 3G).

Central core disease is a congenital myopathy typically affecting infants and children, often manifesting with hypotonia and abnormalities in motor development, and caused by mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene at chromosome 19q13.1. Central cores are seen on H&E sections (Fig. 3H).

Inflammatory Myopathies and Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

The topic of inflammatory myopathies is an evolving one with different perspectives on the diseases and their classifications, see for example Pestronk, Allenbach et al, and Tanboon and Nashino. Older terms, such as dermatomyositis and polymyositis, are now largely replaced by terms like immune myopathy with perimysial pathology, dermatomyositis spectrum disorders, antisynthetase syndrome myositis, sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM), and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM).

sIBM is the most common inflammatory myopathy and tends to have a strong clinical-pathological correlation. At the time of muscle biopsy (Fig. 10A–C), sIBM often shows evidence of chronic necrotizing disease with variable degrees of inflammatory cell infiltrates, rimmed vacuoles, and COX-negative fibers (not shown). Diffuse MHC class I expression is common. Cytoplasmic protein aggregates, such as TDP-43, may also present and can be demonstrated with immunohistochemistry.

FIGURE 10.
Myositis and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM). The more common forms of inflammatory myopathy are readily distinguished by hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunofluorescence. (A – C) In this patient with inclusion body myositis, the biopsy manifests lymphocytic infiltrates, endomysial fibrosis, fatty replacement, rimmed-vacuoles, and diffuse expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) class I. (D – F) A perifascicular pattern of myonecrosis, regeneration, and MHC class I expression define this example of dermatomyositis spectrum disorder. Embryonic myosin heavy chain is a marker of regeneration (E). IMNM is not easily distinguishable from other types of necrotizing myopathy (G – I). The patient illustrated in panels G and I became symptomatic while taking a statin. The patient shown in panel H is statin-naïve and was followed for several years with a clinical diagnosis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Both patients have highly elevated anti-HMGCR antibodies. The pattern of MHC class I expression (I) closely follows the pattern of myonecrosis. The scale bar in panel I is 50 µm for panels B and H; 100 µm for panels A, C, G, and I; 200 µm for panels D–F.

### Recent developments in classification criteria and diagnosis guidelines for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^1115DgzT]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Using data from 976 IIM cases and 624 comparators, the combination of candidate variables that could most accurately distinguish between IIM and non-IIM participants was identified. The variables included in the final classification criteria are displayed in Table 2. Each variable was assigned a weighted score, according to the coefficient from a logistic regression model. The sum of the scores that a potential study participant fulfils corresponds to their probability of having an IIM. Without muscle biopsy data, a score between 5.5 (55% probability) and 7.5 (90% probability) corresponds to 'probable IIM' and a score equal to or greater than 7.5 corresponds to 'definite IIM'. With biopsy data, a score between 6.7 (55% probability) and 8.7 (90% probability) corresponds to 'probable IIM' and a score equal to or greater than 8.7 is 'definite IIM'.

Table 2

The likely IIM subtype of each case can also be ascertained, according to the published classification tree (Fig. 1). Subtype identification can only be carried out on cases with an IIM diagnostic probability of greater than 55%. Further, only those with polymyositis, inclusion body myositis (IBM), dermatomyositis, amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM) and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) can be identified, in part due to the small number of cases of IMNM, hypomyopathic dermatomyositis, ASS and overlap myositis cases in the development population.

For inclusion body myositis (IBM) classification, one of the following is required for classification: finger flexor weakness and response to treatment: not improved (a), or muscle biopsy: rimmed vacuoles (b). c Juvenile myositis other than juvenile dermatomyositis was developed based on expert opinion.

### Polymyositis: does it really exist as a distinct clinical subset? [^111idWnc]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize information on polymyositis; diagnosis, definitions, published data and opinions.

Recent Findings

Polymyositis originally referred to inflammatory muscle diseases presenting with muscle weakness and inflammatory cell infiltrates on muscle tissue visible by microscopy. Over time and with improved technology to immunophenotype infiltrating inflammatory cells and characterize muscle fibres, the meaning of polymyositis changed and became more specific. There is ongoing controversy over the term polymyositis, with proponents for a strict definition based on histopathological and immunohistochemical features on muscle biopsies whereas others advocate for a broader clinical and histopathological phenotype. Over the past decades, the discovery of several myositis-specific autoantibodies together with distinct histopathological features have enabled the identification of new subsets previously labelled as polymyositis notably the antisynthetase syndrome and the immune-mediated necrotizing myopathies thus reducing the number of patients classified as polymyositis.

Summary

There are still a small number of patients among the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies that can be classified as polymyositis as discussed in this review but the entity is now considered relatively rare.

### Mitochondrial pathology in immune and inflammatory myopathies [^112Wojiw]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acquired immune and inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are typically subdivided into dermatomyositis, polymyositis and inclusion body myositis. However, many types of IIMs do not fit well into this scheme. Several myopathologic and autoantibody features of IIMs, that are not considered in standard classifications, are useful for defining individual disorders. We will review one set of myopathologic features that occur in some IIMs, mitochondrial abnormalities, and consider its diagnostic, treatment-related and pathogenic implications.

Recent Findings

Myopathologic changes that indicate mitochondrial disorders are often widespread in regions of muscle fiber abnormality in dermatomyositis. They distinguish dermatomyositis with vascular pathology from other inflammatory myopathies with skin changes that have prominent perimysial connective tissue lesions, but no mitochondrial, abnormalities. Mitochondrial abnormalities in scattered muscle fibers occur in sporadic inclusion body myositis and clinically similar disorders. Mitochondrial abnormalities in scattered nonnecrotic muscle fibers in IIM biopsies predict a poor response to immunosuppression.

Summary

Muscle biopsy, including evaluation of mitochondrial stains, is important for the correct diagnosis of inflammatory myopathies. By recognizing the full range of distinctive myopathologic changes in the diverse group of IIMs, the clinician can improve diagnostic accuracy and apply appropriate treatment.

### Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: definition and management of refractory disease [^116HrhEJ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Adult idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, commonly referred to as myositis, are a heterogeneous group of diseases with an autoimmune etiology. In this review, the authors are going to focus on myositis excluding inclusion body myositis. They will review the prognostic factors (for mortality and response to steroids), define refractory disease, introduce a new concept (presumed refractory disease), analyze definitions of active disease, damage and improvement criteria, and summarize therapeutic alternatives for refractory patients, based on different disease phenotypes.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related myositis: from pathophysiology to treatment [^112FH4GR]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

With rapid advances in immuno-oncology, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are increasingly used for a broad array of malignancies. This has led to a novel spectrum of adverse effects including ICI-related myositis, a potentially life-threatening neuromuscular complication that must be diagnosed and treated promptly. Significant gaps exist in the current understanding of ICI-related myositis due to the rarity of the condition and the lack of evidence-based guidelines, prompting the need to synthesize the most relevant and recent published works in the field. This review provides a broad overview of ICI-related myositis with an emphasis on pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical features, workup, management and future directions.

### Muscle pathology of antisynthetase syndrome according to antibody subtypes [^112o2Mdq]. Brain Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti‐Jo‐1 ASS has been categorized as an immune myopathy with perimysial pathology (IMPP) showing a combination of PFN and perimysial pathology (i.e. perimysial connective tissue fragmentation and increased perimysial ALP activity). Nevertheless, these features are shared by other ASS subtypes and anti‐Mi‐2 DM. The fact that PFN is more common in anti‐PL‐7 ASS could be explained by their myopathology severity which ranks between the higher end of the spectrum (represented by anti‐OJ and anti‐EJ ASS) and the lower end of the spectrum (represented by anti‐PL‐12 and anti‐Jo‐1 ASS). Notably, PFN is not present in our anti‐PL‐12 ASS. In our study, the most common myopathology pattern in ASS is necrotizing myopathy without PFN. Perimysial connective tissue fragmentation is not distinctively different among ASS subtypes. The more common perimysial ALP expression in anti‐OJ and anti‐EJ ASS is likely associated with the high perimysial CD68‐positive cell infiltration scores (eTable S5); a subset of tumor necrosis factor‐α and interleukin‐1β‐secreting CD68‐positive cells could induce tissue‐nonspecific ALPs expression. Reduction of CFR in all ASS subtypes, except for anti‐PL‐7, could be the result of C5b‐9 deposition capillary damage. Interestingly, while the number of anti‐PL‐7 ASS with capillary C5b‐9 deposition in our study is not different from the other antibody subtypes, their CFR is not significantly decreased. These results suggest possible unidentified factor(s) causing different degree of capillary damage and tissue hypoxia among ASS subtypes. The higher number of PFA in anti‐EJ and anti‐OJ ASS could be attributed to their more profound muscle pathology. The underlying mechanism for tissue injury is possibly different considering the higher inflammatory domain score in anti‐OJ ASS. Whether the underlying pathomechanism(s) of ASS features are different from those of the features shared with other autoimmune myositis, especially DM, remains to be elucidated.

### Myopathy with anti-HMGCR antibodies: perimysium and myofiber pathology [^114ajRtJ]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Our myopathology results differ from previous descriptions of HMGCR patients, which have mainly emphasized the myopathy as "necrotic". One reason for this discrepancy is that some studies have biased their results by selecting patients based on the presence of muscle fiber necrosis. Another issue reducing reporting of perimysial damage may be that our pathology laboratory routinely performs histochemical analysis of muscle biopsies that includes acid and alkaline phosphatase stains. Acid and alkaline phosphatase stains are especially sensitive for observing cellular and molecular pathology in perimysial connective tissue. They are not routinely performed in many laboratories and were not reported in previous HMGCR series.

The specificity of HMGCR antibodies in immune and other myopathies requires further study. One series reported that HMGCR antibodies occur in 10% of patients with an entirely different disorder, inclusion body myositis. Our initial results, identifying 49 antibody-positive patients, were at least partly the result of clinicians with a suspicion of an HMGCR antibody–associated syndrome ordering serum testing. Our follow-up review of patients diagnosed with inclusion body myositis suggested a prevalence of 5.4%. However, review of the muscle biopsies in the 2 positive patients showed perimysial connective tissue damage in addition to the typical inclusion body myositis pathology. It is well-known that there is an increased frequency of associated immune features in inclusion body myositis, including antinuclear antibodies, SSA, and M proteins. Clinically, the patients had features that were somewhat atypical for inclusion body myositis, including younger onset in the fifth decade and prominent proximal weakness early in the disease course. This suggests that these patients may have had 2 concurrent myopathy syndromes, inclusion body myositis and HMGCR antibody–associated myopathology. HMGCR antibodies may correlate better with specific pathology features than with general clinical diagnoses.

### Clinical and histopathological features of myositis in systemic lupus erythematosus [^117LG4Kz]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Patient characterisation

This is a nested case–control study of all subjects enrolled in the Hopkins Lupus Cohort database from May 1987 to June 2016. This database included 2437 subjects who met the revised 1982 American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLEor the Systemic Lupus Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria for the classification of SLE. All patients have given informed consent before participating in the study. The patients were seen at least every 3 months, and at each visit all relevant clinical information was collected. Patients were diagnosed with SLE myopathy if they had muscle weakness/myalgias along with one or more of the following: (1) elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, (2) muscle oedema on MRI, (3) myopathic electromyography (EMG) findings or (4) a muscle biopsy demonstrating a myopathic process.

Clinical data

Demographic data including age, gender and race were obtained from the database. Clinical data analysed included SLE manifestations, serological markers and SLE-associated damage. If missing, additional clinical information was obtained from a comprehensive medical chart review.

Muscle histology

For patients who had muscle biopsies obtained at Johns Hopkins, frozen sections were stained using H&E, modified Gomori trichrome, myosin adenosine triphosphatase (pH 4.3, 4.6 and 9.4), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-tetrazolium reductase, acid phosphatase, succinate dehydrogenase stain (SDH), cytochrome esterase, alkaline phosphatase, Periodic Acid-Schiff stain (PAS), PAS-diastase control and Congo red. All available muscle biopsies were reviewed by the same pathologist (AC) and assessed for myofibre necrosis, perifascicular atrophy, perivascular inflammation, lymphocytic invasion of non-necrotic muscle fibres (ie, primary inflammation), and endomysial or perimysial inflammation. Based on their individual features, these were categorised as polymyositis, dermatomyositis, necrotising myopathy or non-specific myositis; these categories were adapted from the European NeuroMuscular Centre histopathological criteria as previously described.

Statistical analyses

Patients with myositis versus those without myositis were compared with respect to patient characteristics and clinical features. OR, p values and 95% CIs were determined using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. ORs were adjusted for gender and race. For continuous variables, p values were determined using a t-test. All statistical calculations were performed using JMP V.14.0 (SAS, Cary, North Carolina).

### Immune myopathies with perimysial pathology: clinical and laboratory features [^115kJady]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical syndromes in patients with IMPP myopathology showed some features that were also common in DM-VP and immune myopathies in general. These features included female predominance, wide variability in age at onset, weakness that is proximal greater than distal and symmetric, dysphagia, and myalgias. The disease course was subacute or chronic, with durations over months to years.

The frequency of skin disorders was similar in IMPP and DM-VP groups. Clinically, approximately 75% of both groups would have been characterized as dermatomyositis by commonly used criteria. Differences in muscle pathology suggest that immune dermatomyopathies may actually comprise several distinct clinical and pathologic syndromes. IMPP dermatomyopathy syndromes seem likely to be due to connective tissue damage, while DM-VP is probably a vascular disorder. Another dermatomyopathy syndrome, regional ischemic immune myopathy (RIIM), has prominent vascular pathology with muscle fiber necrosis occurring in border-zone regions of muscle, a different pattern from IMPP and DM-VP. Both of these vascular dermatomyopathies (RIIM and DM-VP) are associated with an increased frequency of neoplasms and likely account for a substantial proportion of the established association between dermatomyositis (as defined by other criteria) and malignancy. Overall, it is likely that the dermatomyopathies, or "dermatomyositis", should be considered a group of disorders with varying comorbid conditions beyond skin and muscle, rather than a single homogeneous disease.

### Uncertainties in the pathogenesis of adult dermatomyositis [^1172voZ7]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory disorder of muscle affecting both children and adults. The pathogenesis of adult dermatomyositis is reviewed here, with particular attention to gaps and uncertainties in our current understanding of this disease, in order to focus attention on the outstanding research questions with regard to disease mechanisms.

Recent Findings

The conceptual model of the pathophysiology of dermatomyositis has been based on work extending back over at least 35 years, with important findings related to the deposition of membrane attack complex, the character of the inflammatory infiltrate, and the primacy of capillary abnormalities established over 10 years ago. The lack of significant additions to the understanding of this disease over the past few years suggests a state of contentment with current knowledge. Accordingly, we emphasize the uncertainties of this knowledge and the need for re-addressing some of its basic tenets.

Summary

Although evidence remains strong that dermatomyositis is a disorder with an early involvement of the capillaries, the concept that it results from an antibody-mediated attack upon the endothelium is uncertain. It is not clear whether membrane attack complex is activated by antibody-dependent or independent means, whether or not intramuscular B cells are antigen specific and synthesize significant quantities of antibodies, whether the presence of tubuloreticular inclusions precedes, follows, or is independent of membrane attack complex deposition, what is the mechanism of perifascicular atrophy, and what is the relationship of dermatomyositis to systemic lupus erythematosus.

### The performance of the European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology idiopathic inflammatory myopathies classification criteria in an expert-defined 10 year incident cohort [^115rSbdx]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The first widely accepted classification criteria for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) were published in 1975, but challenges remain when applying classification or diagnostic criteria to IIMs. This is at least in part because the IIMs are inherently heterogeneous in their organ-specific manifestations as well as their severity, disease trajectory and response to treatment, even within well-defined disease subtypes. Recent research has progressed our understanding of disease pathogenesis, genetic associations, molecular pathways, clinical subtypes, histological features and autoantibody associations. Translating this contemporary progress into clinical practice has occurred more readily than has been reflected in the development of updated diagnostic and classification criteria needed to identify and stratify patients for subsequent research studies. However, given the tight interdependent relationship between clinical progress and research, especially in conditions as rare as IIM, it is important to ensure classification criteria remain updated and as clinically relevant as possible. These priorities have been well summarized by Lundberg et al.

### Eosinophilic myositis: an updated review [^115fNXGR]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Eosinophilia-associated myopathies are clinically and pathologically heterogeneous conditions characterized by the presence of peripheral and/or muscle eosinophilia. There are at least three distinct subtypes: focal eosinophilic myositis, eosinophilic polymyositis, and eosinophilic perimyositis. Infiltrating eosinophils are not always identified in conventional muscle histologic examination, but the eosinophil major basic protein, whose extracellular diffusion is considered a hallmark of eosinophilic cytotoxicity, is usually detected by immunostaining in muscle biopsy. Whereas focal eosinophilic myositis seems to be a benign and isolated condition, and perimyositis is usually related with the inflammatory infiltrate due to fasciitis, eosinophilic polymyositis can be associated with muscular dystrophy or be a feature of multiorgan hypereosinophilic syndrome. Muscle biopsy remains the cornerstone for the diagnosis. Parasitic infections, connective tissue disorders, hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies, drugs, and toxic substances are the main etiologic agents of eosinophilia-associated myopathy. However, in some cases, no known etiologic factor is identified, and these are considered idiopathic. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay therapy in idiopathic forms. Imatinib and mepolizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin 5 monoclonal antibody, may be useful in patients with eosinophilic myositis as part of a hypereosinophilic syndrome.

### Disease spectrum of myopathies with elevated aldolase and normal creatine kinase [^1122Q4TA]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) or hyperCKemia is considered a biological marker of myopathies. However, selective elevation of serum aldolase with normal CK has been reported in a few myopathies, including dermatomyositis, immune-mediated myopathy with perimysial pathology and fasciitis with associated myopathy. The aim was to investigate the disease spectrum of myopathies with isolated aldolase elevation.

Methods

Medical records were reviewed to identify patients > 18years old seen between December 1994 and June 2020 who had pathologically proven myopathies with elevated aldolase and normal CK level. Patients with alternative causes of aldolase elevation were excluded.

Results

Thirty-four patients with various types of myopathies were identified. Myopathies were treatable in 27 patients. The three most common etiologies were dermatomyositis (n = 8), overlap myositis (n = 4) and nonspecific myopathy (n = 4). Perimysial pathology comprising inflammation, fragmentation, vasculitis, calcified perimysial vessels or extracellular amyloid deposition was found in 17/34 patients (50%). Eight dermatomyositis patients with selective elevated aldolase were compared to 24 sex- and age-matched patients with dermatomyositis and hyperCKemia. Dermatomyositis patients with normal CK significantly (p < 0.05) had less frequent cutaneous involvement (50.0% vs. 100.0%) and fibrillation potentials (50.0% vs. 90.5%) but higher median erythrocyte sedimentation rate (33.5 vs. 13.5mm/h) and more common perifascicular mitochondrial pathology (37.5% vs. 4.2%).

Conclusion

Isolated aldolase elevation can be found in a greater variety of myopathies than initially thought and most were treatable. Dermatomyositis is the most common myopathy with selective elevation of aldolase in our cohort, which features some unique characteristics compared to dermatomyositis with hyperCKemia.

### Muscle biopsy findings in inflammatory myopathies [^113qbgZX]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The inflammatory myopathies encompass a heterogeneous group of acquired muscle diseases characterized clinically, by muscle weakness, and histologically, by inflammatory infiltrates within the skeletal muscles. The group of these myopathies comprise three major and discrete subsets: polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), and inclusion body myositis (IBM). Each subset retains its characteristic clinical, immunopathologic, and morphologic features regardless of whether it occurs separately or in connection with other systemic diseases. Although the diagnosis of these disorders is based on the combination of clinical examination, electromyographic data, serum muscle enzyme levels, various autoantibodies, and the muscle biopsy findings, the muscle biopsy offers the most definitive diagnostic information in the majority of the cases. This article summarizes the main histologic features that characterize PM, DM, or IBM and emphasizes the main pitfalls associated with interpretation of the biopsies.

### Importance of clinical observations [^113p8JBJ]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

In another study, Bucelli and Pestronkperformed a retrospective chart and pathology review of 57 consecutive patients with pathologic findings characterized by damage to perimysial connective tissue and muscle fiber necrosis more prominent near the perimysium. The authors coined the term "immune myopathies with perimysial pathology" (IMPP) to group several known clinical and serological disorders such as inflammatory myopathies occurring with antibodies against aminoacyl–tRNA synthetase or hydroxymethylglutarylCoA reductase. The clinical and pathologic features of this complex group of disorders were then compared with those of 20 patients with dermatomyositis with vascular pathology. Patients with IMPP were more likely to have interstitial lung disease (ILD), Raynaud phenomenon, mechanic's hand, arthralgias, a sustained response to immunotherapy, and less frequently a concurrent cancer. In addition, patients with IMPP more frequently had Jo1 (histidyl-tRNA synthetase) antibodies and SSA/SSA52 antibodies and less frequently antinuclear antibodies. The findings are not surprising, considering the different clinical/serological phenotypes that encompass IMPP, but the authors argue that this pathology also occurs in patients without myositis-associated antibodies, and therefore, its recognition has important clinical implications such as identifying patients at higher risk of ILD. The authors acknowledge that the study is retrospective, spanning a 24-year period, and could not guarantee that diagnostic testing, including myositis-associated antibodies, was uniform across all subjects. Prospective studies with comprehensive pathologic and serological studies are needed to confirm whether this pathologic classification offers substantial advantages to the current diagnostic studies including autoantibody determination.

In addition to these studies, the March issue of N2 contains other interesting articles that I hope will draw your attention.

### Juvenile dermatomyositis: new insights into pathogenesis and clinical applications [^112Bao67]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (JIIM) remain a challenging and heterogeneous group of conditions to manage and treat, with very significant disease burden for patients and families. In this review we consider novel evidence for aspects of both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms of disease, and potential biomarkers of those disease processes. We consider evidence for new and emerging treatments of JIIM, or parallel clinical studies in adult myositis, and how they can inform our clinical practice.

### Statin-naïve anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase antibody-positive necrotizing myopathy with heliotropic pseudoangioedema [^117VJRCc]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Important workup for distinction between pathologies includes muscle biopsy and serum antibody testing. Muscle biopsy in anti-HMGCR antibody-positive IMNM demonstrates necrosis with a pauci-inflammatory infiltrate, whereas biopsy specimens of DM rarely show necrosis, instead displaying a perivascular and perifascicular CD4 + T-lymphocytic infiltrate and perifascicular atrophy. Both have a higher incidence of cancer, with DM showing a stronger association compared with anti-HMGCR antibody-positive IMNM (6-fold vs 2-fold increase). Lastly, DM and anti-HMGCR antibody-positive IMNM differ in their treatments with the latter more often necessitating intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, and systemic corticosteroids, as required by our patient.

In conclusion, this case highlights the presentation of a rare disease with significant morbidity risk that may cause confusion with DM because of its heliotropic pseudoangioedematous presentation. As we are only now beginning to better characterize IMNM, this case contributes to the medical community's understanding of variations in its presentation, particularly among younger patients. Because statin-naïve anti-HMGCR antibody-positive necrotizing myopathy is one of the most severe inflammatory myopathies, we share our observations in the hope that they may lead to earlier diagnosis and timely escalation of immunotherapy. Further investigation is required to better elucidate the pathophysiology of this complex autoimmune disease and identify patients who are susceptible.

### Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^117DGMcJ]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2011). Low credibility.

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) encompass a heterogeneous group of rare disorders that present with acute, subacute, or chronic muscle weakness. Besides overlapping clinical manifestations, polymyositis, dermatomyositis and autoimmune necrotizing myopathy may be associated with cancer or collagen vascular disease, and respond generally well to immunosuppressive therapy. However, these 3 IIM are divergent from the histopathological and pathogenetic standpoints. On the other hand, inclusion body myositis (IBM), the most common IIM in the elderly, is clinically, histopathologically and pathogenetically distinct. IBM is also refractory to all currently available therapies. In this manuscript, we depict advances in our knowledge of the IIM, with emphasis on clinical presentation, associated conditions, laboratory features, electrophysiology, muscle histopathology, pathogenesis, and therapy.

### Possible pathogenic mechanisms in inflammatory myopathies [^116YqBvA]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The limitations associated with the different approaches into the pathogenesis of the IIM have resulted in incomplete knowledge of disease mechanisms in myositis. In most research, in which muscle tissue was used to study the different aspects of disease, biopsies with inflammatory infiltrates have been selected. Although inflammatory cell infiltrates are a characteristic feature of myositis, selecting patients with inflammatory cell infiltrates for investigations naturally introduces a selection bias. Only a few studies have been published on patients without inflammatory infiltrates but with muscle weakness, and few studies have included follow-up biopsies after different therapies. The heterogeneity of the population of patients with myositis is another limitation of the studies of pathogenic mechanisms. Although most studies classify patients according to the Bohan and Peter criteria [118, 119], some studies used histopathologic criteria [6], and only a few studies included characterization with myositis-specific autoantibodies. Because myositis-specific autoantibodies are often associated with certain clinical profiles, classification according to autoantibody profiles could be important to define differences in the pathogenesis of different phenotypes [3]. From available data on pathogenic mechanisms it is evident that cellular and humoral immune responses are involved in disease mechanisms of myositis, but whether there is a muscle-specific immune response cannot be answered by current studies. It is likely that other mechanisms are important for development of muscle weakness, including metabolic disturbances, and muscle weakness could be caused by different mechanisms in different IIM subsets or in patients in different phases of the disease. There could be early changes, which reversibly affect the metabolism, and later, irreversible changes, that could be dependent on muscle fiber damage and replacement of muscle tissue by connective tissue and fat. Current findings suggest that cytokines, which are produced in muscle tissue from different cell sources including inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, and muscle fibers, could affect muscle function. Careful follow-up studies, including the effect of therapies targeting different molecules on molecular expression in muscle tissue, are likely to increase our knowledge on disease mechanisms. A better understanding of which molecules and mechanisms affect muscle function is likely to lead to improved, less toxic therapies in patients with myositis. Many possible target molecules for blocking therapies, especially the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF-alpha, have been identified and should be studied in appropriate clinical settings given the currently poor outcomes of many patients with IIM.

### Cutaneous dermatomyositis: an updated review of treatment options and internal associations [^112b7xA8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Dermatomyositis is a specific type of inflammatory myopathy with characteristic cutaneous findings. Patients may have skin disease without clinically apparent muscle disease, but this disorder is best thought of as a systemic process. Therefore, all patients with dermatomyositis skin lesions need appropriate evaluation for muscle disease, esophageal dysfunction, cardiopulmonary disease, and potential internal malignancy. There are many therapies that have been used for patients with dermatomyositis, but most are based upon case series or expert opinion rather than meta-analyses or randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Even those therapies that have been subjected to randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trials include a mixture of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy and do not utilize a validated assessment tool for measuring cutaneous disease responses. In this review, we discuss the therapies available as well as the internal associations with dermatomyositis.

### Classification and management of adult inflammatory myopathies [^114BeNCQ]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory myopathies, collectively known as myositis, are heterogeneous disorders characterised by muscle inflammation, and frequently accompanied by extramuscular manifestations that affect the skin, lung, and joints. Patients with inflammatory myopathies were previously classified as having dermatomyositis if characteristic rashes accompanied the muscle involvement, and as having polymyositis if no rashes were present. Five main types of inflammatory myopathies are now widely recognised: dermatomyositis, immune-mediated necrotising myopathy, sporadic inclusion-body myositis, overlap myositis (including antisynthetase syndrome), and polymyositis. The discovery of autoantibodies that are specifically associated with characteristic clinical phenotypes has been instrumental to the understanding of inflammatory myopathies. Treatment is still largely based on expert opinion, but several studies have shown effectiveness of different therapies in various subsets of inflammatory myopathies. These advances will undoubtedly improve the outcomes of patients with inflammatory myopathies.

### Expert perspective: diagnostic approach to differentiating juvenile dermatomyositis from muscular dystrophy [^114WWgCr]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Histopathologic features of othersubtypes

As opposed to the classical finding of perifascicular atrophy in JDM muscle biopsies, perifascicular necrosis is the most common histopathologic feature in antisynthetase syndrome–associated myositis. Lymphocytic and histiocytic inflammation is common, often most prominently in perimysial areas. A pattern of edematous, fragmented, and cellular perimysial tissue is commonly seen, often with increased perimysial alkaline phosphatase staining.MHC‐I staining is often diffusely positive (similarly to many other IIMs), with MHC‐II staining more specifically highlighting a perifascicular pattern in antisynthetase syndrome.

The key features of muscle biopsies from patients with IMNM are variable amounts of scattered necrotic and/or regenerating muscle fibers and a concurrent limited amount of lymphocytic inflammation ("pauci‐immune"). In fact, approximately 80% of muscle biopsies from patients with IMNM do not show significant lymphocytic infiltrates. Other features of muscle biopsies from patients with IMNM may include (1) variable sarcolemmal MHC‐I expression,(2) sarcolemmal complement deposition, and (3) endomysial fibrosis. Of note, this combination of features can overlap with muscle biopsy findings from patients with MD. Most patients with IMNM will show a characteristic fine punctate sarcoplasmic p62 staining pattern in scattered fibers not reported in MD, although it is sometimes positive in other IIMs.

### Disease spectrum of myopathies with elevated aldolase and normal creatine kinase [^114K77JT]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Creatine kinase (CK) is a muscle enzyme involved in the phosphocreatine circuit for energy supply of muscles, whilst aldolase is a glycolytic enzyme abundantly expressed in not only muscles but also liver, brain and red blood cells. Elevation of serum CK (hyperCKemia) and aldolase level is considered a biomarker of muscle damage secondary to a leakage of these cytosolic enzymes into the bloodstream. HyperCKemia is often accompanied by high aldolase level. The magnitude of CK elevation generally directly correlates with the number of necrotic fibers. CK level can be normal in myopathies without prominent necrotizing pathology, for example congenital myopathies or metabolic myopathies. Immune‐mediated myopathies generally feature a significant degree of necrotic fibers and CK elevation; however, a proportion of patients with dermatomyositis, inflammatory myopathy or polymyositis, inflammatory myopathy with perimysial pathology, scleroderma myopathy and eosinophilic fasciitis can have normal serum CK levels with elevated aldolase levels. In skeletal muscle, aldolase is abundantly expressed in myoblasts in the early stage of differentiation and in regenerating fibers, whilst CK expression in these cells is minimal to none. It is hypothesized that immune‐mediated destruction of these regenerating myofibers may underlie the discrepancy of aldolase elevation and normal CK level. In some patients in whom myodegeneration is not a prominent histopathological feature (e.g. eosinophilic fasciitis), aldolase may be derived from cells other than myofibers. Herein, the aim was to investigate the disease spectrum of myopathies with elevated aldolase and normal CK level.

Abstract

Background and purpose

Elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) or hyperCKemia is considered a biological marker of myopathies. However, selective elevation of serum aldolase with normal CK has been reported in a few myopathies, including dermatomyositis, immune‐mediated myopathy with perimysial pathology and fasciitis with associated myopathy. The aim was to investigate the disease spectrum of myopathies with isolated aldolase elevation.

Methods

Medical records were reviewed to identify patients > 18 years old seen between December 1994 and June 2020 who had pathologically proven myopathies with elevated aldolase and normal CK level. Patients with alternative causes of aldolase elevation were excluded.

Results

Thirty‐four patients with various types of myopathies were identified. Myopathies were treatable in 27 patients. The three most common etiologies were dermatomyositis (n = 8), overlap myositis (n = 4) and nonspecific myopathy (n = 4). Perimysial pathology comprising inflammation, fragmentation, vasculitis, calcified perimysial vessels or extracellular amyloid deposition was found in 17/34 patients (50%). Eight dermatomyositis patients with selective elevated aldolase were compared to 24 sex‐ and age‐matched patients with dermatomyositis and hyperCKemia. Dermatomyositis patients with normal CK significantly (p < 0.05) had less frequent cutaneous involvement (50.0% vs. 100.0%) and fibrillation potentials (50.0% vs. 90.5%) but higher median erythrocyte sedimentation rate (33.5 vs. 13.5 mm/h) and more common perifascicular mitochondrial pathology (37.5% vs. 4.2%).

Conclusion

Isolated aldolase elevation can be found in a greater variety of myopathies than initially thought and most were treatable. Dermatomyositis is the most common myopathy with selective elevation of aldolase in our cohort, which features some unique characteristics compared to dermatomyositis with hyperCKemia.

### Diagnostic criteria for inclusion body myositis [^116d7z3i]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) was first identified as a specific disorder about 40 years ago and is now recognized to be the most frequently presenting primary myopathy in middle age and beyond. Initial characterization was based on the observation of specific pathological features distinguishing it from polymyositis. It was soon appreciated that there were also distinguishing clinical features. The earliest diagnostic criteria were heavily biased towards pathological features, but over time revised criteria have given increasing importance to certain clinical features. Until the specific cause of IBM is determined, and the basic pathogenetic mechanisms are better understood, there can be no diagnostic gold-standard against which to compare the sensitivity and specificity of any proposed diagnostic criteria, but such criteria are essential to ensure that patients entering clinical, epidemiological, genetic, pathological or therapeutic studies represent a homogeneous population. It is likely that any currently accepted diagnostic criteria will, once a gold-standard is eventually established, be shown to have 'missed' patients with atypical features, but that has to be accepted to make certain that current studies are not contaminated by patients who do not have IBM. In other words, in everyday clinical practice there will be the occasional patient who an experienced myologist strongly suspects has IBM, but does not meet current criteria - the criteria lack sensitivity. But if the criteria are so broad as to include all such atypical cases, they would be likely to include patients who do not in fact have IBM - they would lack specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of existing criteria have been reviewed recently, in so far as it is possible to do so, and found to have high specificity but variable sensitivity.

### Assessment of inflammatory myositis [^112p2paE]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The assessment of disease activity and damage in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myositis remains inadequate. In this review we describe current approaches to the assessment of disease activity and damage. These include serologic, biochemical, radiographic, and histologic approaches. None of these methods are individually effective in differentiating disease activity from damage. Invariably combinations of these methods are needed to comprehensively assess the extent of both muscular and extramuscular disease. Recent developments (in serology, imaging, and genetics) are mentioned. These may prove to be useful in assessing the full extent of idiopathic inflammatory myositis; however, they are not widely available at present and are confined to research studies

### Juvenile polymyositis or paediatric muscular dystrophy: a detailed re-analysis of 13 cases [^112YxHCq]. Histopathology (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

There has been much debate about the existence of juvenile polymyositis (JPM) as an entity distinct from muscular dystrophy (MD). The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse muscle biopsies and clinical features of 13 Australian children given an initial diagnosis of JPM, to determine their clinicopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics.

Methods and Results

The muscle biopsies on 13 cases were reviewed using detailed morphological and immunoperoxidase studies, with additional protein and molecular analyses, in conjunction with clinical review. Only one case had a true connective tissue disease inflammatory myopathy. Twelve (92.3%) cases with an initial diagnosis of JPM were found on clinical, pathological and molecular review to be MD.

Conclusions

Inflammatory changes in apparently sporadic juvenile myopathies should prompt consideration of an early presentation of MD. Detailed analysis of muscle histopathology, specifically the detection of subsarcolemmal blebbing, isolated fibre degeneration occurring independent of inflammatory infiltrates, patchy clustered major histocompatibility complex-I expression and a CD68+/CD3+ perimysial infiltrate, assists in the diagnosis of early MD. Specific protein and gene analysis adds support to the pathological diagnosis of dystrophy. This series adds weight to suggestions that JPM may not represent a discrete clinical or pathological entity.

### Revisiting idiopathic eosinophilic myositis: towards a clinical-pathological continuum from the muscle to the fascia and skin [^1129i35C]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Refining the classification of IEM and EF patients

The patients from the present study were first classified according to the previous IEM classification proposed by Selva O' Callagan et al. and the current EF criteria. Among the 30 patients, 11 (37%) could not be classified and 2 (7%) fulfilled both the eosinophilic perimyositis and EF criteria (Supplementary Fig. S1, available at Rheumatology online), leading us to consider a new classification. Based on the integrative analysis of this case-series, IEM patients can first be classified as either focal or diffuse. Among patients with diffuse muscle involvement, 2 distinct subgroups further emerged and are referred to as diffuse EM (DEM) and eosinophilic myofasciitis (EMF). DEM is characterized by diffuse and objective muscle involvement (muscle weakness, and/or myogenic EMG, and/or myositis on MRI). EMF presents as subjective muscle impairment on top of histological abnormalities and objective fascial involvement. EF is characterized by usual criteria and absence of myositis pattern on histology.

Focal EM

Among the reported cases, 10% had a focal EM (FEM) (n = 3/30), with a median age of 68 (49–69) years. Patients presented with myalgia without general physical deterioration or motor deficit. Skin involvement was present in 66% (n = 2/3) of patients. CK elevation was found in one case (n = 1/3, 33%), and blood eosinophilia and CRP elevation in another case (n = 1/3, 33%). Eosinophilic infiltration topography was variable: fascia 67% (n = 2/3), perimysium 33% (n = 1/3) and endomysium 33% (n = 1/3). Degenerative fibres and necrosis as well as CD56-positive immunostaining were observed for all patients. Perifascicular myofibre atrophy was observed in 33% of biopsies (n = 1/3). CS and additional immunosuppressive therapy were required for 33% of patients (n = 1/3). With a median follow-up of 35 (19–81) months, relapse and/or second-line therapy requirement were not observed.

### Immune myopathies with perimysial pathology: clinical and laboratory features [^112U219o]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Immune myopathies with perimysial pathology (IMPP) have a combination of damage to perimysial connective tissue and muscle fiber necrosis, more prominent near the perimysium. We studied the clinical and laboratory correlates of patients with pathologically defined IMPP.

Methods

This is a retrospective chart and pathology review of 57 consecutive patients with IMPP myopathology and, for comparison, 20 patients with dermatomyositis with vascular pathology (DM-VP).

Results

Compared with DM-VP, IMPP patients more commonly had interstitial lung disease (ILD) (p < 0.01), Raynaud phenomenon (p < 0.05), mechanic's hands (p < 0.05), arthralgias (p < 0.001), and a sustained response to immunomodulatory therapy (p < 0.05), and less frequently had a concurrent malignancy (p < 0.01). IMPP patients had higher serum creatine kinase values (p < 0.05), more frequent serum Jo-1 (p < 0.03) or SSA/SSA52 autoantibodies (p < 0.05), and less frequent antinuclear antibodies (p < 0.01). IMPP patients with serum Jo-1/antisynthetase antibodies were more likely to have ILD (p < 0.05) and inflammatory arthritis (p < 0.05) than IMPP patients without these antibodies.

Conclusions

IMPP myopathology is associated with an increased risk of ILD, Raynaud phenomenon, mechanic's hands, and inflammatory arthritis when compared with another immune myopathy (DM-VP). IMPP patients require regular screening for ILD, particularly those with antisynthetase antibodies. The absence of myositis-specific autoantibodies in a large percentage of IMPP patients emphasizes the important role for myopathology in identifying patients at higher risk of severe comorbid conditions such as ILD.

### How I treat idiopathic patients with inflammatory myopathies in the clinical practice [^111GoyFk]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Management of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) is challenging given the systemic nature of the disease, which is often complicated by potentially life-threatening manifestations and the lack of standardized treatment regimens. Aim of this review is to provide the currently available evidence for immunotherapy in the treatment of various manifestations of IIM in order to help clinicians in the daily management of these patients.

### Anti-Jo-1 antibody-positive patients show a characteristic necrotizing perifascicular myositis [^1134jpeM]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies can be classified as polymyositis, dermatomyositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, sporadic inclusion body myositis or non-specific myositis. Anti-Jo-1 antibody-positive patients are assigned to either polymyositis or dermatomyositis suggesting overlapping pathological features. We aimed to determine if anti-Jo-1 antibody-positive myopathy has a specific morphological phenotype. In a series of 53 muscle biopsies of anti-Jo-1 antibody-positive patients, relevant descriptive criteria defining a characteristic morphological pattern were identified. They were tested in a second series of anti-Jo-1 antibody-positive patients and compared to 63 biopsies from patients suffering from other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. In anti-Jo-1 antibody-positive patients, necrotic fibres, which strongly clustered in perifascicular regions, were frequently observed. Sarcolemmal complement deposition was detected specifically in perifascicular areas. Inflammation was mainly located in the perimysium and around vessels in 90.6%. Perimysial fragmentation was observed in 90% of cases. Major histocompatibility complex class I staining was diffusely positive, with a perifascicular reinforcement. Multivariate analysis showed that criteria defining perifascicular pathology: perifascicular necrosis, atrophy, and perimysial fragmentation allow the distinction of anti-Jo-1 antibody-positive patients, among patients suffering from other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Anti-Jo-1 antibody-positive patients displayed perifascicular necrosis, whereas dermatomyositis patients exhibited perifascicular atrophy.

### The perils of myositis mimickers with illustrative case reports [^116GqsuJ]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a heterogeneous group of immune-mediated systemic disorders that commonly target skeletal muscles. The aim of our review is to remind clinicians to be vigilant of common mimickers, and what red flags to look for to avoid misdiagnosis.

Methods

We reviewed the clinical documentation and investigation results of illustrative real-life case examples of significant IIM mimickers with valuable learning points. Following an initial diagnosis of IIM, the patients had been referred to our Adult Neuromuscular Service at Salford Royal Hospital Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust, UK.

Results

Four cases, two males and two females, were analysed. Retrospective review of key case-specific features suggestive of alternative diagnoses were identified and described, prompting a broader discussion of common disease groups that can mimic IIM.

Conclusions

The presentation of IIM is heterogeneous and the differential diagnosis wide. Several non-inflammatory conditions can present as mimickers of IIM, each requiring a different management approach.

### Polymyositis and dermatomyositis [^114hZmBB]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

The inflammatory myopathies, commonly described as idiopathic, are the largest group of acquired and potentially treatable myopathies. On the basis of unique clinical, histopathological, immunological, and demographic features, they can be differentiated into three major and distinct subsets: dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and inclusion-body myositis. Use of new diagnostic criteria is essential to discriminate between them and to exclude other disorders. Dermatomyositis is a microangiopathy affecting skin and muscle; activation and deposition of complement causes lysis of endomysial capillaries and muscle ischaemia. In polymyositis and inclusion-body myositis, clonally expanded CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells invade muscle fibres that express MHC class I antigens, which leads to fibre necrosis via the perforin pathway. In inclusion-body myositis, vacuolar formation with amyloid deposits coexists with the immunological features. The causative autoantigen has not yet been identified. Upregulated vascular-cell adhesion molecule, intercellular adhesion molecule, chemokines, and their receptors promote T-cell transgression, and various cytokines increase the immunopathological process. Early initiation of therapy is essential, since both polymyositis and dermatomyositis respond to immunotherapeutic agents. New immunomodulatory agents currently being tested in controlled trials may prove promising for difficult cases.

### Inflammatory muscle diseases [^116Wf699]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Dermatomyositis and polymyositis are treatable disorders of skeletal muscle. Despite their clinical similarities, they appear to have fundamentally different autoimmune origins. Inclusion body myositis, from its origins 30 years ago, has emerged as the commonest acquired myopathy of the elderly. Despite inflammatory changes, it is unclear whether it should be considered a primary inflammatory myopathy, and it generally responds poorly to the same treatments that are effective in other inflammatory myopathies.

### Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: epidemiology, classification, and diagnostic criteria [^113aAApA]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic studies have helped to define the prevalence and incidence of PM, DM, and IBM and have highlighted differences in risk between men and women and in the age at onset for the different forms of myositis. Additionally, these studies have shown that there is a substantially higher risk of PM and DM in certain racial groups which is likely to be genetically determined. These differences are all likely to be fundamental in terms of the pathogenesis of these diseases but, as yet, their full significance remains uncertain. They do, however, suggest that the interplay between genetic and environmental initiating factors is different in the three disorders. Additional population-based studies in homogeneous racial groups, in parallel with studies of susceptibility genes for autoimmune disease, such as those encoding the MHC and inflammatory cytokines, are needed to throw further light on the role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of the IIMs [47]. Because of the paucity of epidemiologic data on IBM, further studies are required to determine the degree of variation in prevalence in different populations and racial groups, as well as the consistency of the male association and age spectrum of manifestations of the disease. The particularly strong association with DR3 in this form of IIM [48] clearly points to the importance of genetic factors in pathogenesis, but further studies of DR3-associated genes in the MHC and of other candidate genes are needed to define more precisely the genes that convey susceptibility to the disease in different racial groups. Epidemiologic studies also have the potential to identify environmental factors that may play a part in disease initiation in genetically susceptible individuals. Seasonal patterns of disease onset have been reported, particularly in patients with DM [49–51] as well as seasonal variation in the frequency of relapses [52], pointing to the probable involvement of intercurrent infections, ultraviolet light exposure, or other environmental factors in disease initiation and reactivation. Further prospective studies are required to determine the contribution of environmental exposures and how they interact with genetic susceptibility factors to lead to myositis. One of the major limitations of a number of the previous epidemiologic studies is the lack of precision in the diagnostic criteria used and the classification of cases of IIM. The Bohan and Peter criteria [1] which were used in most studies after 1975, were introduced before IBM was recognized as an entity distinct from PM; most of the published incidence and prevalence figures for PM are therefore likely to be inaccurate. Multicentered, interdisciplinary, prospective studies, incorporating comprehensive clinical, laboratory, and pathologic information, are needed to develop and validate better diagnostic and classification criteria and to determine the true prevalence and incidence of the many forms of IIM.

### Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: one year in review 2024 [^115dy7iV]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a heterogeneous group of autoimmune diseases characterised by skeletal muscle inflammation and frequently by other organs involvement, in particular lung and skin, but also joints, heart and gastrointestinal tract. Although they are rare diseases, the literature on IIMs has been growing rapidly and many studies have been published in order to clarify the pathogenesis and to better define diagnosis, clinical manifestations (muscular and extra-muscular) and treatment. The purpose of this review is to summarise the most relevant contributions published over the last year on this topic.

### EULAR / ACR classification criteria for adult and juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and their major subgroups: a methodology report [^114bZ53G]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Methods to develop new classification criteria

We used three methods to develop the criteria: (1) a probability score, (2) a sum of items and (3) a classification tree. Each approach was developed independently of the others. The variables identified by one approach as potentially relevant predictors were compared with those selected from the other approaches in an iterative process. The items that finally emerged as potentially relevant for the prospective criteria were closely examined for statistical performance, clinical relevance and practicability by the steering committee. Statistical performance was measured by classification accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Internationally, there is wide variation in whether muscle biopsy is felt mandatory, possible or routinely done or available in suspected myositis. Recognising the realities of practice, the committee felt that standardisation and transparency would be best served by having one set of criteria when biopsies are available and another when they are not.

### Long-term follow-up and muscle imaging findings in brachio-cervical inflammatory myopathy [^112upV56]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

From a histopathologic perspective, BCIM presents as a typical inflammatory myopathy, with HLA Class I upregulation on the sarcolemma, and small inflammatory perivascular and endomysial infiltrates mainly represented by CD20 + B cells and CD4 + T cells. Although first described as having a predominant perimysial pathology and peculiar endomysial C5b9 deposition, these findings were not consistently present in our cohort. This heterogeneity may suggest a wider histopathologic spectrum than previously reported.

Although we cannot exclude the presence of uncharacterized, disease-specific autoantibodies, we were not able to detect the presence of any of the known MSA/MAAs in our cohort of patients. In addition, we confirm that ANAs were present in all patients, and 3 also presented anti-AChR antibodies. Taken together, all these findings, along with the detection of B-cell components of inflammation and the association with other autoimmune disorders, support a role of the humoral immune system in the pathogenesis of BCIM.

Myasthenia gravis and IIM can also overlap in some patients. In these peculiar situations, thymus pathology is very frequent, repetitive nerve stimulation is abnormal, and muscle MRI demonstrates a predominant involvement of lower limb muscles. In our cohort, repetitive nerve stimulation was performed on proximal, weak muscles and resulted normal in all patients. No patient reported fluctuation of symptoms, and evidence of muscle fatigability was not found. Moreover, 2 anti–AChR-positive patients started oral pyridostigmine without any clinical improvement, and thymic disease was excluded in all patients.

The association between IIMs (especially DM) and malignancy is well known and has been extensively reported in retrospective cohort studies and metanalyses. In our cohort, 1 patient was diagnosed with breast medullary carcinoma within 3 years from myositis onset. The close temporal relationship between the 2 conditions may support the hypothesis of a paraneoplastic phenomenon, although the differential course of the 2 diseases is in contrast with this hypothesis, as the patient was declared on remission for the malignancy while the myositis progressed. Moreover, breast medullary cancer is rarely associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, and the patient also had scleroderma, which itself has been associated with cancer. In any case, this association highlights the importance of tumor screening for patients with BCIM.
