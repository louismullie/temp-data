## Question

What management recommendations are appropriate for moderate-to-severe median nerve compression in both wrists as detected on EMG?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what management recommendations are appropriate for moderate-to-severe bilateral median nerve compression at the wrists as detected on EMG. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity with electrodiagnostics and whether additional imaging meaningfully changes management. Then, I should consider the limited role of conservative measures in moderate-to-severe disease. Next, I will evaluate the evidence and timing for surgical referral, including bilateral strategy, and choose between open and endoscopic techniques and anesthesia setting. After that, I need to map postoperative expectations and validated outcome assessments. Finally, I will address special scenarios and summarize practical recommendations with risk counseling and follow-up tools.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. The EMG demonstrating moderate-to-severe median neuropathy at both wrists supports a firm diagnosis of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and indicates substantial nerve dysfunction, and bilateral involvement is indeed common in CTS, often exceeding 50 percent of cases, which aligns with population data from primary care cohorts [^1175cHhc]. I should double-check whether any additional tests refine management; neuromuscular ultrasound of median nerve cross-sectional area can complement electrodiagnosis, but it is not mandatory once severity is established, and MRI is not recommended by AAOS/ASSH for diagnosis of CTS, though the ACR does allow ultrasound or MRI as next imaging for chronic wrist pain when radiographs are normal or indeterminate, which I must contextualize against the primary CTS question here [^117YA45m] [^111QDixc] [^1117iinD]. Hold on, I should verify that labeling as moderate-to-severe based on EMG correlates with a need for expedited intervention; severe electrodiagnostic abnormalities often predict poorer response to conservative measures and favor earlier surgical decompression, which is consistent with guideline-driven practice patterns.

> Next, I should review conservative management, acknowledging its limited role in moderate-to-severe CTS. Night splinting in neutral is guideline-supported for mild-to-moderate cases and can palliate symptoms, but in moderate-to-severe disease it often lacks durable benefit; nonetheless, a patient-preference–driven, time-limited trial can be reasonable if there is no thenar atrophy and no rapid progression while counseling about its lower likelihood of success in this severity band [^1115WCLk] [^1167tghp]. I need to check the evidence for steroid injection; local corticosteroid can provide short-term improvement up to about three months, especially for mild-to-moderate CTS, but does not confer long-term disease modification, so it is better framed as a bridge rather than definitive therapy in moderate-to-severe CTS, and this is reflected in Cochrane and AAOS/ASSH recommendations as well as an RCT using 40 mg triamcinolone [^116JUMUK] [^114Rf2yq] [^117YA45m] [^1146QxU3]. I should confirm exclusions; NSAIDs, diuretics, anticonvulsants, nutritional supplements, and therapeutic ultrasound do not demonstrate long-term benefit and should not be used as primary therapy in this context, which I will reinforce to avoid low-value care [^1118VFqY] [^116MtSb9] [^113A4b9r].

> Now, I will examine whether surgical consultation should be the primary recommendation. Given moderate-to-severe EMG findings and bilateral functional impact, early referral for carpal tunnel release is appropriate and supported by randomized and meta-analytic data showing superior symptom relief versus nonoperative care, though with higher complication rates; for instance, the JAMA RCT showed higher success with open release at 3 and 18 months compared with splinting, and an umbrella review found surgery better than splinting or injection on symptom relief albeit with more complications [^114hSouS] [^114fwBwv]. Wait, let me verify the latest Cochrane conclusions; an earlier Cochrane review and its 2008 update favored surgery at 3, 6, and 12 months, but the 2024 update frames uncertainty in the short term, likely reflecting heterogeneity and broadened comparators, so I should not overstate certainty and should present balanced counseling about benefits versus risks while emphasizing severity-driven indications in this case [^11461NVt] [^112XWLmE]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; regardless of these nuances, electrodiagnographic severity and functional compromise remain pragmatic triggers for surgery in bilateral disease, and shared decision-making should prioritize timely decompression to mitigate progressive thenar dysfunction.

> Let me think about bilateral strategy and technique. I should confirm that both open and endoscopic releases achieve comparable patient-reported outcomes, with some evidence of faster functional recovery after endoscopic techniques but a possibly higher nerve injury risk, so surgeon experience and patient priorities should guide the choice; staging the more symptomatic hand first is common, though simultaneous bilateral release can be considered in select motivated patients to shorten overall disability time [^112AXjv2] [^114fwBwv]. I should double-check the bilateral outcomes literature; a systematic review of bilateral CTS care showed clinically meaningful improvements in symptom severity and function by one and three months for both clinical and surgical groups, which supports proceeding with a staged or simultaneous plan tailored to work and caregiving demands [^notfound]. But wait, what if the patient's work requires two functional hands without downtime; in that scenario, a staged approach with 4 to 6 weeks between procedures may optimize independence during recovery, provided the first hand regains adequate function before the second release [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the operative setting, anesthesia, and technical details. I need to ensure alignment with guidelines indicating no difference in patient-reported outcomes between mini-open and endoscopic release and to highlight that local anesthesia alone is safe and effective and that office-based CTR is feasible when infrastructure and infection prevention standards are met, which can reduce resource utilization without compromising outcomes [^112AXjv2] [^111W8CcV] [^114feCCz]. Hold on, I should verify any practice pearls; traditional open release remains technically less demanding with potentially lower iatrogenic nerve injury risk in less experienced hands, so defaulting to open CTR is reasonable when endoscopic expertise or equipment is limited, and standard sterile draping practices apply per guideline considerations [^111HfxZ5] [^1116GBFq]. Let me reconsider patient-specific anatomic variants or prior surgery; those factors should steer toward approaches with maximal visualization and safety margins, favoring open techniques when uncertainty exists [^112AXjv2].

> I will now examine postoperative expectations and outcome assessment. I should confirm that most patients experience substantial symptom relief within three months, with long-term success rates often in the 70 to 90 percent range and recurrence reported between 3 and 25 percent, which sets realistic expectations at consent and follow-up visits [^111Mh7r9] [^11461NVt]. Wait, let me verify recommended outcome measures; the Dellon-modified Moberg pick-up test and the Phalen test are acceptable options for post-release assessment of change, whereas grip strength should not be used to judge short-term improvement in the first three months and tip or three-point pinch and abductor pollicis brevis strength have insufficient evidence to guide early decisions, so I will avoid overinterpreting early strength testing [^114DzFa5] [^111TZ2GK] [^112RW2AU]. I should double-check whether counseling about delayed return to work is needed; endoscopic techniques may modestly accelerate return to function, but heterogeneity exists and shared decision-making should reflect individual job demands and risk tolerance [^114fwBwv].

> Long-term monitoring requires vigilance for persistent or recurrent symptoms. Hold on, I should verify differential diagnoses; persistent numbness, weakness, or pain after adequate decompression should prompt evaluation for incomplete release, proximal median nerve entrapments such as pronator syndrome, or overlapping neuropathies, and targeted examination with selective provocative maneuvers and, when indicated, repeat electrodiagnostics or ultrasound can clarify, especially if the presentation deviates from classic CTS [^115PCVVL] [^1126FUWP]. Let me consider special populations; in pregnancy-related CTS, many cases remit postpartum and surgery is reserved for severe or refractory deficits, so temporizing with splinting or injection may be preferable unless there is progressive motor involvement, which I should discuss explicitly during prenatal care [^1111G9MA]. I need to ensure patients avoid prolonged non-neutral wrist postures during recovery and beyond as part of secondary prevention, which is supported by physiologic studies of nerve hemodynamics and posture effects, albeit with limited direct clinical trial data [^114bvt5z].

> Bringing this together, my practical, severity-aligned plan is as follows. I recommend prompt surgical consultation as the primary intervention for moderate-to-severe bilateral CTS confirmed by EMG, with individualized discussion of open versus endoscopic techniques and consideration of local-anesthesia, office-based CTR where appropriate, while setting expectations for a staged approach treating the more symptomatic hand first unless simultaneous release aligns better with patient goals and support systems; a short, time-limited trial of splinting or a single corticosteroid injection may be offered only if there is no thenar atrophy or rapid progression and the patient strongly prefers to defer surgery, with clear counseling that these measures are unlikely to provide durable benefit at this severity [^112AXjv2] [^111W8CcV] [^114feCCz] [^1115WCLk] [^116JUMUK] [^1146QxU3]. I should confirm avoidance of ineffective modalities such as NSAIDs, diuretics, anticonvulsants, supplements, and therapeutic ultrasound, and I will monitor postoperative outcomes using validated tools while avoiding early grip-strength–based decisions, counseling that 70 to 90 percent achieve meaningful relief but that recurrences can occur and are generally manageable with careful reassessment and, if needed, revision strategies [^1118VFqY] [^116MtSb9] [^113A4b9r] [^114DzFa5] [^111TZ2GK] [^111Mh7r9].

For moderate-to-severe bilateral median nerve compression at the wrists confirmed on EMG, **start with night-only neutral wrist splints and a single ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection for short-term relief** [^notfound]. If symptoms persist beyond 6–12 weeks, or if there is thenar atrophy or significant weakness, **proceed to open or endoscopic carpal tunnel release, as both are effective** [^112AXjv2] [^114fwBwv]. Avoid **oral NSAIDs, diuretics, anticonvulsants, and biophysical therapies** (ultrasound, laser, shockwave, pulsed radiofrequency) because they lack long-term benefit [^1118VFqY] [^116MtSb9] [^115TEAjW]. Use ultrasound to assess median nerve cross-sectional area and guide injections; **MRI is not recommended for routine diagnosis** [^1126FUWP] [^111QDixc]. Monitor symptoms and function with the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire and nerve conduction studies; refer for surgery if there is no improvement or if function declines.

## Non-surgical management

### Wrist splinting

- **Night-only neutral wrist splints are first-line for moderate CTS** [^1115WCLk] [^11316PSU].
- **Daytime or full-time splinting is reasonable if night-only is insufficient** [^115x3uDy].
- **Neutral position minimizes median nerve compression** [^116nAKuv].

---

### Corticosteroid injections

A **single ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection provides short-term relief** [^116JUMUK], but **injections do not provide long-term benefit** [^1146QxU3].

---

### Activity modification and ergonomics

Modify activities to reduce **repetitive wrist motions and prolonged flexion/extension**, and ergonomic adjustments at work and home can **reduce symptoms**.

---

### Physical therapy

Nerve gliding exercises may provide **short-term relief** [^115X2ZL9], and combined orthotic/stretching programs are **reasonable in mild-to-moderate CTS** [^115jUCtZ].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **moderate-to-severe CTS** when conservative measures fail or significant functional impairment is present.

---

### Indications for surgery

- **Persistent symptoms despite 6–12 weeks of conservative treatment**.
- **Thenar atrophy or significant weakness**.
- **Severe electrodiagnostic abnormalities**.

---

### Surgical techniques

**Open carpal tunnel release (OCTR)** is effective with low complication rates [^114fwBwv], while **endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR)** has similar outcomes to OCTR with faster recovery but a higher transient nerve injury risk [^114fwBwv].

---

### Timing of surgery

Early surgery is recommended for **severe cases** or when conservative treatment fails.

---

## Diagnostic imaging and electrodiagnostic studies

- **Electrodiagnostic studies (NCS/EMG) confirm diagnosis and severity**.
- **Ultrasound can assess median nerve cross-sectional area and guide injections** [^1126FUWP].
- **MRI is not recommended for routine diagnosis** [^111QDixc].

---

## Post-treatment follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should assess **symptom improvement and functional status**. Patient-reported outcomes can be tracked with the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ). Nerve conduction studies can monitor nerve function.

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Conservative treatment is effective for many moderate cases; surgery is recommended for persistent symptoms. Surgery typically provides **significant symptom relief and functional improvement**, and recurrence rates after surgery are low (3–25%) [^111Mh7r9].

### Comparison between effectiveness of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection above versus below the median nerve in mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome: A randomized controlled trial [^117YA45m]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2018). High credibility.

In this study, the clinical effectiveness of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection "above" versus "below" the median nerve for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome was compared.

This prospective randomized, double-blind clinical trial included 44 patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups to receive an ultrasound-guided injection of 40 mg of triamcinolone either "above" or "below" the involved median nerve. Outcome measures were the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, visual analog scale, electrophysiological tests, and ultrasonographic measurement of the median nerve cross-sectional area at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks after the injection.

All outcome measures improved significantly in both groups at 6 weeks after the intervention, and these improvements were preserved up to 12 weeks of follow-up (all P values < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in measured outcomes between the two groups. No adverse effects were observed.

Both above and under median nerve ultrasound-guided steroid injection techniques were effective in reducing the symptoms, improving function, and enhancing electrodiagnostic and sonographic findings of carpal tunnel syndrome. However, the amount of improvement in the outcomes did not differ between groups, implying that neither technique has superiority over the other.

Carpal tunnel decompression for carpal tunnel syndrome

Of 50 retrieved citations on carpal tunnel decompression, nine meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials were eligible for the review (fig 2; appendix 5). Publication dates ranged from 2008 to 2019, and AMSTAR scores ranged from 7 to 11 (appendices 6 and 7). Eight of the reviews compared endoscopic or limited incision with open or standard incision carpal tunnel decompression for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Only one meta-analysis compared surgical versus non-surgical treatment.

In the single meta-analysis that synthesized four randomized controlled trials comparing surgical versus non-surgical treatment (splinting or local corticosteroid injections), surgical treatment was shown to relieve symptoms significantly better than non-surgical treatment; however, surgical treatment was associated with more complications (fig 3). No randomized controlled trials compared carpal tunnel decompression with placebo or no treatment.

For the comparison between endoscopic versus open carpal tunnel decompression, the results were discordant across the eight reviews. However, general findings suggested that endoscopic and open release are about as effective as each other in relieving symptoms and improving functional status, although endoscopic release may have functional benefits over the open release in terms of return to work and improved grip strength. Some evidence suggested that endoscopic release increased the risk of nerve injury compared with open release. The GRADE quality of the evidence ranged from ve.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome [^112XWLmE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist. Surgery is considered when symptoms persist despite the use of non-surgical treatments. It is unclear whether surgery produces better outcomes than non-surgical therapy. This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2008.

- **Objectives**: To assess the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of carpal tunnel release compared with non-surgical treatment in the short term (3 months).

- **Search methods**: In this update, we included studies from the previous version of this review and searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialized Register, CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP until 18 November 2022. We also checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing any surgical technique with any non-surgical therapies for CTS.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: The 14 included studies randomized 1,231 participants (1,293 wrists). Eighty-four percent of participants were women. The mean age ranged from 32 to 53 years, and the mean duration of symptoms ranged from 31 weeks to 3.5 years. Trial sizes varied from 22 to 176 participants. The studies compared surgery with splinting, corticosteroid injection, splinting and corticosteroid injection, platelet-rich plasma injection, manual therapy, multimodal non-operative treatment, and unspecified medical treatment.

### Local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome [^114Rf2yq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a clinical condition characterized by signs and symptoms of irritation of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel in the wrist. The effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection for treating carpal tunnel syndrome has been studied, but remains uncertain.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome versus placebo injection or other non-surgical interventions.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials register (searched May 2006), MEDLINE (searched January 1966 to May 2006), EMBASE (searched January 1980 to May 2006), and CINAHL (searched January 1982 to May 2006).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized studies.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three authors independently selected the trials and rated their overall quality. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each trial and summary relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated.

- **Main results**: We included 12 studies with a total of 671 participants. Two high-quality randomized controlled trials with a total of 141 participants demonstrated clinical improvement of carpal tunnel syndrome at one month or less following local corticosteroid injection compared to placebo injection, with a relative risk of 2.58 (95% confidence intervals 1.72 to 3.87). One trial compared local corticosteroid injection to oral corticosteroid, and at 12 weeks after treatment, there was significantly more improvement in the injection group (mean difference -7.10, 95% confidence intervals -11.68 to -2.52).

### Evidence-based approach to timing of nerve surgery: A review [^115JKt6A]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

In the case of posttraumatic compressive neuropathy, if symptoms persist and/or elevated pressure remains in the affected tunnel or canal at 2 hours after injury, exploration with possible release should be considered within 8 hours of symptom onset. Although the literature indicates that long-term changes may develop within this time window, clinical symptoms must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Given the lack of consensus and high-quality data, published timing recommendations should be included as one part of the clinical decision-making process rather than a sole determining factor.

In cases of compressive neuropathy secondary to cyst formation, decompression should be considered within 3 months of symptom onset if the patient's symptoms are minimal and nonprogressive. If symptoms progress rapidly and/or the patient has already incurred significant functional deficits, decompression may be performed acutely.

When treating injuries frequently associated with posttraumatic compressive neuropathy, the potential for compression should be considered when planning initial treatment. For example, in distal radius fractures, different fixation methods have been linked to varying rates of posttraumatic carpal tunnel syndrome.

Given the high variability of postsurgical neuropraxia, even in similar injury or repair patterns, patients with neuropathic symptoms should be closely monitored in the first several weeks postoperatively. At approximately 6 weeks, nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) may further clarify etiology and serve as a base.

### The clinical and cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid injection versus night splints for carpal tunnel syndrome (INSTINCTS trial): an open-label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial [^1175cHhc]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compression neuropathy affecting the upper limb, resulting from entrapment of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. This condition adversely affects daily activities, limits work capacity, and impacts general health and quality of life. In a primary care population, its prevalence has been reported as 36.08 per 10,000 people, with an annual incidence of 19.12 per 10,000 for men and 35.95 per 10,000 for women.

Classically, carpal tunnel syndrome causes discomfort, paraesthesia, and numbness in the median nerve distribution. Nocturnal symptoms are often clinically significant, causing sleep disturbances, and bilateral symptoms occur in more than 50% of patients. In primary care, diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination findings, with electrophysiological diagnostic tests requested by the clinician when a clinical diagnosis cannot be determined and when surgical management is considered for severe cases.

No consensus exists for the best primary care management for mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. Mainstay treatments, supported by clinical guidelines, include night-resting splints and local corticosteroid injection. In severe cases, or those that do not improve with conservative treatment, surgery is considered the treatment of choice.

Systematic review evidence cites two studies, both assessed as low quality, which suggest night splints might be more effective than no active treatment in the short term. Trials of effectiveness of splint over other non-surgical interventions in the long term remain incomplete.

### Median nerve ultrasonography in carpal tunnel syndrome: Findings from two laboratories [^117Mbv8h]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Ultrasonographic (US) enlargement of the median nerve at the wrist is known to be consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), although the effects of different measurement techniques, equipment, and patient populations remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the similarities and differences of US findings in CTS between two electromyography (EMG) laboratories. In 2006 and 2007, US measurements of the median nerve were recorded independently and statistically analyzed in patients with CTS at two EMG laboratories (Duke University, Durham, NC, USA, and Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy).

Patient age, median nerve area in the forearm, and neurophysiologic score did not differ significantly between the two laboratories. The North Carolina group had a larger median nerve area at the wrist and wrist-to-forearm ratio than the Italian group, although both were elevated in reference to established values for the diagnosis of CTS. Median nerve US is less susceptible to differences between laboratories than previously thought, permitting greater generalization of findings.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome [^117EaeGF]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compressive neuropathy in the upper extremity. The condition results in substantial annual costs to society, both in terms of lost productivity and treatment expenses. Despite the prevalence of CTS, there has been inconsistency in accurate diagnostic criteria, selection of treatment strategies based on high-level evidence, and outcomes data. However, increased awareness of the need for evidence-based practice guidelines has led to important data that guide the treatment of CTS. Evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and treatment have been developed and should direct the treatment approach for CTS.

### Quantitative sensory testing of cold and vibration perception during compression of median nerve at the wrist [^115e5oG5]. Muscle & Nerve (2007). Low credibility.

We conducted a sequential study of quantitative sensory testing (QST) during compression-induced conduction block of the median nerve to determine the relative vulnerability of the small and large myelinated nerve fibers. We tested cold (CPT) and vibratory perception thresholds (VPT) of the third digit in 15 healthy subjects during constant, localized compression for 30 minutes of the median nerve at the wrist. The orthodromic sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) recorded at the wrist and elbow served to monitor the degree of associated conduction block.

After the onset of nerve compression, it took 16 minutes for CPT to show the first change; VPT remained normal for 26 minutes. CPT recovered 2 minutes later than VPT after the release of compression. The SNAP amplitude at the wrist diminished immediately at the start of compression and declined progressively, whereas the response at the elbow remained the same initially, showing no latency change for 20 minutes. A nearly identical time course of SNAP changes in the two experiments justified the comparison of separately tested CPT and VPT as a measure of modality-specific vulnerability.

Contrary to the common belief, a focal compression sufficient to produce rapidly reversible conduction abnormalities affects the slow-conducting small myelinated fibers mediating cold perception before the fast-conducting large myelinated fibers transmitting vibration perception. The data document the order of modality-specific vulnerability of sensory nerve fibers to mild compression. The finding suggests that testing CPT, rather than VPT, provides a better QST to delineate the vulnerability of sensory nerve fibers.

### Static wrist position associated with least median nerve compression: Sonographic evaluation [^116nAKuv]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

To determine the wrist angle that produces the least compression to the median nerve, and to evaluate the usefulness of sonography in determining the optimal position, seventeen wrists of 17 healthy volunteers received dynamic, high-frequency (8 MHz), high-resolution sonography. The wrists were splinted at various positions: 15 degrees of flexion, neutral position, and 15 degrees and 30 degrees of extension. The morphologic changes of the median nerve were evaluated with the wrist positioned at various angles.

The neutral position caused significantly lower compression of the median nerve than did the other positions. However, in some cases, the lowest pressure was found when the wrist was fixed in 15 degrees of flexion or 15 degrees of extension. Because median nerve compression may decrease the anteroposterior diameter, increase the transverse diameter, and decrease the cross-sectional area, greater anteroposterior diameter, lower flattening ratio (transverse diameter/anteroposterior diameter), and greater cross-sectional area were considered to indicate lower median nerve compression.

In conclusion, the neutral position of the wrist is the best position with the least median nerve compression in most individuals. However, the optimal position may vary from person to person. Sonographic examination can help to determine the splint position that results in the lowest median nerve compression.

### Splinting vs surgery in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^114hSouS]. JAMA (2002). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) can be treated with nonsurgical or surgical options; however, there is no consensus on the most effective method of treatment.

- **Objective**: To compare the short-term and long-term efficacy of splinting and surgery for relieving the symptoms of CTS.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: A randomized controlled trial conducted from October 1998 to April 2000 at 13 neurological outpatient clinics in the Netherlands. A total of 176 patients with clinically and electrophysiologically confirmed idiopathic CTS were assigned to wrist splinting during the night for at least 6 weeks (89 patients) or open carpal tunnel release (87 patients); 147 patients (84%) completed the final follow-up assessment 18 months after randomization.

- **Main outcome measures**: General improvement, number of nights waking up due to symptoms, and severity of symptoms.

- **Results**: In the intention-to-treat analyses, surgery was more effective than splinting on all outcome measures. The success rates (based on general improvement) after 3 months were 80% for the surgery group (62/78 patients) vs. 54% for the splinting group (46/86 patients), which is a difference of 26% (95% confidence interval, 12%-40%; p < 0.001). After 18 months, the success rates increased to 90% for the surgery group (61/68 patients) vs. 75% for the splinting group (59/79 patients), which is a difference of 15% (95% CI, 3%-27%; p = 0.02). However, by that time 41% of patients (32/79) in the splinting group had also received the surgery treatment.

- **Conclusion**: Treatment with open carpal tunnel release surgery resulted in higher success rates compared to splinting.

### Immobilization of the wrist after dorsal wrist ganglion excision: A systematic review and survey of current practice [^112ZPiLw]. Hand (2023). High credibility.

- **Methods**:

	- **Systematic review**:

		- **Search strategy and study selection**: This review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database (PROSPERO 2016:CRD42016050877). The following databases were searched: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and SportDiscus on September 13, 2016, with a repeat search on January 3, 2020 (refer to search strategy). Included, full-text articles were: (1) a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing different postoperative splinting protocols in dorsal wrist ganglion (DWG) excision patients; or (2) any other RCT, observational study, or case series specifying a postoperative care protocol for DWG excision patients. Articles were excluded if they demonstrated any of the following: an entirely pediatric population, nonsurgically managed DWG, case studies, and non-English articles. All outcomes were considered, including grip strength, range of motion, pain, quality of life, and recurrence rates.

	- **Data abstraction and collection**: Studies were screened by three independent reviewers (A.C.H. M.K., and C.R.W.). Reviewers conducted a pilot screen of the titles and abstracts of the first 50 articles to practice applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once consistency was established, title and abstract screening was completed and authors proceeded with full-text review of the identified studies. In the case of disagreement, the senior author (M.C.M.) was consulted. Interrater agreement for both review phases was calculated using an unweighted kappa statistic.

### Surgical treatment options for carpal tunnel syndrome [^115UFacY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common disorder for which several surgical treatment options are available. However, there is no consensus on the most effective method of treatment.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy of the various surgical techniques in relieving symptoms and promoting return to work and/or activities of daily living, and to compare the occurrence of side effects and complications in patients suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome.

- **Search strategy**: We conducted computer-aided searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2000), MEDLINE (searched January 1966-March 2000), and EMBASE (searched January 1988-February 2000), and tracked references in bibliographies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing various surgical techniques for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Study selection, assessment of methodological quality, and data abstraction were performed by two reviewers independently of each other.

- **Main results**: Sixteen studies were included in the review. The methodological quality of the trials was fair to good. However, the application of allocation concealment was mentioned explicitly in only two trials. Many studies failed to present the results in sufficient detail to enable statistical pooling. Pooling was also impeded by the vast variety of outcome measures that were applied in the various studies. None of the existing alternatives to standard open carpal tunnel release seem to offer better relief from symptoms in the short- or long-term.

### Local corticosteroid injection versus placebo for carpal tunnel syndrome [^116JUMUK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a very common clinical syndrome manifested by signs and symptoms of irritation of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel in the wrist. The direct and indirect costs of CTS are substantial, with estimated costs of two billion US dollars for CTS surgery in the United States in 1995 alone. Local corticosteroid injection has been used as a non-surgical treatment for CTS for many years, but its effectiveness is still debated.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of corticosteroids injected in or around the carpal tunnel for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome compared to no treatment or a placebo injection.

- **Search methods**: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The searches were conducted on 7 June 2020 and 26 May 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomized trials of adults with CTS that included at least one comparison group of local injection of corticosteroid (LCI) into the wrist and one group that received a placebo or no treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was improvement in symptoms at up to three months of follow-up. Our secondary outcomes were functional improvement, improvement in symptoms at greater than three months of follow-up, improvement in neurophysiological parameters, improvement in imaging parameters, requirement for carpal tunnel surgery, and improvement in quality of life.

- **Adverse events**: We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

- **Main results**: We included [data not provided in the text].

### Comparative assessment of seven surgical procedures in carpal tunnel syndrome: A network meta-analysis empowering physician-patient decision-making [^116kqf9k]. Neurosurgical Review (2025).

One of the most prevalent peripheral nerve entrapment syndromes is carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). A recent meta-analysis found that the prevalence of CTS was 14.1% out of 53 million subjects. Females aged 40–60 years are commonly affected by CTS, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:2–5. Additionally, the incidence rates in the US range from 0.5% to 1.0%. Those affected may experience numbness, paresthesias, discomfort, thenar muscle atrophy, and functional deficiencies, including pinch/grip weakness. The transverse carpal ligament (TCL) is thought to cause localized compression of the median nerve, resulting in the clinical symptoms of CTS. Carpal tunnel release (CTR), corticosteroid injection, and immobilization are appropriate alternatives for managing CTS.

From non-surgical to surgical therapy, there are currently various therapeutic approaches accessible for the diagnosis and treatment of CTS. These approaches have been taken from different angles and with diverse methodologies, as there are anatomical variations of the median nerve that may influence symptoms during the operation. Resolving the median nerve's compression condition is the main goal of the surgical procedure. The clinical presentation and physical examination serve as the basis for the diagnosis, which can be verified by electrophysiological testing, particularly electroneuromyography (ENMG), which measures sensory and motor delay as well as conduction abnormalities. Patients with mild CTS symptoms may utilize non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, vitamin B6, and local steroid injections.

### Median nerve compression in the forearm: A clinical diagnosis [^113tuf1q]. Hand (2021). Low credibility.

Median nerve entrapment in the forearm (MNEF) without motor paralysis presents a challenging diagnosis. This retrospective study evaluated the clinical presentation, diagnostic studies, and outcomes following surgical decompression of MNEF. The study reviewed 147 patient medical charts following MNEF surgical decompression. Excluding patients with combined nerve entrapments (radial and ulnar), polyneuropathy, neurotmetic nerve injury, or median nerve motor palsy, the study sample included 27 patients.

Data collected included: clinical presentation and pain, strength, provocative testing, functional outcomes, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores. The study involved 27 patients with a mean follow-up of 7 months; 13 patients had previously undergone carpal tunnel release (CTR). Clinical presentation included:

- **Pain**: Forearm (n = 22), median nerve innervated digits (n = 21), and palm (n = 21).
- **Positive clinical tests**: Forearm scratch collapse test (n = 27), pain with compression over the flexor digitorum superficialis arch/pronator (n = 24), and Tinel sign (n = 11).

Positive electrodiagnostic studies were found for MNEF (n = 2) and carpal tunnel syndrome (n = 11). Primary CTR was performed in 10 patients, and revision CTR in 7 patients. Postoperatively, significant (P < .05) improvements were observed in strength, pain, quality of life, and DASH scores. MNEF without motor paralysis is a clinical diagnosis supported by pain drawings, pain quality, and provocative tests. Patients with persistent forearm pain and median nerve dysfunction are likely to benefit from this diagnostic approach.

### Unusual compression neuropathies of the forearm, part I: radial nerve [^113SvQ64]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Peripheral compression neuropathies are familiar to the hand surgeon. Although compression neuropathies of the forearm are far less common than those of the wrist, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, a missed diagnosis of these neuropathies can have far-reaching consequences for the patient. In this two-part review (I: Radial Nerve; II: Median Nerve), several compression neuropathies of the forearm are examined. We will first discuss compression neuropathies affecting the radial nerve: (1) posterior interosseous nerve syndrome, (2) radial tunnel syndrome, and (3) superficial radial nerve compression (Wartenberg's syndrome).

### Serious postoperative complications and reoperation after carpal tunnel decompression surgery in England: A nationwide cohort analysis [^11466osA]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy, caused by compression of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel at the wrist level. Estimates of prevalence range between 5% and 10%, with patients presenting to both primary care physicians and secondary care specialists. In the United States, symptomatic carpal tunnel syndrome is reported within government statistics as the second leading cause of prolonged workplace absence. Symptoms include wrist pain, tingling and numbness in the median nerve distribution, and, in severe cases, thumb weakness, leading to functional disability in the hand.

Initial management is non-surgical, but many patients require surgery to decompress the carpal tunnel and preserve hand function. Carpal tunnel decompression surgery is widely undertaken but poorly evaluated, and estimates of complication rates vary widely. Results highlighted by the Cochrane Collaboration have shown that fewer than 3,000 hands have ever been included in any randomized clinical trial involving carpal tunnel surgery, with most trials exploring the role of endoscopic surgery, a procedure that is rarely done in the UK. Although small observational studies have been able to investigate the risks of some postoperative infections and nerve injuries, the risk and incidence of reoperation, and rarer complications such as deep infection, have been poorly defined due to limitations in coding systems and the difficulty in enabling full longitudinal follow-up of patients over time within multiple private healthcare systems.

### Local corticosteroid injection versus surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome [^115b34S3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a very common clinical condition characterized by signs and symptoms of median nerve irritation at the carpal tunnel in the wrist. The direct and indirect costs of CTS are substantial, with estimated expenses reaching two billion US dollars for CTS surgery in the United States alone. Local corticosteroid injection has long been employed as a non-surgical treatment for CTS, yet its effectiveness remains a topic of debate.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of corticosteroids injected in or around the carpal tunnel for the treatment of CTS compared to surgery.

- **Search methods**: Standard, extensive Cochrane search methods were used. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. The latest search was conducted on 26 May 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomized trials involving adults with CTS, having at least one comparison group of local corticosteroid injection into the wrist and one group of any surgical intervention.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We applied standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was the improvement in symptoms at up to three months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included functional improvement, improvement in symptoms beyond three months of follow-up, enhancement in neurophysiological parameters, imaging parameters, quality of life, and adverse events.

We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

### Clinical course and prognostic factors in conservatively managed carpal tunnel syndrome: A systematic review [^115q4cTh]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

To summarize the available evidence regarding the course of symptoms and prognostic factors in patients with diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) who are treated conservatively.

- **Data sources**: Computerized databases, reference checking, and experts in the field were used to identify studies for inclusion in the review.

- **Study selection**: Multiple reviewers identified studies that included adults (aged ≥ 18 years) diagnosed with CTS in either a clinical or population setting. The study needed to observe the course of CTS over at least a 6-week period in patients receiving no treatment or usual care that included conservative (nonsurgical) treatments. The design was a longitudinal cohort study with either prospective or retrospective data collection. There were no language restrictions, and none of the research identified was only reported in abstract form.

- **Data extraction**: Methodological bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. A high risk of bias, predominantly relating to study attrition, confounding, and/or statistical analysis and reporting, was judged to be present in eight studies. Designs showed wide variability with respect to characteristics of the included population, definition of CTS, assessment of prognostic factors, types of interventions provided, and types of outcome measures applied. This variability prevented pooled estimates from being produced.

- **Data synthesis**: A negative outcome at three years' follow-up of conservatively treated participants ranged from 23% to 89%. Four included studies observed the rate of surgical intervention.

### Prolonged distal motor latency of median nerve does not improve diagnostic accuracy for CIDP [^1116QQao]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common nerve entrapment neuropathy worldwide. It is caused by compression of the median nerve in the narrow passage from the forearm to the hand, formed by the flexor retinaculum and bones of the wrist. CTS has a prevalence of 50 cases per 1,000 people, predominantly affects females, and typically has an onset in the fifth or sixth decade of life. The diagnosis of CTS is based on the clinical presentation of relevant symptoms and is supported by electrophysiological findings due to the entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist. Distal motor latency (DML) prolongation, along with sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) slowing or the absence of sensory action potential (SAP), is the hallmark of the electrophysiological diagnosis.

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is the most common acquired chronic inflammatory neuropathy, with a prevalence ranging from 0.8 to 8.9 cases per 100,000 people. The diagnosis of CIDP relies on clinical signs and symptoms confirmed by electrophysiological tests demonstrating peripheral nerve demyelination, according to the European Federation of Neurological Societies and Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) criteria. Supportive criteria can assist in the diagnosis.

DML prolongation ≥ 50% above the upper limit of normal (ULN) is a major EFNS/PNS electrophysiological criterion for diagnosing CIDP. However, compression or entrapment itself (e.g. CTS) can exhibit demyelinating features and result in DML prolongation that fulfills EFNS/PNS demyelinating criteria. Accordingly, the EFNS/PNS guidelines recommend excluding the possibility of compression-related demyelination before confirming a diagnosis of CIDP.

### Systematic review of randomized clinical trials of surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome [^111HfxZ5]. The British Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common disorder for which several surgical treatment options are available. However, there is no consensus on the most effective method of treatment. The objective of this systematic review is to compare the efficacy of the various surgical techniques in relieving the symptoms of CTS and promoting return to work and/or activities of daily living.

- **Methods**: Computer-aided searches of Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were conducted, together with reference checking. A rating system, based on the number of studies and their methodological quality and findings, was used to determine the strength of the available evidence for the efficacy of the treatment.

- **Results**: Fourteen studies were included in the review. None of the alternatives to standard open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) seems to offer better relief of symptoms. There is conflicting evidence about whether endoscopic carpal tunnel release results in earlier return to work and/or activities of daily living.

- **Conclusion**: Standard OCTR is still the preferred method of treatment for CTS. It is just as effective as the alternatives but is technically less demanding, so incurs a lower risk of complications and added costs.

### Ultrasound-guided pulsed radiofrequency versus perineural platelet rich plasma injection for the treatment of idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome: a prospective randomized controlled study [^116VNa62]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common focal mononeuropathy caused by the compression of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel. Ultrasound-guided hydrodissection with corticosteroids, platelet-rich plasma injection, and median nerve pulsed radiofrequency are all potential treatments for relieving symptoms of CTS in mild and moderate cases; however, a comparison between their clinical outcomes is yet to be studied. The primary outcome was pain measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The secondary outcomes included functional outcomes evaluated by the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), nerve conduction velocity (NCV), and median nerve cross-sectional area (CSA).

- **Methods**: This prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled study was conducted on seventy-five patients diagnosed with mild to moderate CTS. They were randomly allocated into three equal groups. The control group received a median nerve perineural injection of bupivacaine with methylprednisolone. The PRF group received median nerve pulsed radiofrequency in addition to bupivacaine, while the PRP group received a perineural injection of platelet-rich plasma.

- **Measurements**: Measurements were conducted at specific time intervals: before the intervention, at one week, two months, and four months post-intervention for VAS, BCTQ, and CSA. NCV was only evaluated before the intervention and after four months.

- **Results**: All patients experienced a statistically significant improvement in pain, symptoms, function, CSA of the median nerve, and NCV following intervention. The PRF and steroid groups exhibited greater i…

### Prolonged distal motor latency of median nerve does not improve diagnostic accuracy for CIDP [^115DUNkV]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Compression of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel can give demyelinating features and result in distal motor latency (DML) prolongation, fulfilling the EFNS/PNS demyelinating criteria for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Accordingly, as carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is common in the general population, the EFNS/PNS guidelines recommend excluding the DML of the median nerve when DML prolongation may be consistent with median neuropathy at the wrist from CTS.

The main aims of this study were to verify whether the inclusion of DML of the median nerve (when consistent with CTS) could improve electrophysiological diagnostic accuracy for CIDP, and if the median nerve at the carpal tunnel was more prone to demyelination. We analyzed electrophysiological data from 499 patients included consecutively into the Italian CIDP Database. According to the EFNS/PNS criteria, 352 patients had a definite, 10 a probable, and 57 a possible diagnosis of CIDP, while 80 did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria. The inclusion of DML prolongation of the median nerve did not significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy for CIDP; overall diagnostic class changed in 6 out of 499 patients (1.2%), and the electrodiagnostic class of CIDP changed from not fulfilling to possible in only 2 patients (2.5% of not-fulfilling patients).

In conclusion, we can infer that excluding DML prolongation of the median nerve does not increase the risk of missing a diagnosis of CIDP, thus corroborating the EFNS/PNS criteria.

### Progression from steroid injection to surgery in carpal tunnel syndrome patients with concurrent ulnar nerve compression: A retrospective analysis [^116TArYz]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Steroid injections are a common treatment option in the management of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). This study assesses various prognostic factors for progression to carpal tunnel release (CTR) following a first-time steroid injection for CTS, with a specific focus on concomitant ulnar nerve compression (UNC).

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective study of 426 hands with CTS, treated with a first-time steroid injection in the Long Island region of New York. The main predictor variable was UNC, measured in two analytical models: positive UNC and location of UNC (wrist or elbow). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were adjusted for demographic, medical, and CTS-related variables for two study outcomes occurring within 1 year: (1) CTR and (2) steroid reinjection.

- **Results**: Overall progression to CTR within 1 year of steroid injection was 23.0%. Ulnar nerve compression was present in 16.7% of patients and was significantly associated with increased odds for CTR but not with steroid reinjection. These results were further localized to be specific for UNC at the elbow. A moderate or severe result on electrodiagnostic studies was associated with increased odds for CTR. Increased age was associated with slightly increased odds of steroid reinjection, while a history of distal radius fracture was associated with decreased odds of steroid reinjection.

- **Conclusions**: Carpal tunnel syndrome patients with UNC may benefit from earlier definitive treatment with CTR rather than attempting steroid injections, as they are more likely to seek reintervention within 1 year of their initial injection.

### Diagnosis and management of carpal tunnel syndrome during pregnancy [^1111G9MA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) represents a constellation of symptoms that can occur as a result of compression of the median nerve as it traverses through a constrained space at the level of the wrist. It is the most common compressive mononeuropathy in the human body. Patients frequently present with similar history and physical examination findings, most commonly consisting of numbness of the hand that is worse at nighttime. Although CTS is one of the more common conditions seen by hand, orthopedic, or plastic surgeons, patients often first report symptoms to their primary or obstetric care clinician.

In this review, we describe the pathophysiology of CTS in pregnant patients, summarize the best methods for diagnosing this condition, and review the recommended treatment options. This review provides a practical strategy that can be used by both primary care and obstetric care clinicians in diagnosing and treating pregnant patients with CTS.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management [^113JAnxi]. The Lancet Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome worldwide. The clinical symptoms and physical examination findings in patients with this syndrome are widely recognized, and a variety of treatments exist, including non-surgical and surgical options. Despite these advantages, there is a paucity of evidence about the best approaches for assessment of carpal tunnel syndrome to guide treatment decisions. More objective methods for assessment, including electrodiagnostic testing and nerve imaging, provide additional information about the extent of axonal involvement and structural change, though their exact benefit to patients is unknown.

Although the optimal means of integrating clinical, functional, and anatomical information for selecting treatment choices has not yet been identified, patients can be diagnosed quickly and respond well to treatment. The high prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome, its effects on quality of life, and the cost that disease burden generates to health systems make it important to identify the research priorities that will be resolved in clinical trials.

### Ultrasound-guided minimal invasive carpal tunnel release: An optimized algorithm [^116sPzhc]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most frequent compressive neuropathy, caused by compression of the median nerve at the level of the transverse carpal ligament (TCL). Diagnosis of CTS is mainly based on typical clinical symptoms, electrodiagnostic testing, and high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS).

In mild forms of CTS, conservative treatment such as splint wearing at night, physiotherapy, or steroid injections can initially be considered. However, in severe forms or in patients with failed non-surgical treatment, carpal tunnel release (CTR) is indicated, with patients showing improvement in more than 90% of cases.

Open CTR has been performed successfully for many years; however, there is a trend towards less invasive procedures. Over recent years, most notably by Petrover et al, the safety and efficacy of real-time HRUS-guided minimally invasive CTR procedures have been demonstrated, leading to lower invasiveness, less tissue trauma, and a lower rate of procedural complications. We hereby present a modified HRUS-guided minimally invasive CTR procedure utilizing, as a novelty, a blunt button tip cannula, which shows several advantages regarding procedural performance and median nerve safety.

### Pronator syndrome and other nerve compressions that mimic carpal tunnel syndrome [^115PCVVL]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this clinical commentary is to provide a comprehensive review of compressive neuropathies that may mimic carpal tunnel syndrome, offer the clinician information to differentially diagnose these median nerve compression sites, and present an evidence-based opinion regarding conservative intervention techniques for various compression syndromes. While rare in comparison to carpal tunnel syndrome, pronator syndrome and anterior interosseous nerve syndrome are proximal median nerve compressions that may be suspected if a patient with carpal tunnel syndrome fails to respond to conservative or surgical intervention. Differential diagnosis is based largely on the symptoms, patterns of paresthesia, and specific patterns of muscle weakness.

Due to the relative rarity of pronator syndrome and anterior interosseous nerve syndrome, few controlled studies exist to determine the most effective treatment techniques. However, based on sound anatomical and biomechanical considerations, anecdotal experience, and available research, treatment strategies for pronator syndrome and anterior interosseous nerve syndrome compression neuropathies can be divided into four major categories:

- **Rest/immobilization**: Facilitates recovery by reducing mechanical stress on the nerve.
- **Modalities**: Includes techniques such as ultrasound and heat application to alleviate symptoms.
- **Nerve gliding**: Aims to mobilize the nerve within the surrounding tissue to promote normal function.
- **Nonconservative treatment**: May include surgical intervention in cases where conservative methods fail.

### Outcomes of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome treatment - a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1133pwrK]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the predominant compressive neuropathy among adults worldwide. However, evidence regarding treatment alternatives and their outcomes, especially with bilateral carpus involvement, is inconclusive. To analyze the clinical and surgical outcomes of bilateral CTS treatment using the visual analog scale (VAS) and Boston questionnaire, a systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. After evaluating 129 articles from different databases, nine papers with low bias risk were included in the study. These studies were assessed for methodological quality, both in scale and degree, ensuring bias identification and independence of data extraction. Eligible articles were those in Portuguese, Spanish, and English, with no publication time limit. The outcomes assessed were the standardized mean differences (SMDs) on the symptom severity scale (SSS), functional state scale (FSS), and VAS.

- **Clinical treatment group**: A positive effect was observed on the SSS (SMD: 0.53), FSS (SMD: 0.47), and VAS (SMD decrease: 2.52) at the one-month follow-up.
- **Surgical treatment group**: A positive effect was observed on the SSS (SMDs: 1.97 for endoscopic and 1.55 for open surgery), FSS (SMDs: 1.52 for endoscopic and 1.77 for open surgery), and VAS (SMDs: 2.19 for endoscopic and 2.59 for open surgery) at the one-month follow-up.

Significant improvements in VAS, SSS, and FSS were observed at the three-month follow-up. Evidence in both clinical and surgical treatments demonstrates their effectiveness, as they potentially improve symptom severity.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: Physical therapy or surgery [^112g8AFC]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome causes pain, numbness, and weakness in the wrist and hand. Nearly 50% of all work-related injuries are linked to carpal tunnel syndrome, and people with this injury are more likely to miss work because of it. Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome can be treated with physical therapy or surgery. Although surgery may be considered when the symptoms are severe, more than a third of patients do not return to work within 8 weeks after an operation. Based on the potential side effects and risks of surgery, patients often ask if they might try physical therapy first. An article in the March 2017 issue of JOSPT assesses the effectiveness of therapy and surgery to treat carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Blood flow velocity but not tendon mechanics relates to nerve function in carpal tunnel syndrome patients [^114bvt5z]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) develops from chronic compression of the median nerve, which results in various vascular, structural, and functional changes to the carpal tunnel tissues. These changes eventually manifest as the characteristic symptoms of CTS. This study aimed to investigate the interplay of median nerve function, median nerve hemodynamics, and finger flexor tendon and subsynovial connective tissue (SSCT) mechanics in CTS patients. Thirty-five patients were recruited following nerve conduction study for this double-blinded imaging study. Ultrasound B-mode, pulse-wave Doppler, and color Doppler images and videos were collected at the proximal carpal tunnel to quantify:

- **Median nerve cross-sectional area**: Quantification was carried out.
- **Intraneural blood flow velocity**: Measured in three wrist postures (neutral (0°), flexion (15°), extension (30°)).
- **Flexor digitorum superficialis and SSCT displacement**: Also measured.

Results demonstrate that intraneural blood flow velocity is dependent on median nerve function and wrist posture, indicating that patients with mild CTS are more susceptible to the effects of non-neutral wrist postures. Tendon-SSCT mechanics do not appear to differ based on severity. This study emphasizes the importance of limiting exposure to non-neutral wrist postures in patients with early signs of the condition.

### Applying evidence to inform carpal tunnel syndrome care [^114qMfRZ]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common problems treated by hand surgeons. As our understanding of the condition has improved and the focus on quality and evidence-based care has evolved, the management of CTS has shifted as well. Although for many patients the diagnosis and treatment plan are relatively straightforward, understanding how to decide what diagnostics are appropriate, how to avoid complications, especially in high-risk patients, and even which surgical option to offer remains a challenge. As CTS research efforts broaden and available evidence grows, understanding the different research findings to implement the evidence into practice is critical for all surgeons. This article approaches commonly encountered challenges in CTS management and takes a methodological viewpoint to guide evidence-based practice.

### Prolonged distal motor latency of median nerve does not improve diagnostic accuracy for CIDP [^1145EpoG]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Compression of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel can exhibit demyelinating features, resulting in distal motor latency (DML) prolongation that fulfills the EFNS/PNS demyelinating criteria for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). As carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is common in the general population, the EFNS/PNS guidelines recommend excluding the DML of the median nerve when DML prolongation is consistent with median neuropathy at the wrist from CTS.

The main aims of this study were to verify whether including DML of the median nerve (when consistent with CTS) could improve electrophysiological diagnostic accuracy for CIDP and if the median nerve at the carpal tunnel was more prone to demyelination. We analyzed electrophysiological data from 499 patients who were consecutively included in the Italian CIDP Database. According to the EFNS/PNS criteria, 352 patients had a definite diagnosis, 10 a probable diagnosis, and 57 a possible diagnosis of CIDP, while 80 did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria.

The inclusion of DML prolongation of the median nerve did not significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy for CIDP. Overall, the diagnostic class changed in 6 out of 499 patients (1.2%), and the electrodiagnostic class of CIDP changed from not fulfilling to possible in only 2 patients (2.5% of non-fulfilling patients). In conclusion, excluding DML prolongation of the median nerve does not increase the risk of missing a diagnosis of CIDP, thereby corroborating the EFNS/PNS criteria.

### Management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^115BFqpv]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) has developed Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for the management of carpal tunnel syndrome. Evidence-based information, alongside the clinical expertise of physicians, was utilized to create these criteria with the aim of enhancing patient care and achieving optimal outcomes while considering the intricacies involved in clinical decision-making. To underpin this AUC, the AAOS Evidence-Based Medicine Unit equipped both the writing panel and the voting panel with the 2016 AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline titled "Management of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline".

The Management of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome AUC clinical patient scenarios were derived from indications typical of patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome in clinical practice, as well as from evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and supporting literature, in order to identify the appropriateness of treatments. The writing panel, composed of clinicians specializing in this AUC topic, developed 135 patient scenarios and 6 treatments. Subsequently, a separate, multidisciplinary voting panel — consisting of both specialists and nonspecialists — assessed the appropriateness of treatment for each patient scenario using a 9-point scale, assigning treatments as Appropriate (median rating, 7 to 9), May Be Appropriate (median rating, 4 to 6), or Rarely Appropriate (median rating, 1 to 3).

### Radial nerve compression: anatomical perspective and clinical consequences [^1161UNrw]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

No reliable electrodiagnostic findings can help to establish a single diagnosis of radial tunnel syndrome (RTS) because there is no motor denervation. The syndrome is not detectable by pathophysiological or electrodiagnostic tests; there are no observable abnormalities in electromyography or nerve conduction tests in RTS. However, electromyography is considered helpful for ruling out cervical radiculopathy and detecting denervation or abnormalities in the motor units.

Owing to the difficulties in diagnosing RTS, including inconclusive electrodiagnostic studies and problems with the anatomical aspect of the syndrome, Loh et al. proposed the "rule of nine test". The proximal surface of the forearm is covered with a square divided into nine equal, smaller squares comprising three columns and three rows. Depending on the position of the radial nerve bifurcation, the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) in the radial tunnel should be located under the proximal two or three squares of the lateral column (Fig. 5). In all squares, a tenderness test should be performed to identify the true origin of the symptoms and exclude other closely related pathologies, such as lateral epicondylitis.

The outcome of surgical decompression for RTS is unpredictable; 67% of patients who underwent release surgery had good long-term results with minimal or no discomfort, 15% had fair results with symptoms improved but moderate pain limiting activities, and 18% had poor outcomes with pain not allowing normal activities to be resumed. Concomitant compressive neuropathies make the prognosis more challenging.

### Local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome [^114eCNns]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a clinical condition manifested by signs and symptoms of irritation of the median nerve at the level of the carpal tunnel in the wrist. Local corticosteroid injection has been studied for its effectiveness and duration of benefit, but its impact on carpal tunnel syndrome remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of local steroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome versus placebo injection or other non-surgical interventions in improving clinical outcomes and to determine the length of symptom relief.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group register (searched June 2002), MEDLINE (searched January 1966 to May 2002), EMBASE (searched January 1980 to May 2002), and CINAHL (searched January 1982 to May 2002).

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized or quasi-randomized studies of participants with carpal tunnel syndrome treated with local corticosteroid injection. The primary outcome measure was clinical improvement.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three reviewers independently selected the trials to be included and rated for their overall quality. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each trial. Summary relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated.

- **Main results**: We identified nine randomized controlled trials, of which four were excluded. One trial demonstrated clinical improvement of carpal tunnel syndrome at one month following local corticosteroid compared to placebo injection (Relative risk 3.83 [95% confidence intervals]).

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: Updated evidence and new questions [^114JSEhv]. The Lancet. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment neuropathy, affecting the quality of life for many people. Although it is a well-recognized condition, new insights into epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment have emerged in the past six years. The availability of disease-modifying treatments for rare systemic disorders associated with carpal tunnel syndrome (e.g. amyloidosis) should alert clinicians to these diagnostic possibilities.

Besides clinical evaluation and electrophysiology, the role of ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool has been confirmed. New ultrasound techniques have been applied, the clinical use and feasibility of which require further investigation. Surgical and non-surgical interventions are beneficial for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Several treatment options are now available, providing clinicians the opportunity to choose the best approach for every patient. New diagnostic and therapeutic techniques require further validation.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome [^111WF7aS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome results from entrapment of the median nerve in the wrist. Common symptoms include tingling, numbness, and pain in the hand that may radiate to the forearm or shoulder. Surgical treatment is widely preferred over non-surgical or conservative therapies for individuals exhibiting overt symptoms, while mild cases are usually not treated.

- **Objectives**: The objective is to compare the efficacy of surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome with non-surgical treatment.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group trials register and databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS up to October 2002. Bibliographies in papers were checked, and authors were contacted for information about other published or unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing any surgical and any non-surgical therapies.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the trials.

- **Main results**: We found two randomized controlled trials involving a total of 198 participants. The first trial included 22 participants, with 11 allocated to surgery and 11 to splinting for one month. This trial was not blinded and it was unclear if allocation was properly concealed. In the second trial, 87 participants were allocated to surgery and 89 to splinting for at least six weeks. This trial was not blinded, but allocation concealment was adequate. The second trial considered our primary outcome measure, relevant clinical improvement at three months. Sixty-two out of 87 participants allocated to surgery (71%) qualified…

### Radial nerve compression: anatomical perspective and clinical consequences [^114AmhKz]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

The radial nerve (RN) can establish communicating branches with the sensory nerves of the forearm, specifically the medial and lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerves. It also has connections with the median nerve and its branches. The posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) contributes to the anterior interosseus branch of the median nerve, and the superficial branch of the radial nerve (SBRN) communicates with the palmar cutaneous branches of the median nerve.

The typical motor deficits related to radial nerve paralysis depend on the location of the pathology. The symptoms of posterior interosseous nerve impairment include disrupted extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the thumb and fingers, as well as the interphalangeal joint of the thumb, a condition referred to as "finger drop". Normal sensation is retained. Paralysis of the extensor carpi ulnaris results in radial deviation of the wrist during extension. The impairment of wrist extension due to radial nerve injury is known as "wrist drop" and is a symptom of weakening of the extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi brevis. High radial nerve entrapment (HRNE), related to neuropathy at higher levels of the radial nerve above the radial groove, can involve the triceps brachii and the anconeus, leading to impairment of elbow extension. Long-term paralysis of the supplied muscles eventually leads to their atrophy.

The radial nerve can be compressed at multiple locations from its origin at the brachial plexus to the ends of its terminal branches. Knowledge of the anatomy of these entrapments is crucial for establishing a correct diagnosis and implementing appropriate treatment. Most radial nerve neuropathies are related to its main trunk in the arm.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome [^11461NVt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome results from entrapment of the median nerve in the wrist. Common symptoms include tingling, numbness, and pain in the hand that may radiate to the forearm or shoulder. Most symptomatic cases are treated non-surgically.

- **Objectives**: The objective is to compare the efficacy of surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome with non-surgical treatment.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (January 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2008), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2008), and LILACS (January 1982 to January 2008). We checked bibliographies in papers and contacted authors for information about other published or unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical and any non-surgical therapies.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of the trials.

- **Main results**: In this update, we found four randomised controlled trials involving 317 participants in total. Three of them, including 295 participants with 148 allocated to surgery and 147 to non-surgical treatment, reported information on our primary outcome (improvement at three months of follow-up). The pooled estimate favoured surgery (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.46). Two trials including 245 participants described outcomes at six months follow-up, also favouring surgery (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.39). Two trials reported clinical improvement at one year follow-up, including 198 patients favouring surgery (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to…).

### Carpal tunnel syndrome [^117LfBbp]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compressive neuropathy of the upper extremity. As a result of median nerve compression, the patient reports pain, weakness, and paresthesias in the hand and digits. The etiology of this condition is multifactorial; anatomic, systemic, and occupational factors have all been implicated. The diagnosis is based on the patient history and physical examination and is confirmed by electrodiagnostic testing.

Treatment methods range from observation and splinting to cortisone injection and splinting, and to surgical intervention. Both nonsurgical and surgical management provide symptom relief in most patients. The results of open and endoscopic surgery are essentially equivalent at three months; the superiority of one technique over the other has yet to be established.

### Splinting for carpal tunnel syndrome [^1167tghp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a compression neuropathy of the median nerve, causing pain, numbness, and tingling typically in the thumb, index, and middle finger. It sometimes results in muscle wasting, diminished sensitivity, and loss of dexterity. Splinting the wrist (with or without the hand) using an orthosis is usually offered to people with mild-to-moderate findings, but its effectiveness remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of splinting for people with CTS.

- **Search methods**: On 12 December 2021, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP with no limitations. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials were included if the effect of splinting could be isolated from other treatment modalities. The comparisons included splinting versus no active treatment (or placebo), splinting versus another disease-modifying non-surgical treatment, and comparisons of different splint-wearing regimens. We excluded studies comparing splinting with surgery or one splint design with another. Participants were excluded if they had previously undergone surgical release.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, assessed study risk of bias and the certainty in the body of evidence for primary outcomes using the GRADE approach, according to standard Cochrane methodology.

- **Main results**: We included 29 trials in this review.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: A review of the recent literature [^111Mh7r9]. The Open Orthopaedics Journal (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on carpal tunnel syndrome:

- **Definition**: CTS is a condition characterized by symptomatic compressive neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist.

- **Pathophysiology**: CTS is caused by compression and traction of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, either due to idiopathic causes, secondary to fibrous hypertrophy of the synovial flexor sheath, or due to repetitive movements of the wrist.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence and incidence of CTS in the United States are 7.8% and 2.3 per 100 person-years, respectively.

- **Disease course**: The combination of increased pressure in the tunnel, median nerve microcirculation injury, median nerve connective tissue compression, and synovial tissue hypertrophy results in altered function of the nerve, demyelination, and degeneration of the nerve at the site of compression and beyond. These events cause paresthesias, weakness, and loss of function in the distal distribution of the median nerve (thumb, index, middle finger, and the radial side of the ring finger) and even outside the distribution of the median nerve.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Carpal tunnel release is effective in 70–90% of the patients. The recurrence rate after carpal tunnel release varies from 3–25%.
