## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me to reword a brief note about advising a patient to keep a food diary and make lifestyle modifications into a formal assessment and plan format. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is obesity, cardiovascular risk, diabetes, or general prevention. Then, I should verify the evidence base for self-monitoring and comprehensive lifestyle interventions. Next, I will structure the assessment and plan using guideline-aligned language and behavior-change techniques. Finally, I will add measurable goals, follow-up cadence, and documentation elements that align with best practices and cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why these recommendations matter. For adults with overweight/obesity or those at cardiometabolic risk, comprehensive lifestyle interventions that include dietary change, physical activity, and behavioral strategies are first-line and yield clinically meaningful weight loss and risk-factor improvements, so I should frame the plan within that evidence base rather than as generic advice [^f17473d6] [^9415fff1] [^bc9f9914].

> Wait, let me verify the role of self-monitoring. Self-monitoring of food intake, physical activity, and weight is among the most consistently effective behavioral strategies in weight management and is emphasized in major guidelines and behavioral frameworks; electronic or paper diaries both work, with digital tools often improving adherence and outcomes, so I should specify daily food logging and weekly activity/weight tracking with a tool the patient will actually use [^5c6bef00] [^2047c884] [^040524b9].

> I need to ensure the dietary guidance is specific and evidence-aligned. Rather than "eat healthier", I should anchor to a reduced-calorie, nutrient-dense pattern such as Mediterranean or DASH, emphasize fruits, vegetables, fiber, and minimally processed foods, and limit saturated fats, sodium, added sugars, and refined carbohydrates; I should also individualize to culture, preferences, and comorbidities and consider referral to a registered dietitian for medical nutrition therapy when appropriate [^c9175bfd] [^7d48284d] [^df3223b1].

> Hold on, I should verify the physical activity prescription. For initial weight loss, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity is recommended, with progression to 200–300 minutes per week to maintain weight loss; I should also include resistance training at least twice weekly and stress that any increase from baseline is beneficial, tailoring to fitness level and comorbidities [^9415fff1] [^e117013c] [^1519d4ed].

> Next, I should review behavior-change techniques that improve adherence. Goal setting, problem solving, stimulus control, and motivational interviewing are core elements of effective programs; I should confirm readiness to change, set SMART goals, and plan for barriers and relapse prevention, ideally with follow-up contacts to reinforce progress and adjust the plan [^5c6bef00] [^3c195d78] [^46caff10].

> I will now examine the follow-up cadence and intensity. Intensive, multicomponent programs with at least 12–16 contacts over 6 months are associated with greater weight loss and maintenance; if in-person access is limited, structured remote options can be effective, and I should schedule regular visits or calls and consider referral to a comprehensive program or dietitian to meet intensity targets [^f17473d6] [^2994e36d] [^b463deb7].

> Let me think about measurable outcomes and safety. A 5–10% weight loss goal is appropriate and linked to clinically meaningful improvements in blood pressure, glycemia, and lipids; I should also monitor for adverse effects during dietary change, especially in patients on insulin or SGLT2 inhibitors, and adjust medications proactively to avoid hypoglycemia or ketoacidosis risk [^f17473d6] [^110fd01d] [^ae9855de].

> But wait, what if the patient has specific comorbidities like NAFLD or diabetes? I should tailor the plan: for NAFLD, emphasize weight loss and a Mediterranean-style pattern; for diabetes, coordinate with medication management, consider CGM to guide de-escalation, and reinforce frequent contact and self-monitoring to sustain change and reduce hypoglycemia risk [^9abd2b42] [^0d106289] [^9a830f3d].

> I should double-check that my documentation captures the essentials. The record should include baseline BMI, weight, and risk factors; the specific self-monitoring tools chosen; dietary and activity prescriptions with calorie and minute targets; behavior-change strategies; follow-up interval and total contact plan; and referrals made, aligning with guideline-based templates and ensuring the plan is actionable and trackable over time [^c9175bfd] [^f17473d6] [^5c6bef00].

The patient was counseled to **keep a daily food diary** to track intake and identify eating patterns, and to **adopt a reduced-calorie, nutrient-dense diet** with increased fruits, vegetables, and fiber while limiting saturated fats, sodium, and added sugars [^2da28665] [^c9175bfd]. She was also advised to **aim for at least 150 minutes per week** of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, with resistance training 2–3 times weekly, and to use self-monitoring and goal-setting to support adherence and weight loss [^9284a948] [^5c6bef00]. Follow-up will assess progress, provide feedback, and adjust the plan as needed to support sustained behavior change [^f17473d6].

---

## Assessment

- **Current behaviors**: The patient reports inconsistent eating patterns and low physical activity, with no structured dietary or exercise plan.

- **Readiness to change**: The patient expresses motivation to improve diet and activity and is willing to use self-monitoring tools.

- **Barriers**: Time constraints, limited nutrition knowledge, and lack of routine physical activity are identified barriers.

---

## Plan

### Dietary interventions

- **Food diary**: Keep a daily food diary (paper or app-based) to record intake, timing, and triggers; this supports self-awareness and adherence [^5c6bef00] [^2047c884].

- **Dietary pattern**: Adopt a reduced-calorie, nutrient-dense pattern (e.g. Mediterranean or DASH) with increased fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fiber, and reduced saturated fats, sodium, and added sugars [^2da28665] [^c9175bfd].

- **Portion control**: Use smaller plates, measure portions, and avoid eating while distracted to reduce intake [^notfound].

- **Meal planning**: Plan meals and snacks ahead to limit impulsive eating and support adherence [^notfound].

---

### Physical activity interventions

- **Aerobic activity**: Aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity (e.g. brisk walking, cycling, swimming) [^9284a948] [^1519d4ed].

- **Resistance training**: Include strength training 2–3 times per week to preserve lean mass and enhance metabolism [^e117013c].

- **Daily movement**: Increase non-exercise activity (e.g. stairs, walking breaks) to boost total energy expenditure [^notfound].

---

### Behavioral strategies

- **Goal setting**: Set SMART goals for diet and activity, reviewed regularly to maintain momentum [^46caff10] [^5c6bef00].

- **Problem solving**: Identify triggers and develop coping strategies to prevent relapse [^5c6bef00].

- **Social support**: Engage family or friends and consider group programs to enhance adherence [^5425399e].

---

### Follow-up and monitoring

Schedule **regular follow-up** (every 4–6 weeks initially) to review the food diary, weight, and activity logs, provide feedback, and adjust goals [^notfound]. Consider referral to a **registered dietitian** or structured program for additional support and accountability [^f17473d6] [^b463deb7].

Research needs and gaps — The USPSTF identified several gaps in the evidence where more research is needed. Priorities include that future research should identify best practices to improve clinician skills in delivering in-person behavioral counseling and referring patients to other settings for behavioral counseling; future research should ensure that patient-reported quality of life outcomes related to cardiovascular health are consistently measured and reported; future research should validate and standardize dietary intake and physical activity instruments in collection and reporting; future research should design and test interventions to reduce sedentary behavior; and future research that is adequately powered and of sufficient follow-up duration is needed in patients without known CVD risk.

Most physicians do not have the benefit of in-house registered dietitians to facilitate patient evaluation and create treatment plans. Fortunately, with the new tools that are available to physicians and patients, energy balance can be evaluated. Then, a balanced deficit diet can be encouraged to achieve a weight management goal while maintaining healthy food intake patterns. Patients should also be counseled regarding weight maintenance diets to prevent weight gain. A low-fat diet is preferred because the patient will benefit from improved cardiac risk as a result of weight loss and a restricted saturated fat content is healthier. Other diets and approaches are acceptable if they are hypocaloric and do not negatively impact the patient's health (eg, some high-protein, high-fat diets can increase lipid levels; high-carbohydrate diets can increase triglycerides in patients who have type 2 diabetes). As patients lose weight, further increases in physical activity and exercise should be emphasized to help maintain lost weight. It is also helpful from a behavioral perspective to encourage patients to monitor their weight, food intake, and physical activity. Medical offices can support patients by providing weekly or biweekly weigh-ins to track progress and provide ongoing feedback. Patients should be reminded that the ultimate goal of any weight management program is gradual, incremental weight losses that are maintained over time. Sustainable and enjoyable changes in eating practices and physical activity patterns must be made along with a lifelong commitment to health.

### Lifestyle modification for the management of obesity [^e588db8e]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Several expert panels have recommended that obese individuals attempt to lose 10% of their initial body weight through a combination of diet, physical activity, and behavior therapy (frequently referred to as lifestyle modification). This article reviews the short-and long-term results of lifestyle modification and methods to improve them. Randomized controlled trials were examined that compared different diet and activity interventions for inducing and maintaining weight loss. Studies that compared different methods of providing lifestyle modification, including on-site vs. Internet-based delivery, also were examined. A comprehensive lifestyle modification program was found to induce a loss of approximately 10% of initial weight in 16 to 26 weeks of group or individual treatment, delivered on-site. Comprehensive Internet-based programs induced a loss of approximately half this size. Patients' consumption of portion-controlled diets, including liquid meal replacements, was associated with significantly greater short-term weight loss than was the consumption of isocaloric diets comprised of conventional foods. Factors associated with long-term weight control included continued patient-practitioner contact (whether on-site or by e-mail), high levels of physical activity, and the long-term use of pharmacotherapy combined with lifestyle modification. In summary, lifestyle modification induces clinically significant weight loss that is associated with the prevention or amelioration of cardiovascular risk factors.

### Lifestyle modification approaches for the treatment of obesity in adults [^9af633d8]. The American Psychologist (2020). Medium credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has recommended that primary care clinicians screen all adults for obesity and provide those affected intensive multicomponent behavioral interventions. Approximately 95 million U.S. adults qualify for such care, also referred to as lifestyle modification. Using the Guidelines (2013) for Managing Overweight and Obesity in Adults (hereafter, Obesity Guidelines) as a framework, this article reviews the principal components of comprehensive lifestyle modification, which include diet, physical activity, and behavior therapy. To lose weight, the Obesity Guidelines recommend participation for 6 months in high-intensity programs that provide 14 or more counseling sessions with a trained interventionist. When provided face-to-face individual or group treatment, participants lose up to 8 kg (8% of weight) in 6 months and experience improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors and quality of life. To prevent weight regain, the Obesity Guidelines recommend participation for 1 year in weight-loss-maintenance programs that provide at least monthly counseling. High levels of physical activity, frequent monitoring of body weight, and consumption of a reduced-calorie diet are associated with long-term weight loss. Investigators currently are seeking to increase the availability of lifestyle modification by delivering it in community-based programs, as well as on digital platforms (e.g. Internet and Smartphone). Digitally delivered programs lower costs and expand treatment reach; their efficacy is likely to improve further with the addition of new technologies for monitoring food intake, activity, and weight. Ultimately, to improve long-term weight management, individual lifestyle counseling must be joined with collective and institutional efforts to improve the nation's eating and activity environments.

Behavioral counseling interventions — delivery and intensity: Physical activity counseling often encourages patients to gradually increase aerobic activity to achieve at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) per week of equivalent moderate-intensity activity, and the intensity or interaction time with a clinician may range from 30 minutes to 6 hours or longer. Primary care clinicians can deliver in-person behavioral counseling interventions or refer patients to other settings. Typical counseling techniques include behavior change techniques such as goal setting, problem solving, and self-monitoring.

### Assessment and lifestyle management of patients with obesity: clinical recommendations from systematic reviews [^f17473d6]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Even though one-third of US adults are obese, identification and treatment rates for obesity remain low. Clinician engagement is vital to provide guidance and assistance to patients who are overweight or obese to address the underlying cause of many chronic diseases.

Objectives

To describe current best practices for assessment and lifestyle management of obesity and to demonstrate how the updated Guidelines (2013) for Managing Overweight and Obesity in Adults based on a systematic evidence review sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) can be applied to an individual patient.

Evidence Review

Systematic evidence review conducted for the Guidelines (2013) for Managing Overweight and Obesity in Adults supports treatment recommendations in 5 areas (risk assessment, weight loss benefits, diets for weight loss, comprehensive lifestyle intervention approaches, and bariatric surgery); for areas outside this scope, recommendations are supported by other guidelines (for obesity, 1998 NHLBI-sponsored obesity guidelines and those from the National Center for Health and Clinical Excellence and Canadian and US professional societies such as the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American Society of Bariatric Physicians; for physical activity recommendations, the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans); a PubMed search identified recent systematic reviews covering depression and obesity, motivational interviewing for weight management, metabolic adaptation to weight loss, and obesity pharmacotherapy.

Findings

The first step in obesity management is to screen all adults for overweight and obesity. A medical history should be obtained assessing for the multiple determinants of obesity, including dietary and physical activity patterns, psychosocial factors, weight-gaining medications, and familial traits. Emphasis on the complications of obesity to identify patients who will benefit the most from treatment is more useful than using body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) alone for treatment decisions. The Guidelines (2013) recommend that clinicians offer patients who would benefit from weight loss (either BMI of ≥ 30 with or without comorbidities or ≥ 25 along with 1 comorbidity or risk factor) intensive, multicomponent behavioral intervention. Some clinicians do this within their primary care practices; others refer patients for these services. Weight loss is achieved by creating a negative energy balance through modification of food and physical activity behaviors. The Guidelines (2013) endorse comprehensive lifestyle treatment by intensive intervention. Treatment can be implemented either in a clinician's office or by referral to a registered dietitian or commercial weight loss program. Weight loss of 5% to 10% is the usual goal. It is not necessary for patients to attain a BMI of less than 25 to achieve a health benefit.

Conclusions and Relevance

Screening and assessment of patients for obesity followed by initiation or referral of treatment should be incorporated into primary care practice settings. If clinicians can identify appropriate patients for weight loss efforts and provide informed advice and assistance on how to achieve and sustain modest weight loss, they will be addressing the underlying driver of many comorbidities and can have a major influence on patients' health status.

### Behavioral treatment of the patient with obesity [^87455780]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Advisory panels encourage persons with obesity to lose 5% to 10% of body weight, which can be achieved with dietary change, increased physical activity, and behavioral therapy. Patients participate in weekly individual or group treatment sessions delivered in-person or by telephone. Large-scale trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, with resulting improvement in cardiovascular disease risk factors. Weight regain is common. Several strategies improve weight loss maintenance, including monthly or more frequent follow-up with an interventionist. Digitally-delivered approaches are promising because they have the potential to reach more individuals.

### Practical office strategies for weight management of the obese diabetic individual [^41d7fb32]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Summary

Obesity is a key component of the insulin-resistance syndrome of type 2 diabetes, and intensifies comorbidities underlying the increased cardiovascular risk of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Weight loss leads to dramatic beneficial effects, with reductions in blood glucose levels and improvements in lipid profiles and blood pressure that often necessitate reductions in medications. Successful long-term weight loss is difficult to achieve in patients with diabetes, as standard dietary approaches often have minimal long-term impact, and intensive management strategies designed to improve glycemic control often contribute to further weight gain in these patients. This article offers a review of newer strategies for enhancing lifestyle change and weight loss in the obese diabetic individual. Use of meal replacements provides structure with portion control, and increased intake of fruits and vegetables promotes a healthier eating style for these patients. Encouraging physical activity such as walking, stair climbing, and gardening can significantly improve cardiorespiratory fitness and glycemic control, and helps patients maintain weight loss. Self-monitoring through lifestyle diaries can reinforce the healthy behaviors necessary for long-term management of obesity. Adjunctive antiobesity medication, medically-supervised intensive weight loss programs, and minimally invasive gastric bypass procedures are important options for patients unable to make significant progress with behavioral changes.

Background

Most Americans do not meet diet and physical activity recommendations despite known health benefits.

Purpose

To systematically review the benefits and harms of lifestyle counseling interventions in persons with cardiovascular risk factors for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PsycINFO, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2001 to October 2013); experts; and existing systematic reviews.

Study Selection

Two investigators independently reviewed 7218 abstracts and 553 articles against a set of inclusion and quality criteria.

Data Extraction

Data from 74 trials were abstracted by one reviewer and checked by a second.

Data Synthesis

At 12 to 24 months, intensive lifestyle counseling in persons selected for risk factors reduced total cholesterol levels by an average of 0.12 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.07 mmol/L) (4.48 mg/dL [CI, 6.36 to 2.59 mg/dL]), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 0.09 mmol/L (CI, 0.14 to 0.04 mmol/L) (3.43 mg/dL [CI, 5.37 to 1.49 mg/dL]), systolic blood pressure by 2.03 mm Hg (CI, 2.91 to 1.15 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure by 1.38 mm Hg (CI, 1.92 to 0.83 mm Hg), fasting glucose levels by 0.12 mmol/L (CI, 0.18 to 0.05 mmol/L) (2.08 mg/dL [CI, 3.29 to 0.88 mg/dL]), diabetes incidence by a relative risk of 0.58 (CI, 0.37 to 0.89), and weight outcomes by a standardized mean difference of 0.25 (CI, 0.35 to 0.16). Behavioral changes in dietary intake and physical activity were generally concordant with changes in physiologic outcomes.

Limitation

Sparse reporting of patient health outcomes, longer-term follow-up of outcomes, and harms.

Conclusion

Intensive diet and physical activity behavioral counseling in persons with risk factors for cardiovascular disease resulted in consistent improvements across various important intermediate health outcomes up to 2 years.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^2c45728d]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Lifestyle.

Interventions designed to impact an individual's physical activity levels and food intake are critical parts of type 2 diabetes management. All patients should receive standardized general diabetes education (individual or group, preferably using an approved curriculum), with a specific focus on dietary interventions and the importance of increasing physical activity. While encouraging therapeutic lifestyle change is important at diagnosis, periodic counseling should also be integrated into the treatment program.

Weight reduction, achieved through dietary means alone or with adjunctive medical or surgical intervention, improves glycemic control and other cardiovascular risk factors. Modest weight loss (5–10%) contributes meaningfully to achieving improved glucose control. Accordingly, establishing a goal of weight reduction, or at least weight maintenance, is recommended.

Dietary advice must be personalized. Patients should be encouraged to eat healthy foods that are consistent with the prevailing population-wide dietary recommendations and with an individual's preferences and culture. Foods high in fiber (such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes), low-fat dairy products, and fresh fish should be emphasized. High-energy foods, including those rich in saturated fats, and sweet desserts and snacks should be eaten less frequently and in lower amounts. Patients who eventually lose and keep weight off usually do so after numerous cycles of weight loss and relapse. The health care team should remain nonjudgmental but persistent, revisiting and encouraging therapeutic lifestyle changes frequently, if needed.

As much physical activity as possible should be promoted, ideally aiming for at least 150 min/week of moderate activity including aerobic, resistance, and flexibility training. In older individuals, or those with mobility challenges, so long as tolerated from a cardiovascular standpoint, any increase in activity level is advantageous.

At diagnosis, highly motivated patients with HbA 1c already near target (e.g. < 7.5%) could be given the opportunity to engage in lifestyle change for a period of 3–6 months before embarking on pharmacotherapy (usually metformin). Those with moderate hyperglycemia or in whom lifestyle changes are anticipated to be unsuccessful should be promptly started on an antihyperglycemic agent (also usually metformin) at diagnosis, which can later be modified or possibly discontinued if lifestyle changes are successful.

Transitional Stage

In the Transitional stage, participants will attend one individual counseling session in month 5 and another one in month 6. The goals of these visits are to 1) finalize a customized, comprehensive action plan for weight loss and maintenance viable in the participant's environment, and 2) facilitate participant independence in carrying out and maintaining that behavior change as the influence of the interventionists diminishes. During the sessions, interventionists will review and discuss the participant's self-monitoring records of weight, dietary intake and physical activity, provide feedback on progress (or lack thereof), discuss barriers to behavior change, and will advise on problem solving and relapse prevention strategies.

Extended Stage

The goal of the remaining 6 month will be to facilitate the continued evolution of behavior changes achieved to date and to promote long-term weight stability. Participants will continue to monitor their weight, dietary intake, and physical activity based on their care plan. Interventionists will monitor the progress of each individual and provide individualized feedback and structured guidance by phone at least bi-monthly. Participants may initiate contact with the interventionists at any point. At the discretion of the interventionists, participants may be seen in person to address outstanding issues related to poor understanding of and/or adherence to the intervention protocol. Participants with weight gains of 3 to 5 lbs (1.4 to 2.2 kg) will be telephoned on a biweekly basis until they return to a stable, lower weight. A weight gain of 5 lbs (2.3 kg) or more will automatically trigger a suggestion of an in-clinic visit at which the participant will be encouraged to restart or intensify active weight-loss efforts and a new action plan will be created to guide the efforts.

Research needs and gaps — The page notes little literature on technologies such as wearable activity trackers that may increase engagement in physical activity and provide objective data, and it calls for more studies including online resources such as daily caloric intake applications or other low-intensity approaches that may be valuable in low-resource settings. Despite many included trials reviewed by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), there were few replication studies, and large replication studies of interventions showing reductions in cardiovascular disease (CVD) events are urgently needed.

### Recommended dietary pattern to achieve adherence to the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology (AHA / ACC) guidelines: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^6fc2e7c8]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

In 2013, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology published the "Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk", which was based on a systematic review originally initiated by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The guideline supports the American Heart Association's 2020 Strategic Impact Goals for cardiovascular health promotion and disease reduction by providing more specific details for adopting evidence-based diet and lifestyle behaviors to achieve those goals. In addition, the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans issued updated evidence relevant to reducing cardiovascular risk and provided additional recommendations for adopting healthy diet and lifestyle approaches. This scientific statement, intended for healthcare providers, summarizes relevant scientific and translational evidence and offers practical tips, tools, and dietary approaches to help patients/clients adapt these guidelines according to their sociocultural, economic, and taste preferences.

### Behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthy diet and physical activity for cardiovascular disease prevention in adults without cardiovascular disease risk factors: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^8244e9dc]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF implementation — content and delivery of behavioral counseling for adults without CVD risk factors — notes that the USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing behavioral counseling interventions to patients based on clinician professional judgment and patient preferences. Common dietary counseling advice promotes increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, and fiber; reduced consumption of saturated fats, sodium, and sugar-sweetened beverages; or both. Physical activity counseling often encourages patients to gradually increase aerobic activity to achieve at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) per week of equivalent moderate-intensity activity. Interventions can be delivered individually, in a group, or both, with or without follow-up, and may also be delivered remotely through combinations of print materials, telephone calls, or technology-based activities. Typical counseling techniques include behavioral change techniques such as goal setting, problem solving, and self-monitoring, and approaches including motivational interviewing principles or portions of the 5 A's Model (assess, advise, agree, assist, and arrange) are common. A wide range of specially trained professionals can deliver the interventions, and interaction time with a clinician may range from 30 minutes to 6 hours over 6 months or longer.

Counseling normal weight adults — The CPG Work Group encourages providers to offer guidance on diet and physical activity to patients who are assessed to have a healthy weight, supported by a USPSTF recommendation to consider offering or referring adults without obesity and without other risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD) to behavioral counseling to promote a healthful diet and physical activity. This recommendation is based on a USPSTF review of existing evidence that indicates a small benefit of behavioral counseling for the prevention of CVD in this population. Normal weight patients may be praised for maintaining a healthy weight and encouraged to implement or maintain healthy eating and physical activity behaviors; they may also be educated about the health benefits of maintaining a healthy weight, eating in accordance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, staying physically active, and encouraged to balance caloric intake and energy expenditure, with patient education including recommending a diet balanced in fruits, vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products. In addition, moderate-intensity daily physical activity (≥ 30 min/day, five or more days/week) should be encouraged.

### Effects of lifestyle modification on metabolic syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0ffe556c]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Diet and lifestyle modification

In the remaining four RCTs, dietary education was conducted along with exercise, including exercise.

In the first study, lifestyle modification with an individually prescribed diet was given in line with standard guidelines, and advice on exercise was individualized, mainly by suggesting moderate-intensity activity, such as brisk walks for at least 150 minutes/week. Control subjects were provided with general information emphasizing the importance of a healthy lifestyle from their family physicians, who gave advice according to their usual clinical practice.

In the second study, the LMI was to encourage people to make healthy lifestyle choices. Participants in the intervention group were given detailed and individualized dietary and exercise counseling. Sessions for supervised and individually tailored progressive circuit-type resistance training at moderate intensity were recommended twice a week, and offered free of charge by three of the five study centers participating in this research. In addition, because that study reported only the proportions of patients with MetS and those with resolved MetS, the number of patients with resolved MetS was calculated by multiplying the total number of patients and the proportions of resolved and unresolved MetS. Meanwhile, control subjects were given general information about healthy food choices, physical activity, and weight loss at baseline, but with no individualized counseling.

The third of these studies was a three-group randomization trial. In the first group, participants were given an intensive program of lifestyle intervention with the goals of achieving and maintaining a weight reduction of at least 7% of body weight through a healthy low-calorie, low-fat diet, and were instructed to engage in physical activity of moderate intensity, such as brisk walking, for at least 150 minutes per week. Participants in the second group were given standard lifestyle recommendations plus a placebo, and participants in the third group were given standard lifestyle recommendations and metformin. We did not include the third group in the present analysis. Patients were given weekly advice on nutrition for the first 4 weeks, and subsequently every 2 weeks. Caloric intake was restricted using a middle-European balanced diet (~50% carbohydrates, ~30% protein, 20 g to 60 g fat/day supplemented by vitamins and minerals).

Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Long-term weight loss and maintenance — graded recommendations and activity targets — Referral to a comprehensive lifestyle intervention program with a multidisciplinary team is reasonable as a way to facilitate weight loss or maintenance of reduced body weight (COR IIa, LOE B-NR). Addressing behavioral, family, cultural, and social dynamics and accommodating ethnic or economic influences can be useful to promote long-term success (COR IIa, LOE B-R). A moderate-CHO intake (> 130–225 g/d) with foods associated with improved cardiometabolic health may be a reasonable long-term strategy (COR IIb, LOE B-R). It is recommended that all patients receive counseling to reduce sedentary activity and increase physical activity, including brisk walking, for ≥ 150 min/wk with strength/resistance activities (COR I, LOE A). To maintain long-term (> 1 y) weight loss or minimize regain, it is reasonable to counsel patients to engage in approximately 200 to 300 min/wk of physical activity (COR IIa, LOE B-R).

### Practical approaches to diagnosing, treating and preventing hypoglycemia in diabetes [^1a88fae0]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

A visit to a certified diabetes educator to review glucose logs along with diet and activity logs can help discern important glucose trends and hypoglycemia triggers. For those patients who are working on losing weight, a 24-h diet recall should be included to assess whether insulin mealtime doses should be altered. Weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and may lead to a necessary reduction in insulin doses.

A new exercise routine or a change in type or intensity of activity will increase insulin sensitivity, glucose utilization and the "lag effect" during which muscle glucose stores are replenished after exercise. This creates a glucose utilization/insulin dose mismatch and can increase the risk for hypoglycemia. Lowering the insulin dose or increasing food intake for the meal before the planned exercise are strategies to prevent hypoglycemia, and both interventions may be necessary. For patients engaged in lifestyle modifications, such as increased physical activity and dietary changes, it may be necessary to reduce the insulin dose by 10–20%. Guidelines for carbohydrate intake related to exercise for people with diabetes are shown in Table 5.

### Facilitating treatment adherence with lifestyle changes in diabetes [^d437a931]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Healthy eating and increased physical activity can prevent or delay diabetes and its complications. Techniques that facilitate adherence to these lifestyle changes can be adapted to primary care. Often, the patient's readiness to work toward change must be developed gradually. To prepare patients who are reluctant to change, it is effective to assess and address their conviction and confidence. Patients facing the long-term task of making lifestyle changes benefit from assistance in setting highly specific behavior-outcome goals and short-term behavior targets. Individualization is achieved by tailoring these goals and targets to the patient's preferences and progress, building the patient's confidence in small steps, and implementing more intensive interventions according to a stepped-care model. At each office visit, physician follow-up of the patient's self-monitored goals and targets enhances motivation and allows further customization of the plan. A coaching approach can be used to encourage positive choices, develop self-sufficiency, and assist the patient in identifying and overcoming barriers. More intensive intervention using a team approach maximizes adherence.

### Lifestyle intervention to improve quality of life and prevent weight gain after renal transplantation: design of the active care after transplantation (ACT) randomized controlled trial [^0dac087a]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Exercise + diet intervention

The exercise training program in the exercise + diet intervention group is identical to that of the exercise intervention group, and additionally, participants receive dietary counseling. The dietary counseling runs throughout the entire 15 months of the study period and consists of a total of 12 counseling sessions with a renal dietician. The dietary counseling takes place in the hospital face-to-face. If this is not feasible some counseling sessions are done by phone. The dieticians are trained to use motivational interviewing techniques which they apply during the dietary counseling sessions.

Goals are set to improve nutrition status to preserve renal function, to prevent weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. These goals are set together with the participant to facilitate an autonomy supportive counseling climate. A three-day food diary is used as input during the dietary consultations and for personal goal setting. Participants also receive a food logbook which contains information and exercises to help the participant set diet goals. During the dietary counseling sessions, special attention is given to salt intake, whole-wheat grains and fruit and vegetable intake, intake of saturated and unsaturated fat, and the use of sugar-rich products, sugar-sweetened beverages (soft drinks, sweetened dairy drinks and fruit juices) and preventing overeating. In addition, participants are reminded of their physical activity goals, and the importance of protein intake for maintaining and increasing muscle mass. In case of disease after transplantation, for example infections, the dietician assists the patient in maintaining an energy- and protein-rich diet to prevent further deterioration or decline in muscle mass.

Dietary counseling session 9 (of total 12) is a group meeting for which the participants are encouraged to bring significant others such as their partner or other supportive family members. The dietary counseling is in line with the 2006 Guidelines for a Healthy Diet by the Dutch Food and Nutrition Council, supplemented with diet guidelines for RTR and diet guidelines for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk.

### Structured lifestyle intervention based on a trans-cultural diabetes-specific nutrition algorithm (tDNA) in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^93b5acb7]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Intervention

Structured lifestyle intervention

Patients in the tDNA intervention group underwent an initial risk stratification checklist and were prescribed MNT consisting of a structured low-calorie meal plan (1200 or 1500 kcal/day) using normal foods, incorporation of one or two diabetes-specific formula servings (Glucerna SR, Abbott Nutrition, USA) as meal replacements according to the tDNA protocol and provided free of charge, and a physical activity prescription of at least 150 min per week. Patients received education using the tDNA toolkit and consisting of a flip chart on healthy eating, 14-day meal plans, and culturally adapted information on physical activity and exercise.

The tDNA-MI subgroup received counseling that incorporated motivational interviewing principles. Motivational interviewing is directive, with a goal of eliciting self-motivational statements and behavioral change in addition to creating discrepancy to enhance motivation for positive change. The principles of motivational interviewing include expressing empathy through reflective listening, developing discrepancy between patients' goals or values and their current behavior, avoiding argument and direct confrontation, adjusting to patient resistance, and supporting self-efficacy and optimism. The tDNA-CC subgroup received conventional counseling techniques that focused on empathetic listening, education, persuasion, and encouragement.

Usual care

The UC comparator group followed the clinical care pathway of the Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (2009) and received advice to follow a conventional low-calorie diet plan (1200 or 1500 kcal/day) using normal foods with standard diabetes support and lifestyle education. Dietary counseling was conducted by the dietitian based on individualized care using conventional counseling techniques to facilitate positive behavioral change toward weight loss.

Follow-up

All patients were followed up at 3 and 6 months' after termination of the intervention. During this phase, patients were required to keep a diary of food intakes and physical activities on a weekly basis. This follow-up phase focused on patients' self-adherences to lifestyle change and effect on weight and A1c control after the intervention has been terminated.

Frequency of contact

Patients in the tDNA-MI and tDNA-CC were followed up monthly by the dietitian and physician during the intervention phase and subsequently every 3 months during the follow-up phase. Patients in the UC group were followed up 3 monthly throughout the study duration by the dietitian and physician. All patients were contacted via telephone only to remind them of their scheduled clinic visits and also to reschedule missed appointments.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^9415fff1]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Lifestyle intervention components and targets — Comprehensive lifestyle intervention consists of a structured program with regular self-monitoring of food intake, physical activity, and weight. Increased physical activity, preferably aerobic physical activity (e.g., brisk walking) for ≥ 150 minutes/week (equal to ≥ 30 minutes/day on most days of the week), is recommended for initial weight loss, while approximately 200 to 300 minutes/week are recommended to maintain weight loss or minimize weight regain after 1 year. Adults with obesity are typically prescribed a diet to reduce caloric intake by ≥ 500 kcal/day from baseline, often limiting women to 1,200 to 1,500 kcal/day and men to 1,500 to 1,800 kcal/day; a very-low-calorie diet (defined as < 800 kcal/day) should be prescribed only in limited circumstances and only by trained clinicians with medical supervision. Comprehensive lifestyle intervention has been shown to produce on average 8 kg of weight loss (5% to 10% of initial body weight) in the short term (≤ 6 months) and intermediate term (6 to 12 months) compared with usual care, but longer interventions after 1 year are associated with gradual weight gain of 1 or 2 kg/year; weight loss of 5% to 10% of initial weight has been shown to improve BP, delay T2DM onset, improve glycemic control in T2DM, and improve lipid profile.

### Diet and exercise in the management of hyperlipidemia [^55faccd2]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Dietary factors that influence lipid levels include modification of nutritional components, consumption of specific foods, use of food additives and supplements, and major dietary approaches. The most beneficial changes result from reducing intake of saturated and trans fats; increasing intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats; fortifying foods with plant stanols or sterols; isocalorically adding tree nuts to the diet; consuming one or two alcoholic drinks per day; and adopting a Portfolio, Mediterranean, low-carbohydrate, or low-fat diet. Smaller but still beneficial effects result from reducing intake of dietary cholesterol, increasing intake of soluble fiber and soy protein, and eating fatty marine fish or taking marine-derived omega-3 fatty acid supplements. Red yeast rice supplements have effects similar to those of statin medications and are better tolerated in some patients. Regular aerobic exercise has beneficial effects on lipid levels, particularly if performed for at least 120 minutes per week. Brief physician counseling will have relatively small effects on unselected patients, so efforts should be concentrated on patients who are motivated and ready to make lifestyle changes.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^62c5cb51]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has published several recommendations for multicomponent lifestyle and behavioral therapy for adults with obesity, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and prediabetes, and clinical societies have identified several evidence‐based recommendations for lifestyle modification for obesity (Table 3). According to the USPSTF, the evidence supports referring all adults with obesity to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions for both weight reduction and weight maintenance. Intervention components should include nutrition, physical activity, self‐monitoring, identifying barriers, problem solving, peer support, and relapse prevention — each further discussed in this Advisory.

TABLE 3
Key guidelines for lifestyle modification therapies for individuals with obesity a.

Although specifics of lifestyle programming for weight reduction and maintenance vary across guidelines, common foundations include a nutrient‐dense, reduced‐calorie diet; a structured program of physical activity; and behavioral strategies to support lifestyle change. Various dietary patterns have been used with success, with adherence to counseling visits and the selected diet often being the important factors in determining outcomes. Specific nutrient goals can vary by age, sex, and life stage (e.g. infancy, childhood, adolescence, pregnancy, lactation, older adulthood) as well as comorbidities or clinical conditions.

Based on existing guidelines and evidence, all individuals who would benefit from obesity treatment, including those prescribed GLP‐1s, should be offered or referred for intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions for both weight reduction and weight maintenance. The specific parameters can be based on patient‐centered shared decision‐making, considering each person's stage and severity of disease, risk of progression, and comorbidities; and centered on the individual's values and goals, stage of change, and access to therapies.

### The latest evidence and guidance in lifestyle and surgical interventions to achieve weight loss in people with overweight or obesity [^b463deb7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The current most comprehensive lifestyle guidelines are derived from two sources — the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE). These guidelines recommend that individuals participate in a comprehensive intervention for at least 6 months, delivered by trained health care professionals including registered dietitians, psychologists or health counsellors, as well as, where appropriate, lay persons who are appropriately trained to deliver lifestyle and behavioural interventions that are designed to modify dietary intake and physical activity. These interventions are typically multi‐disciplinary, supporting patients to pursue behavioural interventions that support adherence to physical activity and meal plan prescriptions. This can include activities such as goal setting, self‐monitoring of food intake and physical activity, 1:1 sessions with clinicians (e.g. to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy, dietary education) and group meetings (e.g. gatherings with peers, use of social support structures). A remote approach to support weight loss has also been shown to be effective. The use of a Wireless feedback system (WFS) including a Wi‐Fi activity tracker and scale transmitting data to a smartphone app to provide daily feedback on progress in lifestyle change and weight loss, for example, has been shown to be as effective to induce significant weight loss. In this study, participants' self‐monitoring data was viewed on a dashboard; and step‐up interventions which included supportive messaging via mobile device screen notifications (app‐based screen alerts) without or with coaching or powdered meal replacement was provided where appropriate. In another study, participants underwent an automated online weight loss (WL) program (4 months) and WL maintenance program (8 months), consisting of video lessons, self‐monitoring and personalized feedback. Individuals with suboptimal responses who received brief or extended telephone coaching experienced greater weight loss than control, with weight loss reported to be 6.2%–7% of baseline.

### A nurse-led limited risk factor modification program to address obesity and obstructive sleep apnea in atrial fibrillation patients [^bda8ee2e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Obesity management

The nurse reviews the patient's typical daily diet, eating habits, alcohol and tobacco use, and exercise routine. Education then focuses on healthy eating habits (according to ChooseMyPlate guidelines from the US Department of Agriculture 6), increasing fruit and vegetable intake, limiting processed foods and added sugars, improving portion control, understanding nutrition labels, and reducing alcohol intake. To facilitate and reinforce this discussion, patients are provided written material that details each of the above points. Patients who express interest in further exploring a healthy diet are provided the web address of the ChooseMyPlate guidelines from the US Department of Agriculture. Recommendations of 150 minutes per week of moderate‐intensity physical activity are discussed, but goals are tailored to each patient's baseline fitness level and are provided in writing. The nurse and patient collaborate to develop realistic, specific, individualized lifestyle modification goals with the ultimate goal of loss of ≥ 5% body weight within 6 to 12 months. Patients are also encouraged to maintain a daily food/exercise log as a tool to improve self‐awareness. Additional education on obesity management is provided as needed during follow‐up telephone calls, which occur every 2 weeks during the first 2 months, once‐monthly during months 3 to 6, and every 3 months during months 6 to 12. Based on identified need, follow‐up calls may be more frequent. Patients unable to achieve ≥ 3% weight loss within 3 to 4 months are eligible for referral to collaborating specialists (physician and/or dietician) at Penn Metabolic Medicine for escalated care, including pharmacological management. Patients reporting lack of interest and/or effort for lifestyle modification may withdraw; patients who miss 3 consecutive follow‐up attempts are excluded from further participation. Total duration of participation is for 1 year, beyond which patients are offered advice on continued weight loss on an as‐needed basis.

Obstructive sleep apnea management

The nurse reviews expectations for a sleep study and/or treatment modalities, including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The nurse coordinates the sleep study and/or Sleep Medicine referral, then calls patients to review study results and reinforce importance of follow‐up consultation for treatment initiation. Sleep Medicine assumes all subsequent OSA management and provides regular updates regarding treatment details to the nurse. To assess the initiative's impact on OSA identification and management, we compared referral volumes to Sleep Medicine and sleep study completion rates among patients from our arrhythmia practices in the 1 year preceding and 1 year following PENN AF Care initiation.

### Changing patient behavior [^e84e67a6]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss barriers and strategies relevant to initiating lifestyle modifications for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Findings from previously published studies are reviewed. In light of reported successful changes in patient behavior and resultant improved outcomes pertinent to reduction or control of diabetes, methods to achieve optimal results are outlined.

Results

Both the Diabetes Prevention Program and the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study demonstrated that intensive lifestyle interventions, such as weight loss as a result of physical activity, can delay and prevent the development of type 2 diabetes. Key barriers to initiating behavioral modifications in patients include the following: (1) health-care provider experience, (2) patient experience and beliefs, (3) lack of health-care system support, and (4) minimal availability of community support. These barriers can be overcome through use of proven strategies — promoting patient awareness of health risks, selecting patients who are willing to participate in a behavioral modification program, defining realistic goals, establishing patient accountability, and maintaining regular follow-up for review of progress, providing assistance with problem solving, and reinforcement of efforts and successes.

Conclusion

The feasibility of initiating successful lifestyle interventions has been shown in numerous studies. The effective implementation of these interventions in clinical practice will necessitate fundamental changes in the health-care system and society in general.

### Adherence to self-monitoring and behavioral goals is associated with improved weight loss in an mHealth randomized-controlled trial [^a3b0cdc1]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

SMARTER was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Pittsburgh and registered on(NCT03367936). Inclusion criteria included body mass index (BMI) between 27 and 43 kg/m 2, completion of a 5‐day electronic food diary, and ability to engage in moderate‐intensity PA. Exclusion criteria included needing medical supervision of diet or PA, pregnancy, serious mental illness, alcohol or eating disorder, and current weight‐loss treatment. Recruitment for the study occurred from August 2018 to March 2020, and intervention delivery was completed in April 2021. Figure 1 illustrates the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram for SMARTER.

FIGURE 1
CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) diagram. Previously published in Burke et al. FB, feedback; SM, self‐monitoring.

Intervention

All participants received one 90‐min, 1:1 in‐person session with a master's level prepared dietitian who had extensive experience with behavioral treatment of overweight and obesity. The dietitian also counseled participants using behavioral strategies to support weight reduction; goal setting (daily calorie and fat intake, PA minutes); daily SM of diet, PA, and weight; and the core concepts of SBT and demonstrated how to use the digital SM tools. For the SM + FB group, use of the SMARTER app and how to open the FB messages on participants' smartphones were demonstrated.

Dietary intake

Participants used the Fitbit app (Google LLC) to view food nutrient values, record food intake, and view daily intake summaries. The calorie goal was determined from the person's baseline body weight (women: 1200 kcal for < 200 lb or 1500 kcal for ≥ 200 lb; men: 1500 kcal for < 200 lb or 1800 kcal for ≥ 200 lb) and individualized as needed. The fat gram goal approximated 25% of the calorie goal.

Physical activity

All participants monitored PA using a wrist‐worn Fitbit Charge 2 (Google) synced with their smartphone and interfaced with the study's informatics infrastructure. Staff instructed participants to increase PA gradually, primarily by walking, and aim for 150 min/week by 12 weeks. Once at goal, they were encouraged to add 10 min/week, with an ultimate goal of reaching 300 min/week by 52 weeks.

Weight

All participants were instructed to weigh daily on the study‐provided smart scale that transmitted weight data to their smartphone and the study database.

### Physiological adaptations to weight loss and factors favouring weight regain [^b31dbb1f]. International Journal of Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

From the environmental perspective, reductions in food intake, dietary modifications and environmental modifications (for example, walking-friendly cities) are logical interventions to address the obesogenic environment, since they are simple and safe. Unfortunately, dietary strategies — despite their inherent logic and appeal — have not been successful in making an impact on hypertension or obesity at the population level, and environmental modifications, such as changing city structures, can be expensive. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet was shown to be as effective as a single anti-hypertensive medication and is recommended as an initial intervention for hypertension, based on a clinical trial. However, in real life, patients with hypertension often find it difficult to adhere to a dietary regimen and to restrict their salt intake. The prevalence of obesity began rising around 1980, despite recommendations to reduce caloric intake and increase physical activity. Thus, notwithstanding their inherent appeal, dietary modifications are difficult to successfully put into action because of the physiology associated with reward systems. A diet high in fibre and low in calories may be a logical recommendation, but people find it less appealing to eat than the foods they particularly like, which are high in fat and calorically dense.

Behavioural lifestyle modifications have been shown to help with weight lossand, to a certain extent, with hypertension, particularly over the short term. Diseases that require ongoing management have physiological controls, and it is difficult to overcome physiology with behaviour over the long term. Because of the advances in electronic media, there are now more tools to help modify behaviour. Smartphone applications have been used for assessing food intake via food photography, and mathematical modellingmay augment electronic systems and, thus, raise their success and cost-effectiveness in clinical practice settings, relative to traditional face-to-face counselling. These new technological advances could help improve behavioural therapy for obesity in the future, but they do not address the physiological controls that promote weight regain and, therefore, a healthy weight will still be difficult to maintain over the long term.

### Diet and physical activity for cardiovascular disease prevention [^1519d4ed]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. One-third of these deaths may be preventable through healthy lifestyle choices including diet and physical activity. The Mediterranean diet is associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality, whereas the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan is associated with a reduced risk of coronary artery disease. Substituting dietary saturated fat with polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes, although exogenous supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids does not improve cardiovascular outcomes. There is an association between increased sodium intake and cardiovascular risk, but reducing dietary sodium has not consistently shown a reduction in cardiovascular risk. Physical activity recommendations for adults are at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, or an equivalent combination. Increases in physical activity by any level are associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. Introducing muscle-strengthening activities at least twice per week in previously inactive adults is associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. Inactive adults without known CVD can gradually increase activity to a moderate-intensity level without consulting a physician. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends behavioral counseling to promote healthy diet and physical activity in adults at high risk of CVD. Evidence of benefit for counseling patients at average risk is less established.

### Strategies for promotion of a healthy lifestyle in clinical settings: pillars of ideal cardiovascular health: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^9723fbde]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors is suboptimal. The vast majority of the US population does not meet current recommendations. A healthy lifestyle is defined by consuming a healthy dietary pattern, engaging in regular physical activity, avoiding exposure to tobacco products, habitually attaining adequate amounts of sleep, and managing stress levels. For all these health behaviors there are well-established guidelines; however, promotion in clinical settings can be challenging. It is critical to overcome these challenges because greater promotion of heathy lifestyle practices in clinical settings effectively motivates and initiates patient behavior change. The 5A Model (assess, advise, agree, assist, and arrange) was developed to provide a framework for clinical counseling with requisite attention to the demands of clinical settings. In this science advisory, we present strategies, based on the 5A Model, that clinicians and other health care professionals can use for efficient lifestyle-related behavior change counseling in patients at all levels of cardiovascular disease risk at every visit. In addition, we discuss the underlying role of psychological health and well-being in lifestyle-related behavior change counseling, and how clinicians can leverage health technologies when providing brief patient-centered counseling. Greater attention to healthy lifestyle behaviors during routine clinician visits will contribute to promoting cardiovascular health.

### Physiological adaptations to weight loss and factors favouring weight regain [^1383669e]. International Journal of Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

Ensuring maintenance of weight loss is a crucial step in reversing the current and alarming rise in obesity and, hence, reducing the burden of obesity-related comorbidities. Restricting food intake through dieting generally leads to successful short-term weight loss, but, over the long term, many individuals regain the lost weight. Individuals who live in an 'obesogenic' environment encounter opportunities to overeat on a regular basis. Moreover, compensatory physiological adaptations following diet-induced weight loss, such as decreases in energy expenditure, fat oxidation and anorexigenic hormone (for example, leptin) levels and increases in appetite, craving and orexigenic hormone (for example, ghrelin) levels, promote weight regain. There is also increasing evidence regarding the role of other factors, including hedonic factors and glial cell activity, in overriding the normal feedback loop controlling body weight.,

In order to maintain a healthier weight, individuals must adhere to obesity-reducing behaviours that counteract physiological adaptations and other factors associated with weight regain. Creating an environment that favours healthy behaviour against the current backdrop, which encourages a positive energy balance has been, and is likely to remain, difficult. Although one size does not fit all in successfully maintaining weight loss, the use of anti-obesity medications and/or bariatric surgery are useful interventions that help to reset an individual's physiology. In the long term, interventions that alter the physiology of body weight control are likely to be more efficacious than behavioural interventions, such as counselling and social support to influence an individual's motivation and perseverance. The control of body weight physiology will allow adoption of lifestyle modifications, including eating a low-calorie diet, and undertaking increased physical activity.

There is a continuing need to develop effective weight loss management strategies that, similar to anti-obesity medications, alter the physiology of body weight favouring weight loss and maintenance. Approaches that address the hedonic response to food or prevent chronic glial cell activation should also be explored as they may also be of benefit in preventing weight regain. Having an increased understanding of weight loss and the physiology of weight regain will facilitate the development of future strategies, including better methods of lifestyle modification (diet and exercise), but with emphasis on pharmacological and/or surgical interventions, to help post-obese individuals maintain their loss of body weight.

### A systematic review of lifestyle counseling for diverse patients in primary care [^7d4214eb]. Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Prior research and systematic reviews have examined strategies related to weight management, less is known about lifestyle and behavioral counseling interventions optimally suited for implementation in primary care practices generally, and among racial and ethnic patient populations. Primary care practitioners may find it difficult to access and use available research findings on effective behavioral and lifestyle counseling strategies and to assess their effects on health behaviors among their patients. This systematic review compiled existing evidence from randomized trials to inform primary care providers about which lifestyle and behavioral change interventions are shown to be effective for changing patients' diet, physical activity and weight outcomes. Searches identified 444 abstracts from all sources (01/01/2004–05/15/2014). Duplicate abstracts were removed, selection criteria applied and dual abstractions conducted for 106 full text articles. As of June 12, 2015, 29 articles were retained for inclusion in the body of evidence. Randomized trials tested heterogeneous multi-component behavioral interventions for an equally wide array of outcomes in three population groups: diverse patient populations (23 studies), African American patients only (4 studies), and Hispanic/Mexican American/Latino patients only (2 studies). Significant and consistent findings among diverse populations showed that weight and physical activity related outcomes were more amenable to change via lifestyle and behavioral counseling interventions than those associated with diet modification. Evidence to support specific interventions for racial and ethnic minorities was promising, but insufficient based on the small number of studies.

### Use of a computerized tracking system to monitor and provide feedback on dietary goals for calorie-restricted diets: the POUNDS LOST study [^040524b9]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2012). Low credibility.

The use of self-monitoring as a tool to facilitate behavioral modification is common in many lifestyle-based weight loss interventions. Electronic tracking programs, including computer-based systems and smart phone applications, have been developed to allow individuals to self-monitor their behavior digitally. These programs offer an advantage over traditional self-report modalities in that they can provide users with direct feedback about dietary and/or physical activity adherence levels and thereby assist them in real-time decision making. This article describes the use of an Internet-based computerized tracking system (CTS) that was developed specifically for the POUNDS LOST study, a 2-year randomized controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of four macronutrient diets for weight and fat reduction in healthy, overweight men and women (body mass index range = 25.0–39.9 kg/m(2)). The CTS served many functions in this study, including data collection, dietary and exercise assessment and feedback, messaging system, and report generation. Across all groups, participants with high usage of the CTS during the initial 8 weeks lost greater amounts of weight than participants with low usage (8.7% versus 5.5% of initial body weight, respectively; p < .001) at week 32. Rates of CTS utilization were highest during the first year of this 2-year intervention, and utilization of the CTS declined steadily over time. The unique features of the CTS combined with technological developments, such as smart phone applications, offer significant potential to improve the user's self-monitoring experience and adherence to health promotion programs designed specifically for individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^86a66365]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Other factors, besides high levels of physical activity, associated with successful weight maintenance included continued reduced caloric intake, reduced fat intake, and reduced fast food consumption. Certain psychological traits also are associated with successful weight loss maintenance.

The success of lifestyle modification, at least in a reasonable portion of adults, has prompted its endorsement in guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). That group "recommends that clinicians screen all adult patients for obesity and offer intensive counseling and behavioral interventions to promote sustained weight loss…" The USPSTF emphasizes the concept of intensive counseling, defined as at least one "person-to-person (individual or group) session per month for at least the first 3 months of the intervention".

Emphasis should be on providing an intensive lifestyle modification program. This was most clearly shown by the results of a T2DM prevention trial in which one comparison was between the "standard lifestyle modification" — in which patients received the traditional written instructions about diet and exercise as well as an annual session discussing the importance of a healthy lifestyle — and an intensive plan covering diet, exercise, and behavior modification for the first 24 wk followed by monthly follow-up sessions. The initial goal was a 7% weight loss. The average weight loss in the standard lifestyle modification group was 0.1 kg and in the intensive modification group was 5.6 kg (P < 0.001). Significant weight loss was maintained over the 4 yr of follow-up. The cumulative incidence of diabetes after 3 yr was 28.9% in the standard modification group and only 14.4% in the intensive modification group.

### Review of current evidence and clinical recommendations on the effects of low-carbohydrate and very-low-carbohydrate (including ketogenic) diets for the management of body weight and other cardiometabolic risk factors: a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association nutrition and lifestyle task force [^ae9855de]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Low- and very-low-carbohydrate diets — clinical oversight and contraindications are specified as follows: The decision about whether a patient should follow a low-CHO or very-low-CHO diet should be made after a clinician-patient discussion about the risks and benefits of these diets and consideration of patient preference. If a very-low-CHO diet is adopted, individuals with overweight or obesity without T2D should, ideally, receive medical supervision, baseline and regular assessment of lipid/lipoproteins, and, when feasible, multiple sessions with an RDN to facilitate dietary adherence with personalized nutrition counseling and behavior modification, as well as replacement of CHO with unsaturated fatty acids and avoidance of excessive intakes of SFA and cholesterol. Individuals following low-CHO or very-low-CHO diets for T2D management should receive medical supervision for adjustment of diabetes and hypertension medications as needed. In addition, referral to a behavioral change support team, including an RDN, when feasible, is recommended to facilitate dietary adherence along with personalized nutrition counseling and behavior modification. Patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors should avoid very-low-CHO/KDs because of an increased risk of SGLT2 inhibitor–associated ketoacidosis. Clinician oversight is essential for patients with chronic medical conditions who want to follow low-CHO or very-low-CHO diets, including those with ASCVD, heart failure, T2D, kidney disease, and liver disease. Some patients should not follow a VLCHF diet because of the presence or history of hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis, severe hypertriglyceridemia (ie, propensity for hyperchylomicronemia), or inherited severe hypercholesterolemia. Referral to a comprehensive lifestyle intervention for weight loss can increase the likelihood of weight loss success and long-term weight maintenance, and referral to an RDN, when feasible, for medical nutrition therapy and lifestyle counseling can improve cardiometabolic risk and encourage the consumption of vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains within the context of a CHO-restricted diet. Achieving a healthy body weight and long-term weight maintenance using a cardioprotective dietary pattern and increased physical activity can promote overall health and decrease the risk of ASCVD.

### Diabetes and diet: a patient and dietitian's perspective [^b27873b9]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Behavioral Strategies

Behavioral strategies are a key component of the Weightwise program. Emotional eating is addressed using CBT and some aspects of mindfulness, and all participants are encouraged to self-monitor using food and mood diaries to identify those situations in which they use emotional eating to manage stress. There is evidence that self-monitoring can support weight loss if framed as a positive tool, and in Carole's case, she was supported in using a diary to identify food cravings and external eating. She also used a Smartphone application to monitor her levels of activity and general food intake, and this strategy was recommended to all group participants using a choice of either electronic or paper diaries.

Various strategies to manage emotional eating are introduced over the course of the program, including relapse prevention, coping planning, problem-solving and managing food cravings. These techniques are known as implementation intentions, more commonly called 'if–then' strategies, and are designed to address specific stressful situations by encouraging links between a critical situation ('if') with an appropriate response ('then'). In addition to coping strategies, the program includes fostering self-acceptance and emphasizes the role of thoughts in driving feelings and behavior. Unhelpful thoughts and thinking errors, such as catastrophizing and mind-reading, are explored and challenged. Providing a non-judgmental atmosphere in which all participants feel safe and supported and able to explore their thoughts and feelings is fundamental to the program.

Diabetes Management

There is evidence that it is more challenging for those with type 2 diabetes to lose weight than it is for those without diabetes, and that this difficulty is exacerbated by insulin treatment, which is itself associated with weight gain. One aim of weight loss is to improve (or maintain) glycemic control while avoiding hypoglycemia and achieving this balance requires both blood glucose monitoring and active insulin dose titration. In the Weightwise program, participants are encouraged to monitor blood glucose levels between two to four times daily, and insulin titration takes place under medical supervision. An essential part of the program is carbohydrate awareness and management, with the aim to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. Carol describes how the combination of reduced dietary intake, increased physical activity, weight loss and blood glucose monitoring allowed her to safely reduce her insulin from 74 to 6 units Levemir daily.

In summary, Carole has shown that successful, long-term weight loss is possible in people with type 2 diabetes treated by insulin, but that a multi-component program which includes behavioral strategies was the key to her success.

### Unravelling the role of natural herbs for the management of diabetes mellitus [^819d2c97]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Interventions in diabetes mellitus

Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disease marked by increased blood glucose levels, requires behavior modification and lifestyle changes. In order to help patients, control their diabetes and improve their general health, non-pharmacological methods aim to provide them with the information and abilities they need to make healthy lifestyle choices. Personalized lifestyle interventions that are tailored to each patient's particular requirements and preferences have demonstrated promising outcomes in the treatment of diabetes. Personalized lifestyle interventions have proven to be quite effective in a number of areas related to managing diabetes. By customizing meal plans, recommending physical activity, and creating all-encompassing treatment plans for each patient, these interventions successfully address unique obstacles and difficulties that are unique to each individual. This method successfully increases treatment compliance, promotes sustained behavioral change, and boosts patient involvement in self-care. Individualized dietary regimens, like glycaemic index-based meal plans and carb counting, have been demonstrated to help patients achieve better glycaemic control. By implementing tailored physical activity recommendations, patients are guaranteed to engage in pleasurable and manageable workouts, which improves glucose management. Type 2 diabetes can be significantly increased by obesity, which also increases the likelihood of developing complications from the disease. By applying specialized techniques including portion control, calorie restriction, and physical activity regimens, tailored lifestyle therapies seek to address weight management. According to research, compared to generic therapies, the use of individualized techniques results in better long-term weight management outcomes and enhanced effectiveness in reaching weight loss goals. People with diabetes may experience psychological effects such as stress, anxiety, and sadness. To successfully address emotional barriers and improve psychological well-being, personalized lifestyle therapies usually include behavior modification strategies like motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral therapy. People are better equipped to manage the challenges of managing their diabetes when they receive individualized support and counseling. In order to improve treatment adherence and support long-term behavior change in the management of diabetes, it is imperative to employ behavior modification approaches. These methods place a high priority on empowering patients to embrace healthy behaviors, set reasonable objectives, and build self-efficacy. A crucial habit is self-monitoring, which includes recording physical activity, eating habits, and blood glucose levels on a regular basis. According to research, people who regularly track their progress are more likely to see reoccurring patterns and make wise decisions to improve their diabetes care. Research has indicated that individualized food planning and exercise regimens can greatly enhance the treatment of diabetes. Improved glycaemic control and weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes have been associated with low-carb diets that emphasize nutrient-dense foods like proteins, healthy fats, and non-starchy vegetables. Additionally, these diets lower the risk of heart disease. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and olive oil are all part of the Mediterranean diet, which has been linked to better glycaemic management and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. For diabetics, these diets offer significant health benefits and can be tailored to personal preferences. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that tailored physical activity recommendations that take into account variables like age, fitness level, and comorbidities connected to diabetes improve physical fitness, optimize glucose management, and reduce cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients. All things considered, these individualized methods can greatly enhance diabetic care and general wellness.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^75436b78]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Nutrition and physical activity history — Gathering a nutrition history and physical activity history often uses a healthy habits survey completed by the patient and/or caregiver before the visit, and electronic health records, waiting room kiosks, and emailed previsit surveys can help gather this information; additional tools include 24-hour recalls, food diaries (electronic/written, telephone- or text-prompted), and smartphone applications that track food intake, while pedometers and other wearable activity monitors can assist with physical activity assessment; cultural dietary habits, limited English proficiency, and limited literacy levels may influence tool accuracy, and compared with adults, activity assessment is challenging because children and adolescents are less reliable in recalling performed activity.

### Lifestyle medicine consulting walking meetings for sustained weight loss [^23f27a72]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

With rates of obesity and diabetes rising worldwide, effective ways of managing weight are becoming more important. We present the case study of a middle-aged Caucasian-American woman (body mass index (BMI) 27.8, overweight category) who wanted to lose weight. The patient participated in a behaviour modification programme with a physician trained in lifestyle medicine as well as health and wellness coaching. After the 14-week programme, which included 9, 1 h long walking sessions with the clinician, the patient lost 11 Ibs (BMI 24.7, normal category). The programme included a combination of increasing physical activity, eating appropriate quantities of healthy foods, goal setting and a positive attitude. The patient has kept her BMI at or below 24.1 for over 2 years. This case demonstrates a novel approach to weight loss management — walking therapeutic sessions — and also outlines critical components of lifestyle medicine counselling that facilitate the process of sustainable weight loss and lasting change.

### The effect of electronic self-monitoring on weight loss and dietary intake: a randomized behavioral weight loss trial [^2047c884]. Obesity (2011). Low credibility.

Technology may improve self-monitoring adherence and dietary changes in weight loss treatment. Our study aimed to investigate whether using a personal digital assistant (PDA) with dietary and exercise software, with and without a feedback message, compared to using a paper diary/record (PR), results in greater weight loss and improved self-monitoring adherence. Healthy adults (N = 210) with a mean BMI of 34.01 kg/m(2) were randomized to one of three self-monitoring approaches: PR (n = 72), PDA with self-monitoring software (n = 68), or PDA with self-monitoring software and daily feedback messages (PDA+FB, n = 70). All participants received standard behavioral treatment. Self-monitoring adherence and change in body weight, waist circumference, and diet were assessed at 6 months; retention was 91%. All participants had a significant weight loss (P < 0.01) but weight loss did not differ among groups. A higher proportion of PDA+FB participants (63%) achieved ≥ 5% weight loss in comparison to the PR group (46%) (P < 0.05) and PDA group (49%) (P = 0.09). Median percent self-monitoring adherence over the 6 months was higher in the PDA groups (PDA 80%; PDA+FB 90%) than in the PR group (55%) (P < 0.01). Waist circumference decreased more in the PDA groups than the PR group (P = 0.02). Similarly, the PDA groups reduced energy and saturated fat intake more than the PR group (P < 0.05). Self-monitoring adherence was greater in the PDA groups with the greatest weight change observed in the PDA+FB group.

### Gaps in provider lifestyle counseling and its adherence among obese adults with prediabetes and diabetes in the United States [^4b465790]. Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Obesity is an epidemic affecting about 40% of the US adult population. Tracking with the obesity epidemic is an increase in the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes. Both pre-diabetes and diabetes are often coexistent with obesity and contribute to an increased total and cardiovascular disease related morbidity and mortality. Lifestyle modification is usually the first step in management among individuals with obesity and/or pre-diabetes or diabetes, but remains an unfulfilled potential by healthcare providers to promote healthier lifestyles in obese patients. We aimed to describe the current patterns of lifestyle counseling (diet, physical activity, and weight loss) and their adherence by patients with obesity in the US using the National Health Interview Survey, 2016–2017. We analyzed these patterns among individuals with pre-diabetes and diabetes. We found that, regardless of pre-diabetes or diabetes status, almost 1 in 3 individuals with mild obesity (BMI ≥ 30 & < 35) and 1 in 4 with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 35) reported lack of lifestyle counseling from healthcare providers regarding diet or physical activity, and 2 in 3 individuals with any level of obesity reported lack of referral/counsel concerning weight loss programs. Lifestyle counseling and its compliance among obese adults from a contemporary dataset in the US is still suboptimal. This study highlights the gaps in the implementation of the AHA/ACC 2013 guidelines on management of obesity among adults particularly among those with metabolic disease, who would derive the greatest benefit.

### Identifying sustainable lifestyle strategies for maintaining good glycemic control: a validation of qualitative findings [^fc04d801]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Evidence-based management of diabetes now departs from 'one-size fits all' guidelines, especially for glycemic targets. Guidelines, however, are still based on patient characteristics (age, duration of disease, and the presence of comorbidities)without clear guidance on how to incorporate or accommodate patient preferences. Patient-centered discussions typically depend on good communication between the patient and the doctor, with patient involvement in discussions concerning shared decision-making about management and outcomes. Unfortunately, the clinical reality is that little time is available for these discussions. Even in the transition to patient-centered medical homes, where clinic reorganization focuses on better access to care and a team of healthcare providers familiar with a patient's medical history, time with the doctor and healthcare educators remains limited. This study identified some successful lifestyle practices that might be useful and sustainable in everyday life. Some of these factors already have been shown to be efficacious in clinical trials (diabetes education, adhering to medications, low-fat or low-calorie diet), while others (monitoring sodium) are less clear. These practices may help to maintain good glycemic control and could be emphasized in diabetes education and clinical support discussions. Themes validated in this study may offer concrete discussion points about self-care. Future studies might also explore the sustainability of these practices as well as other strategies, such as drinking low-calorie beverages to reduce food intake.

Diabetes education remains a cornerstone for improved self-care for diabetes. Maintenance of good glycemic control, especially early in the disease progression, is important to diabetes management as it can delay or prevent diabetes complications. Lifestyle and self-care practices focused on physical activity, weight loss, and SMBG may not be sufficient to help patients achieve good control. Often patients with diabetes have limited mobility due to injuries or conditions secondary to obesity, and large, unsupervised weight loss appears unattainable for most patients. This study identified some dietary practices that may be effective in achieving good control even in the absence of exercise. Overall, the results suggest that healthy eating patterns for weight management (low-fat or low-calorie diet, monitoring sodium) should be encouraged and appear to be sustainable. Clinical trial evidence supports the use of most of these strategies for diabetes self-care, but the simple combination of a few key strategies may translate directly to better maintenance of glycemic control over time.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^df20057d]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Prevention of overweight and obesity with diet or combined diet and physical activity interventions — evidence review conclusions indicate that dietary behavior can be safely improved with interventions that result in lower saturated fat intake, reduced intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables; in a small number of studies these changes were associated with significantly lower body mass index (BMI) or BMI percentile on follow-up, and no evidence of harm was identified. For pediatric patients with a BMI below the 85th percentile for age and gender, the guideline recommendations address optimizing diet in these areas, increasing intake of whole grains, and matching energy intake to growth and energy expenditure with monitoring of BMI and dietary intake over time, and state that no additional dietary recommendations to prevent obesity are indicated based on this evidence review, emphasizing the importance of following the pattern of growth over time to identify children who require more frequent follow-up, further assessment, and intervention.

### Role of counseling to promote adherence in healthy lifestyle medicine: strategies to improve exercise adherence and enhance physical activity [^6238483f]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Although healthy lifestyles (HL) offer a number of health benefits, nonadherence to recommended lifestyle changes remains a frequent and difficult obstacle to realizing these benefits. Behavioral counseling can improve adherence to an HL. However, individuals' motivation for change and resistance to altering unhealthy habits must be considered when developing an effective approach to counseling. In the present article, we review psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors that may promote adherence and contribute to nonadherence. We discuss two established models for counseling, motivational interviewing and the transtheoretical model of behavior change, and provide an example of how these approaches can be used to counsel patients to exercise and increase their levels of physical activity.

### Habitual dietary intake, eating pattern and physical activity of women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^a0030f15]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Diet and lifestyle modifications may be of benefit in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but there is a paucity of data on these behaviours in women with PCOS. This study aims to address this through a comprehensive investigation of the habitual diet and activity patterns of UK women with PCOS and their alignment with dietary recommendations for health.

Subjects/Methods

A 7-day-estimated food and activity diary and questionnaire was completed by 210 women with PCOS for calculation of activity levels, energy and nutrient intakes and dietary glycaemic index (GI).

Results

Mean (s.d.) body mass index (BMI) was 27.4 (7.3)kg/m(2) (n = 183), with 53% of women with PCOS having a BMI > 25kg/m(2). Of the overweight women, approximately half were not achieving sufficient physical activity to promote weight loss. More frequent eating episodes and a lower BMI were weakly associated (r = -0.158, P = 0.034). Mean percentage energy from fat was 38 (7)% (12% energy from saturated fat), with 68% of women with PCOS consuming > 35% energy from fat. Mean dietary GI was higher in obese women with PCOS, compared with healthy weight women with PCOS (55.7 (3.4) and 53.8 (4.0), respectively; P = 0.043).

Conclusion

Many women with PCOS are not achieving dietary intakes and levels of physical activity that optimise symptom management and disease prevention. Advice should focus on fat quality and quantity and carbohydrate modification. There is a need for further robust research into the role of dietary GI in the PCOS population.

### Review of current evidence and clinical recommendations on the effects of low-carbohydrate and very-low-carbohydrate (including ketogenic) diets for the management of body weight and other cardiometabolic risk factors: a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association nutrition and lifestyle task force [^ce061424]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Low- and very-low-carbohydrate (CHO) diets, including ketogenic diets — use and transition guidance indicates that although a low-CHO diet (initially < 20 g/d and transitioning to < 30 g/d) can be used in practice with medical supervision, if this is the preferred strategy it is strongly recommended that the patient transition to a healthier dietary pattern meeting current recommendations for ideal cardiometabolic and CV health; long-term adherence to a very-low-CHO/KD is challenging and over time many individuals appear to shift to higher CHO intakes (130–160 g/d); professional guidance, preferably from an RDN, increases the likelihood of transitioning to a sustained healthy dietary pattern that promotes maintenance of reduced body weight.

### Lifestyle habits associated with weight regain after intentional loss in primary care patients participating in a randomized trial [^8bf896ef]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Though long-term weight loss maintenance is the treatment goal for obesity, weight regain is typical and few studies have evaluated lifestyle habits associated with weight regain.

Objective

To identify dietary and physical activity habits associated with 6- and 24-month weight regain among participants in a weight loss maintenance clinical trial.

Design

Secondary analysis of randomized clinical trial data.

Participants

Adult primary care patients with recent, intentional weight loss of at least 5%.

Main Measures

Lifestyle habits included consumption of low-fat foods, fish, desserts, sugary beverages, fruits, and vegetables and eating at restaurants from the Connor Diet Habit Survey; moderate-vigorous physical activity by self-report; steps recorded by a pedometer; and sedentary behavior by self-report. The outcome variable was weight change at 6 and 24 months. Linear regression models estimated adjusted associations between changes in weight and changes in dietary and physical activity habits.

Key Results

Overall, participants (mean (SD): 53.4 (12.2) years old; 26% male; 88% white) maintained weight loss at 6 months (n = 178, mean (SD): -0.02 (5.70)% change) but began to regain weight by 24 months (n = 157, mean (SD): 4.22 (9.15)% increase). When considered all together, more eating at restaurants, reduced fish consumption, and less physical activity were most consistently associated with weight regain in fully adjusted models at both 6 and 24 months of follow-up. In addition, more sedentary behavior was associated with weight regain at 6 months while reduced consumption of low-fat foods, and more desserts and sugary beverages were associated with weight regain at 24 months.

Conclusions

Consuming less fish, fewer steps per day, and more frequent restaurant eating were most consistently associated with weight regain in primary care patients. Primary care providers may consider addressing specific lifestyle behaviors when counseling patients after successful weight loss.

### International consensus statement on the diagnosis, multidisciplinary management and lifelong care of individuals with achondroplasia [^4ac7b168]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Achondroplasia — nutrition, physical activity and weight management — individuals with achondroplasia are at disproportionately elevated risk of obesity, and current references for diagnosing obesity, estimating metabolic requirements, and informing dietary or physical activity guidelines are not valid when applied to individuals of short and disproportionate stature; anthropometric assessment and dietary records should be monitored regularly in adolescents and adults. A healthy diet and regular physical activity are recommended for all patients with achondroplasia. Modifiable lifestyle factors relevant to obesity risk should be targeted in individuals with achondroplasia to prevent weight gain during childhood and adolescence. Monitoring of body composition throughout adult life in individuals with achondroplasia is advocated to establish within-patient reference values and detect excess adiposity.

Table 6 — self-management and medication de-escalation statements that reached consensus for type 2 diabetes (T2D) state that self-management of blood glucose levels and blood pressure can provide patients feedback on the impact of specific lifestyle change(s) and serve as a navigational guide to success in remission of T2D. Routine self-management of blood glucose levels is strongly recommended to guide appropriate, safe, and timely medication de-escalation, if relevant, and a plan for medication de-escalation should include protocols for (a) identifying medication(s) that may negatively impact the success of lifestyle intervention and (b) educating patients to identify and report symptoms and/or self-monitoring values that alert a need for medication de-escalation(s). Continuous glucose monitoring technology, when applicable, can provide timely and actionable insight to patients regarding the impact of lifestyle choices on blood sugar control to aid in the adherence to lifestyle changes.

### Why Do lifestyle recommendations fail in most patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease? [^d78576d8]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been recognized as a major health burden. The efficacy and safety profile of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease remains uncertain; therefore, lifestyle modification is the first line of treatment. Based on available data, patients should optimally achieve at least a 5% to 10% weight reduction for histologic improvement. There is no clear consensus on the optimal diet or exercise regimen. Sustainability of any intervention is key to success; however, compliance has been a major issue in clinical trials. This finding underscores the importance of multidisciplinary strategies to achieve targeted weigh loss.

### Synopsis of the 2020 U.S. VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity [^5a145c6b]. Military Medicine (2021). High credibility.

VA/DoD adult overweight and obesity guideline — comprehensive lifestyle intervention (CLI) is positioned as foundational; the Work Group "strongly recommends offering a CLI that combines behavioral, dietary, and physical activity components as a foundational element of any weight management intervention," and states that emphasizing the CLI "is a key element of the shared decision making process." Pharmacotherapy and metabolic/bariatric surgery "should always be offered in conjunction with or concurrent to a CLI." When patients express interest in a CLI, it is "useful to share and emphasize several key concepts," including to "Understand weight management is a lifelong commitment rather than a brief episode of treatment," to "Create an "energy deficit" through a combination of reduced caloric intake and increased physical activity," and to "Apply specific behavioral strategies (e.g., goal setting, monitoring, problem solving) to support incremental changes in both diet and physical activity." The guideline adds, "We suggest that providers prepare patients to address the challenges of maintaining weight loss," noting this "may include the expectation that they will need to increase their participation in moderate or vigorous physical activity to maintain significant weight loss." Additionally, "Consultation with a dietitian, a clinical pharmacist, or a bariatric surgeon may help with decision making about the choice of specific weight management interventions, especially for patients with complex medical histories and/or concurrent pharmacotherapies that may impact the potential benefits and harms of specific weight management treatment components."

### Telephone counseling for physical activity and diet in primary care patients [^20604bd9]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The delivery of effective interventions to assist patients to improve their physical activity and dietary behaviors is a challenge in the busy primary care setting.

Design

Cluster RCT with practices randomized to telephone counseling intervention or usual care. Data collection took place from February 2005 to November 2007, with analysis from December 2007 to April 2008.

Setting/Participants

Four-hundred thirty-four adult patients with type 2 diabetes or hypertension (mean age = 58.2 [SD = 11.8]; 61% female; mean BMI = 31.1 [SD = 6.8]) from a disadvantaged community were recruited from ten primary care practices.

Intervention

Twelve-month telephone counseling intervention.

Main Outcome Measures

Physical activity and dietary intake were assessed by self-report at baseline, 4, and 12 months.

Results

At 12 months, patients in both groups increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity by a mean of 78 minutes per week (SE = 10). Significant intervention effects (telephone counseling minus usual care) were observed for: calories from total fat (decrease of 1.17%; p < 0.007), energy from saturated fat (decrease of 0.97%; p < 0.007), vegetable intake (increase of 0.71 servings; p < 0.039), fruit intake (increase of 0.30 servings; p < 0.001), and grams of fiber (increase of 2.23 g; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The study targeted a challenging primary care patient sample and, using a telephone-delivered intervention, demonstrated modest improvements in diet and in physical activity. Results suggest that telephone counseling is a feasible means of delivering lifestyle intervention to primary care patients with chronic conditions-patients whose need for ongoing support for lifestyle change is often beyond the capacity of primary healthcare practitioners.

### Effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation in enhancing adherence and improving clinical outcomes post-acute coronary syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^0890573e]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2.1 Exercise Training

The exercise training component began with a comprehensive initial assessment, including cardiopulmonary exercise testing and individualized risk stratification. Patients engaged in a structured exercise regimen consisting of supervised aerobic and resistance training. Aerobic exercises were conducted three times per week, with sessions lasting 30−45 min at a moderate intensity (60%−70% of peak heart rate). Exercises included treadmill walking, stationary cycling, and low‐impact activities, with progression carefully monitored and adjusted based on individual patient response. Resistance training was incorporated twice weekly, focusing on major muscle groups using resistance bands, light weights, and body‐weight exercises. Throughout the program, patients were monitored with continuous cardiac telemetry, regular assessments of perceived exertion, and periodic reevaluations of exercise tolerance.

2.2.2 Dietary Counseling

Dietary counseling was equally comprehensive, beginning with an in‐depth nutritional assessment that included metabolic profiling and a detailed dietary habit questionnaire. Patients received individualized 60‐min consultations with a registered dietitian, resulting in personalized meal plans targeting specific nutritional goals. These goals included sodium reduction to less than 2300 mg per day, limiting saturated fat intake to less than 7% of total calories, increasing fiber intake to 25−30 g daily, and implementing portion control strategies. Follow‐up support included monthly individual counseling sessions, quarterly group nutrition workshops, and access to educational materials and a smartphone application for dietary tracking.

2.2.3 Education

The educational component consisted of weekly 90‐min group sessions covering critical aspects of cardiac health management. Topics included medication management, risk factor modification, stress management, symptom recognition, and lifestyle strategies. Educational materials were diverse, including illustrated guidebooks, video‐based resources, and interactive digital modules. These sessions provided in‐depth information on the pathophysiology of ACS, the importance of medication adherence, and comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction strategies.

2.2.4 Psychological Support

Psychological support was integrated through a structured approach beginning with standardized screening for depression, anxiety, and stress. Patients were offered up to six individual counseling sessions, optional group support meetings, and training in cognitive‐behavioral stress management and mindfulness techniques. Quarterly follow‐up assessments ensured ongoing psychological support, with referrals to specialized mental health services when necessary.

The program concluded with a personalized maintenance plan, providing recommendations for continued independent exercise and 6 months of telephone support to ensure sustained lifestyle modifications. This holistic approach aimed to empower patients with the knowledge, skills, and support necessary for long‐term cardiovascular health management.

### Evaluation of a type 2 diabetes prevention program using a commercial weight management provider for non-diabetic hyperglycemic patients referred by primary care in the UK [^716cdd7c]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

On attending the WW meetings, the WW plan was explained to the patient; program materials were provided and patients were given access to a WW online App. The WW plan is based on a Weight Loss System, which is a point system that creates an energy deficit for a healthy rate of weight loss personalized for every patient (based on gender, height, current weight and age). Dietary modifications seek to increase consumption of wholegrains, vegetables and other foods that are high in dietary fiber, reduce the total amount of fat in the diet by eating less saturated fat and reduce the amount of refined carbohydrates consumed. Promotion of regular, enjoyable and convenient PA is encouraged. Their DPP goals of 7% weight loss and increasing activity were encouraged throughout.

The standard weekly WW sessions already have a core curriculum that uses an evidence-based lifestyle modification program appropriate for diabetes prevention. This includes tailored advice, support and encouragement to help patients be more physically active, eat a healthier diet, lose weight and maintain a healthier weight. The behavioral change strategies employed within the program include, but are not limited to, self-monitoring strategies (utilizing digital-based and/or paper-based tools to track weight, food intake and activity), stimulus control (use of impulse control techniques to improve management of food cravings), development of weekly personal coping plans (for relapse prevention), problem solving, goal setting and strategies to garner social support. Table 1 illustrates the WWDPP core curriculum topics addressed and behavior change strategies employed.

Weight Watchers Diabetes Prevention Program (WWDPP) core curriculum topics addressed and behavior change strategies employed

The fidelity of the intervention was maintained via quality assurance protocols already embedded within the WW organization, including visiting sessions with standardized assessments, completing spot checks that leaders are adhering to the curriculum, regularly tracking and reviewing patient outcomes, completing leader management and training needs analysis and reviewing the qualitative research. All WW services were commissioned by the Local Authority and provided free of charge to patients for the duration of the study (figure 2).

Lifestyle counseling is an intervention that can improve chronic disease management as well as patient and provider satisfaction. Patients and providers are often frustrated with difficulties faced in the implementation and maintenance of lifestyle change. Can we change this paradigm? Are there new strategies that work and can be implemented in a typical office visit? The medical literature confirms the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions and recommends that lifestyle counseling be considered as a cornerstone of care. Here we present a case study of a midlife woman to show how motivational interviewing can be used to help her identify and meet her health goals.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^4db8e8df]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

GUIDELINES AND PRACTICE FOR NUTRITION AND LIFESTYLE COUNSELING FOR OBESITY

The high and rising prevalence of obesity globally is often attributed to poor dietary patterns and insufficient physical activity, which are often related to behaviors learned early in life and developed over time as well as structural barriers to good lifestyle. Serial studies from the US and Europe suggest that energy expenditure from physical activity increased between 1981 and 2017, during the onset of the obesity epidemic, while basal metabolic expenditure declined, implicating other factors such as dietary composition that impact metabolic rate. Beyond obvious effects on energy balance, dietary quality can also influence obesity risk through changes in metabolic adaptation due to a high refined carbohydrate diet, in resting energy expenditure (such as through brown or beige adipose tissue thermogenesis), in microbiome calorie utilization (with corresponding greater or lesser utilization by the host tissues), and in epigenetic or trans‐generational risk of obesity. Thus, dietary composition, beyond calories alone, is relevant to obesity risk.

Although individual risk can be modified by genetic influences, population risk and trends in obesity over time are predominantly driven by lifestyle trends related to cultural, community, and environmental factors. Obesity can also be exacerbated by iatrogenic causes, resulting from poor diet quality or low physical activity due to medical conditions or obesogenic medications. Although all causes and contributors of obesity are not within an individual's control, structured lifestyle modification programs can be effective and feasible to help achieve a 5%–10% weight reduction and maintain a healthy body weight for many people.

### Precision measurements to assess baseline status and efficacy of healthy living medicine [^ccfc3919]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Precision medicine recently has gained popularity, calling for more individualized approaches to prevent and/or reduce chronic-disease risk and to reduce non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). Encompassed under Precision medicine initiatives is the concept of healthy living medicine (HLM), which emphasizes the promotion of lifestyle and behavioral practices including physical activity and healthy dietary pattern. Precision measurements have the potential to improve the understanding of how risk factors influence disease trajectory, and further inform on how to precisely tailor clinical strategies to manage risk factors to prevent disease manifestation, and refine therapies according the patient's demographic, environment, and disease etiology. The purpose of this review is to summarize the application of established and emerging measurements that may be used in HLM to manage and optimize care in CVD prevention.

### Dietary interventions to treat type 2 diabetes in adults with a goal of remission: an expert consensus statement from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^799f3aa8]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Adjuvant and alternative interventions — The panel stated that "dietary intervention should be combined with physical activity to optimize remission outcomes and that all lifestyle-related behaviors should be addressed where possible," emphasizing that "Addressing all lifestyle behaviors, particularly diet and exercise, is likely to produce only positive (side) effects; therefore, no drawbacks exist to clinical care emphasizing healthy behaviors." Supporting epidemiology noted that "Research has found a lower risk of developing T2D with increased plant-based diet consumption and increased levels of physical activity." Consistent with the literature, "the panel agreed that intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding, or both, combined with a whole-food plant-based diet could achieve T2D remission," and "it was agreed that this type of intervention should be individualized and involve team members with knowledge and expertise in diabetes management to achieve the highest level of patient satisfaction and the least amount of recidivism."

### Synopsis of the 2020 U.S. VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity [^5c6bef00]. Military Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Comprehensive lifestyle interventions — specific behavioral strategies are outlined, including goal setting, self-monitoring, stimulus control or cue reduction, positive reinforcement, and contingency management. Goal setting involves setting realistic, specific goals for behavior change and includes the specific action to be taken and when, where, how, how long, and how often it will be performed. Self-monitoring is perhaps "the most often employed and the most important, behavioral strategy" and includes recording food intake, physical activity, and body weight daily. Stimulus control or cue reduction aims to change environmental signals or cues for eating and sedentary behaviors, with examples such as removing unhealthy food from sight or not watching TV when eating. Positive reinforcement refers to the provision of rewards for desirable behavior. Contingency management establishes a defined schedule for rewards or punishments "contingent upon" completion of specified behaviors; "Positive reinforcement is generally preferred over punishment," and "It is recommended to encourage choosing a reward that does not involve calories."

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^9abd2b42]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) lifestyle management — diet, exercise, and coffee intake: Patients who are overweight or obese should be prescribed a diet that leads to a caloric deficit, and when possible, diets with limited carbohydrates and saturated fat and enriched with high fiber and unsaturated fats (e.g. Mediterranean diet) should be encouraged due to their additional cardiovascular benefits. To support physical activity, patients should be encouraged to exercise as much as possible, and individualized prescriptive exercise recommendations may increase sustainability and have benefits independent of weight loss. Weight loss improves hepatic steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and hepatic fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner, and the necessary support to manage comorbid disease and foster the adoption of liver protective health behaviors is best achieved using a multidisciplinary approach. Coffee consumption (caffeinated or not) of at least 3 cups daily is associated with less advanced liver disease.

### Treatment of NAFLD with diet, physical activity and exercise [^c863cab7]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Lifestyle intervention can be effective when treating non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) patients. Weight loss decreases cardiovascular and diabetes risk and can also regress liver disease. Weight reductions of ⩾10% can induce a near universal non-alcoholic steatohepatitis resolution and fibrosis improvement by at least one stage. However, modest weight loss (> 5%) can also produce important benefits on the components of the NAFLD activity score (NAS). Additionally, we need to explore the role of total calories and type of weight loss diet, micro- and macronutrients, evidence-based benefits of physical activity and exercise and finally support these modifications through established behavioural change models and techniques for long-term maintenance of lifestyle modifications. Following a Mediterranean diet can reduce liver fat even without weight loss and is the most recommended dietary pattern for NAFLD. The Mediterranean diet is characterised by reduced carbohydrate intake, especially sugars and refined carbohydrates (40% of the calories vs. 50–60% in a typical low fat diet), and increased monounsaturated and omega-3 fatty acid intake (40% of the calories as fat vs. up-to 30% in a typical low fat diet). Both TV sitting (a reliable marker of overall sedentary behaviour) and physical activity are associated with cardio-metabolic health, NAFLD and overall mortality. A 'triple hit behavioural phenotype' of: i) sedentary behaviour, ii) low physical activity, and iii) poor diet have been defined. Clinical evidence strongly supports the role of lifestyle modification as a primary therapy for the management of NAFLD and NASH. This should be accompanied by the implementation of strategies to avoid relapse and weight regain.

### Protocol for a clinical trial of text messaging in addition to standard care versus standard care alone in prevention of type 2 diabetes through lifestyle modification in India and the UK [^299219d8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes is a serious clinical problem in both India and the UK. Adoption of a healthy lifestyle through dietary and physical activity modification can help prevent type 2 diabetes. However, implementing lifestyle modification programmes to high risk groups is expensive and alternative cheaper methods are needed. We are using a short messaging service (SMS) programme in our study as a tool to provide healthy lifestyle advice and an aid to motivation. The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and user acceptability of text messaging employed in this way for people with pre-diabetes (HbA1c 6.0% to ≤ 6.4%; 42–47 mmol/mol) in the UK and India.

Methods/Design

This is a randomised, controlled trial with participants followed up for 2 years. After being screened and receiving a structured education programme for prediabetes, participants are randomised to a control or intervention group. In the intervention group, text messages are delivered 2–3 times weekly and contain educational, motivational and supportive content on diet, physical activity, lifestyle and smoking. The control group undergoes monitoring only. In India, the trial involves 5 visits after screening (0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months). In the UK there are 4 visits after screening (0, 6, 12 and 24 months). Questionnaires (EQ-5D, RPAQ, Transtheoretical Model of Behavioural Change, and food frequency (UK)/24 h dietary recall (India)) and physical activity monitors (Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers) are assessed at baseline and all follow-up visits. The SMS acceptability questionnaires are evaluated in all follow-up visits. The primary outcome is progression to type 2 diabetes as defined by an HbA1c of 6.5% or over(India) and by any WHO criterion(UK). Secondary outcomes are the changes in body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose; lipids; proportion of participants achieving HbA1c ≤ 6.0%; HOMA-IR; HOMA-β; acceptability of SMS; dietary parameters; physical activity and quality of life.

Discussion

The study is designed to assess the efficacy of tailored text messaging in addition to standard lifestyle advice to reduce the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes in the two different countries.

Regarding patient education for obesity, more specifically with respect to general counseling, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to counsel adult patients with obesity or overweight with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia) that lifestyle changes producing even modest, sustained weight loss of 3–5% produce clinically meaningful health benefits and greater weight losses produce greater benefits. Counsel patients that sustained weight loss of 3–5% is likely to result in clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides, blood glucose, HbA1c, and the risk of developing T2DM.

### Self-monitoring dietary intake: current and future practices [^1f835c41]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

This article reviews the literature on the use of paper diaries for self-monitoring food intake, identifies the strengths and limitations of paper-and-pencil diaries and their new counterpart, the electronic diary or personal digital assistant (PDA), and reports how participants were trained to use a PDA with dietary software in two pilot studies — one with hemodialysis patients and the other with participants in a weight loss study. The report of the pilot studies focuses on the practical issues encountered in training participants in the use of a PDA and addresses the pros and cons of different dietary software programs. Six hemodialysis patients were trained in the first study and seven participants attempting to lose or maintain their weight were trained in the second pilot study. The training focused on how to use a PDA and how to navigate the dietary software to self-monitor food intake. The goals of using the PDA were to improve adherence to the therapeutic diets and to self-monitoring. Lessons learned from the pilot studies are shared.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^659b8e98]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

3.1.0 Values and preferences

In making this recommendation (and other recommendations associated with specific lifestyle choices), the Task Force placed a relatively higher value on promoting lifestyle choices with their potential wide-reaching benefits and safety, and it placed a relatively lower value on avoiding the costs of implementation of lifestyle interventions with their potentially limited impact.

Although physicians generally strive to cure the great majority of their patients and may view a long-term success rate of 25% with despair, we should not retreat into a state of therapeutic nihilism. We are at a stage where we must treat overweight and obese patients, accept that perhaps only 25% may respond, but refine our techniques so that lifestyle modification will be effective in an increasing percentage of patients.

3.1.0 Remarks

Weight loss should be encouraged in patients with severe obesity and significant comorbidities. In this regard, a decrease in BMI of 1.5 kg/m 2, as reported in the meta-analysis commissioned by the Task Force, may seem trivial, but if it is maintained over a longer term, overweight or minimally obese growing children and adolescents without comorbidities may benefit by simply maintaining weight; BMI will decline as linear growth proceeds, and lifestyle modification may reduce fat mass, increase lean body mass, and improve cardiovascular fitness. In the more severely obese or in physically mature patients, moderate weight loss of only 7% was associated with a decrease in the incidence of T2DM. This may be a more realistic goal for the severely obese (see 3.1.0 Evidence). Well-designed, randomized controlled studies of large numbers of patients, employing intensive lifestyle intervention and follow-up maintenance programs, are clearly needed to develop improved techniques. Some of the factors that should be addressed in such studies are described.

Successful lifestyle intervention and preventive measures are labor intensive, and even more so if there is a posttreatment maintenance program. The time spent in delivering intensive lifestyle interventions — direct contact with the patient and family (we cannot overemphasize the importance of family involvement) at least once a month for the first 3 months and comprising dietary and nutritional education, a physical activity prescription, and behavioral therapy — is poorly reimbursed, and thus there may be a disincentive to provide these services (Ref. pp 221–227).
