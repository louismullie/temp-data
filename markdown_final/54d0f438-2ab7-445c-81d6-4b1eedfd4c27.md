## Question

What is the HELIX-x trial of ramirazole in dementia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the HELIX-x trial of ramirazole in dementia is and wants to know whether such a trial exists in the provided materials and, if not, what the closest evidence base suggests. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "HELIX-x" or "ramirazole" appear anywhere in the supplied references. Then, I should verify common trial naming conventions and potential near-miss terms that could explain a misnaming. Next, I will consider the closest pharmacologic match (e.g., riluzole) and summarize what is known. After that, I'll infer what a trial like this would typically look like if it existed, based on recent AD trial paradigms. Finally, I'll synthesize a conclusion and recommend next steps to verify the correct identifier and drug name in registries or sponsor materials.

> Let me first confirm the presence of the exact strings. I need to check whether "HELIX-x", "HELIX", or "ramirazole" appear in any title, abstract, or content of the provided references; wait, let me verify this carefully before concluding absence. On review, I find no occurrences of "HELIX-x", no trials named "HELIX", and no molecule named "ramirazole" across the set, which otherwise includes major recent Alzheimer's trials and drug labels, suggesting reasonable coverage of the field and making the absence notable.

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm not conflating "HELIX" with something unrelated; my first thought was "Helix aspersa" because of the similar string, but that's a preclinical animal study of snail extract with no connection to a human AD clinical trial — so that initial thought is a red herring and I should discard it for the present question [^114FgfQB].

> Next, I should review whether "ramirazole" might be a misnomer for a known small molecule with a similar morphology, like riluzole; let me consider the closest match and double-check details. Riluzole, an FDA-approved glutamate modulator for ALS, has been tested in a 6‑month phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled AD study (50 mg twice daily) that suggested slowed FDG-PET metabolic decline but did not provide definitive clinical efficacy data in the excerpt; safety monitoring for hepatotoxicity, neutropenia, and potential ILD is required, and the labeled dose for ALS is 50 mg BID, which matches the trial regimen, so the pharmacologic and dosing context aligns if "ramirazole" was intended to mean riluzole [^111c1F8q] [^112HqFTW] [^1117ZMyq] [^1144yf3D] [^111gFepb].

> I will now examine trial naming conventions to ensure "HELIX-x" isn't a typical sponsor or program codename I'm overlooking; wait, I should double‑check examples from the set. Recent Alzheimer's trials are typically branded or acronymic (for example, Lauriet for semorinemab and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 for donanemab), and I do not see a "HELIX-x" pattern in these exemplars, which makes the "HELIX-x" label atypical for the programs represented here.

> If I assume such a trial existed but is simply not captured here, I should infer its likely design based on recent paradigms; let me think about what that typically entails and verify with exemplars. Standard designs for disease‑modifying AD therapeutics at prodromal-to-mild stages are randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, with biomarker-confirmed amyloid positivity, longitudinal dosing over 72–96 weeks, and primary outcomes like CDR‑SB, often with tau and amyloid biomarker panels and FDG‑PET as supportive measures [^115QnTeJ] [^112NZ1Y2].

> But wait, I should place any hypothetical results in the context of observed patterns; hold on, let me verify consistency with the broader literature. Multiple anti‑tau antibody trials (for example, semorinemab and tilavonemab) have not demonstrated significant clinical benefit on primary endpoints in early AD, whereas the most consistent positive signal in this corpus comes from anti‑amyloid antibodies (for example, lecanemab and donanemab) showing modest but statistically significant slowing of decline, albeit with safety considerations; the very high historical failure rate and the shift toward earlier intervention windows also temper expectations for late‑stage symptomatic cohorts [^112NZ1Y2] [^117Fygqy].

> Hmm, wait a minute — before concluding, I should double‑check whether the absence could reflect a registry-only listing or a non‑AD dementia; the provided set is rich in AD but not exhaustive for all dementias or very early‑phase programs. Given no hits here, the prudent step is to verify the exact trial identifier and molecule name in ClinicalTrials.gov or EudraCT and, if available, with sponsor communications; in parallel, if the intent was riluzole, the existing phase 2 AD data are preliminary and biomarker‑oriented, with safety constraints that would shape any larger efficacy study design [^112HqFTW] [^111c1F8q].

> Final synthesis: I should confirm the direct answer clearly. There is no information in the provided references about a "HELIX‑x trial of ramirazole in dementia", and both the trial label and the drug name do not appear in this corpus; if "ramirazole" was meant to be "riluzole", the closest evidence is a small phase 2 AD study with imaging biomarker signals but without definitive clinical efficacy in the excerpts, and with known safety monitoring requirements from the ALS label, so further verification of nomenclature and registry details is recommended [^111c1F8q] [^112HqFTW].

I **can't find** a dementia drug named "ramirazole" or a trial called "HELIX-x" in the literature. Could you **please clarify**:

- **The exact drug name** (spelling or alternative names)?
- **The trial identifier** (e.g. NCT number) or sponsor? - **The dementia subtype or mechanism** you're asking about?

If you meant a **tau-targeting therapy**, I can summarize evidence for semorinemab [^115QnTeJ] and tilavonemab [^112NZ1Y2]. Alternatively, if you meant an **amyloid-directed therapy**, I can summarize key results for donanemab [^117Fygqy] and lecanemab (LEQEMBI).

### Safety and efficacy of semorinemab in individuals with prodromal to mild Alzheimer disease: A randomized clinical trial [^115QnTeJ]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Neurofibrillary tangles composed of aggregated tau protein are one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) and correlate with clinical disease severity. Monoclonal antibodies targeting tau may have the potential to ameliorate AD progression by slowing or stopping the spread and/or accumulation of pathological tau.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the monoclonal anti-tau antibody semorinemab in prodromal to mild AD.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted between October 18, 2017, and July 16, 2020, at 97 sites in North America, Europe, and Australia. Individuals aged 50 to 80 years (inclusive) with prodromal to mild AD, Mini-Mental State Examination scores between 20 and 30 (inclusive), and confirmed β-amyloid pathology (by positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid) were included.

- **Interventions**: During the 73-week blinded study period, participants received intravenous infusions of placebo or semorinemab (1500 mg, 4500 mg, or 8100 mg) every 2 weeks for the first 3 infusions and every 4 weeks thereafter.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcomes were change from baseline on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes score from baseline to week 73 and assessments of the safety and tolerability for semorinemab compared with placebo.

In the modified intent-to-treat cohort (n = 422; mean [SD] age, 69.6 [7.0] years; 235 women [55.7%]), similar increases were seen on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes.

### Tilavonemab in early Alzheimer's disease: results from a phase 2, randomized, double-blind study [^112NZ1Y2]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

Tau accumulation in patients with Alzheimer's disease tracks closely with cognitive decline and plays a role in the later stages of disease progression. This phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of tilavonemab, an anti-tau monoclonal antibody, in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. In this 96-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT02880956), patients aged 55–85 years meeting clinical criteria for early Alzheimer's disease with a Clinical Dementia Rating-Global Score of 0.5, a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 22 to 30, a Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status-Delayed Memory Index score of ≤ 85, and a positive amyloid PET scan were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive one of three doses of tilavonemab (300 mg, 1000 mg, or 2000 mg) or placebo via intravenous infusion every 4 weeks.

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline up to Week 96 in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score. Safety evaluations included adverse event monitoring and MRI assessments. A total of 453 patients were randomized, of whom 337 were treated with tilavonemab (300 mg, n = 108; 1000 mg, n = 116; 2000 mg, n = 113) and 116 received placebo. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were comparable across groups. The mean age was 71.3 (SD 7.0) years, 51.7% were female, and 96.5% were White. At baseline, the mean CDR-SB score was 3.0 (1.2), which worsened through Week 96 for all treatment groups. The least squares mean change from baseline at Week 96 in the CDR-SB score with tilavonemab was not significantly different.

### Donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer disease: The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 randomized clinical trial [^117Fygqy]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

The study TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, published in the journal JAMA in 2023, investigates the impact of donanemab on patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease exhibiting amyloid and tau pathology. It is a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial involving 1,736 patients (996 females, 740 males).

The inclusion criteria specified patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease characterized by amyloid and low/medium or high tau pathology, as determined by PET imaging. Key exclusion criteria included the presence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities such as edema/effusion, more than four cerebral microhemorrhages, more than one area of superficial siderosis, any intracerebral hemorrhage larger than 1 cm, or severe white matter disease on MRI.

- **Interventions**: Participants were divided into two groups: 860 received donanemab (intravenous administration of 1,400 mg every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks), while 876 were given a matching placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks.

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome indicated a significant decrease in the decline in least-squares mean Integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale score at week 76, with a difference of 10.19 points versus 13.11 points in the control group (Adjusted Difference -2.92 points, 95% CI -1.51 to -4.33).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was also a significant decrease in the reduction of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score at week 76, with a score of 1.72 points versus 2.42 points in the control group (Adjusted Difference -0.7 points, 95% CI -0.95 to…).

### Leqembi [^111s68Pv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Leqembi treatment met the primary endpoint and reduced clinical decline on the global cognitive and functional scale, Clinical Dementia Rating–Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), compared to placebo at 18 months (-0.45 [-27%], P < 0.0001).

Statistically significant differences (P < 0.01) between treatment groups were also observed in the results for the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 14 (ADAS-Cog14) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living-Mild Cognitive Impairment scale (ADCS MCI-ADL) at 18 months, as presented in Table 8.

- **ApoE ε4 carriers and noncarriers**: Both groups showed statistically significant treatment differences for the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints. In an exploratory subgroup analysis of ApoE ε4 homozygotes, representing 15% of the trial population, a treatment effect was not observed with Leqembi treatment on the primary endpoint, CDR-SB, compared to placebo. However, treatment effects favoring Leqembi were observed for the secondary clinical endpoints, ADAS-Cog14 and ADCS MCI-ADL. Treatment effects on disease-relevant biomarkers — including amyloid beta PET, plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, and plasma p-tau 181 — also favored Leqembi in the ApoE ε4 homozygous subgroup.

- **Statistical significance over time**: Starting at six months, across all time points, Leqembi treatment showed statistically significant changes in the primary and all key secondary endpoints from baseline compared to placebo; see Figure 2.

### Randomized phase II study of the safety and efficacy of semorinemab in participants with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease: Lauriet [^112HDkwz]. Neurology (2023).

Accumulation of tau pathology in Alzheimer disease (AD) correlates with cognitive decline. Anti-tau immunotherapies were proposed as potential interventions in AD. While antibodies targeting N-terminal tau failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy in prodromal-to-mild AD, their utility at other disease stages was not evaluated in prior studies. Lauriet is a phase 2 study of an anti-tau monoclonal antibody, semorinemab, in patients with mild-to-moderate AD.

- **Methods**: The phase 2 Lauriet study included a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind period, during which participants with mild-to-moderate AD received 4,500 mg of IV semorinemab or placebo every 4 weeks for 48 or 60 weeks. Participants who chose to continue in the subsequent optional open-label extension received 4,500 mg of semorinemab every 4 weeks for up to 96 weeks. Coprimary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline to week 49 or 61 on the 11-item version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog11) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects were also evaluated.

- **Results**: Between December 3, 2018, and February 27, 2020, 624 individuals were screened, 272 participants were randomized, and 238 were included in the modified intent-to-treat population (received ≥ 1 dose(s) of study medication).

### Combination therapy in Alzheimer's disease: Is it time [^117Hsxj8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia globally. Increasing evidence suggests that AD has no single pathogenic mechanism, indicating that treatment approaches focusing solely on one mechanism are unlikely to be meaningfully effective. With only one potentially disease-modifying treatment approved, targeting amyloid-β (Aβ), AD remains underserved regarding effective drug treatments.

Combining multiple drugs or designing treatments that target multiple pathways could be an effective therapeutic approach. Considering the distinction between added and combination therapies, most trials fall under the category of added therapies. For combination therapy to impact the course of AD, it is likely necessary to target multiple mechanisms including, but not limited to, Aβ and tau pathology.

Several challenges need to be addressed regarding combination therapy, such as choosing the correct agents, determining the best time and stage of AD to intervene, and designing appropriate protocols for clinical trials. This can be achieved through cooperation between the pharmaceutical industry, academia, private research centers, philanthropic institutions, and regulatory bodies.

Based on all available information, the success of combination therapy in tackling complicated disorders such as cancer, and the blueprint already laid out for implementing combination therapy and overcoming its challenges, an argument can be made that the field must move cautiously but quickly toward designing new clinical trials and further exploring the pathological mechanisms.

### Primary prevention trials in Alzheimer disease [^116ZboPp]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Many new treatments under development for Alzheimer disease (AD) will be disease-modifying rather than symptomatic. Clinical evaluation of these treatments will require primary and secondary prevention trials. We describe some of the methodologic challenges in designing primary prevention trials for AD and illustrate these with examples from the ADAPT (Alzheimer Disease Anti-Inflammatory Prevention Trial) Study and GEM (Ginkgo in Evaluation of Memory) Study. Primary prevention trials for AD present many design challenges. In most situations, secondary prevention trials provide the most feasible first step toward primary prevention.

### SPL drug information for riluzole [^112HqFTW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of riluzole PO (also known as Rilutek, Tiglutik):

- **Decreased blood neutrophil count, agranulocytosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as riluzole has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.

- **Drug-induced liver injury**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as riluzole has been associated with an increased risk of elevated serum transaminases and hepatic injury. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury. Discontinue riluzole if serum transaminase levels are greater than 5× the upper limit of normal (ULN).

- **ILD, hypersensitivity pneumonitis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as riluzole has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.

- **Increased serum riluzole levels**: Use caution in patients of Japanese descent.

### Alzheimer's disease beyond amyloid: Strategies for future therapeutic interventions [^11721e6c]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

Biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease have been clearly identified, yet the disease remains a complex and multifaceted disorder. Few would argue against the value of biomarkers for diagnosis and tracking the course of Alzheimer's disease. As our understanding of these biomarkers advances, however, the limitations of these signature proteins as targets of treatment also emerge. We have delineated several promising strategies which may improve the clinical outcomes of future trials.

- **Promising strategies**: Firstly, the use of higher concentrations of monoclonal treatments to adjust for poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier; secondly, early identification and treatment of patients at high risk for Alzheimer's disease and targeting treatment at asymptomatic patients with limited biomarker deposition; and finally, the simultaneous or sequential targeting of both biomarkers with monoclonal treatment to determine whether synergy is needed to achieve efficacy.

In the meantime, we need to explore promising areas of research that target pathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease and affect cognitive performance, such as vascular and inflammatory risk factors. Whether or not these cognitive benefits directly correlate with or significantly affect biomarker deposition requires further investigation. Cerebrovascular parameters, which may affect clinical outcomes in monoclonal trials, should be evaluated. The combination of cerebrovascular risk modification and monoclonal treatments targeting amyloid β/tau protein could have a therapeutic effect not seen in isolation.

### Pathways to personalized medicine-embracing heterogeneity for progress in clinical therapeutics research in Alzheimer's disease [^115hV6Pu]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

Insufficiently informative reporting of trials may relate to the constraints of regulatory approval pathways and the economic interests within the healthcare investment community driving drug development. Regulatory agencies are responsible for protecting public health by ensuring the safety and efficacy of drugs, biological products, and medical devices. This population orientation may sometimes clash with the individual patient orientation of healthcare practitioners.

If a drug does not show statistical benefit in the population for which it is intended, it cannot progress. However, within that population, there may be subgroups or individuals for whom the drug is effective. Responder analyses might elucidate these cases, but this may require redefining the indication, setting development back to conduct additional trials. This process is inefficient and costly.

### Leqembi [^1175EVAT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

After the 79-week double-blind, placebo-controlled period of Study 1, patients could enroll in an open-label extension period for up to 260 weeks, which was initiated following a gap period ranging from 9 to 59 months, with a mean of 24 months off treatment.

- **Study 2**: In Study 2, 1,795 patients were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive Leqembi 10 mg/kg or placebo once every 2 weeks. Of the total number of patients randomized, 69% were ApoE ε4 carriers, and 31% were ApoE ε4 non-carriers. The overall median age of patients was 72 years, with a range of 50 to 90 years. Fifty-two percent were women, and 1,381 (77%) were White, 303 (17%) were Asian, and 47 (3%) were Black.

- **Randomization stratification**: The randomization was stratified according to clinical subgroup (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of the disease), the presence or absence of concomitant approved therapies for Alzheimer's disease at baseline (cholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist memantine), ApoE ε4 carrier status, and geographical region.

- **Primary efficacy outcome**: The primary efficacy outcome was a change from baseline at 18 months in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB).

- **Key secondary endpoints**: Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline at 18 months for the following measures: amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using Centiloids, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14), and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS MCI-ADL).

### Biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease drug development [^1147yT47]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2011). Low credibility.

Developing new therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critically important to avoid the impending public health disaster posed by this common disorder. Means must be found to prevent, delay the onset, or slow the progression of AD. These goals will be achieved by identifying disease-modifying therapies and testing them in clinical trials. Biomarkers play an increasingly important role in AD drug development. In preclinical testing, they assist in decisions to develop an agent.

- **Phase I**: Biomarkers provide insights into toxic responses and drug metabolism.

- **Phase II (proof-of-concept trials)**: They facilitate go/no-go decisions and dose finding. Biomarkers can play a role in identifying presymptomatic patients or specific patient subgroups. They can provide evidence of target engagement before clinical changes can be expected.

- **Brain imaging**: It can serve as a primary outcome in Phase II trials and as a key secondary outcome in Phase III trials. Magnetic resonance imaging is currently best positioned for use in large multicenter clinical trials.

- **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures**: Measures of amyloid beta protein (Aβ), tau protein, and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein are sensitive and specific to the diagnosis of AD and may serve as inclusion criteria and possibly as outcomes in clinical trials targeting relevant pathways. Plasma measures of Aβ are of limited diagnostic value but may provide important information as a measure of treatment response.

A wide variety of measures of detectable products of cellular processes are being developed as possible biomarkers accessible in…

### Leqembi [^1114u14R]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Leqembi was evaluated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized studies (Study 1, NCT01767311; Study 2, NCT03887455) in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These patients had confirmed presence of amyloid pathology and either mild cognitive impairment (64% of patients in Study 1; 62% of patients in Study 2) or were in the mild dementia stage of the disease (36% of patients in Study 1; 38% of patients in Study 2), consistent with Stage 3 and Stage 4 Alzheimer's disease. In both studies, patients were enrolled with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of 0.5 or 1.0 and a Memory Box score of 0.5 or greater.

All patients had a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of ≥ 22 and ≤ 30, and exhibited objective impairment in episodic memory, indicated by performance at least 1 standard deviation below the age-adjusted mean on the Wechsler-Memory Scale-IV Logical Memory II (subscale) (WMS-IV LMII). Patients were enrolled with or without concomitant approved therapies for Alzheimer's disease, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist memantine.

The dosage of 10 mg/kg once every two weeks was assessed during the 18-month placebo-controlled portions of Study 1 and Study 2 and continued in the optional long-term extension of each study. Transitioning to 10 mg/kg once every four weeks after 18 months of dosing is supported by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling using observed data [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there are limited data to assess the long-term clinical benefit of transitioning to this dosing regimen.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials, focused on disease-modifying drugs and conducted in patients with mild to moderate AD, as well as prodromal (early) AD, have failed to reach efficacy endpoints in improving cognitive function in most cases at the time of writing, or have been terminated due to adverse events. Drugs that have reached the clinical stage were reviewed using web resources.

### Accelerating Alzheimer's disease drug innovations from the research pipeline to patients [^11355BGW]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2018). Low credibility.

In June 2017, a diverse group of experts in Alzheimer's disease convened to discuss how to accelerate getting new drugs to patients to both prevent and treat the disease. Participants concluded that we need a more robust, diversified drug development pipeline. Strategic policy measures can help keep new Alzheimer's disease therapies affordable for patients while supporting innovation and facilitating greater information sharing among payers, providers, researchers, and the public. Measures include a postmarket surveillance study system, disease registries, innovative payment approaches, harmonizing federal agency review requirements, allowing conditional coverage for promising therapeutics and technology while additional data are collected, and opening up channels for drug companies to communicate with payers about data and outcomes.

To combat reimbursement issues, policymakers should address the latency time between potential treatment, which may be costly and fall on private payers, and societal benefits that accrue elsewhere.

### Clinical trials for disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer's disease: A primer, lessons learned, and a blueprint for the future [^115pdoG4]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The development phase — and to a lesser extent the discovery phase — of drug creation is guided by a Target Product Profile (TPP). The TPP defines the desirable features of a drug and its use, including the primary indication, patient population, treatment duration, delivery mode, dosage regimen, tolerability, risk/side effects, and differentiating features in a competitive landscape. A minimally acceptable profile and an ideal profile are identified. Failure to achieve the minimally acceptable profile may lead to discontinuation of the development program. Using the TPP, the indication and proposed package insert are constructed, and the development program is designed in reverse to ensure that all the features of the TPP are fully defined for the compound in the course of development.

Clinical trials must be reported in a specific format called the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) when they are submitted to journals. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors has subscribed to these requirements to achieve standardized reporting of clinical trials. Anticipation of the features to be reported allows the checklist to function as a useful guide to planning a clinical trial.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a template that can be used to plan a clinical trial, including all elements necessary to meet Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and CONSORT requirements.

### Exelon [^117CrDh1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

In each study, the effectiveness of Exelon was evaluated using a dual outcome assessment strategy. The ability of Exelon to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), a multi-item instrument that has been extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language, and praxis. The ADAS-cog scoring range is from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Elderly normal adults may score as low as 0 or 1, but it is not unusual for non-demented adults to score slightly higher.

The patients recruited as participants in each study had mean scores on ADAS-cog of approximately 23 units, with a range from 1 to 61. Experience gained in longitudinal studies of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease suggests that they gain 6–12 units a year on the ADAS-cog. Lesser degrees of change, however, are seen in patients with very mild or very advanced disease because the ADAS-cog is not uniformly sensitive to change over the course of the disease. The annualized rate of decline in the placebo patients participating in Exelon trials was approximately 3–8 units per year.

### Alzheimer's disease [^111r1qvj]. Lancet (2011). Low credibility.

An estimated 24 million people worldwide have dementia, the majority of whom are thought to have Alzheimer's disease, representing a major public health concern and identified as a research priority. Although licensed treatments can alleviate symptoms, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding of its pathogenesis to enable the development of disease-modifying treatments. Methods for improving diagnosis are progressing; however, a better consensus is needed to develop a panel of biological and neuroimaging biomarkers that support clinical diagnosis.

There is now strong evidence of potential risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and cognitive decline, yet further work is necessary to better understand these factors and establish whether interventions can significantly lower these risks. This seminar provides an overview of recent evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. It also discusses potential ways to reduce the risk of developing the disease.

### Riluzole, a glutamate modulator, slows cerebral glucose metabolism decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease [^111c1F8q]. Brain (2021). High credibility.

Dysregulation of glutamatergic neural circuits has been implicated in a cycle of toxicity, which is believed to be among the neurobiological underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we reported preclinical evidence that the glutamate modulator riluzole, which is FDA-approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has potential benefits on cognition, as well as on structural and molecular markers of aging and Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate in a pilot clinical trial the potential efficacy and safety of riluzole in patients with Alzheimer's disease, compared to a placebo, using neuroimaging biomarkers.

A six-month phase 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted at two sites. Participants consisted of males and females, ages 50 to 95, with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease and a Mini-Mental State Examination score between 19 and 27. Ninety-four participants were screened; 50 participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg riluzole (n = 26) or a placebo (n = 24) twice a day. Twenty-two riluzole-treated participants and 20 placebo participants completed the study.

- **Primary end points**: Baseline to six-month changes in (i) cerebral glucose metabolism as measured with fluorodeoxyglucose-PET in prespecified regions of interest (hippocampus, posterior cingulate, precuneus, lateral temporal, inferior parietal, frontal) and (ii) changes in posterior cingulate levels of the neuronal viability marker N-acetylaspartate as measured with in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Secondary outcome measures were not fully detailed in the excerpt provided.

### Galantamine hydrobromide [^115akqe3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In each study, the primary effectiveness of galantamine was evaluated using a dual outcome assessment strategy as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and the Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change that required the use of caregiver information (CIBIC-plus).

The ability of galantamine to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive sub-scale of the ADAS-cog, a multi-item instrument that has been extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language, and praxis. The ADAS-cog scoring range is from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Elderly normal adults may score as low as 0 or 1, but it is not unusual for non-demented adults to score slightly higher.

The patients recruited as participants in each study using the tablet formulation had mean scores on ADAS-cog of approximately 27 units, with a range from 5 to 69. Experience gained in longitudinal studies of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease suggests that they gain 6 to 12 units a year on the ADAS-cog. Lesser degrees of change, however, are seen in patients with very mild or very advanced disease because the ADAS-cog is not uniformly sensitive to change over the course of the disease.

### A framework for translating tauopathy therapeutics: Drug discovery to clinical trials [^113MbMGd]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

Tau may theoretically be a better Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutic target than Aβ because, unlike the weaker relationship of brain Aβ plaque burden and cognition, the extent of insoluble tau pathology predicts both the onset of clinical symptoms of AD as well as the pattern of clinical decline. Insoluble tau deposition measured by tau PET strongly correlates with the onset of clinical symptoms in autosomal dominant AD, and temporal lobe tau PET uptake predicts the cortical spread of tau pathology, brain atrophy, and subsequent clinical decline in sporadic AD. Moreover, the severity and type of symptoms in AD closely reflect the distribution of insoluble tau in the brain, suggesting that interventions reducing tau have the potential to produce large clinical effects.

Clinical trials of early tau therapies, including biologics with first-generation N-terminal anti-tau monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), tilavonemab (ABBV-8E12), gosuranemab, zagotenemab, and semorinemab, have failed to demonstrate consistent clinical benefits in AD and/or other tauopathies. A trial of semorinemab in mild-to-moderate AD stands apart, having reported approximately a 40% reduction in the rate of decline on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Composite co-primary endpoint, but not on other endpoints, resulting in a lack of converging evidence and questions around the potential reproducibility of the findings. By contrast, in prodromal-mild AD, semorinemab did not demonstrate clinical benefit, with modestly reduced CSF p-tau181 levels by approximately 15% (mean of all doses). This effect was less than the approximately 25% reductions reported for patients who responded.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials focused on disease-modifying drugs and conducted in patients with mild to moderate AD, as well as prodromal (early) AD, have failed to reach efficacy endpoints in improving cognitive function in most cases at the time of writing or have been terminated due to adverse events. Drugs that have reached the clinical stage were reviewed using web resources.

### Early-stage Alzheimer disease: Getting trial-ready [^111rS3xn]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Slowing the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) might be the greatest unmet medical need of our time. Although one AD therapeutic has received a controversial accelerated approval from the FDA, more effective and accessible therapies are urgently needed. Consensus is growing that for meaningful disease modification in AD, therapeutic intervention must be initiated at very early (preclinical or prodromal) stages of the disease.

Although the methods for such early-stage clinical trials have been developed, identification and recruitment of the required asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic study participants take many years and require substantial funds. As an example, in the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease Trial (the first phase III trial to be performed in preclinical AD), 3.5 years and more than 5,900 screens were required to recruit and randomize 1,169 participants.

A new clinical trials infrastructure is required to increase the efficiency of recruitment and accelerate therapeutic progress. Collaborations in North America, Europe, and Asia are now addressing this need by establishing trial-ready cohorts of individuals with preclinical and prodromal AD. These collaborations are employing innovative methods to engage the target population, assess risk of brain amyloid accumulation, select participants for biomarker studies, and determine eligibility for trials. In the future, these programs could provide effective tools for pursuing the primary prevention of AD. Here, we review the lessons learned from the AD trial-ready cohorts that have been established.

### Ariceptodt [^115EhiVc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The effectiveness of treatment with 23 mg/day was determined using a dual outcome assessment strategy that evaluated cognitive function using an instrument designed for more impaired patients and overall function through caregiver-rated assessment.

The ability of 23 mg/day to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB). The SIB, a multi-item instrument, has been validated for the evaluation of cognitive function in patients with moderate to severe dementia. It evaluates selective aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, language, orientation, attention, praxis, visuospatial ability, construction, and social interaction. The SIB scoring range is from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment.

The ability of 23 mg/day to produce an overall clinical effect was assessed using a clinician's interview-based impression of change that incorporated the use of caregiver information, the CIBIC-plus. The CIBIC-plus used in this trial was a semi-structured instrument that examines four major areas of patient function: general, cognitive, behavioral, and activities of daily living. It represents the assessment of a skilled clinician based on observations at an interview with the patient, in combination with information supplied by a caregiver familiar with the behavior of the patient over the interval rated. The CIBIC-plus is scored as a seven-point categorical rating, ranging from a score of 1, indicating "markedly improved", to a score of 4, indicating "no improvement".

### Kisunla [^114upKDg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Kisunla was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 1, NCT04437511) focusing on patients with Alzheimer's disease, specifically those with confirmed amyloid pathology. These patients exhibited mild cognitive impairment or were at the mild dementia stage, aligning with Stage 3 and Stage 4 Alzheimer's disease.

Patients enrolled had a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score between 20 and 28 and had experienced a progressive change in memory function for at least six months. Inclusion in the study was based on a visual assessment of tau PET imaging with flortaucipir and a standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). Participants could be enrolled with or without concomitant approved therapies, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist memantine for Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, an optional long-term extension was available for participants.

In Study 1, 1736 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 700 mg of Kisunla every four weeks for the first three doses, followed by 1400 mg every four weeks (N = 860), or a placebo (N = 876) for up to 72 weeks. Treatment was switched to placebo based on amyloid PET levels, assessed at Week 24, Week 52, and Week 76. If the amyloid plaque level was less than 11 Centiloids on a single PET scan or between 11 to less than 25 Centiloids on two consecutive PET scans, the patient became eligible to switch to placebo.

### Tilavonemab in early Alzheimer's disease: results from a phase 2, randomized, double-blind study [^115RCZCi]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

Tau accumulation in patients with Alzheimer's disease tracks closely with cognitive decline and plays a role in the later stages of disease progression. This phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of tilavonemab, an anti-tau monoclonal antibody, in patients with early Alzheimer's disease.

In this 96-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT02880956), patients aged 55–85 years meeting clinical criteria for early Alzheimer's disease with a Clinical Dementia Rating-Global Score of 0.5, a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 22 to 30, a Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status-Delayed Memory Index score of ≤ 85, and a positive amyloid PET scan, were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive one of three doses of tilavonemab (300 mg, 1000 mg, or 2000 mg) or placebo via intravenous infusion every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline up to Week 96 in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score. Safety evaluations included adverse event monitoring and MRI assessments.

A total of 453 patients were randomized, of whom 337 were treated with tilavonemab (300 mg, n = 108; 1000 mg, n = 116; 2000 mg, n = 113) and 116 received placebo. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were comparable across groups. The mean age was 71.3 (SD 7.0) years, 51.7% were female, and 96.5% were White. At baseline, the mean CDR-SB score was 3.0 (1.2), which worsened through Week 96 for all treatment groups. The least squares mean change from baseline at Week 96 in the CDR-SB score with tilavonemab was not significant.

### Tau-targeting therapies for Alzheimer disease [^1179MNTG]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Pathologically, AD is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, with associated loss of synapses and neurons, resulting in cognitive deficits and eventually dementia. Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and tau protein are the primary components of the plaques and tangles, respectively.

In the decades since Aβ and tau were identified, development of therapies for AD has primarily focused on Aβ, but tau has received more attention in recent years, in part because of the failure of various Aβ-targeting treatments in clinical trials.

- **Status of tau-targeting therapies**: Initially, potential anti-tau therapies were based mainly on the inhibition of kinases or tau aggregation, or on stabilization of microtubules. However, most of these approaches have been discontinued due to toxicity and/or lack of efficacy. Currently, the majority of tau-targeting therapies in clinical trials are immunotherapies, which have shown promise in numerous preclinical studies. Given that tau pathology correlates better with cognitive impairments than do Aβ lesions, targeting tau is expected to be more effective than Aβ clearance once the clinical symptoms are evident. With future improvements in diagnostics, these two hallmarks of the disease might be targeted prophylactically.

### Facilitating treatment initiation in early-stage Alzheimer disease [^116zxwMf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

Once a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is established, a wide variety of therapy options are available to treat different stages of the disease. Patients have the opportunity to delay the onset of the disease or delay its progression if diagnosed early enough through new FDA-approved disease-modifying treatments. For mild to moderate stages, new symptomatic treatments can slow the progression of the disease and improve symptoms. A multi-component approach is recommended in order to tailor treatments to each patient's needs.

### A framework for translating tauopathy therapeutics: Drug discovery to clinical trials [^116Vto3i]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

The tauopathies are defined by pathological tau protein aggregates within a spectrum of clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases. The primary tauopathies meet the definition of rare diseases in the United States. There is no approved treatment for primary tauopathies. In this context, designing the most efficient development programs to translate promising targets and treatments from preclinical studies to early-phase clinical trials is vital. In September 2022, the Rainwater Charitable Foundation convened an international expert workshop focused on the translation of tauopathy therapeutics through early-phase trials. Our report on the workshop recommends a framework for principled drug development and a companion lexicon to facilitate communication, focusing on reproducibility and achieving common elements. Topics include the selection of targets, drugs, biomarkers, participants, and study designs. The maturation of pharmacodynamic biomarkers to demonstrate target engagement and surrogate disease biomarkers is a crucial unmet need.

- **Highlights**: Experts provided a framework to translate therapeutics from discovery to clinical trials. Experts focused on the "5 Rights" (target, drug, biomarker, participants, trial). Research on frontotemporal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal syndrome therapeutics includes 32 trials, with 37% on biologics. Tau therapeutics are being tested in Alzheimer's disease; primary tauopathies have a large unmet need.

### Tau biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials [^115gasif]. The Lancet Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

The deposition of tau aggregates is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease closely linked both spatially and temporally to the emergence of neurodegeneration and the manifestation of clinical symptoms. There is an urgent need for accurate PET, CSF, and plasma biomarkers of tau pathology to improve the diagnostic process in clinical practice, as well as the selection of participants and monitoring of treatment effects in trials.

- **Recent developments**: Innovative second-generation tau-PET tracers with high affinity and selectivity to tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease have enabled the detection of tau pathology in medial temporal lobe subregions affected in the earliest disease stages. Furthermore, novel but common tau spreading subtypes have been discovered using tau-PET, suggesting much greater interindividual differences in the distribution of tau pathology across the brain than previously assumed. In the CSF biomarker field, novel phosphorylated tau (p-tau) assays have been introduced that better reflect tau tangle load than established CSF biomarkers of tau pathology. The advent of cost-effective and accessible blood-based biomarkers for tau pathophysiology (i.e. p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231) might transform the Alzheimer's disease field, as these biomarkers correlate with post-mortem Alzheimer's disease pathology, differentiate Alzheimer's disease from other types of dementia, and predict future progression from normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.

In controlled investigational settings, improvements in tau-PET and biofluid assays are ongoing to better understand and tackle Alzheimer's disease.

### Clinical trials for disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer's disease: A primer, lessons learned, and a blueprint for the future [^115dftUH]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Development of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a difficult, long, and expensive process. No development program has yet succeeded. A systematic approach to drug development, advancing the scientific understanding of the candidate molecule from preclinical studies through Phases I, II, and III of clinical trials, can increase the probability of success and de-risk development programs.

Biomarkers for diagnosis, target engagement and proof-of-pharmacology, outcome assessment, and side effect monitoring assist in drug development. Excellent conduct of trials and awareness of the trial pitfalls are critical to development success. New therapeutic targets, such as tau-related processes and the use of combination therapies, may enhance the chances of successful DMT development. Quality development and trial strategies for drugs that are potent, selective, and impactful on the biology of AD are necessary to bring urgently needed new treatments to patients with AD and those at risk for the disease.

The annualized rate of decline in the placebo patients participating in galantamine studies was noted but not fully detailed in this excerpt.

### Risks and benefits of unapproved disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative disease [^111cKo8B]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

To determine whether patients randomized to unapproved, disease-modifying interventions in neurodegenerative disease trials have better outcomes than those randomized to placebo, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. This review assessed the risk and benefit experienced by patients in randomized placebo-controlled trials testing investigational treatments for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

- **Methods**:
	- We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov for results of randomized trials testing non-Food and Drug Administration-approved, putatively disease-modifying interventions from January 2005 to May 2018. Trial characteristics were double-extracted. The coprimary endpoints were the treatment advantage over placebo on efficacy (standardized mean difference in outcomes) and safety (risk ratios of serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events), calculated with random effects meta-analyses. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018103798).

- **Results**:
	- We included 113 trials (n = 39,875 patients). There was no significant efficacy advantage associated with assignment to putatively disease-modifying interventions compared to placebo for Alzheimer's disease (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.07 to 0.01), Parkinson's disease (SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.15), ALS (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.30), or Huntington's disease (0.02, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.31). Patients with Alzheimer's disease assigned to active treatment were at higher risk of experiencing serious adverse events.

### Challenges, solutions, and recommendations for Alzheimer's disease combination therapy [^116YviHX]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2016). Low credibility.

Given the complex neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), combination therapy may be necessary for effective treatment. However, scientific, pragmatic, regulatory, and business challenges need to be addressed before combination therapy for AD can become a reality. Leaders from academia and industry, along with a former member of the Food and Drug Administration and the Alzheimer's Association, have explored these challenges and propose a strategy to facilitate proof-of-concept combination therapy trials in the near future.

- **Integrated understanding**: First, a more integrated understanding of the complex pathophysiology and progression of AD is needed to identify the appropriate pathways and the disease stage to target.
- **Clinical trial designs**: Once drug candidates are identified, novel clinical trial designs and selection of appropriate outcome assessments will be needed to enable definition and evaluation of the appropriate dose, dosing regimen, and determination of efficacy.

Success in addressing this urgent problem will only be achieved through collaboration among multiple stakeholders.

### Tau immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies: Status of trials and insights from preclinical studies [^115hEx4p]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

The tau protein undergoes pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies that eventually lead to functional impairments. Over the years, several therapeutic approaches have been examined to slow or halt the progression of tau pathology but have yet to lead to an approved disease-modifying treatment. Of the drugs in clinical trials that directly target tau, immunotherapies are the largest category and mostly consist of antibodies in different stages of development. There is reasonable optimism that at least some of these compounds will have clinically meaningful efficacy. This view is based on the significant, although modest, efficacy of some antibodies targeting amyloid-β in Alzheimer's disease and the fact that tau pathology correlates much better with the degree of dementia than amyloid-β lesions.

In Alzheimer's disease, clearing pathological tau may therefore improve function later in the disease process than when removing amyloid-β. This review provides a brief update on the active and passive clinical tau immunization trials with insights from preclinical studies. Various epitopes are being targeted, and some of the antibodies are said to target extracellular tau. Because almost all pathological tau is found intracellularly, the most efficacious antibodies should be able to enter the cell.

### Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders [^1178oqni]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

The development of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) is complex, requiring an average of 13 years to complete, often resulting in failure. Approaches to drug development that are more likely to succeed and require limited time and financial investment could accelerate the emergence of new therapies. Repurposed drugs approved for a non-AD/non-NDD indication are a promising source of new therapies.

This study describes the potential for repurposing therapeutics for AD/NDDs and highlights the benefits of developing a second use of an approved medicine, whose pharmacokinetics, safety, toxicity, and manufacturing are already known. It illustrates the role of repurposed drugs in the AD pipeline and describes the emergence of new technologies for identifying candidate repurposable agents. There are noted advantages of repurposing as a development strategy.

- **Challenges and solutions**: The text describes challenges associated with advancing repurposed drugs, particularly the limited availability of funding and sponsors for late-stage trials if the agents are generic. It suggests possible solutions for these challenges and issues a call to action for legislative changes that would incentivize programs to develop repurposable generic agents for the treatment of AD/NDD.

- **Central role in drug development**: The study further explores the central role of repurposed agents in the AD drug development ecosystem.

### Testing the right target and right drug at the right stage [^116GM5bt]. Science Translational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the only leading cause of death for which no disease-modifying therapy is currently available. Recent disappointing trial results at the dementia stage of AD have raised multiple questions about our approaches to the development of disease-modifying agents. Converging evidence suggests that the pathophysiological process of AD begins many years before the onset of dementia. So, why do we keep testing drugs aimed at the initial stages of the disease process in patients at the end-stage of the illness?

### Present algorithms and future treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^111rPkNV]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

An estimated 47 million people live with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia worldwide. Although no disease-modifying treatments are currently available for AD, earlier diagnosis and proper management of the disease could have a considerable impact on patient and caregiver quality of life and functioning. Drugs currently approved for AD treat the cognitive, behavioral, and functional symptoms of the disease and consist of three cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine.

Treatment of patients with mild to moderate AD is generally initiated with a ChEI. Patients who show progression of symptoms while on ChEI monotherapy may be switched to another ChEI and/or memantine can be added to the treatment regimen. In recent years, putative disease-modifying therapies have emerged that aim to slow the progression of AD instead of only addressing its symptoms. However, many therapies have failed in clinical trials in patients with established AD, suggesting that, once developed, disease-modifying agents may need to be deployed earlier in the course of illness.

The goal of this narrative literature review is to discuss present treatment algorithms and potential future therapies in AD.

### Disease-modifying trials in Alzheimer's disease: a European task force consensus [^113f1vAn]. The Lancet Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

After symptomatic treatments, the new target for therapeutic approaches in Alzheimer's disease is the development of disease-modifying drugs. The concept of disease modification in Alzheimer's disease is controversial, and the design of these trials raises many questions. Which populations should be studied? For how long? With which principal and secondary endpoints? Are surrogate markers available?

Here, we present a European consensus on disease-modifying trials in Alzheimer's disease, agreed upon under the auspices of the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium and based on the European perspective of the concept of disease modification, study designs, the role for biomarkers, risk-benefit, and pharmacoeconomic issues.

### Stratification of patients is the way to go to develop neuroprotective/disease-modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease [^111a6YhR]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Development of effective neuroprotective drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a formidable challenge because this disease is multifactorial and heterogeneous. Although AD is characterized histopathologically by the presence of numerous amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary degeneration of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain, these two hallmark lesions do not exist in any fixed proportion in this disease. Furthermore, in the brains of some normal aged individuals, there are as many amyloid-beta plaques seen as in typical cases of AD. On the other hand, extensive neurofibrillary degeneration of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau and dementia, but in the absence of amyloid-beta plaques, occur in several related neurodegenerative disorders called tauopathies. More than one molecular mechanism has been described for the development of amyloid-beta as well as neurofibrillary degeneration of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau. Thus, AD apparently results from several different etiopathogenic mechanisms and offers numerous rational therapeutic targets. We have discovered that there are at least five different subgroups of AD, and future studies are likely to identify additional subgroups. The employment of these subgroups of AD in clinical trials can markedly increase the success in developing specific and potent therapeutic drugs.

### Galantamine hydrobromide [^115PrmPU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In each study, the primary effectiveness of galantamine was evaluated using a dual outcome assessment strategy as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change that required the use of caregiver information (CIBIC-plus).

The ability of galantamine to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive sub-scale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), a multi-item instrument that has been extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language, and praxis. The ADAS-cog scoring range is from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Elderly normal adults may score as low as 0 or 1, but it is not unusual for non-demented adults to score slightly higher.

The patients recruited as participants in each study using the tablet formulation had mean scores on ADAS-cog of approximately 27 units, with a range from 5 to 69. Experience gained in longitudinal studies of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease suggests that they gain 6 to 12 units a year on the ADAS-cog. Lesser degrees of change, however, are seen in patients with very mild or very advanced disease because the ADAS-cog is not uniformly sensitive to change over the course of the disease.

### Toward the right treatment at the right time: Modeling the trajectory of cognitive decline to identify the earliest age of change in people with Alzheimer's disease [^116dMdo1]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Dementia is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide and has a global prevalence exceeding 50 million people. Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and prominent impairments in memory abilities in the early stages, is the most common cause of dementia. The global economic burden of AD and other dementias was estimated at $2.8 trillion in 2019 and is anticipated to rise to $4.7 trillion by 2030. These findings emphasize the need to increasingly direct research toward early intervention to reduce both the incidence and duration of illness.

There are currently many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) underway, with many more in the pipeline. These treatments seek to prevent or delay the development and progression of AD; however, at the time of writing, their clinical efficacy has been poor. This limited success provides opportunities to consider novel approaches in RCT designs, particularly in targeting participants at the highest risk for decline. By adding greater specificity to the recruitment age of prospective participants, studies may better identify optimal intervention windows. The preclinical and prodromal phases of AD pathology can precede clinical onset by decades, and early changes in cognition can be detected before a formal diagnosis. There is growing evidence to suggest that the earlier the intervention, the higher the possibility of success. Intervening earlier necessitates recruiting participants at earlier ages, but the ideal age range is currently undetermined.

### Sample size estimation for Alzheimer's disease trials from Japanese ADNI serial magnetic resonance imaging [^116vQKqL]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Little is known about the sample sizes required for clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-modifying treatments using atrophy measures from serial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the Japanese population.

- **Objective**: The primary objective of the present study was to estimate how large a sample size would be needed for future clinical trials for AD-modifying treatments in Japan using atrophy measures of the brain as a surrogate biomarker.

- **Methods**: Sample sizes were estimated from the rates of change of the whole brain and hippocampus by the k-means normalized boundary shift integral (KN-BSI) and cognitive measures using the data of 537 Japanese Alzheimer's Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) participants with a linear mixed-effects model. We also examined the potential use of ApoE status as a trial enrichment strategy.

- **Results**: The hippocampal atrophy rate required smaller sample sizes than cognitive measures of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Inclusion of ApoE status reduced sample sizes for AD and MCI patients in the atrophy measures.

- **Conclusion**: These results show the potential use of longitudinal hippocampal atrophy measurement using automated image analysis as a progression biomarker and ApoE status as a trial enrichment strategy in a clinical trial of AD-modifying treatment in Japanese people.

### We should not distinguish between symptomatic and disease-modifying treatments in Alzheimer's disease drug development [^114XHdtk]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2008). Low credibility.

The terms symptomatic and disease-modifying have become standard in discussions of Alzheimer's disease therapeutics, yet there is little justification for their use. Currently marketed drugs are presumed to be symptomatic because they lead to some degree of mean improvement over baseline and because of the widespread belief that their mechanisms are limited and their effects are completely reversible. Trial methodologies cannot distinguish between symptomatic and disease-modifying effects. Furthermore, it is highly likely that many trials will demonstrate a combination of such effects at the level of the trial or at the level of the individual. The forces that drive this distinction are largely social, as opposed to scientific. It would be preferable for drugs to first seek an antidementia claim, preferably on the background of conventional therapies when possible, in trials that are as small and as short in duration as possible. Further refinements would come by demonstration of how substantial and how enduring the antidementia benefits are.

### Beneficial effects of snail Helix aspersa extract in an experimental model of Alzheimer's type dementia [^114FgfQB]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with multifactorial etiology, unsatisfactory treatment, and a necessity for broad-spectrum active substances for cure. The mucus from Helix aspersa snail is a mixture of bioactive molecules with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects. So far, there are no data concerning the capacity of snail extract (SE) to affect neurodegenerative disorders.

- **Objective**: The effects of SE from Helix aspersa on learning and memory deficits in Alzheimer's type dementia (ATD) induced by scopolamine (Sco) in male Wistar rats were examined, and some mechanisms of action underlying these effects were evaluated.

- **Methods**: SE (0.5 mL/100 g) was applied orally through a food tube for 16 consecutive days: 5 days before and 11 days simultaneously with Sco (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). At the end of Sco treatment, using behavioral methods, we evaluated memory performance. Additionally, in the cortex and hippocampus, the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, acetylcholine and monoamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) content, levels of main oxidative stress markers, and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were determined.

- **Results**: We demonstrated that, according to all behavioral tests used, SE significantly improved the cognitive deficits induced by Sco. Furthermore, SE possessed AChE inhibitory activity, moderate antioxidant properties, and the ability to modulate monoamines content in two brain structures.

### Clinical trials for disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer's disease: A primer, lessons learned, and a blueprint for the future [^113qdRYk]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently has no approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), and treatments to prevent, delay the onset, or slow the progression are urgently needed. If a 5-year delay were available by 2025, it would decrease the total number of patients with AD by 50% in 2050. To meet the definition of a DMT, an agent must produce an enduring change in the course of AD; clinical trials of DMTs have the goal of demonstrating this effect.

AD drug discovery entails target identification, followed by high throughput screening and lead optimization of drug-like compounds. Once an optimized agent is available and has been assessed for efficacy and toxicity in animals, it progresses through:

- **Phase I testing**: Conducted with healthy volunteers.
- **Phase II learning trials**: Establish proof-of-mechanism and dose.
- **Phase III confirmatory trials**: Demonstrate efficacy and safety in larger populations. Phase III is followed by Food and Drug Administration review and, if appropriate, market access.

Trial populations include cognitively normal at-risk participants in prevention trials, mildly impaired participants with biomarker evidence of AD in prodromal AD trials, and subjects with cognitive and functional impairment in AD dementia trials. Biomarkers are critical in trials of DMTs, assisting in participant characterization and diagnosis, target engagement and proof-of-pharmacology, demonstration of disease-modification, and monitoring side effects.

Clinical trial designs include randomized, parallel group; delayed start; staggered withdrawal; and adaptive designs. Lessons learned from completed trials offer crucial insights for future studies.

### Adlarity [^115JPfqV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The ability of donepezil to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), a multi-item instrument that has been extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language, and praxis. The ADAS-cog scoring range is from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Elderly normal adults may score as low as 0 or 1, but it is not unusual for non-demented adults to score slightly higher.

The patients recruited as participants in each study had mean scores on the ADAS-cog of approximately 26 points, with a range from 4 to 61. Experience based on longitudinal studies of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease suggests that scores on the ADAS-cog increase (worsen) by 6–12 points per year. However, smaller changes may be seen in patients with very mild or very advanced disease since the ADAS-cog is not uniformly sensitive to change over the course of the disease. The annualized rate of decline in the placebo patients participating in donepezil trials was approximately 2 to 4 points per year.

### Clinical trials for disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer's disease: A primer, lessons learned, and a blueprint for the future [^111zLPkn]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

- **Overview**: Figure 1 shows the overview of an AD treatment discovery and development program beginning with the identification of a target and proceeding through preclinical (sometimes called non-clinical) characterization; to Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III clinical trials; and to regulatory review and patient access through marketing. On average, development for an AD treatment requires 13 years and is expected to cost $5.6 billion U.S. dollars. Preclinical evaluation requires approximately 2 years, Phase I averages 2.8 months, Phase II requires 27.7 months, Phase III is typically 50.9 months, and FDA review requires 18 months. These figures are for AD drugs of all types and likely underestimate the time taken to develop an AD DMT.

- **Drug development process**: The biography of new agents can be divided into discovery phases extending from the first characterization of the compound to the final optimization of the lead candidate and development extending from preclinical/animal testing to Phase I First-in-Human (FIH) studies through Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review and to Phase IV for those agents undergoing post-approval assessment.

### Phase 3 solanezumab trials: Secondary outcomes in mild Alzheimer's disease patients [^114AabX7]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2016). Low credibility.

EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2 were identically designed, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies assessing the effects of solanezumab, an antiamyloid monoclonal antibody that binds soluble amyloid-β peptide, on cognitive and functional decline over 80 weeks in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Primary findings for both studies have been published.

- **Methods**: Secondary analyses of efficacy, biomarker, and safety endpoints in the pooled (EXPEDITION + EXPEDITION2) mild AD population were performed.

- **Results**: In the mild AD population, less cognitive and functional decline was observed with solanezumab (n = 659) versus placebo (n = 663), as measured by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living functional scale Instrumental ADLs. Baseline-to-endpoint changes did not differ between treatment groups for Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living functional scale, basic items of the ADCS-ADL, and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes. Plasma/cerebrospinal fluid biomarker findings indicated target engagement by solanezumab. Solanezumab demonstrated acceptable safety. Efficacy findings for the moderate AD population are also provided.

- **Discussion**: These findings describe solanezumab's effects on efficacy and safety measures in a mild AD population. Another phase 3 study, EXPEDITION3, will investigate solanezumab's effects in a mild AD population.

### Science disconnected: The translational gap between basic science, clinical trials, and patient care in Alzheimer's disease [^114YfZym]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2022). Low credibility.

Both research and clinical practice have traditionally centered on the dementia syndrome of Alzheimer's disease rather than its preclinical and prodromal stages. However, there is a strong scientific and ethical impetus to shift focus to earlier disease stages to improve brain health outcomes and help to keep affected individuals symptom-free (dementia-free) for as long as possible. We provide an overview of recent advancements in early detection, drug development, and trial methodology that should be utilized in the development of new therapies for use in brain health clinics.

- **Triad approach to Alzheimer's disease clinical trials**: We propose a triad approach, encompassing (1) experimental medicine studies to gather greater knowledge of disease mechanisms, (2) a more comprehensive platform of phase 2 learning trials to inform phase 3 confirmatory trials, and (3) precision medicine involving smaller subgroups of patients with shared characteristics. This triad would ensure that treatment targets are identified accurately, trial methodology focuses on at-risk populations, and sensitive outcome measures capture potential treatment effects.

Clinical services around the world must embrace the brain health clinic model so that neurodegenerative diseases can be detected in their earliest phase to quicken drug development pipelines and potentially improve prognosis.

### Clinical trials for disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer's disease: A primer, lessons learned, and a blueprint for the future [^111iRCZy]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that produces a gradual decline in cognition and function. The most common form, late-onset AD, becomes symptomatic in late life. However, biomarker studies show that the amyloid protein, considered the major risk factor for the disease, begins to accumulate in the brain up to 20 years before symptoms start.

The total number of individuals with AD will double every 20 years. The annual cost of AD currently exceeds $230 billion, and the total annual cost will exceed $1 trillion by 2050 if means of preventing, delaying, slowing the progression, or improving the symptoms are not found.

There is a high rate of negative clinical trials in AD drug development programs; 99% of drugs tested between 2002 and 2014 showed no drug-placebo difference, and only one drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during that period. Drugs in the AD pipeline include agents intended to intervene in the basic biology of AD and modify disease progression, symptomatic cognitive enhancers, and drugs to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The greatest need in AD drug development is for disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) that will delay or slow the clinical course of AD by intervening in the processes leading to cell death. Approximately two-thirds of the AD drug development pipeline involves DMTs, either immunotherapies or small molecule agents administered orally. In this paper, we describe the methods for AD clinical trials of DMTs and review past failures to identify lessons for AD drug development.

### Are γ-secretase inhibitors detrimental for Alzheimer's disease patients [^114pjbMC]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2010). Low credibility.

The recent failure of semagacestat in two large Phase III studies questions the value of γ-secretase inhibitors in treating Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the reasons for this setback may be important for future research on effective treatments for this devastating disease.

### A tough trek in the development of an anti-amyloid therapy for Alzheimer's disease: Do we see hope in the distance [^111gPeHk]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Low credibility.

The search for a clinically effective therapy for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been long and arduous. In some circles, the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the human monoclonal antibody, Aducanumab, was viewed as a welcome advance. However, the administrative decision, in the face of a negative review by the members of the FDA neurology advisory board, raised many questions concerning its appropriateness. In response, the FDA has modified the conditions under which the drug should be administered.

Currently, the etiology of AD remains unknown. Thus, application of therapies based on the still controversial amyloid hypothesis deserves critical scrutiny. While successful animal studies based on the hypothesis have stimulated many clinical trials in humans, none of these have shown statistically clinical benefit, raising questions regarding the intrinsic validity of the hypothesis itself. However, each successive trial has benefited from the experiences of those which preceded it. Given these caveats, the relevance of an apparent beneficial response in a subset of Aducanumab-treated study participants must be weighed carefully.

There are competing hypotheses regarding the etiology and pathophysiology responsible for the development of AD, including tau protein aggregation, acetylcholine deficiency, and neuroinflammation, among others, all of which remain controversial. Nonetheless, the newly approved agent, Aducanumab, did show some subtle benefit in some mild AD patients. Understanding the hypotheses and controversies may help better evaluate the potential of Aducanumab in treating Alzheimer's disease.

### New treatments in Alzheimer's disease [^1125TM4M]. Journal of Neurology (2018). High credibility.

The three papers reviewed in this journal club represent large, well-constructed, randomized controlled trials examining new and promising treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Despite significant pre-clinical and clinical evidence supporting their suitability for treating Alzheimer's disease, all three treatments failed to reach their primary outcomes. Although this outcome is disappointing for researchers and patients, it is important that lessons are learned from these 'negative' results, particularly in the evolution of trial design in this discipline. The presentation of methodology and evidence in high-impact journals is a refreshing development.

Several potential reasons could explain why these treatments did not demonstrate significant clinical effects. The most important reason might be that participants were too far into their disease course to benefit from the treatments by the time they started the trials. This suggests that targeting preventative treatments at a population level might be a more sensible approach. Despite this, efforts to develop a disease-modifying treatment remain a priority for healthcare providers worldwide. An effective intervention would have the potential to transform the lives of millions of people with Alzheimer's disease, along with their carers who are profoundly affected by the debilitating consequences of this condition.

### Current challenges for the successful treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease: Treating the pathologies of the disease to change its clinical course [^116RFgTm]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2008). Low credibility.

The need to develop meaningful therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease is beginning to reach the general awareness of the public. Matching this awareness is the accelerated pace of compounds entering clinical trials. In addition, the development of diagnostic tools, biomarkers, and imaging modalities over the past decade in Alzheimer's disease has improved dramatically. Unfortunately, the use of these diagnostic and scientific tools in clinical trial practice has not yet aligned or optimized. Most agents still target clinical endpoints associated with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease rather than focusing on the modulation of the underlying pathologies.

Although there are obvious practical reasons for this, meaningful progress in other areas of medicine, such as cardiology and oncology, has generally targeted and monitored improvement or abatement of pathology as the primary endpoint in a successful disease-modifying strategy. Perhaps it is time to consider a similar approach in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

### Pharmacological interventions for cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome [^111fEoBk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

People with Down syndrome are vulnerable to developing dementia at an earlier age than the general population. Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome can place a significant burden on both the person with Down syndrome and their family and carers. Various pharmacological interventions, including donepezil, galantamine, memantine, and rivastigmine, appear to have some effect in treating cognitive decline in people without Down syndrome, but their effectiveness for those with Down syndrome remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of anti-dementia pharmacological interventions and nutritional supplements for treating cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome.

- **Search methods**: In January 2015, we searched CENTRAL, ALOIS (the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, seven other databases, and two trials registers. In addition, we checked the references of relevant reviews and studies and contacted study authors, other researchers, and relevant drug manufacturers to identify additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of anti-dementia pharmacological interventions or nutritional supplements for adults (aged 18 years and older) with Down syndrome, in which treatment was administered and compared with either placebo or no treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in included trials and extracted the relevant data. Review authors contacted study authors to obtain additional information.
