## Question

Qual a dose profilática de cymevir para transplante renal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prophylactic dose of "cymevir" for kidney transplant recipients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "cymevir" refers to and confirm the correct drug name. Then, I should verify the standard adult prophylactic dose and duration for kidney transplant recipients. Next, I will check renal function–based dose adjustments, including Cockcroft-Gault versus CKD-EPI considerations. After that, I should review pediatric dosing. Finally, I will consider alternatives like letermovir and summarize practical implementation points with monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity, because "cymevir" does not map to a known agent in the provided sources. Wait, let me verify the context and likely intended name: given the CMV prophylaxis question and the prominence of valganciclovir in kidney transplantation, the user almost certainly means valganciclovir, which is consistently used for CMV prevention after renal transplant in the cited guidelines and trials [^1ca50f71] [^ecdee589] [^09e4e16a].

> I will now examine the standard adult prophylactic dose. For adult kidney transplant recipients, the FDA-labeled prophylactic dose is 900 mg orally once daily, started within 10 days of transplantation and continued for 200 days, which is supported by randomized data showing superiority of 200 days versus 100 days in high-risk D+/R− patients [^1ca50f71] [^ecdee589] [^09e4e16a] [^5c40dac8] [^85ab4052].

> Hold on, I should verify renal function adjustments because underdosing is a common pitfall. The FDA labeling provides explicit dose reductions based on creatinine clearance calculated by Cockcroft-Gault: for CrCl ≥ 60 mL/min, 900 mg daily. For CrCl 40–59 mL/min, 450 mg daily. For CrCl 25–39 mL/min, 450 mg every 48 hours. For CrCl 10–24 mL/min, 450 mg twice weekly. For CrCl < 10 mL/min, 450 mg no more than three times weekly, with close hematologic monitoring [^1ca50f71] [^ecdee589] [^09e4e16a] [^77ed4e0d] [^e3a9d562] [^042f0218] [^f3d675d6].

> Wait, let me verify the formula issue, because using CKD-EPI instead of Cockcroft-Gault can lead to underdosing. Multiple real-world studies show that underdosing valganciclovir — often due to relying on eGFR rather than Cockcroft-Gault — is associated with breakthrough CMV DNAemia. I should double-check that the label indeed specifies Cockcroft-Gault for dose adjustments, which it does, and emphasize that centers should recalculate at each visit as renal function changes post-transplant [^e5611c18] [^5d369087] [^9ceaf1cc] [^f462f0d8] [^bbdc62b7].

> Next, I should review pediatric dosing. For children 4 months to 16 years, the dose is calculated as 7 × body surface area × creatinine clearance using the modified Schwartz equation, with a hard cap of 900 mg daily. Dosing starts within 10 days and continues for 200 days in kidney transplant recipients, with regular renal function monitoring and dose recalculation as height and creatinine change [^d164b12d] [^0297d84b].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk and cannot tolerate valganciclovir myelosuppression. I need to check alternatives. Letermovir 480 mg orally or intravenously once daily for 200 days is noninferior to valganciclovir in D+/R− kidney transplant recipients and is associated with significantly less leukopenia/neutropenia; dose reduction to 240 mg daily is required if coadministered with cyclosporine, and acyclovir is typically added for HSV/VZV coverage [^f391ab22] [^03ee84c2] [^30d36627] [^32ea6639].

> I should confirm practical implementation details. Tablets should be taken with food to optimize absorption, and complete blood counts should be monitored frequently, especially during dose changes or if cytopenias occur. Given the high frequency of renal function fluctuations early after transplant, proactive dose recalculation at each visit is essential to avoid underdosing and breakthrough viremia [^1ca50f71] [^ecdee589] [^09e4e16a] [^e5611c18].

> Let me reconsider the original question to ensure completeness. The prophylactic "cymevir" dose for kidney transplant recipients is valganciclovir 900 mg orally once daily for 200 days, with renal function–based dose adjustments using Cockcroft-Gault: 450 mg daily if CrCl 40–59 mL/min, 450 mg every 48 hours if CrCl 25–39 mL/min, 450 mg twice weekly if CrCl 10–24 mL/min, and 450 mg no more than three times weekly if CrCl < 10 mL/min, with pediatric dosing calculated as 7 × BSA × CrCl capped at 900 mg daily and letermovir as an alternative in high-risk patients who cannot tolerate valganciclovir [^1ca50f71] [^ecdee589] [^09e4e16a] [^77ed4e0d] [^e3a9d562] [^042f0218] [^f3d675d6] [^d164b12d] [^f391ab22].

---

A dose profilática de **valganciclovir (Cymevene)** para transplante renal é de **900 mg por via oral, uma vez ao dia**, iniciada dentro de 10 dias após o transplante e continuada por 200 dias para pacientes de alto risco (D+/R−) [^1ca50f71] [^ecdee589] [^09e4e16a]. Para pacientes com função renal reduzida, a dose deve ser ajustada conforme a creatinina clearance: 450 mg dia sim, dia não para CrCl 25–39 mL/min; 450 mg duas vezes por semana para CrCl 10–24 mL/min; e 450 mg até três vezes por semana para CrCl < 10 mL/min [^77ed4e0d] [^e3a9d562] [^042f0218] [^f3d675d6]. A monitoração regular da função renal e hemograma é essencial para evitar toxicidade e garantir eficácia [^f9b33169].

## Dose padrão para profilaxia de CMV em transplante renal

A dose padrão de valganciclovir para profilaxia de CMV em receptores de transplante renal é **900 mg por via oral, uma vez ao dia** [^1ca50f71] [^ecdee589] [^09e4e16a]. Este regime deve ser iniciado dentro de 10 dias após o transplante e continuado por um período de 200 dias para pacientes de alto risco (D+/R−) [^5c40dac8] [^85ab4052]. Para pacientes de risco intermediário (D+/R+ ou D−/R+), a duração da profilaxia geralmente é de 100 dias [^notfound].

---

## Ajuste de dose baseado na função renal

A função renal é um fator crítico na determinação da dose de valganciclovir, pois o fármaco é eliminado principalmente pelos rins [^ccae7041]. A Tabela 1 resume os ajustes de dose recomendados com base na creatinina clearance (CrCl):

| **Creatinina clearance (crcl)** | **Dose recomendada** |
|-|-|
| ≥ 60 mL/min | 900 mg uma vez ao dia |
| 40–59 mL/min | 450 mg uma vez ao dia |
| 25–39 mL/min | 450 mg a cada 48 horas |
| 10–24 mL/min | 450 mg duas vezes por semana |
| < 10 mL/min | 450 mg até três vezes por semana |

---

Esses ajustes são essenciais para **evitar a acumulação do fármaco** e a toxicidade associada, como neutropenia e anemia [^f9b33169].

---

## Monitoramento e cuidados clínicos

Durante a profilaxia com valganciclovir, é fundamental **monitorar regularmente**:

- **Função renal**: A creatinina sérica deve ser monitorada regularmente, especialmente em pacientes com função renal instável ou em uso de medicamentos nefrotóxicos [^0dfed155].
- **Hemograma**: A monitoração regular do hemograma é necessária para detectar neutropenia ou anemia induzidas pelo fármaco [^f9b33169].
- **Adesão ao tratamento**: A adesão ao tratamento é crucial para a eficácia da profilaxia e para prevenir infecções por CMV [^d11006b3].

---

## Eficácia e segurança do valganciclovir

Estudos clínicos demonstram que a profilaxia com valganciclovir **significativamente reduz a incidência de doença por CMV** em receptores de transplante renal [^e1cb6e1b]. No entanto, o fármaco está associado a efeitos adversos significativos, principalmente neutropenia e anemia, o que requer monitoramento cuidadoso e ajustes de dose conforme necessário [^f9b33169].

---

## Alternativas ao valganciclovir

Em casos de intolerância ao valganciclovir ou de risco elevado de toxicidade, o **letermovir** é uma alternativa eficaz para profilaxia de CMV em receptores de transplante renal de alto risco [^f391ab22]. O letermovir tem a vantagem de não causar neutropenia significativa, mas requer monitoramento cuidadoso devido a interações medicamentosas [^c81324a6].

---

A dose profilática de valganciclovir para transplante renal é **900 mg por via oral, uma vez ao dia**, com ajustes baseados na função renal. A monitorização regular da função renal e do hemograma é essencial para garantir a segurança e eficácia do tratamento.

### Adverse neuropsychiatric effects of cytomegalovirus prophylaxis with valaciclovir in renal transplant recipients [^69a3f209]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Valaciclovir (VACV) has been reported to induce adverse neuropsychiatric effects (ANE), especially in patients with renal failure, but few data are available for renal transplant recipients (RTR).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study in RTR given VACV as cytomegalovirus prophylaxis, from January 1999 to December 2000, to define the incidence rate, type and outcome of VACV-induced ANE, and to identify risk factors for ANE. The VACV-induced ANE were defined as neuropsychiatric disorders justifying VACV dose reduction or withdrawal. Patients with and without VACV-induced ANE were compared by univariate and multivariate analysis.

Results

In all, 167 RTR were included, of whom 25 (15%) displayed VACV-induced ANE (mainly hallucinations and confusion), which occurred with a mean of 4 days after the start of VACV. ANE were reversible in all cases. Multivariate analysis showed that delayed graft function (DGF) was the main risk factor for VACV-induced ANE [Odds ratio (OR): 12.1; 95% CI = 3.4–43.4; P = 0.0001]. All VACV doses given to patients with ANE were in accordance with the current recommended adaptation to estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Conclusion

In RTR, VACV-induced ANE are significantly frequent but reversible. DGF occurrence is the main risk factor for these ANE. In RTR with DGF, the recommended doses for GFR below 10 ml/min might be too high. Several strategies, in RTR with DGF, might lower the risk of ANE, including reduction of the currently recommended VACV dosage, delayed VACV introduction until improvement of renal function, or use of another anti-cytomegalovirus drug.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline in post-operative care in the kidney transplant recipient [^47f6c117]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

CMV infection is the most common serious viral infection affecting renal transplant recipients. It occurs most commonly in CMV naïve recipients of a kidney from a CMV positive donor. However, seropositive transplant recipients may be affected by reactivation of CMV infection and by primary infection with a new genotype. CMV infection is associated with more intensive immunosuppression, treatment of acute rejection episodes and the use of TDAs. For CMV disease there is clear evidence that prophylaxis reduces the severity, delays the onset and prevents CMV infection in CMV negative recipients of CMV positive kidneys. CMV infection is also associated with concomitant infection by other herpes viruses, the significance of which is uncertain but prevention of which may be an added benefit of prophylaxis over pre-emptive strategies. CMV prophylaxis is therefore recommended in CMV negative KTRs from a CMV positive donor (D+/R-), and for seropositive KTRs (D-/R+ or D+/R+) exposed to more intensive immunosuppression, in particular TDAs.

In CMV negative recipients of a CMV positive kidney the use of oral antiviral therapy – specifically valaciclovir, aciclovir, ganciclovir, or valganciclovir – is proven to delay the onset of CMV disease, to prevent CMV disease in a proportion of patients, and to limit the severity of disease. It is important to recognise that a proportion of patients will develop CMV disease after stopping prophylaxis and will require clinical and virological monitoring for at least 3 months following the stopping of prophylactic therapy. At present, evidence exists for the use of valaciclovir and valganciclovir. In clinical practice, valaciclovir is not widely available or used, and valganciclovir is the agent of choice. The dose of valganciclovir should be adjusted according to renal transplant function. Most commonly, and based on the available evidence, antiviral prophylaxis is usually continued for 90–180 days following transplantation (depending on D and R status). The rationale is that reduction of immunosuppressive therapy over this period will allow the immune system to combat viral replication once prophylactic therapy is withdrawn.

Treatment of CMV disease is equally effective with either oral valganciclovir or intravenous ganciclovir. However, this study excluded patients with life-threatening CMV infection and it is probably advisable to initiate treatment with intravenous therapy in such circumstances.

Guidelines

A. Careful long-term monitoring of graft recipients is mandatory to discover signs of immunosuppressive drug toxicity, in particular nephrotoxicity. B. In the case of a discrepancy between the drug dose and signs of toxicity, then a thorough pharmacokinetic analysis should be performed. C. Cardiovascular, renal and metabolic risks and the risk of de novo malignancy must be considered in a long-term monitoring programme.

### Valganciclovir underdosing is associated with cytomegalovirus DNAemia during universal prophylaxis: a real-life case control retrospective study [^e5611c18]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Patients and Methods

2.1 Institutional Protocols

Immunosuppressive and prophylactic treatments, as well as clinical, biological, and virological follow‐ups, were standardized throughout the study, in accordance with the usual practices of the Centre de Néphrologie et Transplantation Rénale in Marseille University Hospital. Immunosuppression comprised both induction and maintenance treatment consisting of triple therapy with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), antimetabolite, and prednisone. All KTR received anti‐pneumocystosis prophylaxis at least 6 months after KT. Except for D−/R− patients, every KTR received VGCV prophylaxis, starting within the first week after KT. Prophylaxis duration was 3 months in R+ (intermediate risk) and 6 months in D+/R− (high risk) KTR. In accordance with the manufacturer's protocol and international guidelines, the initial dosage of prophylactic treatment with VGCV and at each follow‐up visit was to be adjusted to the estimated creatinine clearance calculated using the Cockcroft–Gault (CG) formula, while the hospital laboratory provided the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD EPI) equation. The maximum prophylactic dose for patients with an estimated creatinine clearance of 60 mL/min or greater was 900 mg daily.

### Antiviral medications for preventing cytomegalovirus disease in solid organ transplant recipients [^69b58aa4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in solid organ transplant recipients has resulted in the frequent use of prophylaxis with the aim of preventing the clinical syndrome associated with CMV infection. This is an update of a review first published in 2005 and updated in 2008.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of antiviral medications to prevent CMV disease and all-cause mortality in solid organ transplant recipients.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library to February 2004 for the first version of this review. The Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register was searched to February 2007 and to July 2011 for the first and current updates of the review without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing antiviral medications with placebo or no treatment, comparing different antiviral medications and comparing different regimens of the same antiviral medications in recipients of any solid organ transplant. Studies examining pre-emptive therapy were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. Results were reported as risk ratios (RR) or risk differences (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and by mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model. Subgroup analysis and univariate meta-regression were performed using restricted maximum-likelihood to estimate the between study variance. Multivariate meta-regression was performed to investigate whether the results were altered after allowing for differences in drugs used, organ transplanted, and recipient CMV serostatus at the time of transplantation.

Main Results

We identified 37 studies (4342 participants). Risk of bias attributes were poorly performed or reported with low risk of bias reported for sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and selective outcome reporting in 25% or fewer studies. Prophylaxis with aciclovir, ganciclovir or valaciclovir compared with placebo or no treatment significantly reduced the risk for CMV disease (19 studies; RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.52), CMV infection (17 studies; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.77), and all-cause mortality (17 studies; RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.92) primarily due to reduced mortality from CMV disease (7 studies; RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.78). Prophylaxis reduced the risk of herpes simplex and herpes zoster disease, bacterial and protozoal infections but not fungal infection, acute rejection or graft loss. Meta-regression showed no significant difference in the relative benefit of treatment (risk of CMV disease or all-cause mortality) by organ transplanted or CMV serostatus; no conclusions were possible for CMV negative recipients of negative organs. Neurological dysfunction was more common with ganciclovir and valaciclovir compared with placebo/no treatment. In direct comparison studies, ganciclovir was more effective than aciclovir in preventing CMV disease (7 studies; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.60) and leucopenia was more common with aciclovir. Valganciclovir and IV ganciclovir were as effective as oral ganciclovir. The efficacy and adverse effects of valganciclovir/ganciclovir did not differ from valaciclovir in three small studies. Extended duration prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of CMV disease compared with three months therapy (2 studies; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.35). Leucopenia was more common with extended duration prophylaxis but severe treatment associated adverse effects did not differ between extended and three month durations of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylaxis with antiviral medications reduces CMV disease and CMV-associated mortality in solid organ transplant recipients. These data suggest that antiviral prophylaxis should be used routinely in CMV positive recipients and in CMV negative recipients of CMV positive organ transplants.

### Randomized trial of valganciclovir versus valacyclovir prophylaxis for prevention of cytomegalovirus in renal transplantation [^fff1c0de]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Both valganciclovir and high-dose valacyclovir are recommended for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis after renal transplantation. A head-to-head comparison of both regimens is lacking. The objective of the study was to compare valacyclovir prophylaxis with valganciclovir, which constituted the control group.

Design, Settings, Participants, & Measurements

In a randomized, open-label, single-center trial, recipients of renal transplants (recipient or donor cytomegalovirus-seropositive) were randomly allocated (1:1) to 3-month prophylaxis with valacyclovir (2 g four times daily) or valganciclovir (900 mg daily). Enrollment occurred from November of 2007 to April of 2012. The primary end points were cytomegalovirus DNAemia and biopsy-proven acute rejection at 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Results

In total, 119 patients were assigned to valacyclovir (n = 59) or valganciclovir prophylaxis (n = 60). Cytomegalovirus DNAemia developed in 24 (43%) of 59 patients in the valacyclovir group and 18 (31%) of 60 patients in the valganciclovir group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.71 to 2.54; P = 0.36). The incidence of cytomegalovirus disease was 2% with valacyclovir and 5% with valganciclovir prophylaxis (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.01 to 5.90; P = 0.36). Significantly more patients with valacyclovir prophylaxis developed biopsy-proven acute rejection (18 of 59 [31%] versus 10 of 60 [17%]; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 5.65; P = 0.03). The incidence of polyomavirus viremia was higher in the valganciclovir group (18% versus 36%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.96; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Valganciclovir shows no superior efficacy in cytomegalovirus DNAemia prevention compared with valacyclovir prophylaxis. However, the risk of biopsy-proven acute rejection is higher with valacyclovir.

### Valganciclovir underdosing is associated with cytomegalovirus DNAemia during universal prophylaxis: a real-life case control retrospective study [^eb74c942]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study raises, as most studies do, the issue of VGCV dosage as key to inefficient prevention of CMV infection/diseases as a result of underdosing related to the use of kidney function assessment formulas other than CG, or as a result of not giving the maximal dose of VGCV (900 mg/day) for whatever reason. On the contrary, few studies have reported that VGCV underdosing has no impact on infections, but the conditions for monitoring PCR and renal function were less stringent than in our study. Some centers using VGCV low‐dose prophylaxis in the hope of improving tolerability showed similar CMV outcomes. However, the most recent international guidelines advise against "mini‐dosing" because these studies were not powered to show different outcomes.

The constraint of adjusting the VGCV dosage to renal function, compared with the easiest use of letermovir that does not need it, may have contributed to the results of a randomized noninferiority, Phase 3 trial comparing letermovir and VGCV among adult CMV‐seronegative KTR who received an organ from a CMV‐seropositive donor. No participants who received letermovir versus five participants (1.7%) who received VGCV developed CMV disease through week 28. The latest consensus conferences for the management of CMV infections in solid organ transplantation recommend the use of creatinine clearance estimated by the CG equation for dose adjustment of VGCV to kidney function. To ensure that the VGCV dosage is systematically adjusted at each visit, an automatic calculation program for estimated creatinine clearance could be easily achieved in the post‐transplant follow‐up form.

Background

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains an important pathogen in transplant patients, and valacyclovir (VACV) prophylaxis 8 g/day has been used in high-risk CMV-seromismatched [D+/R-] renal transplant patients to decrease CMV disease. Neurotoxic adverse effects have limited its use, and the aim of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate low-dose VACV prophylaxis, 3 g/day for 90 days after transplantation, in 102 D+/R- renal transplant patients.

Methods

We compared patient and graft survival rates up to 5 years after transplantation with the data from the Collaborative Transplant Study Group (CTS) database. The incidence of CMV disease, rejection and neurotoxic adverse effects was analyzed up to 1 year after transplantation.

Results

The patient and graft survival rates up to 5 years were comparable with those derived from the CTS. CMV disease was diagnosed in 25% of the patients and 2% developed tissue-invasive CMV disease. The rejection frequency was 22% and neurotoxic adverse effects were seen in 2% of the patients.

Conclusions

Low-dose VACV prophylaxis (3 g/day) for 90 days post-transplantation results in high patient and graft survival rates and reduces the incidence of CMV disease. Neurotoxic adverse effects are minimal. We believe that low-dose VACV prophylaxis should be considered to form one of the arms in future prospective comparison studies for the prevention of CMV disease in the high-risk D+/R- population of renal transplant patients.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline in post-operative care in the kidney transplant recipient [^836e59bc]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 8.3 – KTR: Epstein Barr virus infection

Guideline 8.3.1 – KTR: EBV infection

We recommend that immunosuppression should be reduced or stopped following the development of PTLD (1C)

Guideline 8.3.2 – KTR: EBV infection

We suggest:
Both donor and recipient should have their EBV serology recorded at the time of transplantation (2D)
All high risk (D+/R-) patients (including adults) should have EBV viral load measured immediately after transplantation, monthly for 6 months, and 3 monthly to 1 year (2C)
EBV viral load should be monitored after the treatment of rejection (2C)
Total immunosuppression should be reduced when EBV titres rise significantly (2C)

Audit Measures

Rates of EBV infection and PTLD amongst KTRs
Completeness of records for EBV donor and recipient serology

Rationale

After transplantation, primary EBV infection may present with a broad spectrum of disorders ranging from asymptomatic infection to high grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (PTLD). EBV seronegative KTRs, undergoing seroconversion post transplant, are up to 50 times more likely to develop PTLD compared to their seropositive counterparts. The EBV genome is found in more than 90% of PTLD occurring during the first year after transplantation. Vigilance is therefore essential, especially since EBV viraemia usually precedes the development of PTLD by 4–16 weeks. However, assays for EBV viral load can often be positive in asymptomatic patients (false positives) and so clinical correlation and attention to changes in viral load are essential. Risk factors for early PTLD include primary EBV infection, young donor age, CMV infection, and induction with TDAs. The use of antiviral agents (e.g. valaciclovir or valganciclovir) or immunoglobulins in response to rising viral loads is unproven and cannot be recommended. Since the immune response to EBV infected tissue is thought to depend on EBV-specific T cell responses it is logical to reduce immunosuppressive treatment in the face of clinical EBV infections and PTLD.

### Varicella infections in patients with end stage renal disease: a systematic review [^0b50feae]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

In addition to the database search, we also searched specifically for guidelines on varicella vaccinations. As for recommendations for varicella vaccination in this group of patients; only a handful recommendations from published guidelines were found. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP); Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recommended varicella vaccine for ESRD patients, who meet age criteria and who do not have contraindications to vaccine.

The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons recommended pre-transplantation VZV serology checking. Seronegative adults should receive one dose of varicella vaccine with serologic testing post vaccination. If seroconversion does not occur, the dose may be repeated once if time permits.

Similarly, the Korean Vaccination Society has recommended varicella vaccination for the seronegative adults; and this should be completed at least one month before transplantation. The 2013 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for vaccination of the immunocompromised host advocated that varicella vaccine (VAR) should be given to immunocompetent patients without evidence of varicella immunity if it can be administered at least four weeks before initiating immunosuppressive therapy.

Both the US Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defence (2014) on their Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in Primary Care (strong recommendation); and Public Health Agency of Canada (in their Canadian Immunisation Guide 2016) have extended the recommendation to include patients with chronic kidney disease or chronic renal disease. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcome: Quality Improvement (KDOQI) have not specifically advocated for varicella vaccination post-transplant, the reason being varicella vaccine is a live-attenuated vaccine. At present, there is yet to be any recommendation by both KDIGO and KDOQI on pre-transplant vaccinations in general. While post-exposure prophylaxis with varicella immunoglobulin, and primary varicella treatment with acyclovir or valaciclovir has been recommended; they are still silent with regards to VZV immunisation as a preventive method.

Clinical implications

There is a lack of guidelines in the Asia Pacific Region on varicella vaccination in patients with ESRD. Since most patients with ESRD or advanced CKD are managed by renal physicians and family physicians; it is critical to advocate, initiate planning, followed by implementing policies on varicella vaccination among these susceptible patients. This is of increasing importance considering the increasing number of patients developing ESRD in Asia.

### Antiviral medications for preventing cytomegalovirus disease in solid organ transplant recipients [^e1cb6e1b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in solid organ transplant recipients has resulted in the frequent use of prophylaxis to prevent the clinical syndrome associated with CMV infection. This is an update of a review first published in 2005 and updated in 2008 and 2013.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of antiviral medications to prevent CMV disease and all-cause death in solid organ transplant recipients.

Search Methods

We contacted the information specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 5 February 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing antiviral medications with placebo or no treatment, comparing different antiviral medications or different regimens of the same antiviral medications for CMV prophylaxis in recipients of any solid organ transplant. Studies examining pre-emptive therapy for CMV infection are studied in a separate review and were excluded from this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

This 2024 update found four new studies, bringing the total number of included studies to 41 (5054 participants). The risk of bias was high or unclear across most studies, with a low risk of bias for sequence generation (12), allocation concealment (12), blinding (11) and selective outcome reporting (9) in fewer studies. There is high-certainty evidence that prophylaxis with aciclovir, ganciclovir or valaciclovir compared with placebo or no treatment is more effective in preventing CMV disease (19 studies: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.52), all-cause death (17 studies: RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.92), and CMV infection (17 studies: RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.77). There is moderate-certainty evidence that prophylaxis probably reduces death from CMV disease (7 studies: RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.78). Prophylaxis reduces the risk of herpes simplex and herpes zoster disease, bacterial and protozoal infections but probably makes little to no difference to fungal infection, acute rejection or graft loss. No apparent differences in adverse events with aciclovir, ganciclovir or valaciclovir compared with placebo or no treatment were found. There is high certainty evidence that ganciclovir, when compared with aciclovir, is more effective in preventing CMV disease (7 studies: RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.60). There may be little to no difference in any outcome between valganciclovir and IV ganciclovir compared with oral ganciclovir (low certainty evidence). The efficacy and adverse effects of valganciclovir or ganciclovir were probably no different to valaciclovir in three studies (moderate certainty evidence). There is moderate certainty evidence that extended duration prophylaxis probably reduces the risk of CMV disease compared with three months of therapy (2 studies: RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.35), with probably little to no difference in rates of adverse events. Low certainty evidence suggests that 450 mg/day valganciclovir compared with 900 mg/day valganciclovir results in little to no difference in all-cause death, CMV infection, acute rejection, and graft loss (no information on adverse events). Maribavir may increase CMV infection compared with ganciclovir (1 study: RR 1.34, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.65; moderate certainty evidence); however, little to no difference between the two treatments were found for CMV disease, all-cause death, acute rejection, and adverse events at six months (low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylaxis with antiviral medications reduces CMV disease and CMV-associated death, compared with placebo or no treatment, in solid organ transplant recipients. These data support the continued routine use of antiviral prophylaxis in CMV-positive recipients and CMV-negative recipients of CMV-positive organ transplants.

Donor and recipient CMV sero-positivity should be recorded at the time of transplantation (2D)
A written protocolised strategy based either on prophylaxis, or pre-emptive therapy, or both should be implemented (2D)
For the treatment of mild and moderate CMV disease, oral valganciclovir and intravenous ganciclovir are of equivalent efficacy (2C)
Treatment of life-threatening CMV disease should be initiated with intravenous ganciclovir (2D)
Treatment duration should be determined by monitoring viral load (2C)

Cytomegalovirus antivirals — management of acute kidney injury during therapy requires frequent dose adjustments for (val)ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir; acute renal impairment during pre-emptive CMV therapy within 100 days after HCT has been observed in 13% on (val)ganciclovir and 34% on foscarnet, and in resistant CMV a 51% incidence of renal dysfunction has been reported with foscarnet despite preventive measures such as IV hydration.

### Pharmacokinetics of low and maintenance dose valganciclovir in kidney transplant recipients [^344f3124]. American Journal of Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Valganciclovir is commonly used for cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis in renal transplant patients. A fixed dose of 900 mg daily is typically recommended, however, there has never been a formal pharmacokinetic study comparing various doses in renal transplant patients. We therefore compared the pharmacokinetic characteristics of intravenous ganciclovir (IV GCV) and oral ganciclovir (GCV) with two different doses of valganciclovir (VGCV) in an open-label crossover study. Ten adult kidney recipients participated in a four-phase crossover treatment schedule of IV GCV (2.5 mg/kg every 12 h), VGCV (900 mg daily), VGCV (450 mg daily) and oral GCV (1000 mg Q8 H). IV GCV and oral VGCV 900 mg daily achieved similar values for AUC(0–24) (median 60.63 vs. 62.86 microg/h/mL). Oral VGCV 450 mg achieved comparable AUC(0–24) values as oral GCV 1000 mg Q8 H (median AUC(0–24) 35.9 vs. 29.04 microg/h/mL). Oral VGCV 900 mg daily provided systemic GCV exposure similar to IV GCV and confirms PV 16 000 study results. Further, VGCV 450 mg daily provided comparable systemic exposure versus oral GCV. Due to its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, data herein suggest that VGCV can be used in the early post-kidney transplant period, and that 450 mg daily provides ample drug exposure for effective CMV prophylaxis in kidney transplant patients.

### Transplant centers' prophylaxis and monitoring strategies: a key determinant of current herpes and polyomavirus incidences-results from the DZIF kidney transplant cohort [^d11006b3]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite prophylaxis recommendations, 27% of our large multicenter cohort of kidney transplant recipients developed herpes or polyomavirus viremia to a level consistent with active infection within the first year after transplantation. Consistent with previous findings, CMV and BKV were the predominant agents, with the highest CMV-incidence observed in D+/R − recipients. In the KDIGO 2009 guidelines a CMV prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir or valganciclovir has been recommended for at least 3-months after transplantation, except when donor and recipients both have negative CMV serologies. In the present study, most recipients with post-prophylaxis viremia received a 3-month-regimen, suggesting effectiveness while administered. A 6-month-regimen reduced viremia incidence in D+/R − recipients by nearly 50%, consistent with the IMPACT trial, which showed that extending prophylaxis to 200 days significantly lowered CMV rates compared to 100 days, despite debates over the trial's design and execution. Although current guidelines as the recently published German S2k guideline „virus infection in organ transplantation" endorse extended prophylaxis for D+/R − recipients, adherence to these recommendations in clinical practice varies and factors such as an more individualized risk assessment, patient adherence are often overlooked.

A critical aspect influencing prophylaxis efficacy is the accuracy of antiviral dosing. Breakthrough viremias suggest potential underdosing due to renal function adjustments. While prescribing information recommends dosing based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula, clinical practice often defaults to CKD-EPI, increasing the risk of underdosing or overdosing, leading to inadequate viral suppression, resistance or heightened toxicity, such as leukopenia. In our cohort, valganciclovir nearly tripled the incidence of leukopenia. Leukopenia may lead to reduction of the immunosuppression followed by rejection episodes. Letermovir, a novel prophylactic agent offers fewer side effects but is costly, might delay CMV-specific immune reconstitution and lacks efficacy against other herpesviruses. In current clinical guidelines it is only recommended as an alternative to valganciclovir in D+/R − recipients.

opportunistic infections, graft failure, graft rejection, and mortality. In general, because of the increased morbidity and mortality associated with CMV disease in transplant recipients, preventing CMV disease is generally recognized as a better strategy than treating established CMV disease. Prophylactic therapy and preemptive therapy are the two. Currently, limited therapeutic options for treating or preventing CMV disease in transplant recipients are available. As of May 2020, only five drugs have received FDA approval for systemic use for treating or preventing CMV disease: letermovir, ganciclovir and its prodrug valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. Letermovir is approved for CMV prophylaxis in CMV. seropositive recipients of an allogeneic HSCT; ganciclovir and valganciclovir are approved for preventing CMV disease in transplant recipients and for treating CMV retinitis in immunocompromised patients, including patients with AIDS.

Foscarnet and cidofovir have. are combined at their individual EC50 values, and studies should include controls for cytotoxicity.

### Cytomegalovirus prophylaxis with valganciclovir in cytomegalovirus-seropositive kidney-transplant patients [^909757bd]. Journal of Medical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

The aims of this prospective, open-label, single-center pilot study were to assess the efficacy and safety of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) prophylaxis using valganciclovir in HCMV- seropositive kidney-transplant patients to prevent HCMV infection and disease. Fifty-one HCMV seropositive kidney-transplant patients recipients who received transplants between 1 December 2005 and 30 November 2006 were included in the study. Valganciclovir was given from transplantation up to 114 (37–329) days, and was adapted to renal function, i.e., 900 mg/d if calculated creatinine clearance was > 60 ml/min, or 450 mg/day if it was < 60 ml/min. HCMV DNAemia was assessed every 2 weeks during prophylaxis, and on the same basis for 3 months post-prophylaxis. Immunosuppression was based on calcineurin inhibitors (ciclosporine A = 22; tacrolimus = 11), with mycophenolate mofetil (n = 51), and low-dose steroids. Eighteen patients received no calcineurin-inhibitors, but Belatacept instead. During valganciclovir prophylaxis, asymptomatic HCMV DNAemia was observed in one patient, and no case of HCMV disease occurred. Within 252 days (45–425) post-valganciclovir prophylaxis, HCMV DNAemia was detected in 23.5% (n = 12) of patients, of whom two had two or more consecutive HCMV DNAemias. Valganciclovir prophylaxis in HCMV-seropositive kidney-transplant patients is effective for preventing cytomegalovirus disease.

Methods

Study design

We conducted an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study with two parallel study arms of adult renal transplant recipients in fourteen German centers (EudraCT-Nr: 2013-001770-19). The study was carried out in compliance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent and were allowed to withdraw from the study at any time. The safety population and the intention-to-treat population consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of a study drug and underwent successful renal transplantation. The per-protocol population was defined, including only patients who received treatment without severe protocol violations (see Supplementary Methods) throughout the study period.

Demographic and baseline data of the recipients and donors were assessed before transplantation including sero-status for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Documentation of clinical signs and laboratory data were obtained at baseline, day 6, and at months 1, 3, and 6.

Important to note that external monitoring was performed throughout the study period. An independent data safety monitoring board consisting of one statistician and two international transplant physicians evaluated overall study safety after inclusion of 40, 80, and 200 patients.

Randomization

Participants were centrally randomly assigned via a web-based randomization algorithm in a 1:1 ratio after signing informed consent before transplantation. The allocation list was computer-generated by block randomization with blocks of length four using nQuery-Advisor® 6.01 and stratified by trial site, living donation, and transplantation via European Senior Program (ESP). The randomization algorithm was incorporated in the electronic data management system and after obtaining informed consent the trial sites were allowed to request a patient's randomization result.

First-line agent and precautions for PET (FAQ6) — Oral valganciclovir or intravenous (IV) ganciclovir are recommended over foscarnet in most situations (B‑II), and because of ease of administration and clinical equivalence to IV ganciclovir, valganciclovir is often preferred. Valganciclovir is not recommended if barriers to oral administration or absorption or if on an orally-administered medication exist such as severe gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (D‑II). Neutropenia is a frequent complication of ganciclovir or valganciclovir therapy and should be managed by temporary cessation of therapy and consideration of G‑CSF; dose reductions during PET for neutropenia are generally not recommended unless criteria for change to maintenance dosing as described in FAQ7 are met (D‑III). Foscarnet is recommended as an alternative initial antiviral for pre‑engraftment CMV DNAemia or when valganciclovir/ganciclovir use may be undesirable such as early post‑engraftment, concomitant cytopenias, or patient intolerance (A‑I); renal function and electrolytes should be monitored frequently during foscarnet therapy. Cidofovir should be considered a third‑line agent due to a high incidence of renal toxicity and reports of variable efficacy (C‑II). Regardless of the agent, PET should start at induction dosing with dose adjustment as needed for renal dysfunction.

### Letermovir vs valganciclovir for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus in high-risk kidney transplant recipients: a randomized clinical trial [^f391ab22]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Valganciclovir for 200 days is standard care for cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis in high-risk CMV-seronegative kidney transplant recipients who receive an organ from a CMV-seropositive donor, but its use is limited by myelosuppression.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of letermovir with valganciclovir for prevention of CMV disease in CMV-seronegative kidney transplant recipients who receive an organ from a CMV-seropositive donor.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-masked, double-dummy, noninferiority, phase 3 trial in adult CMV-seronegative kidney transplant recipients who received an organ from a CMV-seropositive donor at 94 participating sites between May 2018 and April 2021 (final follow-up in April 2022).

Interventions

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by receipt of lymphocyte-depleting induction immunosuppression) to receive letermovir, 480 mg, orally daily (with acyclovir) or valganciclovir, 900 mg, orally daily (adjusted for kidney function) for up to 200 days after transplant, with matching placebos.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was CMV disease, confirmed by an independent masked adjudication committee, through posttransplant week 52 (prespecified noninferiority margin, 10%). CMV disease through week 28 and time to onset of CMV disease through week 52 were secondary outcomes. Exploratory outcomes included quantifiable CMV DNAemia and resistance. The rate of leukopenia or neutropenia through week 28 was a prespecified safety outcome.

Results

Among 601 participants randomized, 589 received at least 1 dose of the study drug (mean age, 49.6 years; 422 [71.6%] men). Letermovir (n = 289) was noninferior to valganciclovir (n = 297) for prevention of CMV disease through week 52 (10.4% vs 11.8% of participants with committee-confirmed CMV disease; stratum-adjusted difference -1.4% [95% CI, -6.5% to 3.8%]). No participants who received letermovir vs 5 participants (1.7%) who received valganciclovir developed CMV disease through week 28. Time to onset of CMV disease was comparable between the groups (hazard ratio, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.56–1.47]). Quantifiable CMV DNAemia was detected in 2.1% of participants in the letermovir group vs 8.8% in the valganciclovir group by week 28. Of participants evaluated for suspected CMV disease or CMV DNAemia, none (0/52) who received letermovir and 12.1% (8/66) who received valganciclovir had resistance-associated substitutions. The rate of leukopenia or neutropenia through week 28 was lower with letermovir vs valganciclovir (26% vs 64%; difference, -37.9% [95% CI, -45.1% to -30.3%]; P < .001). Fewer participants in the letermovir group than the valganciclovir group discontinued prophylaxis due to adverse events (4.1% vs 13.5%) or drug-related adverse events (2.7% vs 8.8%).

Conclusion and Relevance

Among adult CMV-seronegative kidney transplant recipients who received an organ from a CMV-seropositive donor, letermovir was noninferior to valganciclovir for prophylaxis of CMV disease over 52 weeks, with lower rates of leukopenia or neutropenia, supporting its use for this indication.

Our study shows safety and efficacy of DAAs in KTR. Based on the observed functional improvements there appears to be potential benefit for clinical outcomes. However, mostly because of improvement of liver function careful surveillance of immunosuppressive trough levels appears mandatory, as the necessity for dose adjustments is common. We recommend testing for RAVs prior to start of a specific DAAs regimen. As "second-line" DAAs for patients with previously failed DAAs therapy are nowadays available, there are also treatment options for non-responders and relapsers. Moreover, the acceptance of HCV positive donor organs for HCV negative transplant candidates is an option that deserves further studies.

To evaluate PREVYMIS prophylaxis as a preventive strategy for CMV disease in kidney transplant recipients, the efficacy of PREVYMIS was assessed in a multicenter, double-blind, active comparator-controlled non-inferiority Phase 3 trial (P002, NCT03443869) in adult kidney transplant recipients at high risk [D+/R-]. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive either PREVYMIS or valganciclovir. PREVYMIS was administered at a dose of 480 mg once daily (adjusted to 240 mg when co-administered with cyclosporine). PREVYMIS was given concomitantly with acyclovir. Valganciclovir was given concomitantly with a placebo to acyclovir. Randomization was stratified by the use or nonuse of highly cytolytic, anti-lymphocyte immunotherapy during induction. Study drug was initiated between Day 0 and Day 7 post-kidney transplant and continued through Week 28 (~200 days) post-transplant. Study drug was administered either orally or IV; the dose of PREVYMIS was the same regardless of the route of administration. Three subjects received IV PREVYMIS for a mean duration of 1.7 days. Subjects were monitored through Week 52 post-transplant.

### Valganciclovir underdosing is associated with cytomegalovirus DNAemia during universal prophylaxis: a real-life case control retrospective study [^5d369087]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Universal prophylaxis or a preemptive strategy with valganciclovir (VGCV) is recommended for prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections after kidney transplantation. We combined both strategies during the first 3 months post‐transplantation. The objectives were to define the incidence of CMV DNAemia and identify the associated factors during universal prophylaxis in a retrospective monocentric case‐control study. Cases presenting CMV DNAemia during the first 3 months post‐transplantation were matched to four controls each regarding sex, age, donor and recipient CMV serostatus, and induction treatment. We collected the rates of visits with VGCV underdosing, comparing the adjusted daily dosage to the kidney function and the received daily dosage. Despite prophylaxis, the incidence of CMV DNAemia was 5.1% between 2017 and 2020 in 300 patients. Rates of visits with VGCV underdosing during follow‐up were significantly higher in the cases group than in the controls group. In the cases group, the rate was higher when using estimated creatinine clearance rather than estimated glomerular filtration rate. VGCV underdosing was the only factor associated with CMV DNAemia in the multivariate analysis (OR: 1.04 95% CI: 1.011–1.061, p = 0.003), regardless of the formula used to estimate kidney function. Resistance to GCV was observed in 4 out of 15 cases, two of which had VGCV underdosing. In our study, CMV DNAemia was associated with VGCV underdosing that could be related to the absence of systematic adjustment during post‐transplantation follow‐up or to the use of inadequate kidney function assessment formulas to adjust VGCV dosages.

### Valganciclovir hydrochloride (valganciclovir) [^ccae7041]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Valganciclovir is an antiviral drug with activity against CMV [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Valganciclovir is a prodrug of ganciclovir. Valganciclovir Cmaxand AUC are approximately 1% and 3% of those of ganciclovir, respectively.

Pharmacokinetics in Adults: The pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir after administration of valganciclovir tablets have been evaluated in HIV- and CMV-seropositive patients, patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis, and in solid organ transplant patients (Table 10).

The systemic ganciclovir exposures attained following administration of 900 mg valganciclovir tablets once daily were comparable across kidney, heart, and liver transplant recipients (Table 11).

The pharmacokinetic parameters of ganciclovir following 200 days of valganciclovir administration in high-risk kidney transplant patients were similar to those in solid organ transplant patients who received valganciclovir for 100 days.

Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion

The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of valganciclovir are provided in Table 12.

Specific Populations:

Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir from a single oral dose of 900 mg valganciclovir tablets were evaluated in 24 otherwise healthy individuals with renal impairment. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir and increased terminal half-life (Table 13).

3.2 Factors Associated With CMV DNAemia Despite Prophylactic Treatment With VGCV

At the time of KT, the characteristics of patients, donors, and KT procedures were comparable between the two groups (Table 1). At the time of CMV DNAemia, the mean daily dosages of immunosuppressive drugs and trough concentrations of CNIs were not different between the two groups (Table 2). In the cases group, there were a total of 50 visits preceding the 15 DNAemias (3.3 ± 1.9 visits per case). The rate of visits with VGCV underdosing was significantly higher in the cases group than in the controls group, whatever the formula used to estimate kidney function (Table 2). Overdosing based on estimated creatinine clearance was also observed during 6% and 21% of visits preceding DNAemia, in cases and controls, respectively.

Table 2
Characteristics after kidney transplantation.

The creatinine clearance estimated by the CG formula at the time of DNAemia was higher, although not statistically, in the control group (50.6 mL/min) than in the cases group (41.2 mL/min) (OR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.93–1; p = 0.08]). We retrospectively analyzed the evolution of the estimated creatinine clearance between day 14 post‐KT in 13 cases and their controls that had not at that time presented DNAemia, and the day of CMV DNAemia (Table 2). We observed a worse renal function in the cases group compared to the controls group at day 14 (37.9 mL/min vs. 51.8 mL/min, p = 0.05) and an improvement of renal function in cases, on DNAemia day (41.3 vs. 50.6 mL/min, p = 0.08).

2.2 Study Design

All adult patients who received a KT between June 1, 2017 and June 1, 2020 in the Centre de Néphrologie et Transplantation Rénale in Marseille University Hospital, and who received anti‐CMV prophylaxis, were included in this retrospective single‐center case‐control study.

Patients presenting with CMV DNAemia during the first 3 months post‐KT despite VGCV prophylaxis were defined as cases. Each case was compared with four controls matched on sex, age, donor and recipient CMV IgG serostatus, and immunosuppressive induction treatment.

The data included in this study were anonymized, approved, and registered at the Health Data Portal of Assistance Publique — Hôpitaux de Marseille (PADS 21–62). The following were collected from medical records: donor‐related data (age, sex, CMV‐IgG serostatus, type of donor), and baseline patient‐related data (age, sex, nephropathy, diabetes, dialysis, previous KT, CMV‐IgG serostatus, anti‐HLA sensitization status, and calculated Panel Reactive Antibody [cPRA]). The immunosuppressive and anti‐infective treatments, cold ischemia time, delayed graft function (defined as the need for at least one dialysis session in the first week post‐KT), and number of HLA mismatches were recorded at the time of KT. After KT and at each visit, the following were noted: post‐transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM), daily dosages of prednisone and antimetabolites, CNI trough concentration, daily dosage of VGCV, and results of CMV PCRs. In the case of CMV DNAemia, CMV loads, presence of CMV disease, and elapsed times between the first DNAemia and preemptive or curative treatment onset were also recorded. If investigated, GCV resistance diagnosis was documented. Allograft loss and death were collected during the first year post‐KT.

### Valganciclovir dosing according to body surface area and renal function in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients [^da4a1cf4]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Oral valganciclovir is effective prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in adults receiving solid organ transplantation (SOT). However, data in pediatrics are limited. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of valganciclovir oral solution or tablets in 63 pediatric SOT recipients at risk of CMV disease, including 17 recipients ≤ 2 years old. Patients received up to 100 days' valganciclovir prophylaxis; dosage was calculated using the algorithm: dose (mg) = 7 x body surface area x creatinine clearance (Schwartz method; CrCLS). Ganciclovir pharmacokinetics were described using a population pharmacokinetic approach. Safety endpoints were measured up to week 26. Mean estimated ganciclovir exposures showed no clear relationship to either body size or renal function, indicating that the dosing algorithm adequately accounted for both these variables. Mean ganciclovir exposures, across age groups and organ recipient groups were: kidney 51.8 ± 11.9 microg * h/mL; liver 61.7 ± 29.5 microg * h/mL; heart 58.0 ± 21.8 microg * h/mL. Treatment was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that in adults. Seven serious treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in five patients. Two patients had CMV viremia during treatment but none experienced CMV disease. In conclusion, a valganciclovir-dosing algorithm that adjusted for body surface area and renal function provides ganciclovir exposures similar to those established as safe and effective in adults.

In the objective to analyze factors associated with DNAemia, we compared the received and the theoretical daily VGCV dosage in each case visit preceding the DNAemia and during an identical follow‐up period in the controls. We retrospectively calculated the estimated creatinine clearance by the CG formula, and the eGFR, indexed to body surface area (BSA) or not, using the 2009 CKD EPI equation, and then established the theoretical daily dosages of VGCV for each formula. At each visit, the effective dose received by the patient was categorized as "adjusted", "underdosed", or "overdosed" in comparison with the theoretical doses (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Period of analysis for valganciclovir dosing. The figure presents a case that had presented three negative CMV PCRs before detection of DNAemia after kidney transplant: We compared the received and the theoretical daily valganciclovir (VGCV) dosage in each case visit preceding the DNAemia and during an identical follow‐up period in the controls. We retrospectively calculated the estimated creatinine clearance by the Cockcroft–Gault formula, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate, indexed to body surface area or not, using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology equation, and then established the theoretical daily dosages of VGCV for each formula. At each visit, the effective dose received by the patient was categorized as "adjusted", "underdosed", or "overdosed" in comparison with the theoretical doses.

### Selective low-dose valganciclovir for prevention of cytomegalovirus disease following kidney transplantation [^da757453]. The Journal of Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the safety of a cytomegalovirus prophylaxis regimen using selective low-dose valganciclovir.

Methods

Retrospective before-after comparison, including consecutive kidney transplant recipients between 2002 and 2004. Excluded were deaths or graft loss within one month after transplantation. During the first period, universal prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir was used. During the second period, selective prophylaxis with low-dose valganciclovir (450 mg/day) was given to patients at high-risk for CMV disease (D+/R- recipients and patients treated with anti-lymphocyte antibodies) and oral acyclovir to all other patients. We compared the incidence of CMV disease between the two periods.

Results

Two hundred and sixty-four patients underwent kidney transplantation of which 221 were included. The incidence of CMV disease was higher with selective low-dose valganciclovir compared to universal ganciclovir without statistical significance, by intention to treat (4.7% vs. 8.5%, respectively, OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.63–5.60) and among patients adhering to the prophylaxis protocol (3.1% vs. 6.8% respectively, OR 2.85, 95% CI 0.65–12.38). Only late-onset CMV was observed for compliant patients. On multivariate analysis, only recipients' serostatus remained significantly associated with CMV disease (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.07–0.70).

Conclusions

Selective low-dose valganciclovir may provide similar protection against CMV when compared to universal oral ganciclovir. Prolongation of prophylaxis beyond 100 days should be explored.

### Efficacy and safety of new direct-acting antivirals in kidney transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis C: a single-center study [^f0df27c1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Currently, DAA combinations represent the standard therapeutic option for the treatment of all CHC subgroups, including those with renal dysfunction or KT. All current DAAs are eliminated mainly through the liver, except for sofosbuvir eliminated through the kidney and may be associated with an unfavorable safety profile in patients who have at least moderate-to-severe renal impairment. Thus, sofosbuvir — and consequently its co-formulations, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir — are not recommended for use in patients who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) lower than 30 mL/min, although in the very recently updated guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), a daily fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg) is considered as an option in this specific group of patients. On the other hand, caution is required regarding the potential drug-drug interactions between immunosuppressive agents and DAAs in the KT setting, since calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs: tacrolimus and cyclosporine) and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus) are substrates of cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein. In fact, some DAAs should not be used and some others should be used with caution in combination with specific immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. protease inhibitors with cyclosporine, given the elevations in cyclosporine concentrations). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of DAAs in KT recipients followed in a single center in Greece.

METHODS

Participants and Sampling

This phase 3 double-blind multicenter trial (protocol MK-8228-002) based on a randomized controlled design compared 28 weeks (up to 200 days) of CMV disease prophylaxis with letermovir vs valganciclovir in KTRs who were CMV D+R− through 52 weeks posttransplant. Complete details of the trial were reported by Limaye et al. Briefly, from May 2018 to April 2021, participants from 94 global sites were randomized 1:1 to letermovir (480 mg/d) or valganciclovir (900 mg/d), with stratification by receipt of lymphocyte-depleting induction immunosuppression. The letermovir group received acyclovir (400 mg twice daily) for prophylaxis of herpes simplex and varicella zoster virus and a placebo for valganciclovir. The valganciclovir group received placebos for letermovir and acyclovir. Discontinuation of prophylaxis for a lack of efficacy or adverse events was noted.

Protocol-defined dose modifications for valganciclovir and acyclovir were indicated according to creatinine clearance assessments (Cockcroft-Gault formula), as recommended in guidelines and prescribing information. Valganciclovir doses lower than recommended for prophylaxis or dose interruptions due to adverse events were documented. Participants who had ≥ 4 valganciclovir dose modifications due to changes in creatinine clearance during prophylaxis were noted, given an observation from another analysis that ≥ 4 modifications were associated with a higher rate of CMV DNAemia vs < 4 modifications [data on file].

Upon suspicion of CMV infection or disease based on clinical signs and symptoms or upon discontinuation of prophylaxis with the intent to start CMV treatment, investigators obtained plasma samples for analysis of CMV DNA at a central laboratory (Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan assay; lower limit of quantification, 137 IU/mL), although additional testing may have been performed at local laboratories for clinical decision making. CMV antiviral resistance and gB genotyping were also analyzed from the given plasma samples. Additional plasma samples were collected at 2 prespecified subsequent time points (next scheduled study visit and at week 52) and other time points based on the investigators' discretion. All investigator-reported cases of CMV disease were assessed by an external independent blinded clinical adjudication committee and confirmed per the diagnostic criteria specified by the CMV Drug Development Forum.

### Valganciclovir underdosing is associated with cytomegalovirus DNAemia during universal prophylaxis: a real-life case control retrospective study [^f462f0d8]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Universal prophylaxis or a preemptive strategy with valganciclovir (VGCV) is recommended for prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections after kidney transplantation. We combined both strategies during the first 3 months post-transplantation. The objectives were to define the incidence of CMV DNAemia and identify the associated factors during universal prophylaxis in a retrospective monocentric case-control study. Cases presenting CMV DNAemia during the first 3 months post-transplantation were matched to four controls each regarding sex, age, donor and recipient CMV serostatus, and induction treatment. We collected the rates of visits with VGCV underdosing, comparing the adjusted daily dosage to the kidney function and the received daily dosage. Despite prophylaxis, the incidence of CMV DNAemia was 5.1% between 2017 and 2020 in 300 patients. Rates of visits with VGCV underdosing during follow-up were significantly higher in the cases group than in the controls group. In the cases group, the rate was higher when using estimated creatinine clearance rather than estimated glomerular filtration rate. VGCV underdosing was the only factor associated with CMV DNAemia in the multivariate analysis (OR: 1.04 95% CI: 1.011–1.061, p = 0.003), regardless of the formula used to estimate kidney function. Resistance to GCV was observed in 4 out of 15 cases, two of which had VGCV underdosing. In our study, CMV DNAemia was associated with VGCV underdosing that could be related to the absence of systematic adjustment during post-transplantation follow-up or to the use of inadequate kidney function assessment formulas to adjust VGCV dosages.

### Valacyclovir or valganciclovir for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis: a randomized controlled trial in adult and pediatric kidney transplant recipients [^0028f49f]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Valganciclovir (valG), a cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylactic agent, has dose-limiting side effects. The tolerability and effectiveness of valacyclovir (valA) as CMV prophylaxis is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, open-label, single-center trial of valA versus valG for all posttransplant CMV prophylaxis in adult and pediatric kidney recipients. Participants were randomly assigned to receive valA or valG. Primary endpoints were the incidence of CMV viremia and side-effect related drug reduction with secondary assessment of incidence of EBV viremia.

Results

Of the 137 sequential kidney transplant recipients enrolled, 26% were positive and negative for CMV antibody in donor and recipient respectively. The incidence of CMV viremia (4 of 71 [6%]; 8 of 67 [12%] P = 0.23), time to viremia (P = 0.16) and area under CMV viral load time curve (P = 0.19) were not significantly different. ValG participants were significantly more likely to require side-effect related dose reduction (15/71 [21%] versus 1/66 [2%] P = 0.0003). Leukopenia was the most common reason for valG dose reduction and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor was utilized for leukopenia recovery more frequently (25% in valG vs 5% in valA: P = 0.0007). Incidence of EBV viremia was not significantly different.

Conclusions

ValA has significantly less dose-limiting side effects than valG. In our study population, a significant increase in CMV viremia was not observed, in adults and children after kidney transplant, compared to valG.

### Transplant centers' prophylaxis and monitoring strategies: a key determinant of current herpes and polyomavirus incidences-results from the DZIF kidney transplant cohort [^8b77809a]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The survival of renal allografts has been improved markedly by immunosuppressive therapy, such as calcineurin inhibitors. However, immunosuppression is accompanied by opportunistic infections, which are a leading cause of death with a functioning graft. The major pathogens causing transplant loss after kidney transplantation are the herpesvirus cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the polyomavirus BK-virus (BKV). Primary BKV infection usually occurs in childhood and persists latently over years. Immunocompromised individuals are at risk of reactivation and of primary infection, either from the donor graft or from other people. In recent years, an increase in BKV has been observed in renal transplant recipients. BKV infection causes BKV-associated nephropathy (BKVAN) in around 10% of patients and allograft loss in around 50% of patients. Similarly, CMV infection occurs frequently after transplantation and can lead to multiorgan diseases, diabetes, and cardiovascular morbidity and can reduce patient and graft survival, despite efficacious anti-CMV prophylaxis being available. Treatment is often complicated by side effects such as neutropenia or nephrotoxicity.

Concerning prophylaxis strategies and monitoring, existing guidelines are often weak. For example, KDIGO 2009 guidelines suggest BKV screening of kidney transplant recipients at least monthly for the first 3–6 months after transplantation and every 3 months until the end of the first post-transplant year. However, this is only a suggestion on a 2D level with very low evidence. KDIGO 2009 also recommends CMV prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir or valganciclovir for at least 3 months after transplantation, except when donor and recipient both have negative CMV serologies on a level 1B recommendation with moderate evidence. Studies in the high-risk population with a CMV-positive donor (D+) and CMV-negative recipient (R-) have shown that antiviral chemoprophylaxis reduces the incidence of CMV disease by about 60%, but prophylaxis has also been shown to be effective in recipients at moderate risk for CMV disease (e.g. CMV D+/R+, or D-/R+). The use of antiviral chemoprophylaxis has also demonstrated to reduce the incidence of CMV-associated mortality, all-cause mortality, as well as clinically important disease due to opportunistic infections.

Significance Statement

Although cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is an important factor in the pathogenesis of kidney allograft rejection, previous studies have not determined the optimal CMV prevention strategy to avoid indirect effects of the virus. In this randomized trial involving 140 kidney transplant recipients, incidence of acute rejection at 12 months was not lower with valganciclovir prophylaxis (for at least 3 months) compared with preemptive therapy initiated after detection of CMV DNA in whole blood. However, prophylaxis was associated with a lower risk of subclinical rejection at 3 months. Although both regimens were effective in preventing CMV disease, the incidence of CMV DNAemia (including episodes with higher viral loads) was significantly higher with preemptive therapy. Further research with long-term follow-up is warranted to better compare the two approaches.

Background

The optimal regimen for preventing cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in kidney transplant recipients, primarily in reducing indirect CMV effects, has not been defined.

Methods

This open-label, single-center, randomized clinical trial of valganciclovir prophylaxis versus preemptive therapy included kidney transplant recipients recruited between June 2013 and May 2018. After excluding CMV-seronegative recipients with transplants from seronegative donors, we randomized 140 participants 1:1 to receive valganciclovir prophylaxis (900 mg, daily for 3 or 6 months for CMV-seronegative recipients who received a kidney from a CMV-seropositive donor) or preemptive therapy (valganciclovir, 900 mg, twice daily) that was initiated after detection of CMV DNA in whole blood (≥ 1000 IU/ml) and stopped after two consecutive negative tests (preemptive therapy patients received weekly CMV PCR tests for 4 months). The primary outcome was the incidence of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection at 12 months. Key secondary outcomes included subclinical rejection, CMV disease and DNAemia, and neutropenia.

Results

The incidence of acute rejection was lower with valganciclovir prophylaxis than with preemptive therapy (13%, 9/70 versus 23%, 16/70), but the difference was not statistically significant. Subclinical rejection at 3 months was lower in the prophylaxis group (13% versus 29%, P = 0.027). Both regimens prevented CMV disease (in 4% of patients in both groups). Compared with prophylaxis, preemptive therapy resulted in significantly higher rates of CMV DNAemia (44% versus 75%, P < 0.001) and a higher proportion of patients experiencing episodes with higher viral load (≥ 2000 IU/ml), but significantly lower valganciclovir exposure and neutropenia.

Conclusion

Among kidney transplant recipients, the use of valganciclovir prophylaxis did not result in a significantly lower incidence of acute rejection compared with the use of preemptive therapy.

### Valganciclovir underdosing is associated with cytomegalovirus DNAemia during universal prophylaxis: a real-life case control retrospective study [^d621c968]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

There have been major advances in the prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in the past decades but these remain among the commonest opportunistic infections after kidney transplantation (KT), creating additional challenges because of the rise of refractory and resistant infections, and the toxicities associated with current anti‐CMV drugs.

The risk of CMV infection or disease after KT is determined primarily by the donor and recipient CMV IgG serostatus and can be stratified from lowest to highest: seronegative donor (D−)/recipient (R−), seropositive donor (D+)/recipient (R+), D−/R+, and D+/R−. With the current preventive strategies, the incidence of CMV infections is about 17%–37%, with the highest risk in the first 100 days.

Currently, two key strategies are used to prevent CMV infections in KT recipients (KTR) — universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy. Universal prophylaxis involves the administration of an antiviral drug, typically valganciclovir (VGCV), to KTR with high and intermediate CMV infection risk. The preemptive strategy involves regular monitoring of blood CMV PCR and initiation of preemptive treatment when CMV DNA is detected in the blood (DNAemia). In the Fourth International Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Cytomegalovirus in Solid‐organ Transplantation, both strategies are suggested but universal prophylaxis is preferred for patients receiving induction with lymphocyte‐depleting agents. However, under universal prophylaxis that does not monitor blood CMV PCR, there have been reports of cases of early CMV infections.

The choice of preventive strategy differs in each transplant center. A European survey performed in 2016 in solid organ transplant centers showed significant differences in CMV prophylaxis management. Most transplant programs reported performing CMV DNA load surveillance while patients were on antiviral prophylaxis, as was the case in the kidney transplant unit of Marseille University Hospital, from which these study patients were drawn.

In this study, we aimed to define the incidence of CMV DNAemia after KT with VGCV universal prophylaxis, to identify the associated factors and their consequences.

14.2 Pediatric Patients

Prevention of CMV in Pediatric Heart, Kidney, or Liver Transplantation: Sixty-three children, 4 months to 16 years of age, who had a solid organ transplant (kidney 33, liver 17, heart 12, and kidney/liver 1) and were at risk for developing CMV disease, were enrolled in an open-label, safety, and pharmacokinetic study of oral valganciclovir (valganciclovir for oral solution or tablets). Patients received valganciclovir once daily within 10 days after transplant until a maximum of 100 days post-transplant. The daily doses of valganciclovir were calculated at each study visit based on body surface area and a modified creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

The pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir were similar across organ transplant types and age ranges. The mean daily ganciclovir exposures in pediatric patients were somewhat increased relative to those observed in adult solid organ transplant patients receiving valganciclovir 900 mg once daily, but were within the range considered safe and effective in adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No case of CMV syndrome or tissue-invasive CMV disease was reported within the first six months post-transplantation.

Prevention of CMV in Pediatric Kidney Transplantation: Fifty-seven children, 1 to 16 years of age, who had a renal transplant and were at risk for developing CMV disease, were enrolled in an open-label tolerability study of oral valganciclovir (valganciclovir for oral solution or tablets). Patients received valganciclovir once daily within 10 days after transplant until a maximum of 200 days post-transplant. The daily doses of valganciclovir were calculated at each study visit based on body surface area and a modified creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. No case of CMV syndrome or tissue-invasive CMV disease was reported within the first 12 months post-transplantation.

### Valganciclovir (valcyte) [^5c40dac8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Prevention of CMV Disease in Heart, Kidney, Kidney-Pancreas, or Liver Transplantation: A double blind, double-dummy active comparator study was conducted in 372 heart, liver, kidney, or kidney-pancreas transplant patients at high risk for CMV disease (D+/R-). Patients were randomized (2 VALCYTE: 1 oral ganciclovir) to receive either VALCYTE tablets (900 mg once daily) or oral ganciclovir (1000 mg three times a day) starting within 10 days of transplantation until Day 100 post-transplant. The proportion of patients who developed CMV disease, including CMV syndrome and/or tissue-invasive disease during the first 6 months post-transplant was similar between the VALCYTE tablets arm (12.1%, N = 239) and the oral ganciclovir arm (15.2%, N = 125). However, in liver transplant patients, the incidence of tissue-invasive CMV disease was significantly higher in the VALCYTE group compared with the ganciclovir group. These results are summarized in Table 20.

Mortality at six months was 3.7% (9/244) in the VALCYTE group and 1.6% (2/126) in the oral ganciclovir group.

Prevention of CMV Disease in Kidney Transplantation: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 326 kidney transplant patients at high risk for CMV disease (D+/R-) to assess the efficacy and safety of extending VALCYTE CMV prophylaxis from 100 to 200 days post-transplant. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive VALCYTE tablets (900 mg once daily) within 10 days of transplantation either until Day 200 post-transplant or until Day 100 post-transplant followed by 100 days of placebo. Extending CMV prophylaxis with VALCYTE until Day 200 post-transplant demonstrated superiority in preventing CMV disease within the first 12 months post-transplant in high risk kidney transplant patients compared to the 100 day dosing regimen (primary endpoint). These results are summarized in Table 21.

The percentage of kidney transplant patients with CMV disease at 24 months post-transplant was 38.7% (63/163) for the 100 day dosing regimen and 21.3% (33/155) for the 200 day dosing regimen.

### Clinical practice guidelines standardisation of immunosuppressive and anti-infective drug regimens in UK paediatric renal transplantation: the harmonisation programme [^808204cf]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Valganciclovir has been widely used for cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis in solid-organ transplant recipients. Limited evidence suggests that 6 months of prophylaxis may be associated with a lower rate of late-onset disease than 3 month regimens in CYP receiving valganciclovir, however, the committee agreed to propose a recommendation for 'at least 3 months' of valganciclovir due to concerns about its significant side effect profile (infection, diarrhoea, leukopenia, neutropenia).

There was 93% agreement with this recommendation in the Delphi consensus process (consensus reached).
10 We recommend that children and young people should be monitored for CMV viral load at least monthly for 12 months post transplant if either donor or recipient are CMV positive (CMV D + R- / CMV D-R+ / CMV D + R+). (1D)

Audit measures

Proportion of CYP undergoing monitoring for CMV viral load for 12 months post transplant if either donor or recipient are CMV positive (CMV D + R- / CMV D-R+ / CMV D + R+).
Proportion of CYP receiving valganciclovir becoming neutropaenic.

Rationale

No relevant studies were identified for this review question, however, the incidence of CMV disease and / or viraemia in has been reported in 41% of CMV positive donor and CMV negative recipient (D+/R-) and 24% of CMV positive recipients (D+/R+ and D−/R+). The committee noted the existing variation in practice across the UK and agreed to recommend CMV viral load monitoring on a monthly basis in all CYP post-transplant. Members of the committee agreed that management of CMV viraemia would be dictated by local practice.

There was 79% agreement with this recommendation in the Delphi consensus process (consensus reached).

### Pre-emptive treatment for cytomegalovirus viraemia to prevent cytomegalovirus disease in solid organ transplant recipients [^e766dbda]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a significant cause of morbidity and death in solid organ transplant recipients. Pre-emptive treatment of patients with CMV viraemia using antiviral agents has been suggested as an alternative to routine prophylaxis to prevent CMV disease. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006 and updated in 2013.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of pre-emptive treatment of CMV viraemia to prevent CMV disease and death (any cause) and the indirect effects of CMV infection (acute rejection, graft loss, opportunistic infections) in solid organ transplant recipients.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies was searched up to 17 December 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing pre-emptive treatment with placebo, no specific treatment, or antiviral prophylaxis in solid organ transplant recipients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of the identified studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted all data. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using a random-effects model. The certainty of evidence was assessed per outcome using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

In this update, we have included seven new studies, bringing the total number of included studies to 22 (1883 participants). Of these, seven investigated pre-emptive treatment versus placebo or standard care, 12 looked at pre-emptive treatment versus antiviral prophylaxis, one study investigated oral versus intravenous pre-emptive treatment, one investigated pre-emptive valganciclovir versus pre-emptive ganciclovir, and one investigated letermovir 40 mg twice/day versus 80 mg once/day. Studies were conducted in Australia, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Spain, South Korea, and the USA. Organ transplant recipients included kidney, liver, heart, lung, and kidney-pancreas. Thirteen studies were single-centre studies, six were multicentre, and three were unknown. The number of participants ranged from 12 to 296. Overall, selection bias was unclear (55%); performance, detection and attrition bias were high (91%, 63% and 95%, respectively), and reporting bias was low (55%). Compared with placebo or standard care, pre-emptive treatment probably reduces the risk of CMV disease (7 studies, 315 participants: RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.80; I² = 54%; moderate-certainty evidence) but may result in little or no difference in death (any cause) (3 studies, 176 participants: RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.30; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Pre-emptive treatment may result in little or no difference in CMV organ involvement, CMV-associated symptoms, acute rejection, graft loss, other infections or leucopenia. Compared to prophylaxis, pre-emptive treatment may make little or no difference to the risk of developing CMV disease (11 studies, 1322 participants: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.01; I² = 54%; low-certainty evidence) and probably makes little or no difference to death (any cause) (9 studies, 1098 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.52; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence). Pre-emptive treatment may increase the risk of CMV infection (8 studies, 867 participants: RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.61; I² = 66%; low-certainty evidence). The risk of leucopenia (7 studies, 869 participants: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.87; I² = 33%; moderate-certainty evidence) and neutropenia (5 studies, 859 participants: RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.90; I² = 0% moderate certainty evidence) probably decreases with pre-emptive therapy. There may be little or no difference in the risks of acute rejection, graft loss, and infections other than CMV. Single studies were identified for comparisons between different pre-emptive treatments: 1) oral ganciclovir versus IV ganciclovir; 2) valganciclovir versus ganciclovir; 3) 40 mg twice/day versus 80 mg once/day. No differences between these treatment modalities in terms of CMV disease, death (any cause), or adverse events were identified.

Authors' Conclusions

In this review, we have included seven new studies, yet the available evidence is overall of low certainty and the conclusions remain similar to the previous version of this review. Pre-emptive treatment probably reduces the risk of CMV disease compared with placebo or standard care. There were no clear differences between pre-emptive treatment and prophylaxis to prevent CMV disease or reduce the risk of death (any cause). The risk of CMV infection may be higher for patients receiving pre-emptive therapy, but the risk of adverse events, such as leucopenia, is probably lower.

Cytomegalovirus antivirals in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and cellular therapy recipients — maribavir has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) and recommended for the treatment of post-transplant R/R CMV infection or disease in adult and pediatric (12 years or older and weighing at least 35 kg) transplant recipients (A-I); in a phase 3 trial it achieved significantly greater viral clearance by week 8 that was maintained up to week 20. Maribavir and (val)ganciclovir are antagonistic and should not be used in combination (E-III), and due to poor central nervous system penetration maribavir should not be used in suspected or confirmed CMV retinitis or encephalitis (E-III). The US–FDA–approved indication for letermovir has been expanded to include prophylaxis for CMV disease in adult kidney transplant recipients and oral pellets in pediatric HCT recipients, and acyclovir-based prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus and herpes zoster virus is recommended for HCT recipients when needed due to the lack of in vitro activity of maribavir and letermovir against these 2 viruses (A-I).

### A new antiviral option for CMV prevention after kidney transplant… [^3533d675]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

In this issue of JAMA, Limaye and colleagues report the results of a phase 3, randomized, active-controlled, double-masked, double-dummy, noninferiority trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of letermovir compared with valganciclovir for universal CMV prophylaxis in high-risk adult CMV-seronegative kidney transplant recipients who receive an organ from a CMV-seropositive donor. 9 A total of 601 participants at 94 international sites were enrolled from May 2018 to April 2021. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either letermovir or valganciclovir for CMV prophylaxis for up to 200 days after transplant. The primary outcome was CMV disease, confirmed by an independent masked adjudication committee, through posttransplant week 52, with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 10%.

No participants in the letermovir group developed resistance-associated sequence variants vs 12. 1% of participants in the valganciclovir group. Importantly, the rate of myelosuppression through week 28 was lower with letermovir vs valganciclovir and fewer patients receiving letermovir discontinued prophylaxis due to drug-related adverse events. The results of the study by Limaye et al9 demonstrating that letermovir is noninferior to valganciclovir, the current standard of care for universal prophylaxis, are practice changing. Although rates of CMV disease were similar between the 2 groups through posttransplant week 52, patients receiving letermovir were less likely to develop both CMV DNAemia and early CMV disease. Strategies for posttransplant CMV prevention continue to evolve, with many promising alternatives on the horizon.

This trial by Limaye and colleagues is a major step forward in demonstrating that letermovir is an equally effective and better-tolerated antiviral option when used as universal prophylaxis in high-risk kidney transplant recipients.

2.3	Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients

Prevention of CMV Disease in Pediatric Kidney Transplant Patients: For pediatric kidney transplant patients 4 months to 16 years of age, the recommended once daily mg dose (7 × BSA × CrCl) should start within 10 days of post-transplantation until 200 days post-transplantation.

Prevention of CMV Disease in Pediatric Heart Transplant Patients: For pediatric heart transplant patients 1 month to 16 years of age, the recommended once daily mg dose (7 × BSA × CrCl) should start within 10 days of transplantation until 100 days post-transplantation.

The recommended once daily dosage of VALCYTE is based on body surface area (BSA) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) derived from a modified Schwartz formula, and is calculated using the equation below:

Pediatric Dose (mg) = 7 × BSA × CrCl (calculated using a modified Schwartz formula). If the calculated Schwartz creatinine clearance exceeds 150 mL/min/1.73m2, then a maximum value of 150 mL/min/1.73m2should be used in the equation. The k values used in the modified Schwartz formula are based on pediatric patient age, as shown in Table 1.

Monitor serum creatinine levels regularly and consider changes in height and body weight and adapt the dose as appropriate during prophylaxis period.

All calculated doses should be rounded to the nearest 25 mg increment for the actual deliverable dose. The oral dispenser is graduated in 0.5 mL increments. A 50 mg dose is equivalent to 1 mL. If the calculated dose exceeds 900 mg, a maximum dose of 900 mg should be administered. VALCYTE for oral solution is the preferred formulation since it provides the ability to administer a dose calculated according to the formula above; however, VALCYTE tablets may be used if the calculated doses are within 10% of available tablet strength (450 mg). For example, if the calculated dose is between 405 mg and 495 mg, one 450 mg tablet may be taken. Before prescribing VALCYTE tablets, pediatric patients should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets.

CMV treatment in LT recipients — treatment should be started whenever recipients are symptomatic, have a tissue injury, or have persistent or increasing viremia, and all LT recipients with symptomatic CMV infection and/or organ disease should receive antiviral therapy with reduction of immunosuppression until viremia and all symptoms have resolved. For low-level viremia, asymptomatic patients should have immunosuppression reduction as tolerated and viral load testing repeated, with treatment administered if the viral load rises and/or symptoms develop. Options for antiviral treatment include intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg twice daily adjusted for renal impairment) and oral valganciclovir (900 mg twice daily adjusted for renal impairment) for mild to moderate disease if no significant gastrointestinal involvement is assumed, noting that valganciclovir is not approved for use in LT.

### Valganciclovir hydrochloride (valganciclovir) [^4fa6a0af]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Prevention of CMV Disease in Heart, Kidney, Kidney-Pancreas, or Liver Transplantation: A doubleblind, double-dummy active comparator study was conducted in 372 heart, liver, kidney, or kidney-pancreas transplant patients at high risk for CMV disease (D+/R-). Patients were randomized (2 valganciclovir: 1 oral ganciclovir) to receive either valganciclovir tablets (900 mg once daily) or oral ganciclovir (1000 mg three times a day) starting within 10 days of transplantation until Day 100 post-transplant. The proportion of patients who developed CMV disease, including CMV syndrome and/or tissue-invasive disease during the first 6 months post-transplant was similar between the valganciclovir tablets arm (12.1%, N = 239) and the oral ganciclovir arm (15.2%, N = 125). However, in liver transplant patients, the incidence of tissue-invasive CMV disease was significantly higher in the valganciclovir group compared with the ganciclovir group. These results are summarized in Table 20.

Mortality at six months was 3.7% (9/244) in the valganciclovir group and 1.6% (2/126) in the oral ganciclovir group.

Prevention of CMV Disease in Kidney Transplantation: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 326 kidney transplant patients at high risk for CMV disease (D+/R-) to assess the efficacy and safety of extending valganciclovir CMV prophylaxis from 100 to 200 days post-transplant. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive valganciclovir tablets (900 mg once daily) within 10 days of transplantation either until Day 200 post-transplant or until Day 100 post-transplant followed by 100 days of placebo. Extending CMV prophylaxis with valganciclovir until Day 200 post-transplant demonstrated superiority in preventing CMV disease within the first 12 months post-transplant in high risk kidney transplant patients compared to the 100 day dosing regimen (primary endpoint). These results are summarized in Table 21.

The percentage of kidney transplant patients with CMV disease at 24 months post-transplant was 38.7% (63/163) for the 100 day dosing regimen and 21.3% (33/155) for the 200 day dosing regimen.

GCV = oral ganciclovir; VGCV = valganciclovir

1Number of patients with CMV disease = Number of patients with tissue-invasive CMV disease or CMV syndrome

2CMV syndrome was defined as evidence of CMV viremia accompanied with fever greater than or equal to 38°C on two or more occasions separated by at least 24 hours within a 7-day period and one or more of the following: malaise, leukopenia, atypical lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevation of hepatic transaminases

Prevention of CMV Disease in Kidney Transplantation: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 326 kidney transplant patients at high risk for CMV disease (D+/R-) to assess the efficacy and safety of extending valganciclovir hydrochloride CMV prophylaxis from 100 to 200 days post-transplant. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive valganciclovir tablets (900 mg once daily) within 10 days of transplantation either until Day 200 post-transplant or until Day 100 post-transplant followed by 100 days of placebo. Extending CMV prophylaxis with valganciclovir hydrochloride until Day 200 post-transplant demonstrated superiority in preventing CMV disease within the first 12 months post-transplant in high risk kidney transplant patients compared to the 100 day dosing regimen (primary endpoint). These results are summarized in Table 21.

### Safety and efficacy of direct-acting antivirals for chronic hepatitis C in patients with chronic kidney disease [^ba20eef7]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is a real-world evidence study that aims to analyze the efficacy, tolerability and safety profile of paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir and dasabuvir, in patients with renal impairment.

Methods

We conducted an observational prospective study, on 232 patients with chronic kidney disease, undergoing treatment with paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir and dasabuvir, for chronic hepatitis C infection - genotype 1b. Renal and liver function were assessed at the beginning of therapy, monthly during treatment and three months after therapy completion.

Results

All patients achieved sustained virologic response. Common side effects were nausea, fatigue and headache. Close monitoring of tacrolimus blood levels and dose reduction was required in kidney transplant recipients.

Conclusions

HCV therapy in the setting of renal dysfunction has always been a challenging topic. Direct-acting antivirals have shown promising effects, demonstrating good tolerance and efficacy in patients with HCV infection and renal impairment. Sustained virologic response within our study population was 100%.

### Valganciclovir underdosing is associated with cytomegalovirus DNAemia during universal prophylaxis: a real-life case control retrospective study [^bbdc62b7]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Under well‐conducted VGCV prophylaxis, we could expect a zero incidence of CMV DNAemia. In the present study, where the 15 cases were matched to 60 controls for sex, age, CMV IgG serostatus of both donors and recipients, and immunosuppressive induction treatment, univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the rate of visits (in other words, the time spent) with VGCV underdosing was a risk factor for the occurrence of CMV DNAemia. Retrospective assessment of kidney function according to different formulas showed that the rate of visits with VGCV underdosing in cases was always significantly higher than in controls, whatever the formula used. Furthermore, we showed an improvement of renal function in cases between day 14 post‐KT and on DNAemia day. Taken together, these data suggest that renal function was not assessed at each post‐transplant visit and that the VGCV dosage was not adjusted, leading to underdosing. The rate of visits with VGCV underdosing in cases was 48%, 35%, and 30%, using the formulas for CG, not BSA‐indexed CKD EPI, and BSA‐indexed CKD EPI, respectively, meaning that underdosing is missed in 13%–18% of visits when estimated GFR is used rather than the CG formula. Another explanation for the underdosing could be concern about the toxicity of VGCV, particularly when estimated creatinine clearance approaches a threshold value that theoretically indicates the need for a dose increase.

### Sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir (Vosevi) [^dcc83464]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.6	Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment of VOSEVI is recommended for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, including ESRD requiring dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7	Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment of VOSEVI is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). VOSEVI is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) due to the higher exposures of voxilaprevir (up to 6-fold in non-HCV infected subjects); the safety and efficacy have not been established in HCV-infected patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Postmarketing cases of hepatic decompensation/failure have been reported in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### An appraisal of antiretroviral drugs in hemodialysis [^be55a79e]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related kidney disorders concern 30% of those patients and can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD; 6 to 10%). Therefore, the administration of antiretroviral drugs in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients with nephropathy is not uncommon.

Methods

The influence of ESRD on the different phases of the pharmacokinetic profile of drugs in general is examined in light of bioavailability, distribution, protein binding, metabolism, and elimination. Then, the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs in hemodialysis are detailed.

Results

From these data, dosing recommendations are given for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-NRTIs, and protease inhibitors (PIs).

Conclusion

Dosage adjustments are often necessary for patients with renal insufficiency. These adaptations have to be carefully performed to optimize drug exposure and reduce the risk of side effects.

### Real-world direct-acting antiviral treatment in kidney transplant and hemodialysis patients: the epiTer-2 multicenter observational study [^225c1dab]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

After KTx, patients treated with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir do not require any adjustment of the dosage of the calcineurin inhibitor. Antiviral treatment with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in patients who are being administered tacrolimus increases 1.45-fold in TAC AUC (area under curve), which does not require any adjustment of tacrolimus dosage. However, monitoring of the concentration is necessary, along with any required dosage adjustments. In patients treated with cyclosporin in dosages higher than 100 mg daily, due to even a 5-fold increase in glecaprevir AUC such treatment is not recommended.

Given the variety of antiviral treatment in the studied group it is worth mentioning the remaining DAA interactions with calcineurin inhibitors. Ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, part of a complex treatment with paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir + dasabuvir (PrOD), increases TAC AUC 57.1-fold. The suggested initial dosage for TAC in this case was 0.5 mg every 7 days, along with the monitoring of tacrolimus concentration and further dosage adjustments. In the case of cyclosporin the CSA AUC increases 5.8-fold, and for this reason the CSA dosage was reduced to 1/5. During the elbasvir/grazoprevir treatment, the TAC AUC increases 1.43-fold, and the tacrolimus dosage does not require any adjustments. However, the elbasvir/grazoprevir treatment is not recommended for patients treated with cyclosporin. The need to modify the dosage of calcineurin inhibitors, most often an increase after the end of antiviral therapy, can be the result of the curing of the HCV infection and the improvement in liver function.

According to Wong et al, treatment with DAA for HCV infection resulted in better 1-year survivability of a kidney graft compared to previous years, when there was no available interferon-free therapy. Goetsch et al followed 18 kidney recipients successfully treated with DAA for 5 years and demonstrated a lower risk of kidney damage episodes or death compared to patients with a chronic active HCV infection. Our oneyear long observation of transplanted kidney function did not allow us to formulate similar conclusions. Therefore, it is still not clear whether successful DAA treatment of HCV infection can really improve the function of the transplanted kidney and prolong the patient's survival. The major limitation of our study is its retrospective nature, typical for real-world experience studies and resulted in the loss of some clinical and laboratory data.
