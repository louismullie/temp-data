## Question

A 34-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease presents for a routine follow-up. Six months ago, she was successfully treated for iron deficiency anemia with intravenous iron. She currently feels well and denies any symptoms of anemia. Her laboratory results today show hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL and serum ferritin of 85 mcg/L. Her previous post-treatment ferritin was 180 mcg/L. The rest of her labs are unremarkable. You are reviewing her management plan.

Based on current guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, what is the most appropriate next step in this patient's management?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step in managing a 34-year-old woman with Crohn's disease who was successfully treated for iron deficiency anemia with intravenous iron six months ago, now presenting with hemoglobin 12.1 g/dL and ferritin 85 mcg/L, down from a post-treatment ferritin of 180 mcg/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether she currently meets criteria for iron deficiency or anemia. Then, I should verify the ECCO thresholds for retreatment in the context of inflammation. Next, I will consider the pathophysiology explaining the ferritin decline and the risk of recurrence. After that, I should review guideline-supported monitoring intervals and whether we are due for surveillance. Finally, I will weigh treatment options, including IV iron, oral iron, and maintenance strategies, and decide on the most evidence-based next step with dosing and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the current status. Hemoglobin 12.1 g/dL is within normal limits for a nonpregnant adult woman, so she is not anemic today, but I should not jump to conclusions about iron sufficiency because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and can be misleading in IBD. In the presence of inflammation, ferritin up to 100 mcg/L may still reflect iron deficiency, and her ferritin has fallen from 180 to 85 mcg/L, which is a concerning downward trend even if CRP is not provided today [^115Cu3E3] [^112L9fB4] [^116X4Aw2].

> Wait, let me verify the ECCO retreatment thresholds. ECCO recommends initiating retreatment with IV iron when ferritin drops below 100 mcg/L or when hemoglobin falls below 12 g/dL in women after successful IV iron therapy, and this patient meets the ferritin criterion despite a normal hemoglobin, so she qualifies for retreatment now rather than waiting for anemia to recur [^115aVxmE] [^114k8Tww].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to ensure this makes sense. In IBD, iron deficiency recurs frequently and rapidly after IV iron, often within months, and the recurrence risk correlates with disease activity and with lower post-treatment ferritin levels. A drop from 180 to 85 mcg/L over six months fits this pattern and signals depleting stores that will soon compromise erythropoiesis if not corrected [^1122umaq] [^115wyJ8z] [^114SBbZS].

> Next, I should review surveillance cadence. ECCO advises monitoring for recurrence every 3 months for at least a year after correction of iron deficiency, then every 6–12 months thereafter. Given that she is six months out and ferritin has fallen below 100 mcg/L, she is due for reassessment and treatment rather than continued observation [^113oejKX] [^114Acp5z].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about route. I initially thought oral iron might suffice since she is not anemic and disease appears quiescent, but wait, I should double-check the evidence. IV iron achieves faster and more reliable repletion in IBD, with meta-analytic data showing greater odds of a hemoglobin rise ≥ 2 g/dL and better treatment continuity versus oral iron, and ECCO/ESPEN prioritize IV iron when ferritin is below 100 mcg/L in the setting of inflammation or when prior IV iron was effective, which applies here [^116FymGj] [^115aVxmE] [^1172SmdN].

> I will now examine dosing options. A practical, guideline-concordant approach is to use a modern IV formulation such as ferric carboxymaltose with a fixed-dose regimen, typically 1,000–1,500 mg total iron given as a single infusion or two 500–750 mg infusions separated by about a week, which avoids the complexity and underestimation of the Ganzoni formula and aligns with ECCO's simplified dosing recommendation [^111Dn2fB] [^114d6w1f].

> But wait, what if we consider oral iron instead. Oral iron can be reasonable in select IBD patients with mild anemia and inactive disease, yet her ferritin is already below 100 mcg/L and declining, absorption may be suboptimal even in quiescent disease, and oral therapy would be slower and less reliable for repleting stores. Given her prior response to IV iron and current trajectory, IV iron remains the safer, more effective choice to prevent imminent recurrence of anemia [^116FymGj] [^113BiEVH] [^116X4Aw2].

> Next, I should review follow-up and maintenance. After IV repletion, I should recheck hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP in about 4–8 weeks to confirm response and then resume structured surveillance every 3–6 months for the first year and every 6–12 months thereafter, with a low threshold to retreat if ferritin again approaches 100 mcg/L. Some patients with recurrent IDA benefit from ferritin-guided maintenance IV iron, though that decision can be individualized based on recurrence pattern and tolerance [^113oejKX] [^114SBbZS] [^117W6VWK].

> Final decision: I should initiate IV iron retreatment now using a fixed-dose regimen such as ferric carboxymaltose 1,000–1,500 mg total, arranged as a single infusion or two infusions, and schedule follow-up labs in 4–8 weeks to document repletion and guide ongoing surveillance. This aligns with ECCO retreatment thresholds, the high recurrence risk in IBD, and the superior efficacy and tolerability of IV iron in this population [^115aVxmE] [^116FymGj] [^111Dn2fB].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **initiate intravenous iron therapy** because her ferritin has declined to 85 mcg/L, which meets ECCO criteria for retreatment in IBD [^115aVxmE] [^114k8Tww], and to **monitor for recurrence** with CBC, ferritin, and CRP every 3–6 months [^113oejKX] [^114Acp5z]. IV iron is preferred over oral iron in IBD due to superior efficacy, faster correction, and better tolerability [^116FymGj] [^113vJuQi], especially when ferritin is < 100 mcg/L or hemoglobin is < 12 g/dL in women [^115aVxmE] [^114k8Tww]. If IV iron is unavailable, oral iron may be tried with close monitoring, but IV iron remains first-line in this scenario [^116FymGj] [^1128x3zD].

---

## Interpretation of current laboratory results

- **Hemoglobin**: 12.1 g/dL is within normal limits for adult women (12.0–15.5 g/dL), indicating no current anemia.
- **Ferritin**: 85 mcg/L is below the 100 mcg/L threshold used in IBD to define iron deficiency in the presence of inflammation, suggesting depleted iron stores despite normal hemoglobin [^115Cu3E3] [^112L9fB4].
- **Comparison with previous ferritin**: The decline from 180 mcg/L to 85 mcg/L over 6 months indicates ongoing iron loss or impaired absorption, consistent with recurrent iron deficiency in IBD [^1122umaq] [^115wyJ8z].

---

## Guideline-based management recommendations

According to ECCO guidelines, **retreatment with IV iron** should be initiated when ferritin drops below 100 mcg/L or hemoglobin falls below 12–13 g/dL (gender-specific) after successful IV iron therapy [^115aVxmE] [^114k8Tww]. The AGA also recommends IV iron as first-line therapy in IBD patients with iron deficiency anemia, particularly when disease activity impairs absorption or oral iron is not tolerated [^116FymGj] [^111M5RPV].

---

## Rationale for intravenous iron therapy

IV iron is preferred in IBD because:

- **Superior efficacy**: IV iron achieves faster and greater hemoglobin increases than oral iron, with higher odds of a ≥ 2 g/dL rise in hemoglobin [^116FymGj] [^114G4vn1].
- **Better tolerability**: IV iron has fewer gastrointestinal side effects and lower discontinuation rates than oral iron [^114G4vn1] [^111YiyBU].
- **Bypasses absorption issues**: IV iron circumvents impaired intestinal absorption due to inflammation or small bowel disease [^116FymGj] [^111M5RPV].

---

## Alternative management options

Oral iron may be considered if IV iron is unavailable or contraindicated, but it is less effective and often poorly tolerated in IBD; if used, monitor closely for response and adherence [^116FymGj] [^113K8Kha]. Maintenance therapy with periodic IV iron may be considered for patients with recurrent iron deficiency to sustain iron stores and prevent anemia recurrence [^114SBbZS] [^1165XYJ5].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to detect recurrence early. ECCO recommends **CBC, ferritin, and CRP every 3–6 months** for the first year after correction, then every 6–12 months thereafter [^113oejKX] [^114Acp5z]. Recurrent iron deficiency despite adequate therapy may signal ongoing disease activity or alternative etiologies and should prompt reassessment of IBD control and investigation for other causes [^113hzV35] [^112mNfTY].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is to **initiate intravenous iron therapy** to replenish iron stores and prevent recurrence of anemia, followed by regular monitoring of hemoglobin, ferritin, and CRP every 3–6 months [^115aVxmE] [^113oejKX]. This approach aligns with ECCO and AGA guidelines and addresses the high recurrence risk of iron deficiency in IBD [^116FymGj] [^1122umaq].

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) — iron supplementation and route selection are as follows: Iron supplementation should be given to all patients with IBD and IDA. In head-to-head comparisons, IV iron had greater efficacy than oral iron in achieving a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 2.0 g/dL (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.13–2.18) and greater treatment continuity (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13–0.59) in a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials including 694 adults. Current consensus recommendations by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization recommend IV over oral iron as first-line therapy for patients with a hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL, but oral iron may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with IBD who have mild anemia and inactive disease; if oral iron is used, close follow-up evaluation is needed to assess tolerance and response.

### Anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel diseases: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^114FrBvq]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia coexists with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in up to two-thirds of patients, significantly impairing quality of life. The most common types of anemia in patients with IBD are iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease, which often overlap. In most cases, available laboratory tests allow successful diagnosis of iron deficiency, where difficulties appear, recently established indices such as soluble transferrin-ferritin ratio or percentage of hypochromic red cells are used. In this review, we discuss the management of the most common types of anemia in respect of the latest available data. Thus, we provide the mechanisms underlying pathophysiology of these entities; furthermore, we discuss the role of hepcidin in developing anemia in IBD. Next, we present the treatment options for each type of anemia and highlight the importance of individual choice of action. We also focus on newly developed intravenous iron preparations and novel, promising drug candidates targeting hepcidin. Concurrently, we talk about difficulties in differentiating between the true and functional iron deficiency, and discuss tools facilitating the process. Finally, we emphasize the importance of proper diagnosis and treatment of anemia in IBD. We conclude that management of anemia in patients with IBD is tricky, and appropriate screening of patients regarding anemia is substantial.

Box 9
Iron deficiency anaemia in IBD

A third of patients with active IBD have iron deficiency anaemia
Anaemia causes fatigue, affects quality of life and delays recovery
As systemic inflammation inhibits absorption of iron, iron tablets should not be used in those with active disease and, in patients with inactive disease, no more than 100 mg elemental iron should be taken daily
Ferritin levels up to 100 µg/L in the presence of inflammation may still reflect iron deficiency. Measurement of transferrin saturation may therefore be helpful
Consider other causes of anaemia (eg, folate deficiency, B12 deficiency or bone marrow depression) in patients with IBD
Intravenous iron should be used first line in patients intolerant of oral iron who have active IBD and moderate to severe anaemia (Hb < 100 g/L), or those who need erythropoietin
Iron absorption may be improved by once daily or alternate daily oral dosing

Within a total of 16 statements, recommendations are made regarding diagnostic measures to screen for iron- and other anemia-related deficiencies regarding the triggers for medical intervention, treatment goals, and appropriate therapies. Anemia is a common cause of hospitalization, prevents physicians from discharging hospitalized patients, and is one of the most frequent comorbid conditions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. It therefore needs appropriate attention and specific care.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

Conclusions

Anemia is the most prevalent extraintestinal complication of IBD and can substantially affect the quality of life of patients with IBD. Although there are several causes of anemia in IBD, IDA is the most common. Assessment of the iron status of patients suffering from inflammatory diseases, such as IBD, by using common biochemical values is insufficient. However, new indices of iron metabolism (i.e. TfR Index, reticulocyte hemoglobin content or percentage of hypochromic red blood cells) may help to improve the assessment of iron status in patients with IBD. The major goal when treating IDA in patients with IBD is first to supply sufficient iron to increase hemoglobin levels by > 2 g/dL or increase them to normal values within 4 weeks and second to replenish iron stores (ferritin levels > 100 g/L). Transferrin saturation levels > 50% and ferritin levels > 800 g/L are considered toxic and should be avoided. Besides, in patients with mild IDA and quiescent or clinical active IBD, IV iron should be the preferred route for iron supplementation. Fig. 3 summarizes our current work-up for the management of IDA in patients with IBD.

Summary

IDA is the most common systemic complication of patients with IBD and contributes significantly to the morbidity of the disease. The overall QoL in patients with IBD correlates strongly with Hb levels independently from underlying disease activity.
Iron deficiency and IDA in patients with IBD is still largely underdiagnosed and undertreated. Every patient with IBD should be screened regularly for IDA. The current ECCO guidelines recommend screenings every 6–12 months for quiescent IBD and at least every 3 months in active disease for outpatients. They recommend a screening panel including Hb, CBC, CRP and ferritin.
For the diagnosis of IDA, the same Hb cutoff values as in otherwise healthy adults apply (Hb < 12 g/dl for women and < 13 g/dl for men). The analysis of iron storage in patients with IBD is complicated by the fact that ferritin is an acute phase protein and can be increased in the setting of chronic inflammation, whereas transferrin is a negative acute phase protein and can be decreased. The current ECCO guidelines suggest adjusted cutoff values with ferritin less than 30 μg/liter in patients with mild disease or in remission and a cutoff of ferritin less than 100 μg/liter in patients with active disease. A new alternative parameter for iron availability to erythropoiesis is sTfR. It can be useful in unclear cases because it does not correlate with inflammation.
Anemia of chronic disease is likely if ferritin is over 100 μg/liter with a TfS less than 20%. If ferritin is between 30 and 100 μg/liter, and TfS is less than 20%, a combination of IDA and ACD is likely.
The goal of treatment of IDA should always be complete normalization of anemia and iron stores. Oral iron is widely available and cost efficient, but has been associated with an increased risk of GI side effects. It is an adequate first-line treatment in patients with mild anemia (Hb > 11 g/dl) whose disease is clinically inactive and who have not been previously intolerant to oral iron. Intravenous iron has been shown to increase Hb faster than oral iron and the new formulations have a favorable safety profile. It is recommended as a first-line treatment in patients with active disease, in patients with severe anemia, in patients with additional need for EPO-stimulating agents and in those with previous intolerance to oral iron.
Early formulations of intravenous iron (HMW iron dextran and to a lesser extent LMW iron dextran) have been associated with a risk of severe anaphylactoid reactions. This is not true for a number of new iron formulations that generally have a favorable safety profile. Iron sucrose and iron carboxymaltose are the formulations most extensively studied in patients with IBD but there are no large comparative trials between different formulations available in terms of safety or efficiency.
If anemia does not respond sufficiently to intravenous iron and (concurrent) ACD is possible, treatment with EPO and intravenous iron is recommended. Thereby, the target Hb should not be above 12 g/dl to minimize potential side effects (e.g. thromboembolism).
Following initiation of treatment, asymptomatic patients should be followed up at least within 4 weeks and symptomatic patients more frequently. When oral iron is used, tolerability should be assessed. A hematologic response is defined as an Hb increase over 2 g/dl or Hb normalization within 4 weeks.
Recurrence of IDA in patients with IBD occurs frequently and surprisingly quick. Fast recurrence of IDA does correlate with IBD disease activity. It is therefore recommended that every patient is screened every 3 months for 1 year following correction and every 6–12 months thereafter. Figure 1 summarizes the screening and treatment algorithm for IDA in patients with IBD described in this paper.

Intravenous (IV) iron therapy has been a major asset in the management of refractory iron-deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other diseases. However, the cost-effectiveness of parenteral substitution as the first-line treatment of this condition in IBD has been questioned. A study published by Reinisch et al. in this issue of the journal fails to show non-inferiority of iron isomaltose 1,000, a novel high-dose IV preparation, compared to oral iron sulfate.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^114ZYX35]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

Intravenous iron supplementation — indications, expected oral response thresholds, and infusion reaction management: Intravenous (IV) iron is indicated if a patient cannot tolerate oral iron or if blood counts or iron stores do not improve with oral iron supplementation. In anemic patients, hemoglobin levels should increase by 1 g/dL within 2 weeks in adherent patients on oral iron; a reasonable expectation is ferritin should increase in a month, and if these parameters are not met then IV iron should be used. IV iron should also be used when oral iron is unlikely to be effective due to impaired absorption (after bariatric surgery or with active inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]) or when iron loss exceeds oral absorption, although IV iron is substantially more expensive than oral formulations. Among available IV formulations, those that can replace iron deficits with 1 to 2 infusions are preferred. True allergy to IV iron is very rare, with most reactions being complement activation–related pseudo‑allergy; for mild reactions, stopping and restarting 15 minutes later at a slower rate will suffice, corticosteroids may help in more severe reactions, and diphenhydramine should be avoided because its side effects can mimic worsening reactions. Reported reaction rates are approximately 1:200 for mild reactions and 1:20,000 for major reactions.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115mg2GW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are some of the most common systemic complications of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Symptoms such as fatigue, reduced ability to concentrate and reduced exercise tolerance can mimic common symptoms of IBD and can therefore easily be overseen. Furthermore, clinicians tend to see mild to moderate anemia as an inevitable accompaniment of IBD that is sufficiently explained by the underlying disease and does not require further workup. But in contrast to these clinical routines, current guidelines recommend that any degree of anemia in patients with IBD should be further evaluated and treated. Multiple studies have shown that anemia is a main factor for decreased quality of life (QoL) in patients with IBD. Correction of anemia, however, can significantly improve the QoL of patients with IBD. It is therefore recommended that every patient with IBD is regularly screened for iron deficiency and anemia. If detected, appropriate workup and treatment should be initiated. Over the last years, a number of new diagnostic tools and treatment options have been developed. Multiple studies have demonstrated the safety of newer formulations of intravenous iron in patients with IBD and have compared oral and intravenous iron in various situations. Treatment recommendations have changed and new evidence-based guidelines were developed. However, to date these guidelines are still not widely implemented in clinical practice. The aim of this review is to draw attention to the need for treatment for every level of anemia in patients with IBD and to provide some practical guidance for screening, diagnostics, treatment and follow up of IDA in patients with IBD following current international guidelines.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^11531s8p]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — management of iron supplementation notes that although no formal recommendation is provided, clinicians should recognize available oral and intravenous formulations with varying costs and side effects, and in most patients an initial trial of oral supplementation should be given as it is generally effective, available, inexpensive, and safe. There is no strong evidence that any of the available oral formulations is more effective or better tolerated than the others. Historically, a daily dose of 150–200 mg of elemental iron has been recommended, but some studies suggest that lower dosing or every-other-day dosing may improve tolerability and absorption. Taking iron supplements with food or using enteric-coated formulations may improve tolerability but decrease absorption, and vitamin C co-administration is commonly recommended as it enhances absorption and may improve response to oral iron. If such a response is not seen, assessment for nonadherence (due to side effects or other reasons), malabsorption, or ongoing blood loss exceeding iron intake is needed. Intravenous iron may be appropriate in selected patients, such as those with impaired absorption due to prior gastric surgery, with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic kidney disease, or in whom blood loss exceeds the ability to replete iron orally, and consultation with a hematologist is often helpful when intravenous iron repletion is required.

Follow up

The goal of iron supplementation should always be complete normalization of Hb and iron storage. It should be kept in mind that even after normalization of Hb levels, iron storages are still not filled up because anemia is only the end point of iron deficiency. Iron treatments should be followed up clinically and using laboratory tests at least within 4 weeks in asymptomatic patients and more frequently in symptomatic patients. An important surveillance factor is the wellbeing of the patient. Clinically, QoL can improve within a few days after initiation of iron therapy and previous symptoms of anemia decrease.

An adequate erythropoietic response has been defined as an increase of Hb of at least 2 g/dl or normalization within 4 weeks. As described above, reticulocyte count and reticulocyte production index are faster parameters of successful treatment and will be increased within 1–2 weeks following oral or intravenous iron with or without EPO.

As described above, iron storage can be assessed using ferritin and transferrin saturation. During oral or intravenous iron supplementation, transferrin saturation can be falsely elevated. Ferritin levels also overestimate the iron available for erythropoiesis in the bone marrow during intravenous iron treatment. Therefore, assessment of iron storage should only be performed a minimum of 4 weeks after the last intravenous iron application. After termination of iron therapy, the parameters of iron storage should be above the lower limits of normal. A recent study has pointed out that the time until reoccurrence of iron deficiency in patients with IBD can be delayed with higher post-treatment ferritin values above 100 μg and even more so above 400 μg/liter. However, it was suggested that a ferritin level of 800 μg/liter and a transferrin saturation of 50% should be used as upper limits for intravenous iron to prevent iron overload.

Patients on oral iron should be monitored clinically about tolerability and side effects. In oral iron therapy, ferritin can be used for monitoring during treatment and is expected to increase within 1–2 weeks and Hb levels should also be monitored.

If a patient is on oral iron and the erythropoetic response is not adequate, or if oral iron is not tolerated, the patient should be switched to intravenous iron. If treatment with intravenous iron is not successful, other causes of anemia should be reevaluated. If (concomitant) ACD is possible, additional use of erythropoietin-stimulating factors should be considered. Optimal treatment of the underlying IBD is also an important factor in the treatment of anemia at all levels.

Inflammatory bowel disease

A third of patients with active IBD are estimated to have iron deficiency, though other mechanisms including vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, marrow suppression due to the anaemia of chronic disease, and overt blood loss may all contribute to the anaemic state.SF levels of up to 100 µg/L in the presence of inflammation may still reflect iron deficiency, and so an estimate of transferrin saturation may be helpful. The absorption of oral iron may be impaired by the systemic inflammatory process, as well as by small bowel involvement and/or previous surgery, and this may favour intravenous IRT in some cases.

Current European guidelines suggest that oral IRT in patients with IBD should contain no more than 100 mg elemental iron a day. Intravenous iron is indicated for those who are intolerant of oral iron and have moderate to severe IDA (Hb < 100 g/L). Optimising nutritional and pharmacological management to bring active IBD into remission would be expected to help improve IDA metrics and response to iron therapy.

It has been suggested that patients with IBD and IDA should be monitored for recurrent iron deficiency every 3 months for at least a year after correction, and periodically thereafter. Recurrent IDA may indicate persistent intestinal inflammatory activity even in the face of clinical remission and normal inflammatory biomarkers.

Maintenance therapy

After correction of the Hb level, iron deficiency and anemia reoccur frequently and surprisingly quickly in patients with IBD as the risk factors might continue. Thereby, a fast recurrence correlates with disease activity even in clinically asymptomatic patients with low inflammatory parameters. A recent follow-up study after intravenous iron replacement therapy in 88 patients revealed a median of only 10 months for reoccurrence of anemia and 19 months for reoccurrence of iron deficiency in patients with IBD and it was suggested that maintenance treatment may be needed.

The FERGImain study investigated intravenous maintenance therapy in patients with IBD who were previously successfully treated with intravenous iron carboxymaltose. Ferritin was controlled every 2 months and if it dropped below 100 μg, 500 mg of intravenous iron carboxymaltose (n = 105) or placebo (n = 99) were given for 8 months. In the treatment arm of the study, anemia reoccurred in 27% of patients compared with 39% in the placebo arm of the study. This was the first study to evaluate ferritin-guided maintenance therapy with intravenous iron.

In line with these studies, the current guidelines recommend that every patient with IBD is monitored for recurrence of IDA every 3 months for at least 1 year following correction of iron and at least every 6–12 months thereafter. Laboratory parameters should include Hb, ferritin, transferrin saturation and CRP. As soon as ferritin drops below 100 μg/liter or Hb falls below normal values, iron should be substituted using the same route as in the initial treatment.

Description

In this Clinical Practice Update (CPU), we will Best Practice Advice (BPA) guidance on the appropriate management of iron deficiency anemia.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation-related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: In individuals with inflammatory bowel disease and iron-deficiency anemia, clinicians first should determine whether iron-deficiency anemia is owing to inadequate intake or absorption, or loss of iron, typically from gastrointestinal bleeding. Active inflammation should be treated effectively to enhance iron absorption or reduce iron depletion. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Intravenous iron therapy should be given in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, iron-deficiency anemia, and active inflammation with compromised absorption. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: In individuals with portal hypertensive gastropathy and iron-deficiency anemia, oral iron supplements initially should be used to replenish iron stores. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in patients with ongoing bleeding who do not respond to oral iron therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: In individuals with portal hypertensive gastropathy and iron-deficiency anemia without another identified source of chronic blood loss, treatment of portal hypertension with nonselective β-blockers can be considered. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In individuals with iron-deficiency anemia secondary to gastric antral vascular ectasia who have an inadequate response to iron replacement, consider endoscopic therapy with endoscopic band ligation or thermal methods such as argon plasma coagulation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: In patients with iron-deficiency anemia and celiac disease, ensure adherence to a gluten-free diet to improve iron absorption. Consider oral iron supplementation based on the severity of iron deficiency and patient tolerance, followed by intravenous iron therapy if iron stores do not improve. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Deep enteroscopy performed in patients with iron-deficiency anemia suspected to have small-bowel bleeding angioectasias should be performed with a distal attachment to improve detection and facilitate treatment. Small-bowel angioectasias may be treated with ablative thermal therapies such as argon plasma coagulation or with mechanical methods such as hemostatic clips. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: Endoscopic treatment of angioectasias should be accompanied with iron replacement. Medical therapy for small-bowel angioectasias should be reserved for compassionate treatment in refractory cases when iron replacement and endoscopic therapy are ineffective.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease-a practical approach [^1122PKte]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Although anemia is the most common systemic manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), among the broad spectrum of extraintestinal disease complications encountered in IBD, including arthritis and osteopathy, it has generally received little consideration. However, not only in terms of frequency, but also with regard to its potential effect on hospitalization rates and on the quality of life and work, anemia is indeed a significant and costly complication of IBD. Anemia is multifactorial in nature, the most prevalent etiological forms being iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease. In a condition associated with inflammation, such as IBD, the determination of iron status using common biochemical parameters alone is inadequate. A more accurate assessment may be attained using new iron indices including reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells or zinc protoporphyrin. While oral iron supplementation has traditionally been a mainstay of IDA treatment, it has also been linked to extensive gastrointestinal side effects and possible disease exacerbation. However, many physicians are still reluctant to administer iron intravenously, despite the wide availability of a variety of new IV preparations with improved safety profiles, and despite the recommendations of international expert guidelines. This article discusses improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on new clinical insights into the regulation of iron homeostasis.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia in patients with IBD [^1114ViX9]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Anemia is the most prevalent extraintestinal complication of IBD. It can affect quality of life and ability to work, and can also increase the hospitalization rate in patients with IBD. Although the causes of anemia in IBD are multifactorial, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common. Assessment of the iron status of patients who have a condition associated with inflammation, such as IBD, by using common biochemical values is insufficient. However, new indices of iron metabolism (for instance ferritin:transferrin receptor ratio, reticulocyte hemoglobin content or percentage of hypochromic red blood cells) may help to improve the assessment of iron status in patients with IBD. The treatment of IDA traditionally involves oral iron supplementation. However, because of extensive gastrointestinal adverse effects, and data showing that the use of oral iron in IBD may be associated with disease exacerbation, current guidelines suggest that iron supplementation in IBD should be administered intravenously. This Review provides an overview of iron homeostasis in health before discussing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for IDA in patients with IBD.

Intravenous iron

The 2015 ECCO guidelines recommend intravenous iron as a first-line treatment in patients with active IBD, in patients with severe anemia (Hb < 10 g/dl), in patients with previous intolerance to oral iron and in patients with additional need for treatment with erythropoietin.

As described above, intravenous iron was shown to increase Hb levels faster and this is of particular importance in patients with severe anemia. In patients with decreased intestinal absorption of iron due to active mucosal inflammation, the intestinal route can be bypassed by using intravenous iron supplementation. The same applies for patients with concurrent ACD with upregulated hepcidin and downregulated iron absorption. Although intravenous iron is recommended as a first choice agent in the above-mentioned scenarios, it is widely underused in clinical practice. This can be due to lower availability, increased costs and inconvenience of intravenous application, but there are also some preconceptions that remain common among medical practitioners:

One common concern is that intravenous iron can exacerbate inflammation in general. As described above, iron is a nutrient for some kinds of bacteria. It is also a pro-oxidant and as such it can theoretically aggravate inflammation. Studies in animal models have illustrated that iron can exacerbate experimental sepsis. Human studies in contrast have shown a transient increase in markers for oxidative stress but no negative clinical outcomes in terms of infectious complications following intravenous iron treatment. With current literature an exact conclusion is not possible, but the risk for increased infection, if there is any, is likely very small.

It is also widely believed that intravenous iron is associated with a high risk of anaphylactoid reactions. While this was true for earlier formulations using high molecular weight (HMW) iron dextran, it is not true for the newer formulas that are the treatment standard today.

In summary, it can be said that intravenous iron with the formulations used today is safe to use in patients with IBD with a very low risk of adverse reactions and a generally favorable tolerability.

Managing intravenous iron therapy

The primary aims of iron supplementation therapy for IDA are to effect an increase in hemoglobin levels of > 2 g/ dL or achieve normal values within 4 weeks, to replenish iron stores (transferrin saturation > 30%), to relieve symptoms of anemia, and to thereby enhance quality of life.

In current practice, the Ganzoni Formula (Iron deficit [mg] = body weight [kg] x (target Hb-actual Hb [g/dL] x 2.4) + stored iron (500 mg)) is used to calculate individual iron requirement. However, this formula is error-prone, inconvenient and inconsistently applied in clinical practice, and in fact underestimates iron requirements. In a study comparing a novel fixed-dose regimen (Table 5) of ferric carboxymaltose (FERGIcor) with individually Ganzonicalculated doses of IS in IBD patients with IDA, the novel fixed-dose regimen was shown to be superior in terms of both efficacy and safety profile (Fig. 2).

Total iron dose with the ferric carboxymaltose dose regimen *

Response Rates at Week 12. Primary (Hb increase ≥ 2 g/dL) and secondary (Hb increase ≥ 2 g/dL or normal Hb) end points

Maintenance therapy

Despite successful treatment of IDA in IBD with IV iron, with or without EPO, anemia recurs frequently and surprisingly quickly. In their analysis of 88 patients from three prospective clinical trials, Gasché and co-workers demonstrated a recurrence of anemia in more than 50% of patients within one year, indicating the need for maintenance therapy. Based on these retrospective data, the authors initiated a prospective multicenter trial, in which patients who had successfully been treated with IV iron within the FERGIcor trial, and who were non-anemic at the end of the study, were randomized to receive either ferric carboxymaltose (500 mg iron) bimonthly or placebo. The results of this 8-month study showed that the administration of FCM prompted by a fall in serum ferritin concentration to below 100 µg/L led to a significantly increased likelihood of avoiding anemia recurrence in IBD. This study demonstrates for the first time that serum ferritin-triggered iron maintenance therapy is an effective and safe treatment strategy to prevent recurrence of anemia in patients who have responded to IV iron.

Iron deficiency, even in the absence of anemia, can be debilitating, and exacerbate any underlying chronic disease, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency is frequently concomitant with chronic inflammatory disease; however, iron deficiency treatment is often overlooked, partially due to the heterogeneity among clinical practice guidelines. In the absence of consistent guidance across chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease, we provide practical recommendations for iron deficiency to treating physicians: definition, diagnosis, and disease-specific diagnostic algorithms. These recommendations should facilitate appropriate diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

Treatment of iron deficiency with oral iron may lead to gastrointestinal intolerance though this may be related to the dose of iron replacement. New intravenous formulations have emerged which allow safe, rapid and effective correction of iron deficiency in IBD. In this article, we provide a review on the topic and cover recent progress in the field for the practicing gastroenterologist.

Screening

As outlined above, patients with IBD have a high risk of anemia, and if present, anemia is a main factor contributing to morbidity. It is therefore important that every patient with IBD is screened for anemia. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) recommend a laboratory screening using complete blood count (CBC), serum ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) for every patient with IBD in their 2015 guidelines. Screenings should be repeated every 6–12 months for patients in remission or with mild disease and at least every 3 months for patients with active disease in the outpatient setting. Vitamin B12 and folic acid should also be tested at least once a year if a patient has risk factors (e.g. extensive small bowel disease or resection, ileoanal pouch) or if macrocytosis is present. Figure 1 in section 'Summary' visualizes the recommended screening algorithm.

Current situation

In 2013, a study across nine European countries was performed to evaluate the routine practice in the management of IBD-associated anemia. A total of 344 gastroenterologists from nine European countries were surveyed; 56% of the patients had at least moderate anemia (Hb < 10 g/dl), 15% had severe anemia (Hb < 6 g/dl). It was reported that 92% of the patients were treated with iron, but only 28% received intravenous iron (67% oral iron) despite international guidelines that recommend intravenous iron as first-line treatment in moderate to severe IDA in patients with IBD. This demonstrates that intravenous iron remains underused in Europe. There is a need to increase awareness and implementation of the international guidelines. The high prevalence of iron deficiency also indicates that monitoring is not sufficient.

Another paper in 2012 evaluated 631 online patient surveys from patients with IBD and anemia. It was reported that 33% of these patients received no treatment for anemia. Of those treated, only 27% received intravenous iron. Depending on the formulation of oral iron, 68–77% of the patients were dissatisfied with oral iron, mostly because of poor tolerability. In contrast, 72% of the patients treated with intravenous iron were satisfied with their treatment.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD, evaluation, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) if the hemoglobin is below normal. Include the following in a more extensive workup: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, LDH, soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

Follow-up and recurrent IDA

12. Hb levels normalise with iron replacement therapy (IRT) in most cases of IDA, but IDA recurs in a minority of these on long-term follow-up (evidence quality — low, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

16. We recommend that long-term IRT may be an appropriate strategy when the cause of recurrent IDA is unknown or irreversible (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

23. After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

IDA should be treated with IRT as detailed in the Treatment section, and if the initial investigation reveals the cause, it should obviously be addressed as appropriate. However, the majority of individuals presenting with unexplained IDA will have negative BDE, no evidence of CD, no other symptoms, and a complete and sustained haematological response to IRT. In this situation, the outlook is generally favourable, and there is no need for further investigation other than a periodic blood count after completion of IRT to check for recurrent IDA. In an era of limited resources, we would suggest checks at perhaps 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.

Further investigation is however warranted if there is any evidence of active undiagnosed pathology. Pointers to this possibility include symptoms such as ongoing weight loss or chronic unexplained diarrhoea, persistently elevated inflammatory markers and the persistence or recurrence of IDA. Persistent IDA describes the situation where there is haematological evidence of ongoing iron deficiency despite adequate IRT, while in recurrent IDA the haematological abnormalities resulting from iron deficiency resolve with IRT, only to reappear at a later date.

Managing ID in IBDs

Characteristics of ID in IBDs

In the majority of cases, both absolute and functional ID are present in patients with IBD, resulting from the combination of different mechanisms — digestive blood loss (mainly chronic), malnutrition, impaired intestinal iron absorption, intestinal resection, inflammatory syndrome, and so on.

Iron biomarker thresholds

The criteria for the biological diagnosis of ID are controversial. The choice and definition of threshold values are complicated by the variable intensity of the inflammatory state that accompanies the relapses and remissions of chronic IBD. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation consensus proposes a definition that considers an associated inflammatory syndrome. ID is defined as serum ferritin ≤ 100 µg/L in the presence of concomitant inflammation (CRP ≥ 5 mg/L) or serum ferritin < 30 µg/L in the absence of inflammation (CRP < 5 mg/L); ID is absolute if serum ferritin is < 30 µg/L or TSAT is < 16% whereas ID is functional if serum ferritin is < 100 µg/L and TSAT is < 16%. According to the British Society of Gastroenterology, serum ferritin is the most specific assay for ID in the absence of inflammation — serum ferritin < 30 µg/L is generally indicative of low iron stores, and serum ferritin < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores. Therefore, serum ferritin < 15 µg/L is considered highly specific for ID; TSAT < 20% indicates iron restriction. In the presence of inflammation (for example, elevated CRP), the threshold for ID is serum ferritin < 100 µg/L.

Clinical evidence for iron therapy

A systematic review of randomized clinical trials comparing oral versus parenteral supplementation in adult patients with IBD included five trials with nearly 700 participants. Meta‐analysis of the data showed that the likelihood of increasing hemoglobin ≥ 2 g/dl was significantly higher with intravenous iron than with oral iron. In contrast, the latter was associated with a substantially higher incidence of treatment discontinuations for adverse events.

Treatment of ID is associated with a significant improvement in physical and mental quality of life, including in patients with ID without anemia.

Treatment

Anemia is one of the manifestations of IBD that often remains undertreated. It has to be considered that IDA is already the endpoint of iron deficiency. As described above, multiple studies have shown a strong correlation between Hb levels and quality of life in patients with IBD. Therefore, IDA should be treated in every patient with IBD, for every level of anemia. The goal of treatment should be complete normalization of anemia and iron stores.

In patients with IBD and iron deficiency without anemia, there is no clear evidence of benefits of iron supplementation. Studies in patients with congestive heart failure or in patients with chronic fatigue have demonstrated an increase in QoL when iron deficiency was treated, but there are no data available for patients with IBD. Therefore, the decision to treat iron deficiency without anemia should be based on the symptoms of the individual patient.

A number of comparative studies between oral and intravenous iron supplementation have been conducted and have confirmed that GI side effects are significantly less frequent when intravenous iron is used. – More recently, two meta-analyses could confirm these results. Furthermore, intravenous iron could replenish iron storage and improve anemia faster and more efficiently than oral iron in clinical studies, as well as in a recent meta-analysis. However, the clinical significance of faster Hb level increase remains unclear as differences in QoL were not different between the intravenous and the oral treatment arm. Disease activity was also not significantly different.

The choice of front-line therapy varies between continents. While intravenous iron is considered the standard treatment in patients with IBD (with active disease) in Europe, oral iron remains the first-line treatment in the US. Some authors propose intravenous administration as the preferred route for all patients with IBD (e.g. Gasche and colleagues), while other authors point out that both routes can be efficient and safe to use, especially when considering the facts that GI side effects to oral iron may be dose dependentand that newer oral formulations might minimize these effects.

Taking together all the evidence today and in line with current international guidelines, oral iron is sufficient in some situations but intravenous iron should be preferred in other specific clinical situations depending, for example, on side effects to oral iron, disease activity and level of anemia. The recommended algorithm for the treatment of IDA in patients with IBD is summarized in Figure 1 in section 'Summary'.

### Common misconceptions in the diagnosis and management of anemia in inflammatory bowel disease [^111rVJh3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Anemia is the most common systemic complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); so common that it is almost invariably not investigated and rarely treated. Several misconceptions are the reason for these clinical errors, and our goal will be to review them. The most common misconceptions are: anemia is uncommon in IBD; iron deficiency is also uncommon; just by treating the intestinal disease, anemia will be corrected; iron deficiency is the only cause for anemia in IBD; ferritin is an accurate parameter for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in IBD; the impact of anemia on the quality of life of IBD patients is limited; iron supplementation is rarely needed in IBD; high-dose oral iron solves the problem of iron malabsorption in IBD; intravenous (IV) iron is dangerous and of no proven benefit in IBD; IV iron is useful only for severe anemia; and erythropoietin has no role in the treatment of IBD anemia. These misconceptions are not evidence-based. On the contrary, there is enough evidence to support the following statements: (a) anemia is very common in IBD, (b) anemia should be investigated with care because many factors can be responsible, (c) treatment of anemia results in clear improvement in the objective parameters of well-being, especially in the quality of life, (d) IV iron is safe and effective in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in IBD patients, and (e) erythropoietin is useful in a subset of patients with refractory anemia. Anemia diagnosis and treatment must not be neglected in IBD patients, and several misconceptions should be promptly abandoned.

### Updates in the management of iron deficiency anemia… [^113e6AoE]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Lilian White, MD Posted on April 28, 2025 Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia globally, comprising an estimated 50% of patients with anemia. Women younger than 50 years are the most likely population to be affected. Iron deficiency due to poor nutrition is the most common cause of anemia in children. Iron deficiency without anemia is estimated to be twice as prevalent as iron deficiency with anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is caused by gastrointestinal bleeding, menstrual blood loss, impaired absorption, inadequate dietary intake, and inflammatory conditions. Iron deficiency results from reduced iron intake, absorption, losses or reduced mobilization of iron from bodily stores. Effects of iron deficiency anemia include reduced cognition in children and older adults, as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is generally based on deficient iron stores and anemia.

A serum ferritin level of < 45 mg/dL is indicative of iron deficiency, demonstrating an 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold is recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association. In patients with an elevated serum ferritin due to inflammation, alternative markers of iron status such as transferrin saturation may be considered. In adults, evaluation of iron deficiency anemia involves noninvasive screening for celiac disease and. Helicobacter pylori infection. The AGA guidelines additionally recommend bidirectional endoscopy in men and postmenopausal women with iron deficiency anemia. Endoscopy may also be considered in premenopausal women; however, a trial of oral iron supplementation is a reasonable initial step in these patients in the absence of concerning symptoms. A hemoglobin increase of greater than 1. 0 g/dL over 1 month is considered a successful response and supports the diagnosis.

In children, mild iron deficiency anemia may be treated initially with oral iron supplementation for 1 month without additional testing. As in adults, an increase of greater than 1. 0 g/dL of hemoglobin over 1 month is considered supportive of the diagnosis. In those who do not respond to empiric treatment, further evaluation for gastrointestinal bleeding and referral to a gastroenterologist is recommended. According to a recent AGA Clinical Practice Update, ferrous sulfate is the preferred form of iron replacement due to its affordability. However, the guidelines indicate that no specific form of iron supplementation has demonstrated superior effectiveness. Several studies have demonstrated the improved tolerability of __iron bisglycinate__ compared with ferrous sulfate, noting fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects and similar effectiveness in adults and children.

The cost of iron bisglycinate supplementation is about $15 for 60 tablets vs $10 for 200 tablets of iron sulfate, making it a little more expensive. Additionally, availability in pharmacies may vary. Intravenous iron replacement is typically recommended by the AGA updated guidelines for patients who cannot tolerate oral iron, exhibit poor absorption, or fail to demonstrate improvement with oral iron supplementation. Compared with oral iron, IV iron does not reduce mortality or the need for blood transfusions in adults with iron deficiency anemia, and it may increase the risk of infection, according to a 2022 FPIN Clinical Inquiry.

### Supplementation with oral vs. intravenous iron for anemia with IBD or gastrointestinal bleeding: is oral iron getting a bad rap? [^113Kgfo6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Although iron supplementation is commonly prescribed, the amount of elemental iron needed to achieve clinical efficacy, and the optimal method of supplementation, are under debate. Use of intravenous (IV) iron replacement is increasingly being advocated. We explore the physiology of iron supplementation, review clinical data suggesting that the typical oral dosing of iron may be excessive, and compare IV and oral methods of iron supplementation with a focus on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Both IV and oral iron can effectively raise hemoglobin levels in iron-deficiency anemia. There is no evidence that IV iron can raise hemoglobin at a faster pace. Side effects of oral iron are probably related to the relatively high doses of elemental iron that are typically prescribed. Emerging data suggest that low-dose iron has comparable efficacy, with fewer side effects. In IBD, both oral and IV iron are effective, and there is no convincing evidence that oral iron activates or exacerbates clinical symptoms. The use of a low starting dose of oral iron, such as one ferrous sulfate tablet per day, for treatment of iron deficiency is worth considering.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^1117adsh]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

2 CONCLUSIONS

Iron deficiency is a very common but often overlooked condition, especially in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. It is a highly relevant comorbidity and accounts for poor outcomes, prolonged hospitalization and poor QoL in this patient population. Here, we have proposed several practical recommendations for the definition and diagnosis of iron deficiency in CHF, CKD and IBD. Based on this definition and diagnosis threshold, simple diagnostic algorithms and management for these conditions have been discussed. The intention of these recommendations is to provide consensus expert opinion where there is variability in the guidelines or gaps in the current evidence base.

Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) in inflammatory bowel disease — erythropoietin (EPO) use — should be reserved for symptomatic patients who have not responded to intravenous (IV) iron despite aggressive IBD management and who may otherwise require repeated blood transfusions; when used, concomitant IV iron is advised to maintain TSAT ≥ 20% and serum ferritin ≥ 200 μg/L, and hemoglobin levels above 12 g/dL should be avoided due to thrombotic and cardiovascular risk.

### Iron replacement in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114G4vn1]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

A number of controlled trials and prospective studies have compared intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) iron for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia with mixed results.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of trials published on 2014 that compared IV with PO iron to treat in patients with IBD. Meta-analysis was performed to generate effect estimates. Quality assessment was also performed according to GRADE criteria.

Results

Five studies met our inclusion criteria, enrolling 694 patients. For the primary outcome of "response" (hemoglobin rise > 2 g/dL), there was no significant difference between IV or PO iron; risk ratio for response with IV was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.9–1.2; P = 0.2). For the secondary outcome of mean change in hemoglobin (g/dL), the mean difference between PO and IV iron was not statistically significant (mean difference, 0.6 g/dL, 96% CI, -0.1 to 1.3; P = 0.08). IV iron was associated with a significantly greater initial rise in serum ferritin compared with PO iron (mean difference 89 ng/mL; 95% CI, 29–148, P = 0.003). There was a lower risk of withdrawal due to adverse events in these trials in the IV iron cohorts when compared with PO iron (risk ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1–1.0; P = 0.05).

Conclusions

We found no significant difference between IV and PO iron in correcting iron-deficiency anemia in patients with IBD in this meta-analysis. Patients who received IV iron had a greater rise in serum ferritin and were less likely to stop treatment due to adverse events, when compared with those who received PO iron.

### Assessment of gaps in care and the development of a care pathway for anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases [^114JgTaN]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Anemia is a common complication among patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and is associated with high rates of IBD-related complications, resource utilization, and impaired quality of life. Despite practice guidelines for anemia in patients with IBD, gaps remain in the perceptions of anemia among health care providers. The aims of this study were to identify gaps in care and to develop a care pathway for anemia in patients with IBD.

Methods

The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America anemia care pathway was developed by a committee using principles of cognitive task analysis. Focus groups of providers of patients with IBD were performed to identify domains of perceptions and management decisions for anemia and IBD. Knowledge elicitation from subject experts in anemia was conducted using case-based scenarios of patients with IBD and anemia to determine decision-making branch points. The care pathway was modified in an iterative fashion to encompass clinical presentations of anemia in IBD and potential barriers to the recognition, management, and follow-up of anemia.

Results

Variations were observed in how providers define iron deficiency, thresholds for treatment of anemia, and route of iron therapy. A care pathway for anemia incorporating the World Health Organization definition of anemia, universal hemoglobin and ferritin screening, evaluation of iron stores using ferritin and transferrin saturation, management of anemia based on adequacy of iron stores, and follow-up was developed.

Conclusions

The authors identified domains of how providers perceive and manage patients with IBD and anemia, and developed a care pathway to align clinical practices with guideline recommendations.

### Noninvasive testing… [^115WmkBo]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In anemia, iron deficiency is best diagnosed using a ferritin threshold of less than 45 ng per mL.
- Patients with IDA should receive noninvasive testing for H. pylori and celiac disease.
- Bidirectional endoscopy is recommended in all adults with IDA.
- Video capsule endoscopy is not recommended in asymptomatic adults with IDA. From the AFP Editors Iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia worldwide. It affects 3% of adults and is slightly more common in women younger than 50 years. The American Gastroenterological Association developed guidelines for the evaluation of IDA in adults. Diagnosing Iron Deficiency The AGA defines anemia as a hemoglobin level of less than 13 g per dL in men and less than 12 g per dL in patients who are not pregnant. Serum ferritin testing is commonly used to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with anemia.

Based on a systematic review, the AGA recommends using a ferritin threshold value of less than 45 ng per mL for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold has 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for iron deficiency. Without anemia, the ferritin threshold for iron deficiency is uncertain. Ferritin testing is less accurate in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, and additional tests including serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, and C-reactive protein can help diagnose iron deficiency. Noninvasive Testing Several common conditions associated with IDA can be diagnosed noninvasively, before or after endoscopy. Frequent blood donation, nutritional deficiencies, or malabsorption syndromes may be suggested by initial evaluation. Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with iron deficiency caused by atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria, which reduce iron absorption. Treating H.

pylori infection improves the benefit of iron supplementation in anemia. After negative bidirectional endoscopy results, the AGA suggests noninvasive testing and treatment for H. pylori in IDA by urea breath testing, although stool antigen testing and serology can also be used. Celiac disease is another common cause of iron deficiency. The AGA suggests serologic testing for celiac disease in patients with iron deficiency, especially those with a family history of the disease, a personal history of autoimmune diseases, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Small bowel biopsy during endoscopy is recommended only if celiac serology is positive. Endoscopy Bidirectional endoscopy is the primary means of evaluation for IDA, although evidence of patient-oriented benefit is lacking.

In men and postmenopausal women with IDA, bidirectional endoscopy is recommended based on diagnosis of colonic malignancy in 9% and upper gastrointestinal malignancy in 2% of patients, more than 10 times the rate of colorectal cancer found in routine screening. The AGA also suggests endoscopy in premenopausal women with IDA because malignancy is diagnosed in 1% of this population. In younger patients who might have a plausible nonmalignant cause of anemia, iron replacement can be offered without further exploration. During esophagogastroduodenoscopy, routine gastric biopsies are not recommended. Although autoimmune atrophic gastritis can be diagnosed by gastric biopsy, it has not been shown to improve long-term outcomes. H. pylori can also cause atrophic gastritis, but it can be diagnosed noninvasively. After normal bidirectional endoscopy, small bowel video capsule endoscopy is not recommended without symptoms because evidence of benefit is lacking.

Dosage of intravenous iron

Traditionally, the iron deficit (in mg) of a patient with IDA was calculated using the Ganzoni formula: [body weight in kg × (target Hb – actual Hb in g/dl) × 0.24 + 500].

In 2011, the FERRIcor trial compared a new, simplified fixed dose regimen for carboxymaltose with individually calculated doses of iron sucrose following the Ganzoni formula in 489 patients with IBD and IDA. Subjects received up to three doses of 500 or 1000 mg of ferric carboxymaltose, or up to 11 infusions of 200 mg iron sucrose. Significantly more patients in the group of the new fixed dose regimen had a Hb response (Hb increase > 2 mg/dl) or Hb normalization by week 12. The compliance to study protocol was larger in this group; the safety profile was favorable in both groups. It was suggested that the Ganzoni formulation underestimates the iron requirements for patients with IBD because of ongoing GI bleeds and malabsorption. The 2015 ECCO guidelines therefore recommend the new simplified dosage scheme for treatment with intravenous iron in general (not only for ferric carboxymaltose for which it was validated).

Patients with severe anemia with an Hb greater than 7 g/dl were not included in the FERRIcor trial. In these cases, the ECCO guidelines recommend an additional 500 mg of intravenous iron.

In patients with symptomatic iron deficiency without anemia, a minimum of 500–1000 mg of iron is recommended in the current ECCO guidelines. This is based on a study that showed an improved QoL following treatment with 1000 mg of intravenous iron in otherwise healthy women with symptomatic iron deficiency. Another study in patients with IBD could demonstrate a decreased rate of recurrence of anemia when iron deficiency without anemia was treated with intravenous iron.

Table 3 summarizes the simplified dosage scheme for intravenous iron recommended by the ECCO 2015 guidelines.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^115bHVQo]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Diagnosis of iron deficiency without anemia

Iron deficiency with relevant clinical symptoms can be present even before anemia develops as a long-term consequence. In such cases, early changes in the CBC, for example an increased RDW or an MCH close to the lower limit of normal, can represent early manifestations of iron deficiency. As described above, the reticulocyte count can be decreased even before erythrocyte indices are affected. Iron storage indices can also be interpreted in a similar way as in the diagnosis of IDA: in patients with IBD and no clinical, endoscopic or biochemical sign of active disease, a ferritin level below 15–30 μg/liter is diagnostic for iron deficiency. In the case of active disease, a ferritin level up to 100 μg/liter can still be consistent with iron deficiency. A TfS below 20% reflects a reduced availability of iron for erythropoiesis, either due to total iron deficiency or due to functional iron deficiency (e.g. in chronic inflammation or following treatment with erythropoietin). It was suggested that a TfS below 20% with a ferritin below 100 μg/liter defines total iron deficiency. A TfS below 20% and a ferritin above 100 μg/liter were defined as functional iron deficiency. In otherwise unclear cases, sTfR can also be useful.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease-a practical approach [^116DXivf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in IBD

Iron supplementation should be administered in all cases of manifest anemia. Cases of iron deficiency without manifest anemia require an individualized approach according to clinical symptoms. In these cases, the timing and type of therapy is determined according to symptoms, etiology, degree of severity and dynamics of the hemoglobin decrease, and the comorbidities and risks of therapy. Iron supplementation can be administered orally or intravenously.

Oral iron administration

Oral iron supplementation has been the therapy of choice for many years. Despite recent recommendations of international expert guidelines, the use of IV iron preparations remains the subject of safety worries and is therefore still widely considered a last resort.

In IBD patients, iron(II) or iron(III) compounds may be administered orally in the absence of absolute indications for IV therapy (see below), and in IBD patients with mild anemia (Hb > 10 g/dL) and inactive disease oral iron replacement can be used. This approach is supported by an the recently published study of Lomer et al and our own data, which showed, that intestinal iron absorption is normal in quiescent or mildly active IBD patients.

However, as more than 90% of ingested iron remains unabsorbed, oral iron supplementation is associated with the frequent occurrence of gastrointestinal adverse effects, such as nausea, flatulence, diarrhea and gastric erosion. Furthermore, a potential for the exacerbation of IBD through the generation of reactive oxygen species (Fenton reaction) by non-absorbed iron has been revealed in both animal and human studies. Upon initiation of oral iron supplementation, the patient's response, tolerance and adherence should therefore be monitored. Patients showing insufficient response (Hb increase < 2 g/dL within 4 weeks) or intolerance to oral iron, as well those with severe IDA (≤ 10 g/dL) and active disease (CRP > 5 mg/L), should receive IV iron as first-line therapy.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease-a practical approach [^111bryez]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Intravenous iron administration

IV iron therapy is recommended for iron-deficient patients who display intolerance or an inadequate response to oral preparations (i.e. insufficient increase in serum iron parameters within the first two weeks of treatment), severely anemic patients (Hb level < 10 g/dL), those who have pronounced disease activity, and those undergoing treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs).

However, although the clinical efficacy and good safety profile of IV iron have been clearly demonstrated in a number of observational and controlled studies in UC and CD patients, many gastroenterologists are still apparently reluctant to administer iron intravenously, for fear of hypersensitivity reactions.

There are now six IV iron preparations available which have a good safety record in other diseases (Table 4). Over the last decade, iron sucrose (IS) has become standard of care in IBD, due to its proven efficacy, wide availability and excellent safety record. However, since a large number and frequency of applications is required (maximum dose 600 mg per week) and administration is relatively time-consuming (3.5 h for a 500 mg dose), the practicality of IS for the achievement of high level iron repletion is limited.

Table 4
Preparations available for intravenous iron supplementation (April 2012)

A new option for iron supplementation is the recently-approved, novel generation of so-called Type I IV iron preparations, which can be applied in high single doses (so-called "total dose infusions, TDi"). As yet, data in IBD patients are available only for low molecular weight (LMW) iron dextran preparations and ferric carboxymaltose.

The efficacy and safety of LMW - iron dextran preparations (e.g. Cosmofer ®) in IBD patients with IDA have been studied both in children and in adults, demonstrating a significant hematopoietic response. However, iron dextrans have been associated with the occurrence of IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions, reported in these studies to be 2–6% in spite of a successful test infusion. LMW - iron dextran preparations allow the total iron dose to be given in only 1–2 infusions. However, administration of LMW-iron dextran at this dose level is time-consuming, taking some 4–6 h. This not only inconvenient, but also results in loss of patient productivity.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114GqNiA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The most important cause of iron deficiency in patients with IBD is increased iron loss due to ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from the inflamed mucosa. In addition, iron absorption can be reduced due to inflamed intestinal mucosa, especially if the duodenum is affected. Other causes include patients who have undergone upper GI surgery. Dietary restrictions in patients with IBD may also play a prominent role. When iron storages are exhausted, anemia occurs.

Although iron deficiency can often be identified as the most important cause of anemia, the pathogenesis of anemia in patients with IBD is complex and often multifactorial. The second most common cause is anemia of chronic disease (ACD) and in a relevant proportion of patients, both etiologies are present. In fact, IBD is a classic example for concurrent iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and ACD and anemia due to both entities is a clear marker of active disease in patients with IBD.

However, ACD is not an IBD-specific clinical problem. It can be found in patients with a variety of chronic infections or inflammation as well as other chronic conditions that are associated with immune activation such as malignancies or other autoimmune diseases.

In ACD inflammatory cytokines are upregulated and can induce changes in the iron homeostasis through multiple pathways. Thereby, the acute phase protein hepcidin plays a central role. It is generated in the liver and upregulated by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 and lipopolysaccharides. If upregulated, hepcidin blocks the basolateral iron exporter ferroportin 1 on duodenal enterocytes, macrophages and hepatocytes. This results in a reduced intestinal absorption of iron and in a shift of iron from the circulation to the storage sites. These effects combined can in turn create functional iron deficiency. In addition, other proinflammatory cytokines, most notably tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin 1 and interferon α, β and γ, can have an inhibitory effect on multiple steps of erythropoiesis: The proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells are directly impaired by inflammatory cytokines, erythropoietin response is often inadequate for the level of anemia and the responsiveness of the erythroid progenitor cells to erythropoietin is also decreased when inflammatory cytokines are elevated. In addition, free radicals and proinflammatory cytokines can potentially cause direct damage to erythrocytes resulting in an increased degree of erythrophagocytosis and a reduced erythrocyte half-life.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^112Vtput]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

Diagnostic work-up of iron deficiency in IBD

Anemia is defined by the WHO as a decline in blood hemoglobin to a concentration of < 12 g/dL (120 g/L) in women and < 13 g/dL (130 g/L) in men, parameters which are equally applicable to patients with IBD. When anemia is assessed on the basis of hemoglobin levels, the influence of a range of other factors must, however, be taken into account: pregnancy, altitude, cigarette smoking, and possibly ethnicity. The WHO has therefore additionally issued respective international minimum levels for hemoglobin and hematocrit (Table 2).

Table 2
Minimum hemoglobin and hematocrit levels used to define anemia in people living at sea level

The standard parameters of iron deficiency, low MCV and low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) are generally reliable. However, iron deficiency as the cause of anemia cannot be ruled out on the grounds of a normal MCV, since up to 40% of "pure" IDA cases are normocytic (e.g. in IBD patients treated with azathioprine or 6-MP). Conversely, low MCV does not necessarily indicate ID, as the presence of ACD can cause it to be normal or low. A substantially more accurate IDA diagnosis can be attained by the additional determination of iron metabolism parameters. In principle, all components of the body's iron metabolism can be conveniently monitored using routine laboratory methods:

Iron stores: serum ferritin
Iron transport: transferrin saturation
Iron utilization: erythropoiesis: i.e. proportion of hypochromic erythrocytes or reticulocytes

Serum iron concentrations are governed by a circadian rhythm and can be low even in cases of anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Its role in the work-up of iron deficiency therefore, obsolete.

14.1 Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

The safety and efficacy of ACCRUFER for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia was studied in two randomized, placebo-controlled trials: AEGIS 1 (NCT01252221) and AEGIS 2 (NCT01340872). These trials enrolled 128 patients (age range 18–76 years; 45 males and 83 females) with quiescent IBD (58 patients with Ulcerative Colitis [UC] and 70 patients with Crohns disease [CD]) and baseline Hb concentrations between 9.5 g/dL and 12 /13 g/dL for females / males and ferritin < 30 mcg/L. All patients had discontinued prior oral ferrous product treatment due to lack of efficacy or inability to tolerate oral iron replacement products. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either 30 mg ACCRUFER twice daily or a matched placebo control for 12 weeks.

The major efficacy outcome was the mean difference in Hb concentration from baseline to week 12 between ACCRUFER and placebo. The Least Square [LS] mean difference from baseline was 2.18 g/dL (p < 0.0001)(see Table 2).

The LS mean difference in change from baseline Hb to Week 4 and 8 between ACCRUFER and placebo were 1.04 g/dl and 1.73 g/dl, respectively.

The mean ferritin (mcg/L) levels in ACCRUFER subjects at baseline were 8.6 mcg/L [SD 6.77]) and the mean ferritin (mcg/L) levels at Week 12 were 26.0 mcg/L [SD 30.57] with a mean overall improvement of 17.3 mcg/L.

Following completion of the 12-week placebo-controlled phase of the studies, eligible patients transitioned to ACCRUFER 30 mg twice daily open-label treatment for an additional 52 weeks.

During the open-label phase with ACCRUFER, the mean change in Hb concentration from baseline to Week 64 was 3.1 g/dL [SD 1.46 g/dL, n = 35] and the ferritin value demonstrated a mean of 68.9 mcg/L [SD 96.24] at 64 weeks, with a mean overall improvement of 60.4 mcg/L.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^113xmMC9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on management of iron deficiency anemia — best practice advice includes: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation–related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss.

### Effectiveness and safety of ferric carboxymaltose treatment in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease and other gastrointestinal diseases [^111F63Sy]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

In terms of anemia treatment, a secondary efficacy parameter, a rapid increase in the reticulocyte count was observed within 2 weeks of iron administration using FCM and translated into anemia correction already at approximately 4 weeks. Over the observational period, the Hb levels were seen to evolve from a pre-treatment mean of 9.5 g/dL (5.9 mmol/L) to an acceptable 11.4 g/dL (7.1 mmol/L) by 5–8 weeks and achieve acceptable concentrations of 11.9 g/dL (7.4 mmol/L) by weeks 9–12.

In recent studies of FCM use in an adult IBD population, similar results were observed, namely the correction of Hb to acceptable levels, albeit with a large proportion of patients not achieving or maintaining appropriate iron repletion. In this study the authors concluded that sufficient doses of iron may not have been given and that perhaps the current guidelines are not entirely suitable for optimal anemia management. In the follow-up study to assess maintenance therapy (beyond initial iron deficiency correction) it was confirmed that anemia recurrence could be avoided in a large percentage of patients by means of continued iron management based on decreased serum ferritin values. Whilst not currently our routine practice nor part of this observational study, such a maintenance strategy may warrant further investigation and provide rationale for more routine monitoring of iron parameters in our patients.

Although anemia and iron deficiency are highly prevalent in pediatric patients with IBD, focus of treatment lies often only on intestinal inflammation, which results in a slow hematological recovery. Further to anemia management, the administration of iron also appeared to result in decreases respectively normalization of white cell count, platelets and C-reactive protein. These observations might suggest a role of iron therapy also in reducing inflammation and normalization of secondary thrombocytosis in IBD, however should be interpreted with caution, as medication changes were not captured as part of this study. As the majority of our patients received concomitant, mostly immunosuppressive, medication, such findings need to be confirmed in appropriately designed clinical studies. However, similar reductions have been seen in other studies using FCM, where a decrease of platelets was observed independent of inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein. Therefore, decreases in platelet count in our study may reflect normalized bone marrow activity rather than reduced inflammation.

### Intravenous iron sucrose versus oral iron supplementation for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease – a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study [^111YiyBU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Anemia is a frequent complication in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The optimal route for iron supplementation to replenish iron stores has not been determined so far. We therefore evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravenous iron sucrose as compared with oral iron sulfate for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in patients with IBD.

Methods

A randomized, prospective, open-label, multicenter study was performed in 46 patients with anemia and transferrin saturation ≤ 20% and/or serum ferritin concentrations ≤ 20 microg/L. The intravenous group received a single dose of iron sucrose of 7 mg iron/kg body weight, followed by five 200 mg infusions for the following 5 wks. The oral group received iron sulfate 100–200 mg per day for 6 wks.

Results

While a comparable increase in hemoglobin was observed for both administration routes (median increase 0.25 g/L in the intravenous group vs 0.21 g/L in the oral group), only iron sucrose led to a rise in serum ferritin concentrations. Intractable gastrointestinal adverse events caused permanent study drug discontinuation in five patients (20.8%) receiving iron sulfate, whereas only one patient (4.5%) had to be withdrawn because of side effects due to iron sucrose.

Conclusions

Although being equal in short-term efficacy and overall tolerability our results suggest a better gastrointestinal tolerability for iron sucrose. Larger trials are mandatory to prove a possible advantage of iron sucrose in short- and long-term efficacy as well as in tolerability over iron sulfate in the management of IDA in IBD.

For patients with intolerance or failure of Hb response at the 2–4 weeks point, alternate day traditional iron salts (if not already used) or ferric maltol may be alternatives to parenteral iron on those with mild-moderate anaemia (Hb > 95 g/L). The tolerability and response should be assessed, and failure of the Hb to rise by 10 g/L at 4 weeks for alternate day iron, or 6 weeks for ferric maltol, indicates the need for parenteral IRT.

Regular Hb monitoring is recommended to ensure an ultimately satisfactory response. The optimal interval is not clear, but every 4 weeks until the Hb is in the normal range seems reasonable. After normalisation of the Hb, oral iron needs to be continued to replenish the iron stores. Traditionally it has been recommended that oral iron is continued for 2–3 months to do this. However, the duration required and indeed the appropriate measure of true iron repletion are both unclear. In healthy, almost iron-replete subjects, 2 months of continued iron was considered sufficient. However, in patients with chronic disease, continuing blood loss, impaired absorption or GI inflammatory disease (where iron is lost from the GI mucosa), it is likely that a longer period would be required.

Infliximab (+intravenous iron)

Successful treatment of the underlying IBD can improve mucosal inflammation and GI blood loss and thereby improve anemia (for treatment guidelines, see Dignass and colleagues, Wehkamp and colleagues and Gomollón and colleagues –). In addition to this effect, treatment with the anti-TNF agent infliximab is thought to have a direct beneficial effect on the pathogenesis of anemia in patients with IBD. As described above, IDA and ACD frequently coexist in patients with IBD and TNFα and other inflammatory cytokines are involved in the development of ACD. An in vitro study demonstrated that blockage of TNFα with infliximab could increase the amount of erythroid precursor cells. In a study of 87 patients with IBD receiving infliximab and intravenous iron sucrose, 49.4% could reach the target Hb level of 12 g/dl. Following treatment with infliximab, erythropoetin (EPO) levels and sTFR levels initially increased, which is consistent with functional iron deficiency. After subsequent therapy with iron sucrose, EPO and sTFR levels decreased significantly. These results demonstrate why the combination of intravenous iron and infliximab might be particularly beneficial.

Erythropoetin

When anemia in patients with IBD does not respond adequately to optimal treatment of the underlying IBD and intravenous supplementation of iron, (concurrent) ACD should be thought of. If ACD is likely, additional treatment with EPO should be considered.

As described above, ACD is frequent in patients with IBD and frequently coexists with IDA. However, treatment with EPO remains a second-line treatment for patients with severe or symptomatic anemia refractory to intravenous iron alone due to high costs and potential side effects. A number of clinical trials could demonstrate successful treatment of IBD related anemia previously refractory to iron therapy using additional EPO. – Thereby, laboratory parameters predictive for a poor response to iron supplementation alone are low serum EPO levels for the degree of anemia as well as low levels of transferrin and sTfR.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^113bSGbB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Anemia represents one of the most frequent complications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and severely impairs the quality of life of affected patients. The etiology of anemia in IBD patients can be multifactorial, often involving a combination of iron deficiency (ID) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Although current guidelines recommend screening for and treatment of anemia in IBD patients, current observational data suggest that it still remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Besides basic laboratory parameters (e.g. mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, etc.), the concentration of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and novel parameters such as the sTfR/log ferritin index can guide the challenging task of differentiating between ID and ACD. Once identified, causes of anemia should be treated accordingly. This review summarizes our current understanding of anemia in IBD patients, including the underlying pathology, diagnostic approaches and appropriate anemia treatment regimens.
