## Question

is imitrex safe during pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Imitrex (sumatriptan) is safe to use during pregnancy and how to counsel on its use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory baseline and what the FDA labeling says. Then, I should verify the human pregnancy data, especially registry and observational cohorts. Next, I will review animal toxicity data to understand mechanistic concerns. After that, I need to check guideline positions from ACOG and other authorities. I will then examine trimester-specific considerations, including the naproxen component if using Treximet. Finally, I should confirm maternal risk–benefit framing, lactation guidance, and practical prescribing recommendations with monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. The FDA's current Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR) no longer uses the old A–X categories. Instead, it provides a narrative risk summary emphasizing that prospective registry and epidemiologic studies have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of malformations with sumatriptan compared with the general population, while noting animal data showing embryolethality and fetal abnormalities at high exposures, which supports a risk–benefit framework rather than a categorical prohibition [^113WxAKx] [^112w5DXV].

> Wait, let me verify the human data signal. The largest dataset comes from the international Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet Pregnancy Registry with 626 exposed pregnancies. Major birth defects occurred in 4.2% with first-trimester exposure and 4.2% with any-trimester exposure, which aligns with the 2–4% background risk in the general population and the 2.2–2.9% background in women with migraine, and the registry had adequate power to detect a 1.73–1.91 fold increase if present, which was not observed [^111dRNf8] [^114TThfH]. I should also confirm corroborating population data: Swedish and Norwegian registry analyses likewise did not show increased malformation risk with first-trimester sumatriptan exposure, with relative risk estimates around 0.99–1.16, which is reassuring [^116YVgSM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check for any concerning signals. The registry flagged small clusters of ventricular septal defects and pyloric stenosis, but these did not exceed expected background frequencies and did not form a consistent teratogenic pattern; additionally, a large cohort study found no association between prenatal triptan exposure and ADHD at age 5, which helps address longer-term neurodevelopmental concerns, though confounding remains possible in observational designs [^111dRNf8] [^111tiDnn]. Let me also consider broader syntheses: meta-analytic data indicate no significant increase in major malformations, low birth weight, or preterm delivery among triptan users compared with the general population, supporting class-level reassurance for sumatriptan as the best-studied agent [^112K7f7j].

> I will now examine the animal data to ensure we are not missing a mechanistic red flag. In rats and rabbits, oral and intravenous sumatriptan produced embryolethality, fetal vascular and skeletal abnormalities, and pup mortality at doses at or near those causing maternal toxicity; however, no-effect doses were generally several-fold above human exposure, and effects occurred in the context of maternal toxicity, which tempers direct extrapolation to humans at therapeutic doses [^111dRNf8] [^115EP5FU] [^11564LMD]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the no-effect dose in rabbits was 50 mg/kg/day; let me correct that — some rabbit studies showed embryolethality at 100 mg/kg/day orally and 2 mg/kg/day IV, with no-effect doses lower than those, underscoring that toxicity is dose dependent and often maternal-toxicity related in animals [^115EP5FU] [^11564LMD].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to align clinical advice. ACOG advises that sumatriptan can be considered when benefits outweigh risks across trimesters, with a preference for acetaminophen first-line; if sumatriptan is used, employ the lowest effective dose and shortest duration, and if sumatriptan–naproxen is used beyond 48 hours in mid to late pregnancy, consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid due to NSAID-related risks [^111dRNf8] [^113WxAKx]. I should double-check other authorities: the VA/DoD guideline notes limited but emerging evidence suggesting triptans are as safe as, and more effective than, older agents like butalbital compounds in select pregnant patients, supporting individualized use when necessary, and Nature Reviews Neurology similarly supports sporadic sumatriptan after acetaminophen failure under specialist supervision [^115DxCP6] [^112VmZNd].

> Let me consider trimester-specific nuances. In the first trimester, the human data are most robust and do not show increased malformation risk. In the second trimester, use remains acceptable with caution. In the third trimester, isolated sumatriptan is not contraindicated, but sumatriptan–naproxen should be avoided after 30 weeks due to NSAID risks including ductal constriction and oligohydramnios, with monitoring if exposure occurs beyond 48 hours in mid to late gestation [^112VmZNd] [^113Fr3uC]. I need to ensure I distinguish the components: the concern in late pregnancy is driven by naproxen, not sumatriptan itself, so pure sumatriptan remains the preferred triptan formulation if a triptan is needed in the third trimester [^113Fr3uC] [^112VmZNd].

> I should confirm maternal risk–benefit framing. Untreated or undertreated migraine in pregnancy is associated with increased risks such as preeclampsia and adverse obstetric outcomes, and undertreatment can lead to medication overuse headache; therefore, when acetaminophen is inadequate, carefully selected sumatriptan use can be justified to maintain maternal function and reduce total medication exposure, provided we minimize dose and frequency and avoid risky combinations [^111dRNf8] [^112VmZNd]. But wait, what if the patient has cardiovascular risk factors? Sumatriptan is contraindicated in coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, and certain arrhythmias, so I need to screen for vascular disease and drug interactions before prescribing [^117Mbxeo].

> Next, I should review lactation considerations. Sumatriptan is detectable in breast milk after subcutaneous dosing, but infant exposure can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for about 12 hours after a dose. Given the short half-life and sporadic use typical of migraine treatment, this approach balances maternal needs with infant safety, and multiple labels align on this 12-hour guidance [^116h1gZ4] [^113S9z9d] [^116LMEAV]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies across formulations; yes, the lactation advice is consistent for tablets, nasal formulations, and injection, reflecting class-wide considerations and limited infant data [^116h1gZ4] [^11564LMD].

> I will now translate this into practical prescribing. Use sumatriptan only after acetaminophen failure or intolerance, at the lowest effective dose, and limit frequency to avoid medication overuse. Avoid sumatriptan–naproxen after 30 weeks. Coordinate with obstetrics for shared decision-making. And if exposure occurs in mid to late pregnancy with ongoing NSAID use, consider targeted ultrasound assessment of amniotic fluid. Document counseling and informed consent regarding uncertainties and the reassuring human data [^113WxAKx] [^113Fr3uC]. Let me reconsider any overlooked contraindications: concomitant ergots or other triptans within 24 hours, MAOI use, and significant cardiovascular disease remain key exclusions that must be screened at each visit [^117Mbxeo].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Based on registry and observational data encompassing more than 600 exposed pregnancies, sumatriptan has not been associated with an increased risk of major birth defects or a teratogenic pattern, and guideline bodies support its selective use in pregnancy when acetaminophen is inadequate, with attention to dose, timing, and formulation. Animal toxicity exists at high exposures but does not translate into a human teratogenic signal at therapeutic doses, reinforcing a risk–benefit approach rather than avoidance [^111dRNf8] [^112VmZNd] [^112K7f7j].

Imitrex (sumatriptan) is **generally considered safe during pregnancy** when used as indicated, with no clear increase in major birth defects or miscarriage in human data [^111dRNf8] [^116YVgSM]. Animal studies show fetal risks at high doses, but human exposure at therapeutic doses has not shown a consistent pattern of harm [^111dRNf8]. Use the **lowest effective dose** and avoid frequent use; reserve for moderate-to-severe migraines unresponsive to acetaminophen. Avoid in patients with cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or hemiplegic/basilar migraine. If used, monitor fetal growth and amniotic fluid, especially with repeated dosing or combination products containing NSAIDs [^113WxAKx].

## Safety of Imitrex during pregnancy

### Human data

- **Pregnancy registries and observational studies**: No increased frequency of major birth defects or consistent pattern of defects with sumatriptan exposure compared to the general population [^111dRNf8] [^116YVgSM].

- **Sumatriptan/naratriptan/treximet pregnancy registry**: 626 exposed pregnancies; major birth defects occurred in 4.2% with first-trimester exposure (95% CI: 2.6%–6.5%), similar to the general population (2%–4%) [^111dRNf8] [^114TThfH].

- **Swedish medical birth register**: 2,257 first-trimester exposures; no increased malformation risk (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.91–1.21) [^116YVgSM].

- **Norwegian prescription database**: 415 first-trimester exposures; no increased malformation risk (OR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.69–1.94) [^116YVgSM].

---

### Animal data

In animals, **embryolethality and fetal abnormalities** occurred at high doses, but no-effect doses were several-fold above human exposure [^111dRNf8] [^115EP5FU]. Overall, **animal findings** suggest risk at supratherapeutic exposures, whereas human data at therapeutic doses are reassuring [^111dRNf8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ACOG guidelines**: Use sumatriptan only if benefits outweigh risks; limit to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration; monitor fetal growth and amniotic fluid if repeated dosing or NSAID-containing combinations are used [^113WxAKx].

- **FDA labeling**: Use during pregnancy only if potential benefit justifies potential risk; no adequate well-controlled studies in pregnant women [^111dRNf8].

- **Specialist supervision**: Use under specialist care, especially beyond the first trimester or with repeated dosing [^116e4Jvx].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Vasoconstriction; avoid in coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or hemiplegic/basilar migraine [^117Mbxeo].

- **Fetal growth restriction**: Rare reports with repeated dosing or NSAID combinations; monitor fetal growth and amniotic fluid [^113WxAKx].

- **Common adverse effects**: Tingling, dizziness, flushing, fatigue, chest tightness, and injection-site reactions [^113XX4pf] [^112zCtW7].

---

## Alternative treatments

Preferred first-line therapy is **acetaminophen**; consider NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) in the second trimester only, avoiding the third trimester [^116e4Jvx] [^113Fr3uC]. Non-pharmacologic options include **stress management, relaxation, acupuncture, and biofeedback** [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

- **Fetal monitoring**: Ultrasound for growth and amniotic fluid if repeated dosing or NSAID combinations are used [^113WxAKx].

- **Maternal monitoring**: Blood pressure and cardiovascular symptoms during treatment [^117Mbxeo].

- **Patient counseling**: Discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives; document informed consent [^11688k3a].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| First trimester | Use if benefits outweigh risks; lowest effective dose; shortest duration |
| Second trimester | Use with caution; monitor fetal growth and amniotic fluid if repeated dosing |
| Third trimester | Avoid repeated dosing; avoid NSAID-containing combinations |
| Cardiovascular disease | Contraindicated |
| Hemiplegic/basilar migraine | Contraindicated |
| Repeated dosing | Monitor fetal growth and amniotic fluid |

---

Imitrex is **generally safe during pregnancy** when used appropriately, with no clear increase in major birth defects or miscarriage. Use the lowest effective dose, avoid frequent use, and monitor fetal growth and amniotic fluid if repeated dosing or NSAID combinations are used.

### Treatment of migraine headaches with sumatriptan in pregnancy [^116NjP3q]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature for treatment of migraine headaches with sumatriptan during pregnancy.

Data Sources

Studies and reports were located in International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-September 2003) and MEDLINE (1966-week 3 September 2003).

Data Synthesis

Research has been performed to evaluate the risk of teratogenesis after sumatriptan exposure in pregnant patients. Data have been collected in areas including placental transmission of sumatriptan, prospective pregnancy registries, open-labeled and controlled prospective studies, and a retrospective prescription-linked study. As of August 6, 2004, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted with exposure to sumatriptan during pregnancy.

Conclusions

Teratogenesis occurs in approximately 150 000 births per year which represents an incidence of 3–5%. Available literature to date indicates that exposure to sumatriptan during pregnancy has no additional risk of birth defects compared with the incidence in the general population.

### Efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan injection for the treatment of morning migraine: two multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled studies in adults [^116DdQgi]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan injection in the treatment of morning migraine.

Methods

In 2 multicenter (20 sites for study 1 and 25 sites for study 2), randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group studies, male and female patients aged 18 to 65 years with migraine meeting International Headache Society criteria received SC sumatriptan succinate injection 6 mg or inactive vehicle (control) for the outpatient treatment of a single morning migraine, defined as migraine with moderate or severe pain on awakening. The primary end point was the percentage of patients who achieved pain-free relief (moderate or severe pain reduced to no pain) at 2 hours after treatment. Tolerability was assessed using spontaneous reporting or noted by a clinician during the studies, assessed at the return visit.

Results

The efficacy analysis included, in the succinate group, 145 patients in study 1, 148 in study 2; control, 152 in study 1, 139 in study 2. The mean (SD) ages in the sumatriptan group were 40.2 (9.7) and 38.8 (10.1) years in studies 1 and 2, respectively; control, 41.4 (10.4) and 39.3 (9.7) years. The majority of patients in the 2 studies were female (sumatriptan, 84% and 93% in studies 1 and 2, respectively; control, 82% and 81%) and white (sumatriptan, 83% and 81%; control, 78% and 89%). Two hours after treatment, 48% and 57% of patients treated with sumatriptan injection compared with 18% and 19% of control patients reported pain-free relief in studies 1 and 2, respectively (both, P < 0.001). Two hours after treatment, 72% and 77% of patients treated with sumatriptan injection reported headache relief (moderate or severe pain reduced to mild or no pain) compared with 32% and 41% of control patients (both, P < 0.001). Onset of efficacy versus control (the first time point with statistical significance of pain relief) was observed beginning 10 minutes postdose (P < 0.05 sumatriptan injection vs placebo across pooled studies). Mean time to efficacy in the sumatriptan group was 10 minutes (P < 0.05 vs controls). The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea (sumatriptan, 6% and 4%; control, 2% and 2%) and injection-site reaction (ie, burning or stinging at the injection site) (sumatriptan, 5% and 5%; control, 2% and 1%). Injection-site reaction was also the only adverse event considered treatment related and reported in ≥ 5% of all patients.

Conclusion

The results of these 2 randomized, double-blind, controlled studies suggest that sumatriptan injection was effective and well tolerated in the acute treatment of morning migraine in these adults.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan tablets. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for sumatriptan tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets.

Data

Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk.

Triptans in pregnancy and breast feeding?

The major concern for migraine medications during pregnancy is of potential teratogenicity; our practice during pregnancy is to continue triptans only if benefit outweighs risk. The sumatriptan pregnancy register (626 pregnancies exposed to sumatriptan) has highlighted that the risk of first trimester birth defects was 4.2%, versus 3–5% in the general population. There are fewer data for other triptans. The current NICE CG150 headache guideline states that triptans can and should be considered for pregnant patients experiencing disabling headache attacks when other therapies have proven unhelpful and when patients have been counselled about their use in pregnancy. Triptans are generally considered compatible with breast feeding as less than 10% of the drug dose appears in breast milk; however, there are no large studies in this area.

Should we use triptans in patients with migraine aura?

Auras were previously thought to represent a vasoconstrictive episode and consequently there was concern about using triptans, which cause vasoconstriction, as this might in theory predispose to stroke. However, current understanding is that cortical spreading depression underlies aura, calling into question this theoretical contraindication. Studies of triptan use in familial hemiplegic aura report an excellent response to triptans and only minor side effects. Opinions vary among headache physicians, depending on the type of aura. Triptans are generally prescribed for migraine associated with non-motor aura. However, for hemiplegic migraine and also basilar migraine, there is less consensus, but the potential benefit of triptans may well outweigh their theoretical risks.

Migraine prevention

Migraine preventative treatments aim to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and may help reduce the frequency of analgesic use. It is usually unrealistic for patients to expect complete headache cessation and it can be useful to have a discussion with patients about realistic goals of treatment. Prophylactic treatment is typically considered if there are more than four migraine days per month. However, preventative therapy may also be given for less frequent but very disabling attacks.

Most medications used as preventatives were originally used for a different indication, and the evidence for individual agents varies. The agents used can be classified into antiepileptic drugs, beta blockers, antidepressants, serotonergic antagonists (methysergide is no longer manufactured), calcium channel antagonists, angiotensin modulators (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor inhibitors), nutrients and herbal products (Feverfew).

Sumatriptan — adverse events profile indicated generally mild, transient events with dose dependence and inconsistent reporting. Adverse events were transient and mild; however, higher doses of sumatriptan were associated with more AEs. Individual AEs were reported inconsistently among studies, and most studies reported only those occurring in greater than 3% of participants in any treatment arm.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data).

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine.

Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy.

Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/TREXIMET* (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group.

### Repository corticotropin (Acthar) [^113KMcsY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of corticotropin repository IM (also known as Acthar) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Corticotropin, ACTH may cause fetal harm when administered to a patient during pregnancy due to stimulation of an endogenous steroid response. The use of corticosteroids during pregnancy has been associated with intrauterine growth restriction, decreased birth weight, and preterm birth; thus there is potential concern regarding the use of corticotropin in pregnancy. Hypoadrenalism has also been reported in infants born to patients who received high-dose and/or long-term corticosteroid therapy during pregnancy. The drug corticotropin repository IM (also known as Acthar) is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^117EDtQ2]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.1.7. Age at entry

Recommendation:

Adult subjects participating in clinical trials should be between 18 and 65 years of age at entry.

Comments:

Only people who are at least 18 years old can provide informed consent. The inclusion of subjects older than 65 years is encouraged in post-marketing surveillance studies. After age 65, those with migraine are more likely to have (and be taking medications for) coexistent conditions than a younger population, which can confound assessments of safety and drug-drug interactions. Adverse health-related outcomes due to coexistent disease may be difficult to separate from a complication of the treatment under investigation.

1.1.8. Sex

Recommendation:

1.1.8.1. Males and females with migraine are eligible to participate in clinical trials of acute migraine medications.

Comments:

Migraine is at least three times more prevalent in females than in males. Special caution should be taken to avoid enrolling women who may be pregnant or lactating, unless they are the target of the trial. Partners of fertile-age women should practice effective contraception (refer to Section 2.3 for information about menstrual migraine).

1.1.9. Concomitant drug use

Recommendations:

1.1.9.1. Therapies not for migraine

Trials allowing participants to treat conditions other than migraine should pre-specify the permitted uses of concomitant therapies (i.e. open or restricted). The use of contraceptive medication should also be pre-specified. In phase II clinical trials, subjects should not be allowed to treat conditions other than migraine unless pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses have clearly shown a lack of interactions between the intervention being assessed for migraine and the concomitant therapy. In later development trials (i.e. phase III and IV), the treatment of concomitant and comorbid conditions may be specifically permitted with due precautions.

1.1.9.2. Acute migraine treatment

Investigational treatments should not be administered until at least 48 hours after the use of other acute treatments for migraine, including over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, prescription medications, and medical devices.

### A systematic review and meta-analyses on the prevalence of pregnancy outcomes in migraine treated patients: a contribution from the IMI2 concePTION project [^112K7f7j]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The present study aims to summarize the safety profile of the medications used to treat migraine during pregnancy by performing a systematic review and meta-analyses. The term "migrain" combined with pregnancy terms were used to search Embase, PubMed, PsychInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science through 31 December 2020. Pooled prevalences of untreated and treated migraine patients were estimated using MetaXL software. Pooled odds ratios (OR) using random effects models were estimated in RevMan 5. All the identified studies assessed medications used to treat acute migraine. The pooled prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients prescribed any migraine medication ranged from 0.4% (95% CI 0.2–0.7%) for stillbirth to 12.0% (95%CI 7.8–16.9%) for spontaneous abortions. Among untreated patients with migraine, the pooled prevalence of the assessed pregnancy outcomes ranged from 0.6% (95% CI: 0–1.7%) for stillbirth to 10.4% (95% CI: 8.9–12%) for gestational age < 37 weeks. Given the limited data, it was only possible to perform OR meta-analyses for triptans. The adjusted ORs for triptan users compared the general population were: for major malformations 1.07 (95%CI: 0.83–1.39, p = 0.60); birth weight < 2500g 1.18 (95%CI: 0.94–1.48, p = 0.16); gestational age < 37 weeks 1.49 (95% CI: 0.37–6.08, p = 0.58). In conclusion, triptans do not appear to increase the risk of pregnancy outcomes when compared to the general population. It was not possible to assess other migraine medications. Further studies are needed to investigate the safety of individual medications of acute and prophylactic migraine treatment among pregnant women.

### A pharmacokinetic interaction study between butorphanol and sumatriptan nasal sprays in healthy subjects: importance of the timing of butorphanol administration [^111KDYcq]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

Sumatriptan and butorphanol nasal sprays are commonly used agents for the management of migraine headaches. Under certain circumstances, these two agents may be administered closely in time. However, the possibility of a pharmacokinetic interaction and the safety of this regime have not been examined. In this crossover design study, 24 healthy subjects received the following four treatments, each separated by at least 7 days: 1 mg butorphanol (Stadol NS7); 20 mg sumatriptan (Imitrex Nasal Spray); or both formulations together with butorphanol administered either 1 or 30 min after sumatriptan. Serial plasma samples were collected for 24 h post-dose and analysed for butorphanol and/or sumatriptan by HPLC-MS/MS. Butorphanol plasma concentrations were reduced when it was administered 1 min (mean 28.6% decrease in AUC(0-infinity)), but not 30 min, after sumatriptan. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan were not substantially altered by butorphanol. The combination of nasally administered sumatriptan and butorphanol appeared safe. However, if butorphanol nasal spray is administered < 30 min after sumatriptan nasal spray, the analgesic effect of butorphanol may be diminished due to reduced nasal absorption resulting from probable transient vasoconstriction of nasal blood vessels by sumatriptan.

Regarding the use of sumatriptan IN (also known as Imitrex, Onzetra Xsail, Zembrace Symtouch, Sumavel Dosepro, Tosymra) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use with caution. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. The drug sumatriptan IN (also known as Imitrex, Onzetra Xsail, Zembrace Symtouch, Sumavel Dosepro, Tosymra) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Exposure to medication for neurological disease in pregnancy-time to consider the long-term implications? [^111WTseT]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Migraine

Migraine is one of the most common neurological diagnoses, with the one year prevalence estimated to be up to 15%. Treatments include both acute and preventive medications, the majority of which are used for a range of disorders.

Acute treatments for migraine

Whilst non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications are preferred as an acute treatment outwith pregnancy, they are not recommended for use during the third trimester due to risks around premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and oligohydramnios.

Triptans (sumatriptan, rizatriptan, zolmitriptan and others) are 5-HT1 receptor agonists commonly used for the acute treatment of migraine. Women are often advised against their use during pregnancy. Data surrounding sumatriptan exposure during pregnancy is most available in the literature. A large meta-analysis did not associate sumatriptan with an increased risk of congenital malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Some studies have reported an increased risk of behavioural disorders, mainly parent-reported attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in exposed children aged up to 3 years, however reassuringly this effect was not seen in school age children.

### Sumatriptan and naproxen sodium [^111UPkXY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Oral administration of sumatriptan alone to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 6 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis.

In reproduction studies of naproxen in rats (20 mg/kg/day), rabbits (20 mg/kg/day, and mice (170 mg/kg/day, no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus was observed. The doses tested in rats, rabbits, and mice were less (≤ 0.8 times) the MRHD, based on body surface area (mg/m²) comparisons.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

The naproxen anion has been found in the milk of lactating women at a concentration equivalent to approximately 1% of maximum naproxen concentration in plasma. Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan tablets.

There are no data on the effects of naproxen or sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of naproxen or sumatriptan on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets.

Data

Following subcutaneous administration of a 6-mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk.

Episodic migraine prevention — rimegepant is presented as an oral CGRP option with a shorter half-life than monoclonal antibodies, but the squares mean difference between rimegepant and placebo was -0.8 days and was not considered clinically significant, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against rimegepant for prevention. Dosing is specified as 75 mg taken as needed, up to once daily or every other day, to treat or prevent migraines, with noted limited benefit of fewer than 1 per month reduction in headache days. Safety cautions include unknown fetal effects in pregnancy, low transfer into breast milk (< 1%), and to avoid use in end stage renal disease and with certain cytochrome P450 3A4 [CYP3A4] inhibitors. The guideline categorizes the topic as Reviewed, New-added, and states the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate.

### Sumatriptan succinate (onzetra xsail) [^11564LMD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively.

Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of ONZETRA Xsail. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ONZETRA Xsail and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition.

### Obstetric toxicology: teratogens [^113VA1V8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The emergency physician frequently encounters women who seek care because of pregnancy- and nonpregnancy-related complaints. Many medications are safe for use during pregnancy, including several that are listed as potential teratogens based on the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) pregnancy classification; but it is important that the emergency physician know and recognize which drugs can be given in pregnancy and which drugs are absolutely contraindicated. Expert resources should be identified and used because the FDA's classification of drugs based on pregnancy risk does not represent the most up-to-date or accurate assessment of a drug's safety.

### Sumatriptan (ZEMBRACE symTouch) [^116cuQhL]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data).

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy.

Data

Human Data

The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73-to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group.

### Rizatriptan benzoate (Maxalt) [^11132eoK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Human Data

The Pregnancy Registry for MAXALT did not identify any pattern of congenital anomalies or other adverse birth outcomes over the period of 1998 to 2018. However, the lack of identification of any pattern should be viewed with caution, as the number of prospective reports with outcome information was low and did not provide sufficient power to detect an increased risk of individual birth defects associated with the use of MAXALT. Additionally, there was significant loss to follow-up in the prospective pregnancy reports, further complicating this assessment of an association between MAXALT and any pattern of congenital anomalies or other adverse birth outcomes.

In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 157 births with first-trimester exposure to rizatriptan, 7 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 1.01 [95% CI: 0.40 to 2.08]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for triptans before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 310 women who redeemed prescriptions for rizatriptan during the first trimester, 10 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.03 [95% CI: 0.55 to 1.93]), while for the 271 women who redeemed prescriptions for rizatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 12 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.48 [95% CI: 0.83 to 2.64]), each compared with the population comparison group.

Methods

Subjects

Healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years, with a body mass index between 18 and 32 kg/m², and in good general health at screening were eligible. The general health of subjects was confirmed by medical history evaluation, BP assessment, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, neurological examination, and clinical laboratory assessment (serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis). Women were eligible to participate if they were not pregnant or breastfeeding and if they were either using an acceptable method of contraception or were physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant. Subjects with elevated BP (systolic BP [SBP] ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic BP [DBP] ≥ 90 mmHg), elevated heart rate (> 100 beats/min), a prolonged corrected QT interval (obtained using Fridericia's formula; ≥ 450 msec for men and ≥ 470 msec for women), or history of prolonged QT syndrome were excluded. Subjects were also excluded if they had an unstable medical condition (resulting in hospitalization within 28 days of study day 1, major surgery within 6 months of study day 1, or in the judgement of the study investigator) or had suffered a major cardiovascular event or been treated with a percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft within 6 months of study day 1. Subjects with a history of malignancy or impaired renal or hepatic function were also excluded. In addition, subjects who had previously received erenumab or any other large molecule that targets CGRP, had a history or evidence of substance or alcohol abuse, or those who had a contraindication to sumatriptan were excluded.

Subjects were asked to avoid strenuous exercise during screening and 48 hours before endpoint assessments (days 1, 2, 4, and 5) and any exercise or consumption of caffeinated food and beverages ≥ 30 minutes before endpoint assessment (days 1, 2, 4, and 5). Smoking was prohibited 30 days prior to the beginning of the treatment period and during the study, as was the consumption of ≥ 2 alcoholic drinks daily during the study or any alcohol within 24 hours of a clinic visit. Use of any over-the-counter or prescription medication within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever was longer), or any investigational product within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever was longer), of receiving the first dose of erenumab or placebo was prohibited. Use of simple analgesics was permitted during the study, except within the 48 hours before receiving sumatriptan.

### Sumatriptan succinate (Imitrex) [^115EP5FU]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category C. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to rabbits, sumatriptan has been shown to be embryolethal. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, IMITREX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In assessing this information, the following findings should be considered.

Embryolethality: When given orally or intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, sumatriptan caused embryolethality at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. In the oral studies this dose was 100 mg/kg/day, and in the intravenous studies this dose was 2.0 mg/kg/day. The mechanism of the embryolethality is not known. The highest no-effect dose for embryolethality by the oral route was 50 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 9 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m² basis. By the intravenous route, the highest no-effect dose was 0.75 mg/kg/day, or approximately one tenth of the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m² basis.

### Medications in pregnancy and lactation: part 2. drugs with minimal or unknown human teratogenic effect [^114stisE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

This is the second of a two-part series on the use of medication during pregnancy and lactation. Pregnancy risk factors together with an increased incidence of chronic diseases and the rise in mean maternal age predict an increase in medication use during gestation. However, as highlighted in the first installment of this series, relatively few medications have specifically been tested for safety and efficacy during pregnancy, and, therefore, responses to those inquiries can be uninformed and inaccurate. Whereas the first installment provided new insight into the nature of medications with known human teratogenic effects, this part concentrates on drugs with minimal or no known human teratogenic effect. It is important that clinicians become familiar with all of the aspects of the drugs they prescribe, in addition to the controversies surrounding them, through consultation with maternal-fetal medicine specialists and through references and Web sites providing up-to-date information in an effort to promote safer prescribing practices.

Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data).

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy.

Data

Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group.

### Acitretin [^113JWuWU]. FDA. Low credibility.

Regarding the use of acitretin PO (also known as Soriatane) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Acitretin is teratogenic and is contraindicated in females who are pregnant or who intend to become pregnant during therapy or within 3 years after therapy. The drug acitretin PO (also known as Soriatane) is classified under category X in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has such a high risk of causing permanent damage to the fetus that it should not be used in pregnancy or when there is a possibility of pregnancy.

### Pharmacological treatment of migraine during pregnancy and breastfeeding [^112VmZNd]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Migraine affects up to 25% of women of reproductive age. In the majority of these women, migraine improves progressively during pregnancy, but symptoms generally recur shortly after delivery. As suboptimally treated migraine in pregnancy could have negative consequences for both mother and fetus, the primary aim of clinicians should be to provide optimal treatment according to stage of pregnancy, while minimising possible risks related to drug therapy. Nonpharmacological approaches are always first-line treatment, and should also be used to complement any required drug treatment. Paracetamol is the preferred drug for acute treatment throughout pregnancy. If paracetamol is not sufficiently effective, sporadic use of sumatriptan can be considered. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen can also be used under certain circumstances, though their intake in the first and third trimesters is associated with specific risks and contraindications. Preventive treatment should only be considered in the most severe cases. In women contemplating pregnancy, counselling is essential to promote a safe and healthy pregnancy and postpartum period for the mother and child, and should involve a dialogue addressing maternal concerns and expectations about drug treatment. This Review summarizes current evidence of the safety of the most common antimigraine medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and provides treatment recommendations for use in clinical practice.

### Sumatriptan succinate (sumatriptan) [^116YVgSM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sumatriptan PO (also known as Imitrex, Onzetra Xsail, Zembrace Symtouch, Sumavel Dosepro, Tosymra):
- **Chest tightness, chest pain, neck pain, jaw pain**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of non-cardiac chest pain and related symptoms.
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sumatriptan has been associated with an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis.
- **Medication overuse headache**: use caution in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Seizure**: use caution in patients with a seizure disorder.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: use caution in patients taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or TCAs.

FDA pregnancy risk categories and transition to the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR) are outlined as follows: Prior (1979) categories defined A — Adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy; B — Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, or animal reproduction studies have shown adverse effects, but well-controlled studies in pregnant women have shown no adverse effects to the fetus; C — Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, or there are no animal reproduction studies and no well-controlled studies in humans; D — Positive evidence of fetal risk, but benefits may outweigh risks; and X — Positive evidence of fetal risk, and risks clearly outweigh any possible benefit. The (2015) PLLR eliminated the pregnancy risk categories and provides individualized summaries of risk for each medication.

### Prescribing for pregnancy: managing chronic headache and migraine [^111EQtzS]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Globally, headache disorders are an important cause of disability in adults. As many types of headache (eg, migraine, tension-type and medication-overuse) are more common in women and have peak incidence in reproductive years, chronic headache disorders are highly prevalent in pregnant women. Some women with a history of migraine may find that it improves during pregnancy while others may find that their migraines become more unpredictable. Ideally, women with migraine and problematic headache disorder should be offered preconception counselling to address pregnancy-related concerns and advice on the use of medicines, which should be supported by high-quality information. For women with history of headache, the use of effective non-pharmacological options should be maximised, and the smallest number of the safest medicines at the lowest effective doses should be used while preparing for pregnancy and during pregnancy. This article forms part of the series of prescribing for pregnancy and discusses the impact of headache and migraine on pregnancy, the impact of pregnancy on headache and migraine and options for prophylaxis and treatment.

### Treatment of cluster headache in pregnancy and lactation [^112rt4xN]. Cephalalgia (2009). Low credibility.

Cluster headache is a rare disorder in women, but has a serious impact on the affected woman's life, especially on family planning. Women with cluster headache who are pregnant need special support, including the expertise of an experienced headache centre, an experienced gynaecologist and possibly a teratology information centre. The patient should be seen through all stages of the pregnancy. A detailed briefing about the risks and safety of various treatment options is mandatory. In general, both the number of medications and the dosage should be kept as low as possible. Preferred treatments include oxygen, subcutaneous or intranasal sumatriptan for acute pain and verapamil and prednisone/prednisolone as preventatives. If there is a compelling reason to treat the patient with another preventative, gabapentin is the drug of choice. While breastfeeding, oxygen, sumatriptan and lidocaine for acute pain and prednisone/prednisolone, verapamil, and lithium as preventatives are the drugs of choice. As the individual pharmacokinetics differ substantially, adverse drug effects should be considered if unexplained symptoms occur in the newborn.

### Sumatriptan succinate (Imitrex) [^117MfRTt]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

IMITREX Tablets should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established.

Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events

Sumatriptan should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). It is strongly recommended that sumatriptan not be given to patients in whom unrecognized CAD is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, male over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patient's medical history or electrocardiographic investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, sumatriptan should not be administered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of sumatriptan tablets take place in the setting of a physician's office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received sumatriptan. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the interval immediately following IMITREX Tablets in these patients with risk factors.

It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use sumatriptan.

The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to sumatriptan.

### Sumatriptan succinate and naproxen sodium [^113D8o9S]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Oral administration of sumatriptan alone to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 6 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis.

In reproduction studies of naproxen in rats (20 mg/kg/day), rabbits (20 mg/kg/day, and mice (170 mg/kg/day, no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus was observed. The doses tested in rats, rabbits, and mice were less (≤ 0.8 times) the MRHD, based on body surface area (mg/m²) comparisons.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

The naproxen anion has been found in the milk of lactating women at a concentration equivalent to approximately 1% of maximum naproxen concentration in plasma. Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan tablets.

There are no data on the effects of naproxen or sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of naproxen or sumatriptan on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets.

Data

Following subcutaneous administration of a 6-mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk.

### Eletriptan hydrobromide [^114Ls8LL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available human data on the use of eletriptan hydrobromide in pregnant women are not sufficient to draw conclusions about drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal studies, oral administration of eletriptan during pregnancy or throughout pregnancy and lactation was associated with developmental toxicity (decreased fetal and pup weights, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities, decreased pup viability) at clinically-relevant doses [see Data].

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension during pregnancy.

Data

Human Data

A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for triptans before pregnancy only. Of the 189 women who redeemed prescriptions for eletriptan during the first trimester, 4 (2.1%) had infants with major congenital malformations, while for the 174 women who redeemed prescriptions for eletriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 11 (6.3%) had infants with major congenital malformations. Methodological limitations of this study, including small size of the eletriptan population and infrequent events, do not allow for thorough characterization of risk.

### Neurostimulation in the treatment of primary headaches [^113Mir9q]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence for SpringTMS

Acute treatment of migraine with and without aura

The evidence for acute treatment of migraine comes from only one small manufacturer-sponsored study and postmarketing surveys. A sham-controlled study on SpringTMS in the acute treatment of migraine with aura in 164 patients reported a pain-free response rate higher in those with active compared with sham treatment at both 2 h (39% vs 22%) and 24 h (29% vs 16%) for a therapeutic gain of 17% (p = 0.0179). As above, in a previous trial of acute migraine treatment, the pain-free rate was 67% for 100 mg sumatriptan with a placebo rate of 28%.

In an open-label postmarketing survey of 462 subjects in the UK using SpringTMS as acute treatment for migraine with and without aura, authors obtained 3-month follow-up data on only 190 patients. The discontinuation rate within the 3-month follow-up period was 55% (n = 105) mainly due to inadequate benefit (n = 49), cost (n = −17) or inconvenience (n = 15). Of the 190 subjects who completed 3 months follow-up, 62% reported some reduction in migraine pain and 59% some reduction in attack duration. The group did not provide further clarification with responder rates and so we cannot make meaningful comparisons to other acute treatments for migraine.

Preventative treatment of migraine

There is no controlled evidence to support the use of SpringTMS in the prevention of migraine.

Possible uses of SpringTMS

From the limited evidence available, SpringTMS might have a role in the acute treatment of migraine with and without aura in those at risk of overusing acute medications or if acute pharmacological treatments are ineffective (table 1). As with the other devices, there are no clear safety data in children or in pregnancy; however, three women among the postmarketing data completed normal pregnancies. Current evidence does not support the use of SpringTMS in the preventative treatment of migraine or for the treatment of cluster headache.

### Patterns and predictors of analgesic use in pregnancy: a longitudinal drug utilization study with special focus on women with migraine [^114YyyNf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

A considerable number of women reported high headache intensity, and many of them did not use any analgesics, while the remaining mainly used paracetamol. This suggests that there are women who are not optimally treated. This finding was also reported in another study, where less than one third of the women considered their migraine to be optimally treated. For women with insufficient relief from paracetamol or with severe migraine, limited use of triptans should be considered and recognized as an alternative by prescribers. Results from studies on triptan safety in pregnancy are generally reassuring and suggest that sporadic use of sumatriptan is probably safe, although the data are limited for other triptans. While it is necessary to exercise caution when using pharmacotherapy during pregnancy, untreated or inadequately managed severe migraine may seriously impact a woman's well-being, and might even pose a risk to both mother and child. In fact, several studies have suggested an association between active migraine and hypertensive diseases in pregnancy, which is a risk factor for preterm birth, low birthweight and placental abruption. Moreover, the switch to less effective migraine medications such as paracetamol could impose an increased risk of analgesic induced headache.

We found several factors predicting analgesic use, some of them not directly related to the disease, which illustrates the need for and importance of information and advice on safe analgesic use and migraine management in pregnancy. This should be recognized by physicians as well as midwives, pharmacists, and other health care personnel communicating with pregnant women. The fact that smokers were more likely to use analgesics for headache or migraine can be due to a less restrictive attitude towards medication use in pregnancy, or addictive behavior. Mothers with previous pregnancies may be less worried about using medications in their next pregnancy, if they have experienced having a healthy infant despite medication use in a previous pregnancy. Women with chronic diseases or somatic symptoms could have a lower threshold for using analgesics due to a larger total disease burden or more experience with drug treatment in pregnancy. In order to identify women at risk for suboptimal migraine treatment during pregnancy, we need more information on factors affecting drug use in pregnancy, as the literature is inconsistent.

### Sumatriptan-naproxen sodium in migraine: a review [^116p2mac]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

PREGNANCY

No major birth defects were reported in patients exposed to sumatriptan‐naproxen sodium in the first trimester of pregnancy, as reported by the Sumatriptan, Naratriptan, and Treximet Pregnancy Registry. Of the 680 exposed pregnant women which resulted in 689 infants and foetuses across a 16‐year period, the majority (92.1%; 626/680) were exposed to sumatriptan, whilst a smaller proportion was exposed to naratriptan (8.3%; 57/680) and an even smaller proportion to sumatriptan‐naproxen sodium (0.9%; 6/680). Although the Registry detected no signal of teratogenicity associated with major birth defects for sumatriptan, there is a lack of evidence for its use in pregnancy and the use of sumatriptan‐naproxen sodium must be cautioned in any conclusion, especially in the third trimester due to the risk of foetal abnormalities (patent ductus arteriosus closure and oligohydramnios).

Pregnant and lactating individuals historically have been excluded from research studies because of the ethical concerns surrounding potential harm to the fetus. Several National Institutes of Health and Food and Drug Administration initiatives have attempted to improve inclusion; however, clinical trials continue to exclude pregnant and lactating people. Drug labeling for safety and efficacy in pregnancy has thus been forced to rely on data from animal studies or limited case reports. Recent changes have sought to improve prescriber understanding of risks, benefits, and limitations of safety information on medications; however, confusion persists.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sumatriptan / naproxen PO (also known as Treximet):
- **Anemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of anemia. Monitor hemoglobin levels and for signs of bleeding.
- **Chest tightness, chest pain, neck pain, jaw pain**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of non-cardiac chest pain and related symptoms.
- **Edema**: use caution in patients taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, as naproxen may blunt the cardiovascular effects of these agents. Avoid using in patients with severe HF unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening HF.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as naproxen has been associated with an increased risk of elevations of serum transaminases and, rarely, severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Monitor liver enzymes periodically in patients on long-term treatment.
- **HF**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, hospitalization for HF, and death.
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sumatriptan has been associated with an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- **Mask symptoms of infection**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs reduce inflammation and fever, potentially diminishing the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.
- **Medication overuse headache**: use caution in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Renal toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of NSAIDs has been associated with an increased risk of renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, AKI, and other renal injury, especially in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration or hypovolemia, taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, and in the elderly. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration, or hypovolemia.
- **Seizure**: use caution in patients with a seizure disorder.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: use caution in patients taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or TCAs.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^116e4Jvx]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women

Migraine often remits during pregnancy, but if treatment is continued, the potential for harm to the fetus demands special consideration. Despite relatively poor efficacy, paracetamol should be used as the first-line medication for acute treatment of migraine in pregnancy; NSAIDs can be used only during the second trimester. Triptans should be used only under the strict supervision of a specialist, as the safety data available are limited and originate from post-marketing surveillance; most data relate to the use of sumatriptan. For nausea associated with migraine in pregnancy, metoclopramide can be used.

Preventive migraine medications are best avoided during pregnancy owing to the potential for fetal harm. However, if preventive therapy is considered clinically indicated because of frequent and disabling migraine attacks, the best available safety data support the use of propranolol or, if propranolol is contraindicated, amitriptyline. Both should be used under specialist supervision to adequately monitor any potential fetal harm. Topiramate, candesartan and sodium valproate are contraindicated; sodium valproate is known to be teratogenic, so must not be used, and the use of topiramate and candesartan is associated with adverse effects on the fetus.

Migraine medication therapy in the post-partum period also requires caution because of potential risks to the infant. Paracetamol is the preferred acute medication, although ibuprofen and sumatriptan are also considered safe. If preventive medication is required, propranolol is the recommended first choice as it has the best safety profile. Pharmacological treatments for migraine during pregnancy and breastfeeding have been reviewed in more detail elsewhere.

Women with menstrual migraine

Approximately 8% of women with migraine experience migraine attacks that are exclusively related to their menstruation, referred to as pure menstrual migraine. If optimized acute medication therapy does not suffice for these patients, initiation of perimenstrual preventive treatment should be considered. This approach typically involves daily intake of a long-acting NSAID (for example, naproxen) or triptan (for example, frovatriptan or naratriptan) for 5 days, beginning 2 days before the expected first day of menstruation –. Some women with pure menstrual migraine without aura benefit from continuous use (that is, without a break) of combined hormonal contraceptives. By contrast, combined hormonal contraceptives are contraindicated in women with migraine with aura regardless of any association with their menstrual cycle, owing to an associated increase in the risk of stroke.

### Rizatriptan benzoate (Rizafilm) [^111ZP6Jn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Data

Human Data

The Pregnancy Registry for rizatriptan did not identify any pattern of congenital anomalies or other adverse birth outcomes over the period of 1998 to 2018. However, the lack of identification of any pattern should be viewed with caution, as the number of prospective reports with outcome information was low and did not provide sufficient power to detect an increased risk of individual birth defects associated with the use of rizatriptan. Additionally, there was significant loss to follow-up in the prospective pregnancy reports, further complicating this assessment of an association between rizatriptan and any pattern of congenital anomalies or other adverse birth outcomes.

In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 157 births with first-trimester exposure to rizatriptan, 7 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 1.01 [95% CI: 0.40 to 2.08]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for triptans before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 310 women who redeemed prescriptions for rizatriptan during the first trimester, 10 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.03 [95% CI: 0.55 to 1.93]), while for the 271 women who redeemed prescriptions for rizatriptan before but not during pregnancy, 12 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.48 [95% CI: 0.83 to 2.64]), each compared with the population comparison group.

### Pregnancy outcome after anti-migraine triptan use: a prospective observational cohort study [^112qehZy]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Objective The objective of our study is to assess the impact of triptan exposure on pregnancy outcome. Methods We performed a prospective observational cohort study with 432 pregnant women exposed to triptans and enrolled by the German Embryotox system. Pregnancy outcomes were compared with a migraine and a non-migraine comparison cohort. Primary objectives were major birth defects and spontaneous abortion; secondary endpoints were preterm delivery, birth weight, pregnancy complications and the rate of electively terminated pregnancies. Results Compared to a non-migraine cohort the rates of major birth defects (OR adj 0.84; 95% CI 0.4–1.9), spontaneous abortions (OR adj 1.20; 95% CI 0.9–1.7), preterm delivery (OR adj 1.01; 95% CI 0.7–1.5), and preeclampsia (OR adj 1.33; 95% CI 0.7–2.5) were not increased in triptan-exposed pregnancies. Conclusions Our findings support the evidence that triptans are not major teratogens. When compellingly needed during pregnancy, sumatriptan as the best studied triptan appears an acceptable treatment option. A detailed fetal ultrasound should be offered in cases of first trimester exposure to less well-studied triptans. Trial registration number in German Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00007660.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists' use during pregnancy: safety data from regulatory clinical trials [^115nR8Bz]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

Clinical Reviews published by the FDA for every GLP1‐RA were assessed for information on pregnancies that occurred in female participants during the clinical development programmes. These reviews are conducted at the end of a multistep process for developing and approving new drugs in the United States. Sponsors are required to report to the FDA when pregnancy occurs during clinical trials, and pregnant individuals are followed to term. These data are included in the Clinical Reviews, which makes them a uniquely valuable source of data for assessing the safety of GLP1‐RA use in pregnancy. When data were not available in the Clinical Reviews, results posted onwere examined for studies in the clinical development programmes of the included drugs.

### Use of 5-HT1 agonists in pregnancy [^116CN6ps]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report and evaluate available data on the use of serotonin 5-HT(1) agonists (triptans) during pregnancy.

Data Sources

A PubMed search, limited to English-language articles on human subjects, was conducted (1990-December 2007) using the search terms pregnancy, migraine, and the individual triptan drug names. In addition, the manufacturers of all 7 available triptans were contacted regarding the existence of a pregnancy registry for their drug(s) and the availability of registry reports.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All retrospective and prospective studies reporting on pregnancy outcomes after the use of a triptan were included and critically evaluated. Data from all available manufacturer-sponsored pregnancy registries were also included.

Data Synthesis

Safe and effective treatment of migraine during pregnancy is imperative. Data involving sumatriptan and, to a lesser extent, naratriptan and rizatriptan, exist primarily regarding exposure in the first trimester. These data show no significant differences in congenital malformations or poor pregnancy outcomes when compared with expected rates in the general population or with the observed rates in control subjects. There is very little information regarding exposure in middle and late pregnancy.

Conclusions

Sumatriptan appears to be a safe treatment alternative for pregnant women who experience new-onset or worsened migraines in the first trimester. Further observation is needed prior to recommending its use in later trimesters. Based upon available data, the other agents in this class cannot be recommended for use during pregnancy at this time.

### Trends in the prevalence and pharmacological management of migraine during pregnancy in the UK, 2000–2018 [^112FSdsd]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for research and practice

Migraine is commonly classified as being with and without aura. As those with aura have been found to have a higher risk of stroke, it may be important to understand the burden of migraine with aura during pregnancy. This was explored in this dataset, but only a small proportion of the population (~3.5%) had aura status recorded.

Apart from triptans, there is a paucity of evidence around the safety of migraine drugs during pregnancy. Due to the exclusion of pregnant women from most clinical trials, much of the existing evidence for the effect of medication use during pregnancy comes from observational studies The inherent limitations and biases of these studies can mean it is difficult for clinicians and women to make decisions around medication use in pregnancy. This study highlights the increasing burden of pharmacological therapies in women with migraine during pregnancy and therefore the urgent need for further research into drug safety in pregnancy. Pregnant women have been historically excluded from clinical trials. More recently, there have been calls for their inclusion. This study provides further justification of the need for this.

The increasing trend in medication use during pregnancy in women with migraine also raises concerns about medication overuse headache. The prevalence of this condition during pregnancy and impact on pregnancy outcomes are not well understood and warrant further study.

### Sumatriptan (sumavel dosePro) [^1113opqY]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of sumatriptan injection in pregnant women. Sumavel DosePro should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

When sumatriptan was administered intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, embryolethality was observed at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. These doses were less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 12 mg/day on a mg/m² basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rabbits during organogenesis was associated with increased incidences of fetal vascular and skeletal abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for these effects was 15 mg/kg/day. The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at doses that are approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis, did not produce evidence of embryolethality. The subcutaneous administration to pregnant rats prior to and throughout pregnancy did not produce evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether sumatriptan is excreted in human breast milk following subcutaneous administration. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Sumavel DosePro, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

### Sumatriptan (oral route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults [^114Y9d5y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of oral sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using oral sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Sixty-one studies (37,250 participants) compared oral sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 50 mg and 100 mg doses. Sumatriptan surpassed placebo for all efficacy outcomes. For sumatriptan 50 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 6.1, 7.5, and 4.0 for pain-free at two hours and headache relief at one and two hours, respectively. NNTs for sustained pain-free and sustained headache relief during the 24 hours postdose were 9.5 and 6.0, respectively. For sumatriptan 100 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 4.7, 6.8, 3.5, 6.5, and 5.2, respectively, for the same outcomes. Results for the 25 mg dose were similar to the 50 mg dose, while sumatriptan 100 mg was significantly better than 50 mg for pain-free and headache relief at two hours, and for sustained pain-free during 24 hours. Treating early, during the mild pain phase, gave significantly better NNTs for pain-free at two hours and sustained pain-free during 24 hours than did treating established attacks with moderate or severe pain intensity. Relief of associated symptoms, including nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, was greater with sumatriptan than with placebo, and use of rescue medication was lower with sumatriptan than with placebo. For the most part, adverse events were transient and mild and were more common with the sumatriptan than with placebo, with a clear dose response relationship (25 mg to 100 mg). Sumatriptan was compared directly with a number of active treatments, including other triptans, paracetamol (acetaminophen), acetylsalicylic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and ergotamine combinations.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral sumatriptan is effective as an abortive treatment for migraine attacks, relieving pain, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability, but is associated with increased adverse events.

### Sumatriptan succinate, ondansetron (sumansetron) [^115h6UW6]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects:Pregnancy Category C. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to rabbits, sumatriptan has been shown to be embryolethal. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, sumatriptan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In assessing this information, the following findings should be considered.

Embryolethality

When given orally or intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, sumatriptan caused embryolethality at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. In the oral studies this dose was 100 mg/kg/day, and in the intravenous studies this dose was 2 mg/kg/day. The mechanism of the embryolethality is not known. The highest no-effect dose for embryolethality by the oral route was 50 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 9 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m² basis. By the intravenous route, the highest no-effect dose was 0.75 mg/kg/day, or approximately one tenth of the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m² basis.

The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at 12.5 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, did not cause embryolethality. This dose is equivalent to the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m² basis. Additionally, in a study in rats given subcutaneous sumatriptan daily prior to and throughout pregnancy at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of increased embryo/fetal lethality. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m² basis.
