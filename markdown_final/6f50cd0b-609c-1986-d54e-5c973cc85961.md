## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of heart failure in adults with myocardial infarction?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosing for treating heart failure in adults after myocardial infarction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and which patients qualify for guideline-directed therapy. Then, I should verify the core drug classes and their hierarchy. Next, I will extract dosing for each class from authoritative sources, including FDA labels and ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines. After that, I need to check titration cadence, monitoring, and safety thresholds. Finally, I will integrate special scenarios and summarize a practical, stepwise approach with targets and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and eligibility. Post-MI heart failure spans Stage B (asymptomatic LV dysfunction) and Stage C (symptomatic HF), and the strength of evidence and dosing targets vary accordingly; importantly, many trials and labels anchor therapy to LVEF thresholds and symptom status, so I need to keep LVEF ≤ 40% and symptomatic HF or diabetes in mind as I proceed [^1175CZA9] [^114o8xWv].

> Next, I should review the foundational drug classes and their hierarchy. ACE inhibitors are first-line after MI with reduced LVEF, with ARBs as alternatives when ACE inhibitors are not tolerated; evidence-based beta-blockers are indicated in essentially all post-MI patients with reduced LVEF; mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are indicated when LVEF is ≤ 40% with symptoms or diabetes; and SGLT2 inhibitors are increasingly used in HFrEF post-MI, though I should confirm that the post-MI evidence base is strongest for dapagliflozin and empagliflozin rather than assuming class-wide benefit [^1175CZA9] [^114o8xWv] [^112Bxws3].

> I will now examine ACE inhibitor dosing, starting with ramipril because it has robust post-MI data. The FDA label recommends starting ramipril 2.5 mg twice daily for 1 week, then increasing to 5 mg twice daily as tolerated, which aligns with the AIRE trial showing a 27% mortality reduction at 5 mg twice daily; I should double-check that this applies to patients with clinical signs of HF after MI, which it does [^111pqQif] [^1149iBwy]. Wait, let me verify the target dose in performance measures; ACC/AHA lists 10 mg once daily as a target, but that reflects chronic HFrEF dosing rather than the post-MI BID regimen, so I should not conflate these and will keep the post-MI target at 5 mg twice daily per the trial and label [^115FpEui] [^111pqQif].

> For captopril, I need to check both the post-MI LV dysfunction regimen and the general HF regimen. The post-MI label advises a test dose of 6.25 mg, then 12.5 mg three times daily, titrating to 25–50 mg three times daily, with SAVE demonstrating benefit up to 50 mg three times daily; the general HF label allows higher maintenance ranges, but I should prioritize the post-MI LV dysfunction dosing here [^116bezV3] [^116enigz]. Hold on, I should verify the maximum; yes, 450 mg/day is the labeled ceiling, but most patients are managed at 25–50 mg three times daily in trials and practice [^112JsuTQ].

> Let me consider enalapril and lisinopril, since clinicians often use them. Guidelines list enalapril 2.5 mg twice daily initially, titrating to 10–20 mg twice daily, and lisinopril 2.5–5 mg daily to 20–40 mg daily; I should confirm these align with trial targets, which they do in ACC/AHA dosing tables and SOLVD-era protocols, though post-MI-specific titration details are less granular than for ramipril or captopril [^116Fmcqe] [^1141d3Ru].

> Next, I should review ARB dosing, especially valsartan, because it has head-to-head post-MI data. In VALIANT, valsartan was titrated from 20 or 40 mg twice daily to a highest tolerated dose up to 160 mg twice daily, with mean daily dose around 217 mg; importantly, valsartan was noninferior to captopril for mortality, supporting its use when ACE inhibitors are not tolerated or as an alternative strategy in selected patients [^116JoXUi] [^114PNq2J]. I need to ensure I do not overstate combination therapy; the combination arm in VALIANT did not show added benefit and had more adverse events, so monotherapy with either ACE inhibitor or ARB is preferred [^116JoXUi].

> Now, beta-blocker dosing. I should confirm the agents with proven benefit post-MI: carvedilol and metoprolol are the principal choices, with carvedilol having the most robust post-MI survival data in CAPRICORN. Carvedilol is typically started at 6.25 mg twice daily and titrated every 3–10 days to 12.5 mg twice daily, then to 25 mg twice daily as tolerated; for patients over 85 kg, some protocols allow 50 mg twice daily, but I should note that the core post-MI evidence and most guidance center on 25 mg twice daily as the practical target [^113ruXTL] [^1141d3Ru]. For metoprolol tartrate, the acute-phase IV regimen is 5 mg every 2–5 minutes up to 3 doses, followed by oral 25–50 mg every 6–12 hours, then transition to 50–100 mg twice daily for at least 3 months and up to 1–3 years; I should emphasize that the long-term oral target here is metoprolol tartrate rather than succinate, which is used in chronic HFrEF, to avoid confusion [^113QBxBx] [^113bLBts].

> Hold on, I should verify the timing and tolerability advice. Beta-blockers should be started once the patient is hemodynamically stable and fluid retention is optimized; early initiation before discharge is reasonable if the patient is stable, and dose escalations should be individualized with attention to blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms of worsening HF or vasodilation [^113ruXTL] [^113roJAv].

> For mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, I need to check eplerenone dosing and safety. The FDA label recommends 25 mg once daily, titrating to 50 mg once daily within 4 weeks as tolerated, with mandatory potassium and renal function monitoring; serum potassium should be checked before initiation, within 1 week, and at 1 month, with periodic checks thereafter, and the drug is contraindicated with creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL in men or > 2.0 mg/dL in women or potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L, which I should explicitly state to avoid hyperkalemia risk [^1122Vt7x] [^112cpnzG]. Let me reconsider the indication timing; EPHESUS enrolled patients 3–14 days post-MI with LVEF ≤ 40% and either HF symptoms or diabetes, supporting relatively early initiation once stability and safety labs are assured [^1122Vt7x].

> I should confirm the role and dosing of SGLT2 inhibitors in this population. While the question is focused on dosing, the strongest post-MI HFrEF evidence supports dapagliflozin 10 mg daily and empagliflozin 10 mg daily, with initiation after stabilization; dosing is straightforward, but I need to ensure eGFR thresholds and volume status are addressed before starting, which is consistent with HF and diabetes guidance [^112Bxws3].

> Next, I should review titration cadence and monitoring. Let me verify that uptitration every 2 weeks is a reasonable default for ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and beta-blockers when tolerated, which aligns with performance measures and guideline pathways; however, in the immediate post-MI window, some clinicians titrate more slowly based on hemodynamics, and carvedilol labeling allows 3–10 day intervals, so I should tailor to the patient's stability and lab parameters [^114p8N7W] [^113ruXTL]. I need to ensure I emphasize checking blood pressure, heart rate, renal function, and potassium at each visit during uptitration, and to pause or down-titrate if there is symptomatic hypotension, bradycardia, hyperkalemia, or worsening renal function [^114Gf5LS] [^1122Vt7x].

> But wait, what if the patient is intolerant to ACE inhibitors? I should confirm that ARBs are appropriate alternatives with comparable outcomes in post-MI populations, as shown in VALIANT and supported by guidelines; however, I should avoid dual ACEi/ARB therapy because of harm without added benefit, and I should remember that ARBs are less well studied in asymptomatic post-MI LV dysfunction, so ACE inhibitors remain preferred when tolerated [^116JoXUi] [^1175CZA9] [^116CCaJm].

> I will now examine special scenarios that modify dosing or sequencing. In patients with significant bradycardia or conduction disease, I should start beta-blockers at very low doses and titrate cautiously, recognizing that carvedilol's alpha-1 blockade can cause early vasodilatory hypotension; separating beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor dosing times and adjusting diuretics can mitigate hypotension, and I should double-check for drug interactions that worsen bradycardia or hypotension before escalating [^1152RZQW] [^113ruXTL]. In patients with borderline renal function or potassium near 5.0 mEq/L, I should delay or reduce MRA dosing and recheck labs within 3–7 days, and I should avoid starting SGLT2 inhibitors in volume-depleted states or with very low eGFR without correction [^1122Vt7x] [^116XVMVX].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. Start with an ACE inhibitor such as ramipril 2.5 mg twice daily and titrate to 5 mg twice daily within 1–2 weeks if tolerated, or use captopril 12.5 mg three times daily titrated to 25–50 mg three times daily, while monitoring blood pressure, renal function, and potassium; if ACE inhibitor is not tolerated, substitute valsartan and titrate to 160 mg twice daily as tolerated, avoiding combination with an ACE inhibitor [^111pqQif] [^116bezV3] [^116JoXUi] [^116CCaJm]. Add a beta-blocker such as carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily, titrating every 3–10 days to 12.5 mg then 25 mg twice daily as tolerated, or metoprolol tartrate 25–50 mg twice daily with a long-term target of 50–100 mg twice daily, ensuring hemodynamic stability before each uptitration [^113ruXTL] [^113QBxBx]. If LVEF is ≤ 40% with symptoms or diabetes, add eplerenone 25 mg daily and titrate to 50 mg daily within 4 weeks with strict potassium and renal monitoring, and consider adding an SGLT2 inhibitor such as dapagliflozin 10 mg daily or empagliflozin 10 mg daily once the patient is stabilized and eGFR permits [^1122Vt7x] [^112Bxws3].

> Finally, I should confirm the overarching principle: target doses matter, but getting patients on therapy and uptitrating thoughtfully is the priority. Even subtarget doses confer early benefit, yet dose-escalation toward trial-proven targets yields the greatest mortality and morbidity reductions; therefore, I need to reassess at frequent intervals, minimize permanent dose reductions, and persist with uptitration unless limited by true intolerance or safety concerns [^113kHhVe] [^115mvdng] [^114p8N7W].

For adults with heart failure after myocardial infarction, use **ACE inhibitors or ARBs** [^1175CZA9] [^114PNq2J] started low and titrated to target doses: captopril 50 mg three times daily [^116bezV3] [^116Fmcqe], ramipril 5 mg twice daily [^111pqQif] [^1149iBwy], or valsartan 160 mg twice daily [^116JoXUi] [^112NJKiQ]. Add a **beta-blocker** [^113roJAv] such as carvedilol 25 mg twice daily [^113ruXTL] or metoprolol succinate 200 mg once daily [^115FpEui], titrated from low doses as tolerated [^114p8N7W]. If LVEF is ≤ 40% with symptoms or diabetes, add **eplerenone** 25–50 mg daily [^1122Vt7x] with close potassium and renal monitoring [^112cpnzG]. These therapies reduce mortality and HF hospitalizations [^114Gf5LS] [^116CCaJm]; titrate to maximally tolerated doses [^113roJAv] and monitor for hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia [^114Gf5LS] [^1122Vt7x].

## ACE inhibitors and ARBs

ACE inhibitors are **first-line** [^1175CZA9] after MI with reduced LVEF; ARBs are for ACE inhibitor intolerance [^114PNq2J].

| **Medication** | **Initial dose** | **Target dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Captopril | 6.25 mg TID | 50 mg TID [^116bezV3] [^116Fmcqe] |
| Ramipril | 2.5 mg BID | 5 mg BID [^111pqQif] [^1149iBwy] |
| Valsartan | 20–40 mg BID | 160 mg BID [^116JoXUi] [^112NJKiQ] |

---

Titrate every 1–2 weeks as tolerated, and monitor for **hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia** [^114Gf5LS].

---

## Beta-blockers

Beta-blockers are **essential** [^113roJAv] after MI with reduced LVEF; start low and titrate to target doses [^114p8N7W].

| **Medication** | **Initial dose** | **Target dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Carvedilol | 3.125–6.25 mg BID | 25 mg BID [^113ruXTL] [^115FpEui] |
| Metoprolol succinate | 12.5–25 mg daily | 200 mg daily [^115FpEui] [^1141d3Ru] |

---

Titrate every 2 weeks as tolerated, and monitor for **bradycardia, hypotension, and fatigue** [^113roJAv].

---

## Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)

MRAs are indicated for **LVEF ≤ 40% with symptoms or diabetes** [^112cpnzG] [^116CCaJm]. Eplerenone 25 mg daily is titrated to 50 mg daily [^1122Vt7x] with close monitoring of potassium and renal function [^112cpnzG].

---

## Monitoring and dose adjustments

- **Renal function and electrolytes**: Check at baseline, 1–2 weeks after initiation, and periodically thereafter [^notfound].
- **Hypotension**: Adjust or temporarily hold doses if symptomatic [^1152RZQW].
- **Hyperkalemia**: Reduce or stop MRAs if potassium ≥ 5.5 mEq/L [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes

These therapies reduce **mortality, HF hospitalizations, and adverse remodeling** [^114Gf5LS] [^116CCaJm] [^112uVe6K]. Early initiation and titration to target doses are critical for optimal outcomes [^113kHhVe] [^114p8N7W].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **ACE inhibitors or ARBs**: Titrate to target doses [^114Gf5LS].
- **Beta-blockers**: Titrate to target doses [^113roJAv].
- **MRAs**: Use in LVEF ≤ 40% with symptoms or diabetes, with close monitoring [^112cpnzG] [^116CCaJm].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess renal function, electrolytes, and blood pressure [^114Gf5LS].

---

The recommended dosing strategy is to **start low, titrate to target doses**, and monitor closely for adverse effects to maximize clinical benefit in post-MI heart failure.

2013 ACCF/AHA heart failure clinical practice guideline — aldosterone receptor antagonists are recommended as follows: "Aldosterone receptor antagonists (or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) are recommended in patients with NYHA class II–IV HF and who have LVEF of 35% or less, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality", with safety thresholds that "Creatinine should be 2.5 mg/dL or less in men or 2.0 mg/dL or less in women (or estimated glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), and potassium should be less than 5.0 mEq/L", and evidence rating "(Class I, Level of Evidence: A)". Monitoring is specified: "Careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing should be performed at initiation and closely followed thereafter to minimize risk of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency". Post–myocardial infarction use is also supported: "Aldosterone receptor antagonists are recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality following an acute MI in patients who have LVEF of 40% or less and who develop symptoms of HF or who have a history of diabetes mellitus, unless contraindicated", with "(Class I, Level of Evidence: B)".

### Captopril [^112JsuTQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart Failure: Initiation of therapy requires consideration of recent diuretic therapy and the possibility of severe salt/volume depletion. In patients with either normal or low blood pressure, who have been vigorously treated with diuretics and who may be hyponatremic and/or hypovolemic, a starting dose of 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg three times a day may minimize the magnitude or duration of the hypotensive effect (see WARNINGS: Hypotension); for these patients, titration to the usual daily dosage can then occur within the next several days.

For most patients the usual initial daily dosage is 25 mg three times a day. After a dose of 50 mg three times a day is reached, further increases in dosage should be delayed, where possible, for at least two weeks to determine if a satisfactory response occurs. Most patients studied have had a satisfactory clinical improvement at 50 mg or 100 mg three times a day. A maximum daily dose of 450 mg of captopril tablets should not be exceeded.

Captopril should generally be used in conjunction with a diuretic and digitalis. Captopril therapy must be initiated under very close medical supervision.

2.1 Heart Failure

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND CLOSELY MONITORED BY A PHYSICIAN DURING UP‑TITRATION. Prior to initiation of COREG CR, it is recommended that fluid retention be minimized. The recommended starting dose of COREG CR is 10 mg once daily for 2 weeks. Patients who tolerate a dose of 10 mg once daily may have their dose increased to 20, 40, and 80 mg over successive intervals of at least 2 weeks. Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated.

Patients should be advised that initiation of treatment and (to a lesser extent) dosage increases may be associated with transient symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness (and rarely syncope) within the first hour after dosing. Thus, during these periods, they should avoid situations such as driving or hazardous tasks, where symptoms could result in injury. Vasodilatory symptoms often do not require treatment, but it may be useful to separate the time of dosing of COREG CR from that of the ACE inhibitor or to reduce temporarily the dose of the ACE inhibitor. The dose of COREG CR should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure or vasodilation have been stabilized.

Fluid retention (with or without transient worsening heart failure symptoms) should be treated by an increase in the dose of diuretics.

The dose of COREG CR should be reduced if patients experience bradycardia (heart rate less than 55 beats per minute).

Episodes of dizziness or fluid retention during initiation of COREG CR can generally be managed without discontinuation of treatment and do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, COREG CR.

2.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND MONITORED DURING UP‑TITRATION. Treatment with COREG CR may be started as an inpatient or outpatient and should be started after the patient is hemodynamically stable and fluid retention has been minimized. It is recommended that COREG CR be started at 20 mg once daily and increased after 3 to 10 days, based on tolerability, to 40 mg once daily, then again to the target dose of 80 mg once daily. A lower starting dose may be used (10 mg once daily) and/or the rate of up‑titration may be slowed if clinically indicated (e.g., due to low blood pressure or heart rate, or fluid retention). Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. The recommended dosing regimen need not be altered in patients who received treatment with an IV or oral β‑blocker during the acute phase of the myocardial infarction.

Stage B structural heart disease without heart failure symptoms — Class I care includes the following. All Class I recommendations for Stage A should apply to patients with cardiac structural abnormalities who have not developed HF (Levels of Evidence: A, B, and C as appropriate). Beta-blockers and ACEIs should be used in all patients with a recent or remote history of MI regardless of EF or presence of HF (see Table 3) (Level of Evidence: A). Beta-blockers are indicated in all patients without a history of MI who have a reduced LVEF with no HF symptoms (see Table 3 and text) (Level of Evidence: C). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be used in patients with a reduced EF and no symptoms of HF, even if they have not experienced MI (Level of Evidence: A). An ARB should be administered to post-MI patients without HF who are intolerant of ACEIs and have a low LVEF (Level of Evidence: B). Patients who have not developed HF symptoms should be treated according to contemporary guidelines after an acute MI (Level of Evidence: C). Coronary revascularization should be recommended in appropriate patients without symptoms of HF in accordance with contemporary guidelines (Level of Evidence: A). Valve replacement or repair should be recommended for patients with hemodynamically significant valvular stenosis or regurgitation and no symptoms of HF in accordance with contemporary guidelines (Level of Evidence: B).

Asymptomatic post-MI or LV remodeling — risk and aldosterone antagonist: Patients without HF symptoms but who have had an MI or who have evidence of LV remodeling are at considerable risk of developing HF, and in such patients the incidence of HF can be decreased by reducing additional injury and by retarding LV remodeling. In this setting, the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with low EF and no HF after MI already treated with ACEIs and beta-blockers.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114o8xWv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Pre–heart failure (stage B) management to prevent clinical heart failure focuses on disease-modifying therapies and device prevention at specific left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events. In patients with a recent myocardial infarction and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality. In patients who are at least 40 days post–myocardial infarction with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving GDMT and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death to reduce total mortality. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF. In patients with LVEF < 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations. In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful.

### Reducing the risks of sudden death and heart failure post myocardial infarction: utility of optimized pharmacotherapy [^1177Nmfz]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Current guidelines define the standard of care for patients after myocardial infarction (MI), with particular focus on patients with significant ventricular dysfunction. Inherent in these recommendations are assumptions about the relative risks and benefits, as well as the costs, of the available options. This review will consider strategies to prevent sudden death and heart failure post-MI by utilization of pharmacologic therapies — angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), aldosterone antagonists, statins, and beta-blockers — in parallel with the approaches reviewed elsewhere in this supplement. A patient-centric approach necessitates that drugs in each class be compared for efficacy within this patient population. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of several drugs, such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, in patients post-MI, yet these benefits do not seem to be reflected in the epidemiologic data. This may reflect underutilization of these therapies or, alternatively, support the notion that efficacy in clinical trials does not assure effectiveness in clinical practice. The latter point is a subject of ongoing investigation, while the former is being addressed through quality-of-care initiatives. In clinical practice, aggressiveness is key, starting with patient education. If patients understand their risks better, compliance and adoption of a more ideal lifestyle seem more likely. However, even with educational programs, human nature teaches us that marked change in behavior is difficult and therefore, to minimize risks, particularly of sudden death and heart failure post infarction, an optimized pharmacologic regimen serves as a powerful tool.

1.2 Heart Failure

Valsartan tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with heart failure (NYHA class II to IV). There is no evidence that valsartan tablets provides added benefits when it is used with an adequate dose of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Post-Myocardial Infarction

### Eplerenone (Inspra) [^1122Vt7x]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

HFrEF Post-MI: Initiate treatment with 25 mg once daily. Titrate to maximum of 50 mg once daily within 4 weeks, as tolerated. Dose adjustments may be required based on potassium levels. (2.1)

Hypertension: 50 mg once daily, alone or combined with other antihypertensive agents. For inadequate response, increase to 50 mg twice daily. Higher dosages are not recommended. (2.2)

For all patients:

Measure serum potassium before starting INSPRA and periodically thereafter. (2.3)

2.1 Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction

Initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily and titrate to the recommended dose of 50 mg once daily, preferably within 4 weeks as tolerated by the patient.

Once treatment with INSPRA has begun, adjust the dose based on the serum potassium level as shown in Table 1.

2.2 Hypertension

The recommended starting dose of INSPRA is 50 mg administered once daily. The full therapeutic effect of INSPRA is apparent within 4 weeks. For patients with an inadequate blood pressure response to 50 mg once daily increase the dosage of INSPRA to 50 mg twice daily. Higher dosages of INSPRA are not recommended because they have no greater effect on blood pressure than 100 mg and are associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

2.3 Recommended Monitoring

Measure serum potassium before initiating INSPRA therapy, within the first week, and at one month after the start of treatment or dose adjustment. Assess serum potassium periodically thereafter.

Check serum potassium and serum creatinine within 3–7 days of a patient initiating a moderate CYP3A inhibitor ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II blockers or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories.

2.4 Dose Modification for Use with Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors

In post-MI HFrEF patients receiving a moderate CYP3A inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin, saquinavir, verapamil, and fluconazole), do not exceed 25 mg once daily. In patients with hypertension receiving a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, initiate at 25 mg once daily. For inadequate blood pressure response, dosing may be increased to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Lessons from the management of chronic heart failure [^116wUeWM]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

In seeking to implement evidence based medicine for the patient with heart failure occurring after a myocardial infarction (MI), much can be learnt from the long road to delivery of best care for the patient with chronic heart failure (CHF) caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Both patient groups are part of the same cardiovascular continuum. A mass of evidence has accrued for the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists on both morbidity and mortality across a wide spectrum of patient severity. This evidence has informed the development of management guidelines, although registry data showed that uptake of treatments remained low, leading to research focused on how heart failure care could be delivered more effectively. This has resulted in a range of heart failure management programmes, many of which have been shown to reduce hospital admission rates and to improve adherence with treatments. Multidisciplinary heart failure management programmes that span primary and secondary care are now considered a routine "standard" to be aspired to in delivering effective CHF care. Applying such an approach to the care of the post-MI heart failure patient should be equally important.

### Ramipril [^111pqQif]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Hypertension

The recommended initial dose for patients not receiving a diuretic is 2.5 mg once a day. Adjust dose according to blood pressure response. The usual maintenance dosage range is 2.5 mg to 20 mg per day administered as a single dose or in two equally divided doses. In some patients treated once daily, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. In such patients, consider an increase in dosage or twice daily administration. If blood pressure is not controlled with ramipril alone, a diuretic can be added.

2.2 Reduction in Risk of Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Death from Cardiovascular Causes

Initiate dosing at 2.5 mg once daily for 1 week, 5 mg once daily for the next 3 weeks, and then increase as tolerated, to a maintenance dose of 10 mg once daily. If the patient is hypertensive or recently post-myocardial infarction, ramipril capsule can also be given as a divided dose.

2.3 Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction

For the treatment of post-myocardial infarction patients who have shown signs of congestive heart failure, the recommended starting dose of ramipril is 2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg per day). A patient who becomes hypotensive at this dose may be switched to 1.25 mg twice daily. After one week at the starting dose, increase dose (if tolerated) toward a target dose of 5 mg twice daily, with dosage increases being about 3 weeks apart.

After the initial dose of ramipril, observe the patient under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour. If possible, reduce the dose of any concomitant diuretic as this may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of ramipril does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)].

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Class IIa–III recommendations for asymptomatic patients and device therapy — angiotensin system blockers, ICDs, and therapies to avoid: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or ARBs can be beneficial in patients with hypertension and LVH and no symptoms of HF (Level of Evidence B). Angiotensin II receptor blockers can be beneficial in patients with low EF and no symptoms of HF who are intolerant of ACEIs (Level of Evidence: C). Placement of an ICD is reasonable in ischemic cardiomyopathy patients who are at least 40 days post-MI, have an LVEF of 30% or less, are NYHA functional class I on chronic optimal medical therapy, and have reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 year (Level of Evidence: B). Placement of an ICD might be considered in patients without HF who have nonischemic cardiomyopathy and an LVEF less than or equal to 30% who are in NYHA functional class I with chronic optimal medical therapy and have a reasonable expectation of survival with good functional status for more than 1 year (Level of Evidence: C). Digoxin should not be used in patients with low EF, sinus rhythm, and no history of HF symptoms, because the risk of harm is not balanced by any known benefit (Level of Evidence: C). Use of nutritional supplements to treat structural heart disease or to prevent the development of symptoms of HF is not recommended (Level of Evidence: C). Calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful in asymptomatic patients with low LVEF and no symptoms of HF after MI (Level of Evidence: C).

### American college of cardiology / American Heart Association chronic heart failure evaluation and management guidelines: relevance to the geriatric practice [^115yovp1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is the only cardiovascular disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines.

Purpose

The purpose of revising the 1995 ACC/AHA guidelines was to incorporate recent advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to HF treatment and to assist physicians in clinical decision-making in the management of HF.

Methods

The ACC/AHA invited representatives from the American College of Chest Physicians, the Heart Failure Society of America, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine to participate in the preparation of the guidelines. The writing committee searched pertinent medical literature in English using computerized databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and manually searching the bibliographies of the selected articles. The writing committee classified HF into four stages, including patients who are at high risk for developing HF. According to this new classification, Stage A and B represent asymptomatic patients, the former at high risk for developing HF but no structural disorder, the latter with structural disorders of the heart. Stage C encompasses patients with underlying structural heart disorders who are symptomatic, either currently or in the past. Stage D includes end-stage HF patients. This new classification is intended to complement the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of HF into Class I (asymptomatic), Class II (symptomatic on less than ordinary exertion), Class III (symptomatic on ordinary exertion), and Class IV (symptomatic at rest).

Results

The recommendations are categorized into those for evaluation and management.

### Carvedilol [^114XWFe1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND MONITORED DURING UP-TITRATION. Treatment with carvedilol tablets may be started as an inpatient or outpatient and should be started after the patient is hemodynamically stable and fluid retention has been minimized. It is recommended that carvedilol tablets be started at 6.25 mg twice daily and increased after 3 to 10 days, based on tolerability, to 12.5 mg twice daily, then again to the target dose of 25 mg twice daily. A lower starting dose may be used (3.125 mg twice daily) and/or the rate of up-titration may be slowed if clinically indicated (e.g., due to low blood pressure or heart rate, or fluid retention). Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. The recommended dosing regimen need not be altered in patients who received treatment with an IV or oral β-blocker during the acute phase of the myocardial infarction.

2.3 Hypertension

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED. The recommended starting dose of carvedilol tablets are 6.25 mg twice daily. If this dose is tolerated, using standing systolic pressure measured about 1 hour after dosing as a guide, the dose should be maintained for 7 to 14 days, and then increased to 12.5 mg twice daily if needed, based on trough blood pressure, again using standing systolic pressure 1 hour after dosing as a guide for tolerance. This dose should also be maintained for 7 to 14 days and can then be adjusted upward to 25 mg twice daily if tolerated and needed. The full antihypertensive effect of carvedilol tablets are seen within 7 to 14 days. Total daily dose should not exceed 50 mg.

Concomitant administration with a diuretic can be expected to produce additive effects and exaggerate the orthostatic component of carvedilol action.

2.4 Hepatic Impairment

Carvedilol tablets should not be given to patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4)].

Stage B (patients with pre-HF) — preventing clinical heart failure (HF) recommendations include: In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality (Class 1, Level A). In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS), statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events (Class 1, Level A). In patients with a recent MI and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients with a recent or remote history of MI or ACS and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients who are at least 40 days post-MI with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) to reduce total mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF (Class 1, Level C-LD). In patients with LVEF ≤ 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations (Class 3: Harm, Level B-R). In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful (Class 3: Harm, Level C-LD).

### A hard look at angiotensin receptor blockers in heart failure [^115YgDjY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Multiple trials over the past several years have examined indications for angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction, both acutely after myocardial infarction and in chronic heart failure. Yet despite these data, there is still confusion regarding the efficacy of ARBs as monotherapy in these patient populations, as well as the specific indications for combination ARB/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. We examine the key differences among the trials-including the ACE inhibitor dose, the ARB and its dose, blood pressure reduction, and patient populations-to present our perspective on ARB use, alone or in combination with ACE inhibitors, in patients with chronic heart failure and post-myocardial infarction left ventricular dysfunction. We conclude that ACE inhibitors remain the first-line therapy for left ventricular dysfunction. Angiotensin receptor blockers should be reserved for monotherapy in ACE intolerant patients and for combination therapy in symptomatic class II/III patients with chronic heart failure.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^114XDPEm]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Do the benefits of foundational drugs depend on background therapy?

Assuming that there are four foundational pharmacological treatments for patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, it is important to ask if the efficacy of each treatment is influenced (favourably or unfavourably) by co‐administration of the other therapies. Are angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors effective only in patients receiving beta‐blockers? Are the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors evident only if patients are receiving mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists? It is understood that each drug class was tested in patients already receiving certain background therapy; however, the fact that background therapy was present does not imply that the background therapy was needed for the study medication to have demonstrated efficacy in a large‐scale trial.

It is therefore noteworthy that the totality of evidence from randomized controlled trials strongly indicates that background therapy does not influence the response to each of the foundational drug classes (Table 1). In general, for patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, beta‐blockers were tested in patients already receiving conventional inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system. However, in the post‐infarction setting, the converse was true, i.e. angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors were typically tested in patients already receiving beta‐blockers. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure following a myocardial infarction, beta‐blockers were shown to reduce mortality in trials with and without background therapy with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor. Furthermore, the first trial with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (RALES) tested spironolactone in patients who were largely not receiving a beta‐blocker, but the second trial of the drug class (EMPHASIS‐HF) tested eplerenone in a setting where most patients were receiving a beta‐blocker as background therapy; the benefits reported in the two trials were similar. Enalapril was effective in reducing mortality in a trial in which > 50% of the patients received spironolactone and in a trial where potassium‐sparing diuretics were prescribed to < 10%. In the large‐scale trials with sacubitril/valsartan and with SGLT2 inhibitors, the favourable effects of both drug treatments were similar whether patients were or were not receiving a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitors were effective in reducing hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes (with a magnitude similar to that seen in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction), but most of the patients in these trials were not receiving spironolactone or eplerenone. Finally, in the two trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, background therapy with a neprilysin inhibitor did not minimize the benefits of treatment with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. Background therapy has influenced the effects of the study medication only when the treatments unequivocally interfered with the same pathophysiological pathway (i.e. angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and renin inhibitors).

### One-year landmark analysis of the effect of beta-blocker dose on survival after acute myocardial infarction [^116h3vXe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although beta‐blockers are recommended following myocardial infarction (MI), the benefits of long‐term treatment have not been established. The study's aim was to evaluate beta‐blocker efficacy by dose in 1‐year post‐MI survivors.

Methods and Results

The OBTAIN (Outcomes of Beta‐Blocker Therapy After Myocardial Infarction) registry included 7057 patients with acute MI, with 6077 one‐year survivors. For this landmark analysis, beta‐blocker dose status was available in 3004 patients and analyzed by use (binary) and dose at 1 year after MI. Doses were classified as no beta‐blocker and > 0% to 12.5%, > 12.5% to 25%, > 25% to 50%, and > 50% of target doses used in randomized clinical trials. Age was 63 to 64 years, and approximately two thirds were men. Median follow‐up duration was 1.05 years (interquartile range, 0.98–1.22). When analyzed dichotomously, beta‐blocker therapy was not associated with improved survival. When analyzed by dose, propensity score analysis showed significantly increased mortality in the no–beta‐blocker group (hazard ratio,1.997; 95% CI, 1.118–3.568; P < 0.02), the > 0% to 12.5% group (hazard ratio, 1.817; 95% CI, 1.094–3.016; P < 0.02), and the > 25% to 50% group (hazard ratio, 1.764; 95% CI, 1.105–2.815; P < 0.02), compared with the > 12.5% to 25% dose group. The mortality in the full‐dose group was not significantly higher (hazard ratio, 1.196; 95% CI, 0.687–2.083). In subgroup analyses, only history of congestive heart failure demonstrated significant interaction with beta‐blocker effects on survival.

Conclusions

This analysis suggests that patients treated with > 12.5% to 25% of the target dose used in prior randomized clinical trials beyond 1 year after MI may have enhanced survival compared with no beta‐blocker and other beta‐blocker doses. A new paradigm for post‐MI beta‐blocker therapy is needed that addresses which patients should be treated, for how long, and at what dose.

### Carvedilol phosphate [^113mcQHb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND MONITORED DURING UP-TITRATION. Treatment with carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules may be started as an inpatient or outpatient and should be started after the patient is hemodynamically stable and fluid retention has been minimized. It is recommended that carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules be started at 20 mg once daily and increased after 3 to 10 days, based on tolerability, to 40 mg once daily, then again to the target dose of 80 mg once daily. A lower starting dose may be used (10 mg once daily) and/or the rate of up-titration may be slowed if clinically indicated (e.g., due to low blood pressure or heart rate, or fluid retention). Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. The recommended dosing regimen need not be altered in patients who received treatment with an IV or oral beta-blocker during the acute phase of the myocardial infarction.

2.3 Hypertension

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED. The recommended starting dose of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules is 20 mg once daily. If this dose is tolerated, using standing systolic pressure measured about one hour after dosing as a guide, the dose should be maintained for 7 to 14 days, and then increased to 40 mg once daily if needed, based on trough blood pressure, again using standing systolic pressure one hour after dosing as a guide for tolerance. This dose should also be maintained for 7 to 14 days and can then be adjusted upward to 80 mg once daily if tolerated and needed. Although not specifically studied, it is anticipated the full antihypertensive effect of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules would be seen within 7 to 14 days as had been demonstrated with immediate-release carvedilol. Total daily dose should not exceed 80 mg.

Concomitant administration with a diuretic can be expected to produce additive effects and exaggerate the orthostatic component of carvedilol action.

### Β-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction: a little goes a long way [^113bqgHy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The optimal dosing of BBL therapy after MI in the contemporary era is another unanswered question. The dosing of BBL was not collected in the Cardiovascular Risk and Identification of Potential High‐Risk Population in Acute Myocardial Infarction registry, and the interaction of dose and duration on outcomes after MI is unknown. The only contemporary randomized controlled trial of BBL versus placebo that investigated outcomes past 3 years was in a selected group of patients with MI, those with STEMI undergoing primary PCI who had normal ejection fraction. In the study, 801 patients were enrolled and the BBL was carvedilol. The intended dose titration was to 20 mg/d; however, dosing was at the discretion of the physician and averaged only 6.3 mg/d at 1 year. The trial failed to show a benefit of BBL on the primary outcome, which was a composite of all‐cause death, MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and acute coronary syndrome. Although the low dose of BBLs may have influenced the potential therapeutic effect, several national registries suggest that patients after MI are treated with BBL doses well below the target range of earlier randomized trials. In addition, several nonrandomized studies supported the use of BBL over no BBL but failed to demonstrate a greater effect of high‐ compared with low‐dose therapy, with low dose defined as either < 25% or 50% of the target dose, depending on the study. In the OBTAIN registry, in fact, the lowest mortality was found with 25% of the target dose.

Circling back to the optimal duration of BBL therapy after MI, this rigorously adjusted analysis adds evidence that maintenance therapy beyond 36 months is associated with lower mortality. A review of landmark analyses from large national registries evaluating benefits of long‐term use of BBLs after acute MI, however, shows conflicting results, with several showing no difference in mortality or composite outcomes (Table). So, how can the results be so divergent? Although these observational trials provide a window into real‐world practices and outcomes, differences in patient populations, BBL cardioselectivity and dosing, analytic techniques, and unmeasured confounders exist. Ultimately, evidence from ongoing adequately powered randomized trials is required to make definitive recommendations.

Rationale and recommendations for dosing of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction emphasize outcome benefits and titration to target or maximally tolerated doses. The rationale states that use of guideline-recommended beta blockers "has been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF, and studies have supported a dose-response relationship of beta blockers with improved outcomes", and that "treating at less than the target dose may result in worse clinical outcomes" with "the percentage of patients achieving these doses is low and remains low over time". It adds, "Treatment with a beta blocker should be initiated at very low doses, followed by gradual incremental increases in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated. Clinicians should make every effort to achieve the target doses of the beta blockers shown to be effective in major clinical trials". The 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline specifies, "Use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (eg, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality" with "(Class I, Level of Evidence: A)". The 2017 ACC decision pathway adds, "After a diagnosis of heart failure is made, GDMT should be initiated and therapies should be adjusted no more frequently than every 2 weeks to target doses (or maximally tolerated doses)" and "To achieve the maximal benefits of GDMT in patients with chronic HFrEF, therapies must be initiated and titrated to maximally tolerated doses".

To review literature relating to significant changes in drug therapy recommendations in the 1999 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for treating patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Data Sources

1999 ACC/AHA AMI guidelines, English-language clinical trials, reviews, and editorials researching the role of drug therapy and primary angioplasty for AMI that were referenced in the guidelines were included. Additional data published in 2000 or unpublished were also included if relevant to interpretation of the guidelines.

Study Selection

The articles selected influence AMI treatment recommendations.

Data Synthesis

Many clinicians and health systems use the ACC/AHA AMI guidelines to develop treatment plans for AMI patients. This review highlights important changes in AMI drug therapy recommendations by reviewing the results of recent clinical trials. Insights into evolving drug therapy strategies that may impact future guideline development are also described.

Conclusions

Several changes in drug therapy recommendations were included in the 1999 AMI ACC/AHA guidelines. There is emphasis on administering fibrin-specific thrombolytics secondary to enhanced efficacy. Selection between fibrin-specific agents is unclear at this time. Low response rates to thrombolytics have been noted in the elderly, women, patients with heart failure, and those showing left bundle-branch block on the electrocardiogram. These patient groups should be targeted for improved utilization programs. The use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors in non-ST-segment elevation MI was emphasized. Small trials combining reduced doses of thrombolytics with GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors have shown promise by increasing reperfusion rates without increasing bleeding risk, but firm conclusions cannot be made until the results of larger trials are known. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) trials suggest lower mortality rates for primary PCI when compared with thrombolysis alone. However, primary PCI, including coronary angioplasty, is only available at approximately 13% of US hospitals, making thrombolysis the preferred strategy for most patients. Clopidogrel has supplanted ticlopidine as the recommended antiplatelet agent for patients with aspirin allergy or intolerance following reports of a better safety profile. The recommended dose of unfractionated heparin is lower than previously recommended, necessitating a separate nomogram for patients with acute coronary syndromes. Routine use of warfarin, either alone or in combination with aspirin, is not supported by clinical trials; however, warfarin remains a choice for antithrombotic therapy in patients intolerant to aspirin. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers continue to be recommended, and emphasis is placed on improving rates of early administration (during hospitalization), even in patients with moderate left ventricular dysfunction. New recommendations for drug treatment of post-AMI patients with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and/or elevated triglycerides are included, with either niacin or gemfibrozil recommended as an option. Supplementary antioxidants are not recommended for either primary or secondary prevention of AMI, with new data demonstrating lack of efficacy vitamin E in primary prevention. Estrogen replacement therapy or hormonal replacement therapy should not be initiated solely for prevention of cardiovascular disease, but can be continued in cardiovascular patients already taking long-term therapy for other reasons. Bupropion has been added as a new treatment option for smoking cessation. As drug therapy continues to evolve in treating AMI, more frequent updates of therapy guidelines will be necessary.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^114yy489]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Recommendation 6 — initial antihypertensive therapy in adults: In the general population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Moderate Recommendation – Grade B. For this recommendation, only RCTs that compared one class of antihypertensive medication to another and assessed the effects on health outcomes were reviewed; placebo-controlled RCTs were not included. Each of the 4 drug classes recommended by the panel in recommendation 6 yielded comparable effects on overall mortality and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and kidney outcomes, with one exception: heart failure. Initial treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic was more effective than a CCB or ACEI, and an ARB was more effective than a CCB in improving heart failure outcomes. The panel also acknowledged that the evidence supported BP control, rather than a specific agent to be used to achieve that control, as the most consistent determinant for risk reduction. β-Blockers were not recommended as first-line therapy because in one study initial treatment with a β-blocker resulted in a higher rate of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke compared to use of an ARB, a finding that was driven largely by an increase in stroke. Similar to those in the general population, this recommendation applies to those with diabetes because trials including participants with diabetes showed no differences in major cardiovascular or cerebrovascular outcomes from those in the general population.

### Ramipril (Altace) [^111T2BkC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction

ALTACE was studied in the AIRE trial. This was a multinational (mainly European) 161-center, 2006-patient, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study comparing ALTACE to placebo in stable patients, 2–9 days after an acute myocardial infarction, who had shown clinical signs of congestive heart failure at any time after the myocardial infarction. Patients in severe (NYHA class IV) heart failure, patients with unstable angina, patients with heart failure of congenital or valvular etiology, and patients with contraindications to ACE inhibitors were all excluded. The majority of patients had received thrombolytic therapy at the time of the index infarction, and the average time between infarction and initiation of treatment was 5 days.

Patients randomized to ALTACE treatment were given an initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily. If the initial regimen caused undue hypotension, the dose was reduced to 1.25 mg, but in either event doses were titrated upward (as tolerated) to a target regimen (achieved in 77% of patients randomized to ALTACE) of 5 mg twice daily. Patients were then followed for an average of 15 months, with the range of follow-up between 6 and 46 months.

The use of ALTACE was associated with a 27% reduction (p = 0.002) in the risk of death from any cause; about 90% of the deaths that occurred were cardiovascular, mainly sudden death. The risks of progression to severe heart failure and of congestive heart failure-related hospitalization were also reduced, by 23% (p = 0.017) and 26% (p = 0.011), respectively. The benefits of ALTACE therapy were seen in both genders, and they were not affected by the exact timing of the initiation of therapy, but older patients may have had a greater benefit than those under 65. The benefits were seen in patients on (and not on) various concomitant medications. At the time of randomization these included aspirin (about 80% of patients), diuretics (about 60%), organic nitrates (about 55%), beta-blockers (about 20%), calcium channel blockers (about 15%), and digoxin (about 12%).

Stage B HF — angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) versus ACEi after MI: Two major trials have compared ARB with ACEi after MI; in VALIANT (Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction), which included approximately 25% of patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction, the benefits of valsartan on mortality and other adverse cardiovascular outcomes were comparable to captopril, whereas in OPTIMAAL (Optimal Trial in Myocardial Infarction with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan) losartan did not meet the noninferiority criteria for mortality compared with captopril and the lower dose of losartan (50 mg daily) may have contributed to the difference; no clinical trials have specifically evaluated ARB in patients with asymptomatic reduced LVEF in the absence of previous MI, and although ARB are alternatives for patients with ACEi-induced angioedema, caution is advised because some patients have also developed angioedema with ARB.

### Ramipril [^1149iBwy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction

Ramipril was studied in the AIRE trial. This was a multinational (mainly European) 161-center, 2006-patient, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study comparing ramipril to placebo in stable patients, 2 to 9 days after an acute myocardial infarction, who had shown clinical signs of congestive heart failure at any time after the myocardial infarction. Patients in severe (NYHA class IV) heart failure, patients with unstable angina, patients with heart failure of congenital or valvular etiology, and patients with contraindications to ACE inhibitors were all excluded. The majority of patients had received thrombolytic therapy at the time of the index infarction, and the average time between infarction and initiation of treatment was 5 days.

Patients randomized to ramipril treatment were given an initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily. If the initial regimen caused undue hypotension, the dose was reduced to 1.25 mg, but in either event doses were titrated upward (as tolerated) to a target regimen (achieved in 77% of patients randomized to ramipril) of 5 mg twice daily. Patients were then followed for an average of 15 months, with the range of follow-up between 6 and 46 months.

The use of ramipril was associated with a 27% reduction (p = 0.002) in the risk of death from any cause; about 90% of the deaths that occurred were cardiovascular, mainly sudden death. The risks of progression to severe heart failure and of congestive heart failure-related hospitalization were also reduced, by 23% (p = 0.017) and 26% (p = 0.011), respectively. The benefits of ramipril therapy were seen in both genders, and they were not affected by the exact timing of the initiation of therapy, but older patients may have had a greater benefit than those under 65. The benefits were seen in patients on (and not on) various concomitant medications. At the time of randomization these included aspirin (about 80% of patients), diuretics (about 60%), organic nitrates (about 55%), beta-blockers (about 20%), calcium channel blockers (about 15%), and digoxin (about 12%).

### Evaluating the application of chronic heart failure therapies and developing treatments in individuals with recent myocardial infarction: a review [^114vZBoE]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Despite advances in cardiac care, patients remain at a high risk of death and the development of heart failure (HF) following myocardial infarction (MI). These risks are highest in patients with reduced ejection fraction (EF) or signs of HF immediately after MI. Drugs to mitigate these risks have been identified through the systematic evaluation of therapies with proven efficacy in patients with HF and reduced EF (HFrEF).

Observations

Although landmark studies in patients with HFrEF consistently exclude patients with recent MI, dedicated post-MI trials of these drugs have led to multiple therapies with proven benefit in these patients. However, not all therapies with proven efficacy in patients with chronic HF have been shown to provide benefit in the post-MI population, as recently evidenced by the discrepant results between chronic HF and post-MI trials of sacubitril-valsartan. Similarly, multiple trials of early and aggressive use of therapies effective in chronic heart failure immediately post-MI failed to demonstrate benefit or were associated with harm, emphasizing the vulnerability of the post-MI population.

Conclusions and Relevance

Trials of patients at high risk of HF following MI have emphasized the differences between the post-MI and HFrEF populations and the necessity for dedicated trials in the post-MI population. This review summarizes trials studying the use of these therapies for at-risk patients following MI from therapies used in patients with HFrEF and exploring new potential therapies for this high-risk population.

### Practical algorithms for pharmacologic management of the post myocardial infarction patient [^111q19so]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The pharmacologic management of the patient post myocardial infarction (MI) aims to achieve several goals. Chief among these is to prevent subsequent events, which include death, reinfarction, and rehospitalization. Secondary goals include preventing arrhythmias, minimizing left ventricular (LV) remodeling, and preventing progression to heart failure. This review describes practical algorithms for use in the pharmacologic management of the patient post MI based on American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines. The intensity of drug treatment is determined guided by the degree of LV dysfunction and the presence or absence of ischemia and arrhythmic risk markers. All patients post MI require an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and antiplatelet therapy, usually with aspirin. In individuals who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is an adequate substitute. Numerous studies document the efficacy of ACE inhibitors, which decrease mortality and the risk of heart failure and stroke. Aldosterone blockade is recommended long-term for patients post MI with an LV ejection fraction ≤ 40% and either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes. Use of a beta blocker is an important addition to most post-MI drug regimens. Beta blockers decrease mortality and are especially effective in patients with impaired LV function. Among the beta blockers, carvedilol, which also has alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking activity, was found to decrease mortality significantly in patients with low ejection fractions and heart failure. Another drug therapy of value in post-MI treatment is use of calcium-channel blockers. These are restricted to patients with conserved LV function in whom congestion is absent and in whom beta blockers are contraindicated. Current guidelines also recommend that patients post MI with elevated cholesterol levels should be prescribed lipid therapy with a statin at hospital discharge.

### Real-world algorithms for the optimal use of drugs and devices in the patient post myocardial infarction and the future of post myocardial infarction management [^117HKDdg]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) are at increased risk for dying suddenly of cardiac causes. The most common causes of LVD are coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI). Aggressive intervention following MI is essential for minimizing the myocardial damage that leads to LVD and the subsequent risk for heart failure and sudden cardiac death. This article describes practical algorithms for managing the patient post MI to minimize such risks. The degree of LVD is a key factor for determining clinical management strategies in the patient post MI. Risk factor reduction and selective neurohormonal blockade, especially with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are usually recommended in the presence or absence of LVD, along with early use of a beta blocker. In patients with LVD, more aggressive intervention includes extended use of a beta blocker. In cases of LVD progressed to heart failure, the mixed beta and alpha blocker carvedilol has improved outcomes significantly. In clinical trials, carvedilol has been demonstrated to have antiarrhythmic activity, a property that offers protection against sudden arrhythmic death in high-risk patients with LVD. Addition of an aldosterone antagonist is also advised in patients with heart failure. In selected patients with reduced ejection fractions, use of surgical/catheter treatment and device therapy offers further benefits.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^114bczHV]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

To complicate matters further, it is not possible to state with confidence that differences in dosing within the subtarget range lead to different benefits. Can we claim that 10 mg of enalapril daily is superior to 5 mg daily? Do we know that metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily is superior to 50 mg daily? Because physicians cannot answer these questions, it is not possible to make evidence‐based comparative judgments. One can only ask if the patient was treated using the forced‐titration strategies that were deployed in the landmark clinical trials. We cannot assume that subtarget strategies are ineffective or inferior, but we do know that they are untested and unproven.

Therefore, we can ask physicians to describe (i) whether patients are receiving each of the recommended neurohormonal antagonists; (ii) whether patients are being treated with target doses of each of these drugs; and (iii) if they are receiving the drug at subtarget doses, whether the patient had been tried on higher doses that could not be tolerated, despite reasonable efforts at rechallenge or adjustment of concomitant medications. Accordingly, three strata are proposed. Stratum I represents the deployment of the specific trial‐based strategies that have been shown to prolong survival, i.e. the use of target doses or the use of the highest tolerated doses using the forced‐titration regimens shown to be effective in reducing mortality. Stratum II represents the use of the drug at a subtarget dose for reasons that are unrelated to demonstrable and clinically important intolerance (e.g. patient or physician preferences, overemphasis of clinical stability, fears of the possibility of adverse effects, lack of knowledge of target doses); all of these reasons are grouped together in a non‐hierarchical manner. This stratum is intended to encompass the prescribing of drugs in all ways that do not specifically replicate the strategies that were utilized in the landmark clinical trials. Stratum III indicates that the patient is not receiving the critical drug at any dose.

### Comparison of metoprolol versus carvedilol after acute myocardial infarction [^117SyhDx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers are typically prescribed following myocardial infarction (MI), but no specific beta-blocker is recommended. Of 7,057 patients enrolled in the OBTAIN multi-center registry of patients with acute MI, 4142 were discharged on metoprolol and 1487 on carvedilol. Beta-blocker dose was indexed to the target daily dose used in randomized clinical trials (metoprolol-200 mg; carvedilol-50 mg), reported as %. Beta-blocker dosage groups were > 0% to12.5% (n = 1,428), > 12.5% to 25% (n = 2113), > 25% to 50% (n = 1,392), and > 50% (n = 696). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate 3-year survival. Correction for baseline differences was achieved by multivariable adjustment. Patients treated with carvedilol were older (64.4 vs 63.3 years) and had more comorbidities: hypertension, diabetes, prior MI, congestive heart failure, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and a longer length of stay. Mean doses for metoprolol and carvedilol did not significantly differ (37.2 ± 27.8% and 35.8 ± 31.0%, respectively). The 3-year survival estimates were 88.2% and 83.5% for metoprolol and carvedilol, respectively, with an unadjusted HR = 0.72 (p < 0.0001), but after multivariable adjustment HR = 1.073 (p = 0.43). Patients in the > 12.5% to 25% dose category had improved survival compared with other dose categories. Subgroup analysis of patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, showed worse survival with metoprolol versus carvedilol (adjusted HR = 1.281; 95% CI: 1.024 to 1.602, p = 0.03). In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction > 40%, there were no differences in survival with carvedilol versus metoprolol. In conclusion, overall survival after acute MI was similar for patients treated with metoprolol or carvedilol, but may be superior for carvedilol in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%.

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what is the 'right' dose? [^115tqEk2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Do we have any other trial evidence about toleration of evidence‐based therapy?

For one evidence‐based drug, enalapril, there is evidence about the success rate in achieving different target doses. Here, an indirect comparison of the CONSENSUS and SOLVD‐T trials is instructive (Table 1). In CONSENSUS, only 22% of patients randomized to enalapril were titrated to the target dose of 20 mg twice daily, compared with the 49% reaching the target dose of 10 mg twice daily in SOLVD‐T. A better comparison is provided by a trial in which patients were randomized to enalapril 20 or 60 mg/day. In that trial, Nanas and colleagues reported that 72.5% and 32.5% of the patients, respectively, reached their target enalapril doses by the end of 3 months of follow‐up, and 79.6% and 45.5% by the end of the first year. Although patient characteristics may influence the likelihood of attaining the target dose, collectively, these data suggest that the current target dose of at least enalapril (i.e. 10 mg twice daily) has been chosen appropriately.

A unique analysis of EMPHASIS‐HF discussed in the next section also shows that the target dose of an MRA (eplerenone) may be smaller in some participants than others, depending on patient characteristics, and yet be highly effective.

Unfortunately, similar data do not exist for beta‐blockers.

### Improving outcomes in post-acute myocardial infarction heart failure: incorporation of aldosterone blockade into combination therapy to optimize neurohormonal blockade [^113X5Pjb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and beta-blockers have been proved to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI), studies show that these agents are consistently underused in this population. Further, morbidity and mortality remain high even when standard-of-care therapies are applied. Thus, new strategies have been sought to better counteract the maladaptive effects of neurohormonal stimulation in post-AMI heart failure. The Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS) demonstrated that the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone, when used in addition to standard therapy, results in significant incremental improvements in survival and morbidity and is safe and well tolerated in this setting. Based on this, major therapeutic guidelines in the United States and Europe now strongly recommend that all eligible patients with concomitant heart failure post-AMI be treated with an aldosterone blocker in addition to an ACE inhibitor (or an ARB) and a beta-blocker. To achieve needed improvements in outcomes in this population, early and consistent initiation of these evidence-based, guideline-recommended therapies in all eligible patients is crucial.

Critical factors that contribute to the widespread failure to achieve and maintain target doses of neurohormonal antagonists

Why are most patients with chronic heart failure treated for long periods of time with only one or two drugs or with doses that are much lower than the doses that have been shown to prolong life? There are several contributory factors.

First, many physicians may be unfamiliar with the doses of neurohormonal antagonists that have been shown to prolong survival in chronic heart failure. The target doses of most neurohormonal antagonists used to treat heart failure are typically higher than the doses of the drugs when they are used to treat other cardiovascular disorders. For example, the usual doses of candesartan and valsartan used for the treatment of hypertension (4–8 mg daily and 40–80 mg daily, respectively) are far lower than the target doses in the large‐scale trials in heart failure (32 and 320 mg daily, respectively). 30, 31 Similarly, the optimal dose for losartan for heart failure (150 mg daily) is higher than that approved in the US for any cardiovascular indication 19; the commonly prescribed dose of 50 mg daily appears to be inferior to ACE inhibitors with respect to mortality reduction. 32, 33 The dose of metoprolol succinate used for hypertension or angina is 25–100 mg daily, but the target dose used in the landmark heart failure trial was 200 mg daily. 34

Patient Characteristics, Testing, and Treatments

Baseline characteristics, precipitating etiology, diagnostic testing, and in‐hospital treatments for patients with T2MI were recorded. For those who underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram during admission, the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was recorded. Among patients with T2MI and a history of HF, the classification of HF (ie, preserved [HFpEF], mid‐range [HFmrEF], or reduced EF [HFrEF]) was recorded. Among T2MI patients with a history of HFrEF or newly diagnosed HFrEF, admission and discharge guideline directed medications and dosages were recorded (ie, angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme inhibitors [ACEI], angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARB], beta blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and sacubitril/valsartan).

Outcomes

Among patients with T2MI with available follow‐up data, the occurrence and number of hospitalizations for HF was determined at 30 days, 180 days, and 1 year post discharge. Hospitalizations for HF were identified at our institution or outside institutions when data were available (identified by chart review of available records from outside institutions and data linked to our medical record system). Patients who were discharged to hospice or who did not have clear follow‐up data beyond their index T2MI hospitalization in the electronic medical record were excluded from the event analyses. The median number of HF hospitalizations were determined. Among patients who experienced a HF hospitalization during the follow‐up period, the classification of HF was determined (HFpEF, HFmrEF, and HFrEF) based on available echocardiography data at that time. In subgroup analyses, the incidence of HF hospitalization among T2MI with prevalent or newly diagnosed HF during their index T2MI event was determined. The incidence of HF among patients with T2MI with no history of HF (either prior to or during their index T2MI admission) was also recorded. Lastly, we compared outcomes among patients with myocardial injury who were miscoded as a T2MI and patients adjudicated to have T2MI.

Secondary outcomes recorded included cardiovascular death at 30 days, 180 days, and 1 year post discharge and a composite end point of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF at each timepoint. Cardiovascular death includes death from acute MI, HF, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, or sudden cardiac death.

### Incident heart failure and recurrent coronary events following acute myocardial infarction [^112Atf9n]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients who develop post-myocardial infarction (MI) heart failure (HF) have a high risk for mortality and rehospitalizations. Reducing the risk of recurrent ischaemic events after an acute MI is a major therapeutic goal and has led to significant advances in systems of care, revascularization strategies, and drug therapy targeting secondary prevention. New onset HF is another adverse consequence complicating MI. Estimates from over a decade ago suggest that 20%–25% of patients develop HF during an MI admission or after discharge. Several therapies have shown risk reduction for death or HF in high-risk patients following an MI, such as beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). It has been two decades, however, since a drug therapy was shown to reduce the risk for HF after an acute MI. Herein, we leveraged an integrated healthcare system's data to evaluate contemporary trends in patient characteristics, and risks and outcomes related to the development of incident HF and recurrent MI in patients post-MI, to inform the need for clinical and research priorities.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Beta-blocker–related hypotension — timing and management state that beta-blockers, especially those that also block alpha-1-receptors, can produce hypotension, and for beta-blockers that also block alpha-receptors, such as carvedilol, these vasodilatory side effects are generally seen within 24 to 48 hours of the first dose or the first increase in dose and usually subside with repeated dosing without any change in dose. Physicians may minimize the risk of hypotension by administering the beta-blocker and ACEI at different times during the day, and if this is ineffective, the occurrence of hypotension may require a temporary reduction in the dose of the ACEI. Hypotensive symptoms may also resolve after a decrease in the dose of diuretics in patients who are volume depleted, and if hypotension is accompanied by other clinical evidence of hypoperfusion, beta-blocker therapy should be decreased or discontinued pending further patient evaluation.

### Captopril [^116enigz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 2,231 patients (age 21 years to 79 years) who survived the acute phase of myocardial infarction and did not have active ischemia. Patients had left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), defined as a resting left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, but at the time of randomization were not sufficiently symptomatic to require ACE inhibitor therapy for heart failure. About half of the patients had symptoms of heart failure in the past. Patients were given a test dose of 6.25 mg oral captopril tablets and were randomized within 3 days to 16 days post-infarction to receive either captopril or placebo in addition to conventional therapy. Captopril tablets were initiated at 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg three times a day and after two weeks titrated to a target maintenance dose of 50 mg three times a day. About 80% of patients were receiving the target dose at the end of the study. Patients were followed for a minimum of two years and for up to five years, with an average follow-up of 3.5 years.

Baseline blood pressure was 113/70 mmHg and 112/70 mmHg for the placebo and captopril groups, respectively. Blood pressure increased slightly in both treatment groups during the study and was somewhat lower in the captopril group (119/74 mmHg vs. 125/77 mmHg at 1 yr).

### Do β-blockers prolong survival in heart failure only by inhibiting the beta1-receptor? A perspective on the results of the COMET trial [^114G5J9E]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Experimental and clinical studies indicate that carvedilol exerts multiple antiadrenergic effects in addition to beta(1)-receptor blockade, but the prognostic importance of these actions has long been debated. This controversy has now been substantially advanced by the results of the recently completed Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET), which showed that carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) reduced mortality by 17% when compared with metoprolol (50 mg twice daily), P = 0.0017 — a result that was consistent with the differences seen across earlier controlled trials with beta-blockers in survivors of an acute myocardial infarction and in patients with chronic heart failure. Questions have been raised about the interpretation of these findings in view of the fact that the trial did not use the dose or formulation of metoprolol that was shown to prolong life in a placebo-controlled trial (ie, Metoprolol CR/XL [Controlled Release] Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure). Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses, however, indicate that the dosing regimen of metoprolol selected for use in the COMET trial produces a magnitude and time course of beta(1)-blockade during a 24-hour period that is similar to the dose of carvedilol targeted for use in the trial. These analyses suggest that the observed difference in the mortality effects of metoprolol and carvedilol is not related to a difference in the magnitude or time course of their beta(1)-blocking effects but instead reflect antiadrenergic effects of carvedilol in addition to beta(1)-blockade.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit and agent selection is summarized as follows: Three beta-blockers have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of death in patients with chronic heart failure (HF): bisoprolol, sustained-release metoprolol (succinate), and carvedilol; positive findings with these 3 agents should not be considered a class effect, and patients who have Stage C HF should be treated with 1 of these 3 beta-blockers. In one head-to-head trial, carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) versus immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose 50 mg twice daily) was associated with a significantly reduced mortality, and there have been no trials to explore whether the survival benefits of carvedilol are greater than those of sustained-release metoprolol when both are used at the target doses.

Why are patients receiving subtarget doses of critical treatments?

In clinical practice, physicians initiate treatment at a low 'starting dose', but most patients continue to receive the starting dose for long periods of time, often indefinitely, with no or minimal uptitration. When new treatments are initiated at low doses during a hospitalization for heart failure, these doses are typically maintained following discharge. 25 This pattern of practice is prevalent whether patients are treated by primary care physicians or by heart failure specialists.

A striking example is the prescribing of sacubitril/valsartan. The drug is commonly initiated at 24/26 mg twice daily, but is uptitrated only in a small fraction of patients. 26 In contrast, few patients received long‐term treatment with 24/26 mg twice daily in the large‐scale clinical trial that established the survival benefit of neprilysin inhibition (PARADIGM‐HF). 27, 28 All patients in that trial received target doses of the drug at randomization, and > 70% were maintained on this dose for the duration of the study 27; yet, in clinical practice, < 25% of patients are ever titrated to the target dose of 97/103 mg twice daily. Interestingly, 40% of the patients who required temporary dose reduction in PARADIGM‐HF were subsequently restored to target doses. In contrast, in clinical practice, the vast majority of dose reductions are permanent, leading to indefinite treatment with subtarget doses.

The approach to treating life‐threatening heart failure in clinical practice differs markedly from that used by oncologists to treat life‐threatening cancers. Cancer specialists initiate simultaneous therapy with multiple‐drug regimens at target doses and down‐titrate only if serious adverse reactions occur that cannot be mitigated with additional treatments. Efforts to prolong life are valued far more highly than efforts to minimize drug toxicity. In striking contrast, the treatment of heart failure is routinely initiated with low doses of a single drug; additional therapies are added at a later time; and avoidance of adverse effects represents the clinical priority. The difference in the two approaches is medically inexplicable, since heart failure is more lethal than most forms of cancer. 29 Furthermore, the median improvement in survival produced by most treatments for heart failure exceeds that for most therapies for metastatic cancer.

### Captorpil (Captopril) [^115akSc7]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 2,231 patients (age 21–79 years) who survived the acute phase of a myocardial infarction and did not have active ischemia. Patients had left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), defined as a resting left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, but at the time of randomization were not sufficiently symptomatic to require ACE inhibitor therapy for heart failure. About half of the patients had symptoms of heart failure in the past. Patients were given a test dose of 6.25 mg oral captopril tablets and were randomized within 3–16 days post infarction to receive either captopril tablets or placebo in addition to conventional therapy. Captopril tablets were initiated at 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg t.i.d. and after two weeks titrated to a target maintenance dose of 50 mg t.i.d. About 80% of patients were receiving the target dose at the end of the study. Patients were followed for a minimum of two years and for up to five years, with an average follow-up of 3.5 years.

Baseline blood pressure was 113/70 mmHg and 112/70 mmHg for the placebo and captopril tablets groups, respectively. Blood pressure increased slightly in both treatment groups during the study and was somewhat lower in the captopril tablets group (119/74 Vs. 125/77 mmHg at 1 yr).

Second, physicians may recognize the inadequacy of low starting doses but may nonetheless believe that medium‐range doses provide most of the benefits of target doses. Theoretically, this premise would be true if medium‐range and high target doses were on the upper flat portion of the dose–response curve. Yet, in a clinical trials, higher doses have provided greater benefits than lower doses, 19, 20, 35, 36 and there is little evidence that medium‐range subtarget doses reduce the risk of death. Interestingly, the final step in the dose‐titration process to target doses may provide unexpectedly large survival benefits. In the COMET trial, 37 carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) was compared with metoprolol tartrate (50 mg twice daily) in a large double‐blind trial of > 3000 patients who were followed for nearly 5 years. At these doses, the heart rate reduction in the metoprolol group was within 1–2 bpm of that achieved in the carvedilol group, suggesting that metoprolol tartrate provided > 75% of the beta‐1 receptor blockade produced by carvedilol. 38 Yet, when compared with metoprolol, carvedilol was accompanied by a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular death. Since beta‐blockers reduce mortality by ≈30–35% when compared with placebo, 39 these observations suggest that more than half of the mortality reduction produced by target doses of beta‐blockers may be provided by the final step in the dose titration protocol. 40

In ANDROMEDA, dronedarone in hospitalized HFrEF patients "had increased mortality", and in SWORD, sotalol in HF post-MI patients "had increased mortality", whereas "Amiodarone and dofetilide are the only antiarrhythmic agents with neutral effects on mortality in clinical trials of patients with HFrEF". Thiazolidinediones are linked to fluid retention and HF events, as "thiazolidinediones have been associated with increased incidence of fluid retention and HF events", and mechanistically "PPAR-γ also regulates sodium reabsorption in the collecting ducts of the kidney". Regarding dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, "Saxagliptin increased the risk of hospitalization for HF, as did alogliptin… but sitagliptin and linagliptin did not", and "The FDA recommends discontinuation specifically of saxagliptin and alogliptin in patients who develop HF", while "whether the risk of worsening HF is a class effect of DPP-4 inhibitors is unclear". Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) "can cause sodium and water retention and blunt the effects of diuretics", and "observational cohort studies have revealed increased morbidity and mortality in patients with HF using either nonselective or selective NSAIDs".

### Continuation vs withdrawal of beta-blockers and outcomes after myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular function [^113WN5fs]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Guideline-recommended therapy for patients who have suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) includes antiplatelet therapy, statins, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and beta-blockers (BBs). BBs are a cornerstone of treatment for ischemic heart disease in the acute phase because they inhibit the physiological sympathetic activation, reduce myocardial workload, reduce infarct size, and have antiarrhythmic and antiremodeling effects. BB also have a well-defined role in long-term therapy of patients with persistent reduction in left ventricular (LV) systolic function. However, the role of longer-term BB treatment when AMI course is not complicated by heart failure, LV systolic dysfunction, recurrent ischemia, or arrhythmia is not well established. Most guidelines recommend BB use in the absence of contraindications with grade 1B evidence in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and grade 2A in non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The recommendation for BB use after AMI predominately comes from studies that predate routine implementation of a contemporary strategy of early reperfusion and medical therapy. Recent guidelines report uncertainty in the strength of the evidence for long-term use of BB post revascularization with preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF).

Observational studies that have evaluated the duration of BB use and outcomes after AMI have several limitations, including incomplete ascertainment or heterogeneous definitions of post-myocardial infarction (MI) LV dysfunction, inclusion of patients with independent indications or contraindications to BB, lack of longitudinal prescription data, and relatively short durations of follow-up. Two recently published open-label randomized clinical trials have added to this literature but have not completely resolved the dilemma. The REDUCE AMI (Randomized Evaluation of Decreased Usage of Beta-Blockers after Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial found that initiating BBs in MI survivors with preserved LVEF at the time of discharge did not reduce the incidence of death from any cause or recurrent AMI, whereas the ABYSS (Assessment of Beta-Blocker Interruption 1 Year after an Uncomplicated Myocardial Infarction on Safety and Symptomatic Cardiac Events Requiring Hospitalization) trial failed to find that interrupting BBs a mean of 2.9 years after MI was noninferior to continuing them, for a composite primary endpoint of death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. We sought to assess the association between discontinuation of newly prescribed BB within 180 days after AMI and long-term cardiovascular outcomes among a well-characterized, population-based cohort of AMI survivors without definite indications for long-term BB therapy.

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what is the 'right' dose? [^117KSyAz]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Unlike renin–angiotensin system blockers and MRAs, the early benefit of beta‐blockers is less clear. After initiation, beta‐blockers may cause worsening of heart failure. Indeed, careful scrutiny of the Kaplan–Meier curves in the placebo‐controlled trials and comparison of the first 6 months of treatment with either enalapril or bisoprolol in CIBIS III demonstrates an early excess of heart failure hospitalizations following initiation of a beta‐blocker, although there is no indication of an increase in risk of death. Indeed, it is clear that the risk of death is reduced relatively early after starting treatment with a beta‐blocker, for example in combined analysis of the trials in the US carvedilol programme.

Understanding the importance of dose with sacubitril/valsartan is more difficult because of the design of the PARADIGM‐HF trial, as mentioned above. In this trial, outcomes were compared in patients having either their dose of either sacubitril/valsartan (42% of randomized participants) or enalapril (43%) reduced compared to those who remained on the starting (target) doses or each treatment. The treatment benefit of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril following a dose reduction was similar (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70–0.93, p < 0.001) to that seen in patients who did not have any dose reduction (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71–0.88, p < 0.001) and consistent whether the reduction was to 50%–100% of target or to < 50% of target dose.

Table 3

A further underappreciated consideration is the influence of concomitant therapy on the dosing of an added treatment. This can be best seen in two trials (CIBIS III and CARMEN) comparing initiation of treatment with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril) or a beta‐blocker (bisoprolol or carvedilol) first and adding the alternative second. When enalapril was used first, the dose achieved was larger than when it was used second, i.e. added to a beta‐blocker rather than used before a beta‐blocker (Table 1). Of course, in the trial on which our target dose of enalapril is based on (the treatment arm of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction, SOLVD‐T) the use of a beta‐blocker was minimal.

This 'target dose' approach used in the original placebo‐controlled landmark trials using renin–angiotensin system blockers also influenced the design of subsequent trials comparing and adding alternative agents such as the neprilysin inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination sacubitril/valsartan and the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren. In these trials, all participants were required to demonstrate toleration of the target dose of enalapril (control therapy) before randomization to either the experimental therapy or control therapy. This was because the achievement of at least the mean dose of enalapril shown to be effective in SOLVD‐T was considered a prerequisite for demonstration of non‐inferiority or superiority of the experimental therapy over the established control treatment (enalapril). This design requirement renders understanding the dosing of sacubitril/valsartan particularly difficult as all patients were taking the target dose at the time of randomization (to either continue sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg twice daily or to enalapril 10 mg twice daily) – see below.

Data Collection

Data were collected by medical chart review. Use of selected guideline-recommended therapies was assessed at baseline at all participating practices. After baseline data collection, a practice-specific performance improvement intervention was implemented, and use of recommended therapies was reassessed at 12 and 24 months at all practices. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were also collected, as were medical history, previous treatments, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional status, QRS duration, laboratory and diagnostic tests and results, treatments, and provision of HF education. Contraindications and other reasons for not administering the recommended therapies (eg, patient noncompliance, patient refusal, and medical, economic, social, and religious reasons) were collected from the chart when documented. Collected practice characteristics included geographic region, outpatient practice setting (ie, university or teaching versus nonuniversity or nonteaching), practice type (single versus multispecialty), presence of a HF clinic in the practice, staffing (ie, number of physicians, HF nurses, electrophysiologists, and interventionalists in the practice), number of patients managed annually, type of medical record system (electronic, paper, or mixed), and use of IMPROVE HF performance improvement tools.

For each practice, medical records from patients with a clinical diagnosis of HF or prior myocardial infarction and LVEF ≤ 35% were screened, and a representative sample of 90 patients per practice (on average) was randomly selected for each follow-up assessment. The study was designed with several measures to ensure data quality and accuracy. These measures included the use of 34 trained, centralized chart reviewers, who received ongoing training and testing by members of the IMPROVE HF Steering Committee to ensure the accuracy of data abstraction. Average interrater reliability (κ statistic) was 0.82. Data quality reports were generated monthly, and an average of 1.7 automated data quality checks were performed on each data field to ensure the values met prespecified ranges, formats, and units. An audit of all patient data as compared with source documentation was conducted for 20% of the entire patient sample, using records from a 10% random sample of practices. The mean data concordance rate was 94.5% (range, 92.3% to 96.3%). Practices were required to obtain institutional review board approval or waivers to participate in IMPROVE HF. The registry coordinating center was Outcome Sciences, Inc (Cambridge, MA).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in HFrEF — use, dosing, and safety. The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for patients with prior or current symptoms of chronic HFrEF to reduce morbidity and mortality. ACE inhibitors should be started at low doses and titrated upward to doses shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials, and should be given with caution to patients with low systemic blood pressures, renal insufficiency, or elevated serum potassium (> 5.0 mEq/L). Angioedema occurs in < 1% of patients who take an ACE inhibitor; patients should not be given ACE inhibitors if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. ACE inhibitors also inhibit kininase and increase levels of bradykinin, which can induce cough in up to 20% of patients.

### Meta-analysis: angiotensin-receptor blockers in chronic heart failure and high-risk acute myocardial infarction [^112EeCCz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The role of angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in treating patients with chronic heart failure and high-risk acute myocardial infarction (MI) has been controversial, and recent clinical trials provide more information on this topic.

Purpose

To quantify the effect of ARBs when compared with placebo (with and without background angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) and ACE inhibitors on all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with chronic heart failure and high-risk acute MI.

Data Sources

Data from original research published through 13 November 2003.

Study Selection

Predefined criteria were used to identify 24 trials.

Data Extraction

2 reviewers independently collected information on study characteristics and data on all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization.

Data Synthesis

24 trials involving 38 080 patients were included. Analysis of chronic heart failure trials revealed that 1) ARBs were associated with reduced all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.00]) and heart failure hospitalizations (OR, 0.64 [CI, 0.53 to 0.78]) as compared with placebo; 2) for ARBs versus ACE inhibitors, all-cause mortality (OR, 1.06 [CI, 0.90 to 1.26]) and heart failure hospitalization (OR, 0.95 [CI, 0.80 to 1.13]) did not differ; 3) and for combinations of ARBs plus ACE inhibitors versus ACE inhibitors alone, all-cause mortality was not reduced (OR, 0.97 [CI, 0.87 to 1.08]) but heart failure hospitalizations were reduced (OR, 0.77 [CI, 0.69 to 0.87]). For patients with high-risk acute MI, 2 randomized trials compared ARBs with ACE inhibitors but did not reveal differences in all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization.

Limitations

Comparative economic data between ARBs and ACE inhibitors are lacking.

Conclusions

Because ACE inhibitors and ARBs do not differ in efficacy for reducing all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with chronic heart failure and in patients with high-risk acute MI, ARBs should be regarded as suitable alternatives to ACE inhibitors.

Clinical Evidence of Angiotensin Receptor–Neprilysin Inhibitors

Over the last 10 to 15 years, several trials sought to characterize the benefits of ARN inhibitors. Sacubitril-valsartan is the specific formulation of ARN inhibitors that is available and widely used in practice. There have been several seminal trials examining the benefit of ARN inhibitors in patients with HFrEF, HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and patients post–myocardial infarction (MI) with high-risk features for developing HF(Table 2).

Studies in patients with HFrEF

PARADIGM-HF(Prospective Comparison of ARN Inhibitors With ACE Inhibitors to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in HF Trial) was a paradigm-changing trial. The trial was stopped early because of the significant reduction in cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization by 20% with sacubitril and valsartan compared with enalapril alone (Table 2). Sacubitril-valsartan was also associated with a significant reduction in HF hospitalization rates and with improvement in both symptoms and physical limitations of HF. Results of the PARADIGM trial led to the incorporation of ARN inhibitors as a recommendation for treatment of patients with HFrEF in guidelines.

Meaning When patients with AHF can tolerate higher doses of GDMT, results suggest that all efforts should be made to rapidly uptitrate to optimal doses of the 3 and 4 pillars of HF medications, including renin-angiotensin receptor system inhibitors, β-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors. Interventions The mean percentage of the doses of 3 classes of HF medications relative to their optimal doses was computed. Patients were classified into 3 dose categories: low, medium, and high. Dose and dose group were included as a time-dependent covariate in Cox regression models, which were used to test whether outcomes differed by dose. A total of 515 patients assigned high-intensity care were included in this analysis. At 2 weeks, 39 patients achieved low doses, 254 patients achieved medium doses, and 222 patients achieved high doses. To provide a measure of the degree of full GDMT implementation, the mean percentage of the doses of the 3 classes of HF medications relative to their optimal doses was computed. For instance, a patient with HF in the HIC arm receiving 30% of the optimal dose of RASi, 40% of the optimal dose of BB, and 50% of the optimal dose of MRA at week 2 after discharge would have an average percentage optimal dose of HF medications of / 3 = 40%. Per protocol, doses of the medications in the 3 classes were ideally to be uptitrated together. The doses of the medications prescribed at week 2 were thus moderately correlated. The Pearson correlation between BB and RASi doses was 0. 43, between MRA and RASi doses was
0. 32, and between BB and MRA doses was 0. 23.

### Aldosterone blockade in post-acute myocardial infarction heart failure [^1132yAbx]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Development of heart failure (HF) or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) significantly increases mortality post acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Aldosterone contributes to the development and progression of HF post AMI, and major guidelines now recommend aldosterone blockade in this setting. However, lack of practical experience with aldosterone blockade may make clinicians hesitant to use these therapies. This review is based on a consensus cardiology conference that occurred in May 2005 (New York City) concerning these topics. Potential barriers to the use of aldosterone blockade are discussed and an algorithm for appropriate in-hospital pharmacologic management of AMI with LVSD and/or HF is presented.

### Pharmacologic therapies across the continuum of left ventricular dysfunction [^113xoxtr]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Neurohormonal activation and increased sympathetic stimulation are among the factors that have been linked to the development and progression of left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and heart failure (HF) in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Various available pharmacologic therapies can target these factors and improve many aspects of the disease, depending on the degree of LVD. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists because of their proven favorable effects on symptoms, left ventricular function, cardiac remodeling, hospitalization rates, and survival. However, they are not being used in over two thirds of patients with post-MI LVD. This review illustrates the impact of these therapies on post-MI LVD patients using evidence from multiple clinical trials. In addition, current and emerging treatments for acute decompensated HF will be outlined.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers versus ACE inhibitors: prevention of death and myocardial infarction in high-risk populations [^116EVBrS]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine, through a review of the medical literature, whether there is adequate evidence to support the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in place of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in high-risk populations, focusing on the prevention of death and myocardial infarction (MI).

Data Sources

Original investigations, reviews, and meta-analyses were identified from the biomedical literature via a MEDLINE search (1966-August 2004). Published articles were also cross-referenced for pertinent citations, and recent meeting abstracts were searched for relevant data.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles identified during the search were evaluated. Preference was given to prospective, randomized, controlled trials that evaluated major cardiovascular endpoints and compared ARBs with ACE inhibitors, active controls, or placebo.

Data Synthesis

The renin-angiotensin system plays a pivotal role in the continuum of cardiovascular disease and represents a major therapeutic target in the treatment of patients at risk for vascular events. While ACE inhibitors have been definitively shown to prevent death and MI, studies with ARBs in similar populations have not reduced these endpoints. In clinical trials that enrolled patients with heart failure, post-MI, diabetes, and hypertension, ARBs did not prevent MI or prolong survival compared with ACE inhibitors, other antihypertensives, or placebo.

Conclusions

ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be considered interchangeable, even among patients with a documented history of ACE inhibitor intolerance. ARBs can be considered a second-line alternative in such patients with the realization that they have not been shown to prevent MI or prolong survival.

Table A — Target doses of guideline-directed medical therapies in heart failure lists angiotensin–converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with target dosing and 50% thresholds: captopril 50 mg, three times daily (total daily target dose 150 mg; 50% 75 mg); enalapril 10 mg, twice daily (20 mg; 10 mg); lisinopril 20 mg, once daily (20 mg; 10 mg); ramipril 10 mg, once daily (10 mg; 5 mg); and perindopril 8 mg, once daily (8 mg; 4 mg). For angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), examples include candesartan 32 mg, once daily (32 mg; 16 mg); losartan 100 mg, once daily (100 mg; 50 mg) with the note that "ACCF/AHA Guidelines recommend losartan 150 mg as target dose. However, because current FDA-approved labeling has 100 mg as the maximal dose, the 100-mg dose is used in the performance measure".; and valsartan 160 mg, twice daily (320 mg; 160 mg). For angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg, twice daily (194/206 mg; 98/102 mg†) is listed, with the footnote that "The sacubitril 98 mg and valsartan 102 mg total daily dosing (49/51 mg twice daily) is considered fulfilling the 50% of target dosing criteria". Evidence-based beta-blockers include bisoprolol 10 mg, once daily (10 mg; 5 mg), carvedilol 25 mg, twice daily (50 mg; 25 mg), carvedilol extended release 80 mg, once daily (80 mg; 40 mg), and metoprolol succinate sustained release 200 mg, once daily (200 mg; 100 mg).

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113roJAv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Beta blockers for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF, with current or previous symptoms, use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, and beta-blocker therapy provides high economic value. Treatment with beta blockers reduces the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization in patients with HFrEF. Beta blockers should be initiated at low doses with efforts to achieve target doses as tolerated, and they can be safely started before hospital discharge when patients are clinically stabilized and do not require intravenous inotropic therapy for HF. Even if symptoms or LVEF improve, long-term treatment with target doses should be maintained to reduce risk of progression, and abrupt withdrawal should be avoided unless indicated.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^115mvdng]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

What are the early effects of starting doses of foundational therapy?

In most large‐scale clinical trials of drugs for heart failure, double‐blind treatment was typically initiated at low doses, and if tolerated, the dose of double‐blind therapy was increased at specified intervals until a target dose was achieved. This design feature has allowed investigators to estimate the magnitude of the early treatment effects of low doses and to compare these estimates to the effect seen with target doses administered during the total duration of double‐blind treatment (Table 2).

Table 2
Early effects of foundational treatments on major outcomes in large‐scale trials

The findings of the analyses of the early effects of low doses are highly instructive. In the SOLVD Treatment trial, low starting doses of enalapril yielded favourable effects on the combined risk of death and hospitalization for heart failure during the first 2–4 weeks of treatment which were comparable to those seen with target doses of enalapril during the duration of the trial. In the COPERNICUS trial, low starting and sub‐target doses of carvedilol produced favourable effects to reduce the risk of death or hospitalization for any reason, and these benefits became apparent at 30 days of randomization. In the EPHESUS trial with eplerenone, low starting doses of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists reduced the risk of death within the first 4 weeks of treatment. In all three trials, the magnitude of the benefit seen very early following initiation of therapy was comparable to or greater than that seen in the trial overall, even though the dose of the study medication had not yet been increased to the target dose specified in the protocol.

### Comparative effectiveness of individual sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors [^113EgfQR]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Evidence on cardiovascular benefits and safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors is mainly from placebo-controlled trials. Therefore, the comparative effectiveness and safety of individual SGLT-2 inhibitors remain unknown.

Objective

To compare the use of canagliflozin or dapagliflozin with empagliflozin for a composite outcome (myocardial infarction [MI] or stroke), heart failure hospitalization, MI, stroke, all-cause death, and safety outcomes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), lower-limb amputation, bone fracture, severe urinary tract infection (UTI), and genital infection and whether effects differed by dosage or cardiovascular disease (CVD) history.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This comparative effectiveness study using target trial emulation included adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using 3 US claims databases using data from August 2014 through June 2020. The study was conducted from August 2023 to July 2024, with a follow-up period of up to 8 years, and the analysis was completed in July 2024.

Exposures

First dispensing of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin without any use of SGLT-2 inhibitors during the prior 365 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Database-specific models were weighted using propensity score matching-weights to adjust for 129 confounders. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs for outcomes were estimated using weighted Cox proportional hazards models. HRs were pooled across databases using a fixed-effect meta-analysis.

Results

Across the databases, 232 890 patients receiving canagliflozin, 129 881 patients receiving dapagliflozin, and 295 043 patients receiving empagliflozin were identified. Compared with empagliflozin initiators, those receiving canagliflozin or dapagliflozin were less likely to have diabetes-related conditions or a history of CVD at baseline. For MI/stroke risk, both canagliflozin (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91–1.05) and dapagliflozin (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.89–1.03) were comparable to empagliflozin. For heart failure hospitalization, dapagliflozin initiators had a higher risk (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02–1.39), particularly at the low dose of 5 mg (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.12–1.50). These findings were consistent across subgroups of CVD history. For safety events, compared with empagliflozin, canagliflozin initiators had a lower risk of genital infections (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91–0.97) but a higher risk of severe UTIs (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03–1.24), and dapagliflozin initiators had lower risks of genital infections (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89–0.95) and DKA (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68–0.90).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that individual SGLT-2 inhibitors demonstrated comparable cardiovascular effectiveness at clinically effective doses, though low-dose dapagliflozin showed a reduced benefit for heart failure hospitalization compared with empagliflozin.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) use in HFrEF: ACEi reduce morbidity and mortality in HFrEF, and RCTs clearly establish the benefits of ACE inhibition in patients with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms of HF and in patients with or without CAD. Data suggest that there are no differences among available ACEi in their effects on symptoms or survival. ACEi should be started at low doses and titrated upward to doses shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials. ACEi can produce angioedema and should be given with caution to patients with low systemic blood pressures, renal insufficiency, or elevated serum potassium (> 5.0 mEq/L). If maximal doses are not tolerated, intermediate doses should be tried; abrupt withdrawal of ACE inhibition can lead to clinical deterioration and should be avoided. Although the use of an ARNi in lieu of an ACEi for HFrEF has been found to be superior, for those patients for whom ARNi is inappropriate, continued use of an ACEi for all classes of HFrEF remains strongly advised.

The VALsartan In Acute myocardial iNfarcTion trial (VALIANT) was a randomized, controlled, multinational, double-blind study in 14,703 patients with acute myocardial infarction and either heart failure (signs, symptoms or radiological evidence) or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤ 40% by radionuclide ventriculography or ≤ 35% by echocardiography or ventricular contrast angiography). Patients were randomized within 12 hours to 10 days after the onset of myocardial infarction symptoms to one of three treatment groups: valsartan (titrated from 20 or 40 mg twice daily to the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 160 mg twice daily), the ACE inhibitor, captopril (titrated from 6.25 mg three times daily to the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 50 mg three times daily), or the combination of valsartan plus captopril. In the combination group, the dose of valsartan was titrated from 20 mg twice daily to the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 80 mg twice daily; the dose of captopril was the same as for monotherapy. The population studied was 69% male, 94% Caucasian, and 53% were 65 years of age or older. Baseline therapy included aspirin (91%), beta-blockers (70%), ACE inhibitors (40%), thrombolytics (35%) and statins (34%). The mean treatment duration was 2 years. The mean daily dose of valsartan in the monotherapy group was 217 mg.

The VALsartan In Acute myocardial iNfarcTion trial (VALIANT) was a randomized, controlled, multinational, double-blind study in 14,703 patients with acute myocardial infarction and either heart failure (signs, symptoms or radiological evidence) or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤ 40% by radionuclide ventriculography or ≤ 35% by echocardiography or ventricular contrast angiography). The VALIANT study was conducted with a formulation of valsartan that is not therapeutically equivalent to PREXXARTAN [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients were randomized within 12 hours to 10 days after the onset of myocardial infarction symptoms to one of three treatment groups: valsartan (titrated from 20 or 40 mg twice daily to the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 160 mg twice daily), the ACE inhibitor, captopril (titrated from 6.25 mg three times daily to the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 50 mg three times daily), or the combination of valsartan plus captopril.

### One-year landmark analysis of the effect of beta-blocker dose on survival after acute myocardial infarction [^114pcg5R]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Although the present findings are intriguing, they should be considered exploratory in nature. Beta‐blocker dosing was at the physician's discretion. Although there are no data on the reasons for down‐titration, maintenance of the same dose, or up‐titration Figure 1, clearly shows the inertial effects of discharge dosing across the spectrum of doses. In real‐world cardiac practice, target doses from clinical trials are often not achieved.

A variety of mechanisms have been suggested to underlie the improved survival associated with beta‐blocker therapy after MI. These include anti‐ischemic effects, prevention of reinfarction, and reduction in arrhythmic sudden death. In the modern era of reperfusion therapies and aspirin and statin use, the role of beta‐blockers for the first two mechanisms may have substantially diminished. Its role in the prevention of arrhythmic sudden death, however, may still be vital. VALIANT (Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial)reported the monthly rate of sudden death after MI. This peaked in the first month after MI and rapidly declined over 6 months. By 12 months, this appeared to plateau. Although the mechanism of sudden death in the early post‐MI period is likely multifactorial, an autopsy study suggested that half of the sudden deaths occurring beyond 1 year after acute MI are presumed arrhythmic. Olsson et al.demonstrated that metoprolol reduced sudden death substantially following acute MI, with an increasing effect over 3 years. There are no data evaluating the dose response for the protective effect of beta‐blockers against sudden death. In light of the potential detrimental effects of higher doses of beta‐blockers, other approaches for primary prevention may need to be considered. It is interesting to note that primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillators following acute MI have not provided any survival benefit over a period of several years.

There are potential detrimental effects of higher doses of beta‐blockers. In a compilation of data from randomized clinical trials of beta‐blockers in heart failure, significant adverse effects included hypotension and bradycardia. These are both dose dependent. Unappreciated downstream effects can be considered, such as diminished physical activity. It is well known that outcomes post‐MI are improved with increased physical activity. Clearly, further research is needed in this area to better identify the individual balance of beneficial and adverse effects that occur across the clinically used dose spectrum.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116CCaJm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with heart failure (HF) or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% — either an oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be initiated in appropriate patients with AMI, and in patients with AMI with LVEF ≤ 40% and HF symptoms and/or diabetes mellitus, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist reduced all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and should be given in the absence of advanced chronic kidney disease, hyperkalemia, or other contraindication. In patients early after MI with LVEF ≤ 40% and/or pulmonary congestion, sacubitril-valsartan did not significantly reduce cardiovascular death or incident HF compared with an ACEi, hypotensive events were more common, and initiation of this combination agent early after MI appears safe if treatment for HF with reduced ejection fraction is planned. Concomitant initiation of both an ACEi and ARB in patients with AMI should be avoided due to an increase in adverse events without added benefit compared with either drug alone. In EPHESUS, the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone reduced both all-cause death and MACE during a mean follow-up of 16 months in patients with AMI with LVEF < 40% who also had symptoms of HF and/or diabetes mellitus; evidence-based therapy use at enrollment was 86% for ACEi or ARB and 75% for a beta blocker, and patients with serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL or serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L were excluded. Supporting evidence includes an individual-patient meta-analysis of 98 496 patients with AMI reporting a 30-day mortality rate of 7.1% with ACEi compared with 7.6% with placebo (proportion reduction, 7% [95% CI, 2–11]; P = 0.004), and a trial of 1012 patients with acute STEMI without a history of HF in which eplerenone reduced the primary end point but the benefit was largely driven by a reduction in natriuretic peptides.

### One-year landmark analysis of the effect of beta-blocker dose on survival after acute myocardial infarction [^115SbVUq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This landmark analysis of the OBTAIN study was designed to evaluate whether there is benefit to beta‐blocker therapy beyond 1 year after MI. When analyzed dichotomously, beta‐blocker therapy beyond 1 year after an MI was not associated with improved survival. However, on the basis of the primary OBTAIN studyresults, we hypothesized there would be a dose‐dependent effect of beta‐blocker dosing in 1‐year survivors after an acute MI. Both multivariate and propensity score analyses of survival by dose suggested that patients treated with > 12.5% to 25% of the target dose have enhanced survival compared with no beta‐blocker therapy and other beta‐blocker doses. The present study provides important data on the role of beta‐blocker dose and therapy in 1‐year survivors after MI.

CAPRICORN (Carvedilol Post‐Infarct Survival Control in LV Dysfunction)is the only reperfusion‐era randomized clinical trial to demonstrate a survival benefit of beta‐blocker therapy; in this trial of carvedilol versus placebo in patients after MI with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, the survival curves continued to diverge for 2.5 years, suggesting long‐term benefit for this low ejection fraction group. Our findings in the subgroup of patients with a history of congestive heart failure support the continued benefit of beta‐blocker therapy in patients after MI with left ventricular dysfunction and/or heart failure. Two recent landmark analyses at 1 year after MI have been reported. In these observational studies of 1383and 1946patients, there was no benefit to beta‐blocker therapy when analyzed as a dichotomous variable. In a report from the French national health insurance database including 73 450 patients after MI who had been treated with beta‐blockers for at least 1 year, there was no significant increase in mortality associated with beta‐blocker discontinuation (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.94–1.36). The dichotomous analysis in this OBTAIN report is consistent with these findings. However, beta‐blocker dose may be an important modulator of beta‐blocker benefit. It is notable that the same dose (25% of the target dose used in randomized clinical trials) was found to be the optimal dose in this report as in the original OBTAIN report. Furthermore, in this subsample of the OBTAIN study, ≈40% of patients had a change in dose from the discharge dose used in the analysis of the original OBTAIN cohort. The only inconsistent finding in the current analysis is the lack of benefit of the > 12.5% to 25% dose relative to the > 50% dose. This may relate to this latter group being the smallest of the beta‐blocker treatment groups. In a report from the CRUSADE (Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes With Early Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines) registry, a landmark analysis was performed at 3 years after MI in patients aged ≥ 65 years old (mean age, 75 years), stratified by no beta‐blocker, < 50% of target dose, and ≥ 50% of target dose. No difference in outcomes was noted. However, there was no delineation between the 12.5% and 25% dose. Furthermore, the authors note that the findings were consistent in patients with and without heart failure or systolic dysfunction, questioning the generalizability of these findings. Therefore, the present report provides further support that the medical discussion around the use of beta‐blockers after MI, even long‐term use, must center on dose and not simply use. This is a major paradigm change, because the vast majority of studies in this field do not address dose. It is important to note that there has not been a single randomized clinical trial of beta‐blockers after acute MI that tested multiple doses.

### Siponimod (Mayzent) [^11513cuc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 First Dose Monitoring in Patients With Certain Preexisting Cardiac Conditions

Because initiation of MAYZENT treatment results in a decrease in heart rate (HR), first-dose 6-hour monitoring is recommended for patients with sinus bradycardia [HR less than 55 beats per minute (bpm)], first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

First Dose 6-Hour Monitoring

Administer the first dose of MAYZENT in a setting where resources to appropriately manage symptomatic bradycardia are available. Monitor patients for 6 hours after the first dose for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly pulse and blood pressure measurement. Obtain an ECG in these patients at the end of the Day 1 observation period.

Additional Monitoring After 6-Hour Monitoring

If any of the following abnormalities are present after 6 hours (even in the absence of symptoms), continue monitoring until the abnormality resolves:

The heart rate 6 hours postdose is less than 45 bpm
The heart rate 6 hours postdose is at the lowest value postdose, suggesting that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect on the heart may not have occurred
The ECG 6 hours postdose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block

If post-dose symptomatic bradycardia, bradyarrhythmia, or conduction-related symptoms occur, or if ECG 6 hours post-dose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block or QTc greater than or equal to 500 msec, initiate appropriate management, begin continuous ECG monitoring, and continue monitoring until the symptoms have resolved if no pharmacological treatment is required. If pharmacological treatment is required, continue monitoring overnight and repeat 6-hour monitoring after the second dose.

Advice from a cardiologist should be sought to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy (which may include overnight monitoring) during treatment initiation, if treatment with MAYZENT is considered in patients:

With some preexisting heart and cerebrovascular conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
With a prolonged QTc interval before dosing or during the 6-hour observation, or at additional risk for QT prolongation, or on concurrent therapy with QT prolonging drugs with a known risk of torsades de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]
Receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that slow heart rate or AV conduction [see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)]

### Effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on remodeling in clinical trials [^112uVe6K]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2002). Low credibility.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a cornerstone of therapy for heart failure. Large-scale clinical trials show that ACE inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients and myocardial infarction (MI) survivors with left ventricular dysfunction. Cardiac remodeling is the term used to describe a series of prototypic changes in cardiac structure that occur in response to injury or prolonged increase in cardiac load. These changes include an increase in chamber volumes and muscle mass and changes in the configuration of the left ventricle. Remodeling results in a deterioration in cardiac function and plays a major role in the progression of heart failure. Although the ACE inhibitors have numerous effects that might be beneficial in heart failure patients, there is substantial evidence that their ability to inhibit cardiac remodeling is directly associated with a favorable impact on the clinical course. This article reviews evidence directly relating the administration of ACE inhibitors with an inhibition of structural remodeling of the heart in heart failure and post-MI patients.

### Update in imaging of cancer therapy-related cardiac toxicity in adults [^116FSPNg]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice

Currently, cardiac follow-up of patients with increased risk for CTRCD is based on expert consensus. Teske et al provided an overview about the available evidence and clinical practice in our institution which will be referred to in the following section. Typically, the surveillance of adult patients with cancer who will receive cardiotoxic agents starts before initiation of cancer therapy and ends up to 1 year after last chemotherapy dose. The frequency of follow-up is based on the individual risk profile for CTRCD, which incorporates parameters such as type and dosage of chemotherapy, age at time of chemotherapy and presence of cardiovascular risk factors.

The results of the recently published studies show that CTRCD can affect multiple parts of the myocardium and therefore reinforce the recommendation of a comprehensive and systematic echocardiographic assessment of at least LV systolic and diastolic function, LV strain and RV function. It is important to use the same imaging modality over time to enhance adequate interpretation of serial measurements and identification of individual CTRCD. Since the accuracy in LV measurements by 3D echocardiography has expanded in clinical care, this modality is recommended for serial LVEF measurements in patients with cancer. Regarding myocardial strain, a clear superiority of 3D STE over 2D STE has not been reported yet, although results of 3D-derived strain are promising.

The use of cardiac MRI is recommended as a complementary tool when echocardiography is inconclusive and when evaluation of other underlying causes of LV dysfunction is indicated. Despite the superior qualities of cardiac MRI, this modality is (in the Netherlands) approximately three times more expensive and less available than echocardiography. In our own institution, CMR is routinely used in case of clinical CTRCD on transthoracic echocardiography and considered in case of subclinical CTRCD. Furthermore, cardiac MRI provides additional diagnostic and prognostic information in patients with known cardiac disease, that is, previous myocardial infarction.

Heart failure medication is only initiated in adult patients with evidence of CTRCD, defined as LVEF > 10% decline to LVEF < 53% or GLS decline of 15% and NYHA ≥ II/IV or LVEF < 45% on echocardiography.

### Angiotensin inhibition after myocardial infarction: does drug class matter? [^1119x2zC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin-II-receptor blockers (ARB) are equally efficacious in reducing mortality after MI, although the latter are far more costly. Little is known about their relative use after MI in typical care settings, and about their relative effectiveness outside the clinical trial setting.

Objectives

To assess temporal trends in the relative use of ACEI and ARB after myocardial infarction, and to test for differences in 1-year survival between users of these drug classes.

Design

Retrospective closed cohort study.

Patients

Medicare beneficiaries who survived > 90 days after myocardial infarction, had full prescription drug coverage, and who filled a prescription for either ACEI or ARB within 90 days of myocardial infarction.

Measurements

Relative use of ACEI versus ARB over time. Adjusted relative 1-year mortality between ACEI and ARB users.

Results

Between 1995 and 2004, 14,190 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 80 years, 75% were female, and 90% were white. Overall, 88% received an ACEI, and 12% an ARB, with the proportion receiving an ARB increasing from 2% (1995) to 25% (2004; P < .001). Multivariate-adjusted 1-year mortality did not differ between ARB and ACEI users (HR: 1.04; 95% confidence interval: 0.88 to 1.22). The findings were similar for new users of ACEI/ARB, and for those with preexisting heart failure.

Conclusions

ARB users had the same 1-year mortality after myocardial infarction as ACEI users in routine care. Use of more costly ARB has increased dramatically over time, to a quarter of ACEI/ARB users, despite the lack of a therapeutic advantage for most patients.
