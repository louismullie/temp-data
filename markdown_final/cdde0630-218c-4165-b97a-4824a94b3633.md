## Question

Inhaled budesonide for pulmonary edema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether inhaled budesonide is appropriate or effective for pulmonary edema. However, here is an assessment with references that addresses whether inhaled budesonide is appropriate or effective for pulmonary edema, drawing on FDA labeling and major society guidelines.

> Clinical indication and labeling: Budesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid approved for maintenance treatment of asthma and, in fixed combinations, COPD; there is no FDA-approved indication for any form of pulmonary edema, and labeling further cautions against use for acute episodes of airway disease that require intensive measures [^116xo9Uk] [^114b4gds] [^112GgG6D] [^114wqEgL].

> Cardiogenic pulmonary edema care pathways: Evidence-based management centers on oxygenation support and noninvasive ventilation (CPAP or bilevel NIV), with rapid hemodynamic optimization; inhaled corticosteroids are not included in cardiogenic pulmonary edema algorithms from ERS/ATS guidelines [^112Sgy3C].

> Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and ARDS: Contemporary ATS guidelines provide a conditional recommendation for systemic corticosteroids in ARDS because of heterogeneity in agents, doses, and timing, but they do not recommend or even mention inhaled routes or budesonide for ARDS or pulmonary edema; inhaled vasodilators may be used as rescue therapy for refractory hypoxemia, but this is distinct mechanistically and does not support ICS for edema [^113crMig] [^112CEtUu] [^117Fosao].

> Negative-pressure pulmonary edema: Standard management is airway stabilization, supplemental oxygen, and PEEP/NIV as needed; diuretics lack proven benefit and may be harmful in some cases, and there is no role described for inhaled corticosteroids in NPPE care pathways [^117AJhfg].

> Mechanistic plausibility and indirect data: Pulmonary edema in cardiogenic states is driven by hydrostatic forces, whereas ARDS reflects increased permeability; budesonide's local anti-inflammatory effects do not directly address alveolar-capillary fluid dynamics, and while preclinical VILI studies suggest ICS may reduce inflammatory lung injury, these use nonclinical tidal volumes and preventive timing and are not clinically generalizable; conversely, beta-agonists can upregulate alveolar fluid clearance and reduced high-altitude pulmonary edema risk, underscoring the mismatch between ICS pharmacology and edema pathophysiology [^113ftowD] [^115SBJAj] [^112DWWQY].

> Safety considerations: Even with predominantly local action, inhaled budesonide carries risks of adrenal suppression, immunosuppression, effects on growth in children, and clinically important drug–drug interactions with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors; in an acute pulmonary edema setting with potential infectious precipitants and physiologic stress, these risks weigh against an unproven intervention [^114rtRgU] [^1169PsR4] [^notfound].

> Peripheral contexts do not change the conclusion: Early outpatient COVID-19 trials of inhaled budesonide and living systematic reviews on ICS in COVID-19 do not constitute evidence for treating pulmonary edema, and neonatal intratracheal budesonide mixed with surfactant targets a distinct disease process and route of delivery that is not applicable to adult or pediatric pulmonary edema management [^114RDjfG] [^116fd37B] [^115PDrkr] [^116i6m2b] [^116aLwcX].

> Bottom line recommendation: Inhaled budesonide is not indicated, guideline-supported, or evidence-based for treating pulmonary edema of any etiology; clinicians should use guideline-directed therapy for cardiogenic pulmonary edema (oxygen, CPAP/NIV, hemodynamic and diuretic strategies as appropriate), and for ARDS employ lung-protective ventilation and consider systemic corticosteroids only when aligned with ATS conditional guidance and clinical context [^112Sgy3C] [^113crMig] [^112CEtUu].

Inhaled budesonide is **not recommended** for pulmonary edema due to a **lack of clinical evidence** supporting its use. Pulmonary edema management relies on **oxygen, diuretics, and ventilatory support** — not inhaled corticosteroids [^112Sgy3C]. Budesonide is indicated for asthma and COPD; its use in pulmonary edema is **unsupported by guidelines or trials** [^116xo9Uk] [^114b4gds]. Animal data suggesting reduced lung injury do not justify clinical use, and potential risks include delayed wound healing, immunosuppression, and adrenal suppression [^114GPcdR] [^113ftowD] [^114rtRgU]. Clinicians should use **established therapies** and avoid inhaled budesonide for pulmonary edema [^112Sgy3C].

---

## Pharmacological properties of budesonide

Budesonide is a potent glucocorticoid with strong anti-inflammatory activity and minimal mineralocorticoid effect [^114JUsuY], with predominantly local pulmonary effects and low systemic absorption. It is approved for asthma and COPD maintenance therapy, **not for acute pulmonary edema**.

---

## Evidence for inhaled budesonide in pulmonary edema

There is **no clinical evidence** to support inhaled budesonide for pulmonary edema. Management of pulmonary edema, including ARDS, focuses on supportive care, oxygen, diuretics, and ventilatory strategies — not inhaled corticosteroids [^112Sgy3C]. Although animal studies suggest budesonide may reduce lung injury and edema in ventilator-induced lung injury models, these findings are **not validated in humans** and do not support clinical use [^114GPcdR] [^113ftowD].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend** inhaled budesonide for pulmonary edema. Management of ARDS and pulmonary edema emphasizes supportive care, oxygen, diuretics, and ventilatory support, with no role for inhaled corticosteroids [^112Sgy3C] [^113crMig].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Inhaled budesonide **carries risks**, including:

- **Delayed wound healing**: Use caution in all patients [^114rtRgU].
- **Immunosuppression**: Increased infection risk, especially with active or latent infections [^114rtRgU] [^1169PsR4].
- **Adrenal suppression**: Risk of adrenal insufficiency, particularly with prolonged use [^114rtRgU] [^112VJcM6].
- **Growth restriction**: Use caution in pediatric patients [^114rtRgU] [^117W3BAJ].

These risks **outweigh any unproven benefit** in pulmonary edema.

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

Standard treatments for **pulmonary edema** include:

- **Oxygen therapy**: Improves oxygenation and reduces hypoxemia.
- **Diuretics**: Reduces fluid overload and pulmonary congestion.
- **Ventilatory support**: NIV or mechanical ventilation for severe cases [^112Sgy3C] [^117AJhfg].

Inhaled budesonide does not address the underlying pathophysiology of pulmonary edema and is **not supported by evidence or guidelines** [^112CEtUu].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Inhaled budesonide is **not recommended** for pulmonary edema due to a lack of evidence and guideline support. Management should rely on established therapies, such as oxygen, diuretics, and ventilatory support [^112Sgy3C]. Budesonide remains indicated for asthma and COPD, not pulmonary edema [^116xo9Uk] [^114b4gds].

### Understanding negative pressure pulmonary edema [^117AJhfg]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of NPPE generally includes maintaining a patent airway and oxygen supplementation, with the addition of positive end-expiratory pressure or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) as guided by physical examination and arterial blood gas analysis. Mechanical ventilation should be reserved for severe patients who do not respond to NIV. Diuretics are often used; however, there is no evidence of their utility, and they may exacerbate hypovolemia and hypoperfusion. Ultimately, NPPE usually has a rapidly resolving clinical course in 12–48 hours when recognized early and treated immediately.

Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to pulmonary edema can help in distinguishing NPPE from other causes of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, thus preventing the use of inappropriate and dangerous treatments for patients with NPPE.

### Budesonide inhalation suspension reduces the need for emergency intervention in pediatric asthma: a named-patient case series [^1156EZTh]. The Journal of Asthma (2003). Low credibility.

This report describes 15 children aged 10–35 months, frequently hospitalized with uncontrolled asthma, who were monitored for a mean of 26.9 months to assess the efficacy of budesonide inhalation suspension (AstraZeneca LP, Wilmington, DE) in reducing emergency interventions. Budesonide inhalation suspension was previously shown to relieve asthma symptoms, improve pulmonary function, and reduce rescue medication use in children as young as 6 months with mild to severe persistent asthma. We now show that ≥ 1 year of treatment with budesonide inhalation suspension at doses between 0.25 and 1.5 mg/day decreased the burden of asthma. The mean number of hospitalizations due to asthma or respiratory illness decreased from 1.8 ± 1.37 before initiation of treatment to 0.33 ± 0.62 during treatment. Likewise, the mean number of oral prednisone courses decreased from 8.1 ± 13.7 to 1.8 ± 2.1, and the mean number of acute respiratory illnesses requiring additional therapy decreased from 2.7 ± 2.3 before treatment to 0.87 ± 0.74 during treatment. The number of emergency department visits decreased or remained the same after initiation of budesonide inhalation suspension treatment in all but two children. There was no effect on growth rate in this group of children with moderate to severe asthma. In this case series, budesonide inhalation suspension represents a safe, effective treatment option to prevent emergency intervention for patients under 3 years of age with poorly controlled asthma.

### Budesonide ameliorates lung injury induced by large volume ventilation [^113ftowD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, rats were ventilated with a tidal volume of 30 ml/kg, which is substantially higher than volumes used in clinical applications. Our preliminary study showed that a lower tidal volume (10–15 ml/kg) did not cause a decline in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Therefore, we increased the tidal volume to 30 ml/kg, successfully establishing a significantly decreased PaO2/FiO2 ratio and mild acute respiratory distress syndrome. Using this tidal volume, we established VILI, consistent with the study by Li et al, who also used the 30 ml/kg tidal volume to induce acute lung injury (ALI). Second, in this study, budesonide was administered at the onset of VILI, supporting its use as a preventative treatment. Clinically, however, patients need mechanical ventilation support before dysfunction of or injury to the lung occurs. Third, we did not evaluate the purity of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), which may influence the assessment of budesonide's effects on neutrophils in VILI. We will address these limitations in our future studies.

### Are inhaled vasodilators useful in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^117Fosao]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), inhaled vasodilators can result in significant physiological benefits, such as improved hypoxemia, lower pulmonary arterial pressure, and enhanced right-ventricular function and cardiac output, without systemic hemodynamic effects. Inhaled nitric oxide (INO) and aerosolized prostacyclins are currently the most frequently used inhaled vasodilators. Inhaled prostacyclins are as effective physiologically as INO and are more cost-effective. Randomized controlled trials of INO in the treatment of ARDS have demonstrated short-term physiological benefits but no improvement in long-term outcomes. Additionally, no outcome studies have been reported on the use of prostacyclin in patients with ARDS. Consequently, there is no role for the routine use of inhaled vasodilators in patients with ARDS. The utilization of inhaled vasodilators as a rescue therapy for severe refractory hypoxemia in patients with ARDS may be reasonable, but this approach remains controversial.

### The impact of combined administration of surfactant and intratracheal budesonide compared to surfactant alone on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality rate in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome: a single-blind randomized clinical trial [^115PDrkr]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare the impact of administering both intratracheal surfactant and budesonide versus surfactant alone on the mortality rate and BPD in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. The overall analysis did not reveal a significant difference in mortality rate and BPD between the two groups. However, subgroup analysis showed that gestational age had a significant influence on mortality rate. Specifically, the combination of surfactant and budesonide significantly reduced the number of deaths in infants under 30 weeks of age compared to surfactant alone. The difference in BPD between subgroups was not significant.

In a systematic review published in 2023, the findings suggested that three randomized clinical studies reported a reduction in the incidence of BPD and death when using intratracheal surfactant with budesonide compared to surfactant alone. However, two observational studies and one clinical trial did not find any statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of BPD and death. The included studies focused on short-term outcomes in infants weighing less than 1500 g or born before 30 weeks. The findings of our study show that infants under 30 weeks with respiratory distress benefit from the combination of surfactant and budesonide in preventing hospital mortality.

In a 2016 clinical trial conducted by Yeh et al, the effect of intratracheal administration of budesonide plus surfactant was evaluated in 265 very-low-birth-weight infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome. The trial took place in the Uni

### The impact of combined administration of surfactant and intratracheal budesonide compared to surfactant alone on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality rate in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome: a single-blind randomized clinical trial [^116i6m2b]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

The study focused on the combined administration of surfactant and intratracheal budesonide compared to surfactant alone in terms of its impact on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality rates in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome.

The analysis involved the comparison of mean (SD) secondary outcomes between the two groups by adjusting the baseline variables. The baseline variables included the first-day mean arterial pressure (MAP), first-day oxygen index, first-day blood sugar, and first-day mean blood pressure. This comparison utilized analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to ensure accurate assessment.

### Safety profile of budesonide inhalation suspension in the pediatric population: Worldwide experience [^117CfwEY]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

To review the worldwide safety data for budesonide inhalation suspension (Pulmicort Respules), the objective is to provide a tolerability profile for pediatric patients.

- **Data sources**: Clinical study data were obtained from AstraZeneca safety databases, used by the US Food and Drug Administration to support the approval of budesonide inhalation suspension, and from postmarketing surveillance reports spanning January 1, 1990, through June 30, 2002.

- **Study selection**: The analysis included completed parallel-group studies of patients with asthma aged 18 years and younger.

- **Results**: Safety data for budesonide inhalation suspension were pooled from three US, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (n = 1,018); data from their open-label extensions (n = 670) were combined with data from a fourth US open-label study (n = 335). Additionally, data for 333 patients aged 18 years and younger enrolled in five non-US studies were analyzed. No posterior subcapsular cataracts were reported in any study, and the frequencies of oropharyngeal events and infection with budesonide inhalation suspension were comparable to those of reference treatments. There was no apparent increased risk of varicella or upper respiratory tract infection, and budesonide inhalation suspension did not cause significant adrenal suppression in studies assessing this variable. There were small differences in short-term growth velocity between children who received budesonide inhalation suspension and those who received reference treatment in two of five trials that evaluated this variable. No increased risk of adverse events was apparent from postmarketing surveillance reports.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^113q9nZJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

GRADE is an internationally accepted framework for determining the quality or certainty of evidence and the direction and strength of recommendations based on this evidence. A guideline methodologist, not involved in the development of the systematic reviews for this update, provided training on GRADE methodology to the Expert Panel and ongoing support and consultation throughout the project. The Expert Panel used the GRADE approach to review the evidence, create evidence profiles for critical and important outcomes, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements.

- **Prioritization and rating of asthma outcomes**: The Expert Panel discussed asthma outcomes of potential interest and rated the relative importance of each outcome for clinical decision-making using the GRADE approach. During this process, the Expert Panel reviewed the definitions of the outcomes in each of the systematic review reports. The outcomes deemed critical to assess for making recommendations across all topic areas were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life.

The Expert Panel assessed additional outcomes for specific key questions when these outcomes were relevant to the topic or when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. For example, in some instances, the systematic review reports identified limited or not adequate data on the effect of the interventions listed in the key questions on specific critical outcomes (e.g. asthma control). In such cases, the Expert Panel considered available data on a related outcome (e.g. asthma symptoms).

### The impact of combined administration of surfactant and intratracheal budesonide compared to surfactant alone on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality rate in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome: a single-blind randomized clinical trial [^117X8aCx]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants. It occurs when there are defects or delays in the production and secretion of surfactant, which leads to worsening symptoms within a few days if not treated with exogenous surfactant replacement. Premature infants are particularly susceptible to respiratory failure due to surfactant deficiency because their lungs are not fully developed. The inadequate surfactant levels result in alveolar collapse, reduced lung compliance, and decreased functional residual capacity (FRC). These lung injuries also increase the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is defined as receiving any respiratory or ventilatory support or supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. BPD is a prevalent, intricate, and fascinating condition within the field of perinatal medicine.

Some infants with RDS may experience rapid respiratory distress, requiring increased oxygen supplementation, and may need continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or mechanical ventilation shortly after birth. RDS has a slightly higher incidence in males compared to females. The major risk factors for RDS include prematurity, lower gestational age, and low birth weight. Infants born prematurely are at a higher risk due to the immaturity of their lungs and insufficient surfactant production. Additionally, maternal diabetes and perinatal hypoxia-ischemia are also considered risk factors for developing RDS. These factors contribute to the likelihood of experiencing respiratory distress and the need for interventions.

### A follow-up study of preterm infants given budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle to prevent chronic lung disease in preterm infants [^111KAHFg]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Our study of early intratracheal instillation of budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle showed a significant decrease in death or chronic lung disease (CLD) in preterm infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). We now report the long-term outcome at about 2 to 3 years of age.

- **Study design**: Of the 75 potential survivors, 67 (90%) were studied (35 budesonide-treated, 32 control). All infants had a birth weight of less than 1500 g and had severe RDS, requiring intermittent mechanical ventilation shortly after birth. The treated group received a mixture of budesonide and surfactant every 8 hours. The control group received only surfactant.

- **Results**: The physical growth and neurological examinations were comparable between the groups at follow-up. Infants in the group treated with budesonide tended to have higher PDI and MDI scores than infants in the control group (79 ± 20 vs. 74 ± 18 and 80 ± 19 vs. 75 ± 20), but these differences were not statistically significant. The incidence of neurodevelopmental impairment was 11 (31%) in the treated group and 13 (40%) in the control group (P = 0.367).

- **Conclusions**: Early intratracheal instillation of budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle significantly improved pulmonary outcomes without causing long-term adverse effects.

### Expert panel consensus recommendations on the utilization of nebulized budesonide for managing asthma and COPD in both stable and exacerbation stages in Thailand [^1127m94H]. The Journal of Asthma (2024). Low credibility.

This study investigated the utilization of nebulized budesonide for acute asthma and COPD exacerbations as well as for maintenance therapy in adults.

- **Data sources**: We conducted a search on PubMed for nebulized budesonide treatment.

- **Selected studies**: Selecting all English-language papers that utilize MeSH phrases "asthma", "COPD", "budesonide", "nebulized", "adult", "exacerbation", and "maintenance" without temporal restrictions, and narrowing down to clinical research such as RCTs, observational studies, and real-world studies.

- **Results**: Analysis of 25 studies was conducted to assess the effectiveness of nebulized budesonide in asthma (n = 10) and COPD (n = 15). The panel in Thailand recommended incorporating nebulized budesonide as an additional or alternative treatment option to the standard of care and systemic corticosteroids (SCS) based on the findings.

- **Conclusion**: Nebulized budesonide is effective and well-tolerated in treating asthma and COPD, with fewer systemic adverse effects compared to systemic corticosteroids. High-dose nebulized budesonide can enhance clinical outcomes for severe and mild exacerbations with slow systemic corticosteroid response. Nebulized budesonide can substitute systemic corticosteroids in some situations.

### In vitro delivery of budesonide from 30 jet nebulizer/compressor combinations using infant and child breathing patterns [^115Q87cp]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

An aerosol of budesonide inhalation suspension is delivered when used with various jet-nebulizer/compressor combinations. The constant introduction of new nebulizer/compressor combinations raises the question of whether the performance of these matches the performance of existing devices. The aim of this study was to determine in vitro the inhaled mass and aerosol characteristics of budesonide inhalation suspension from a selection of jet-nebulizer/compressor combinations presently marketed in the United States, Europe, and Japan.

- **Methods**: The in vitro characterization was performed using standardized and published methods. Each nebulizer was charged with one vial (2 mL) of budesonide inhalation suspension 0.25 mg/mL (0.5 mg budesonide) and run until the end of aerosol formation. Droplet size and distribution were determined using a cooled impactor at air flow of 15 L/min. The inhaled mass of budesonide (i.e. mass on the inhalation filter) was collected using a breathing simulator that mimicked the breathing patterns of an infant and a child. The aerosol was collected on filters placed between the nebulizer mouthpiece and the breathing simulator. Budesonide was quantified via standard high-performance liquid chromatography.

- **Results**: The mass median aerodynamic diameter of the aerosol measured with the cooled impactor ranged between 4.8 µm and 9.9 µm, and the geometric standard deviation ranged between 1.7 µm and 2.1 µm. The inhaled mass of budesonide expressed as a percentage of the nebulizer charge ranged from 1% to 9% (infant) and from 4% to 20% (child).

### Nebulized budesonide added to standard pediatric emergency department treatment of acute asthma: a randomized, double-blind trial [^111SLUMp]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The goal was to determine if adding inhaled budesonide to standard asthma therapy improves outcomes of pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute asthma.

The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a tertiary care, urban pediatric ED. Patients 2 to 18 years of age with moderate to severe acute asthma were randomized to receive either a single 2-mg dose of budesonide inhalation suspension (BUD) or normal sterile saline (NSS) placebo, added to albuterol, ipratropium bromide (IB), and systemic corticosteroids (SCS). The primary outcome was the difference in median asthma scores between treatment groups at 2 hours. Secondary outcomes included differences in vital signs and hospitalization rates.

A total of 180 patients were enrolled. Treatment groups had similar baseline demographics, asthma scores, and vital signs. A total of 169 patients (88 BUD, 81 NSS) were assessed for the primary outcome. No significant difference was found between groups in the change in median asthma score at 2 hours (BUD -3, NSS -3, p = 0.64). Vital signs at 2 hours were also similar between groups. Fifty-six children (62%) were admitted to the hospital in the BUD group and 55 (62%) in the NSS group (difference 0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -14% to 14%). Neither multivariate adjustment nor planned subgroup analysis by inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) use prior to the ED significantly altered the results.

For children 2 to 18 years of age treated in the ED for acute asthma, a single 2-mg dose of nebulized budesonide added to standard treatment showed no significant difference in outcomes compared to placebo.

### Budesonide ameliorates lung injury induced by large volume ventilation [^114GPcdR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, in the study, we found that budesonide ameliorated lung injury probably by improving epithelial permeability, decreasing edema, inhibiting local and systemic inflammation, and reducing apoptosis in VILI. We speculate that inhalation of budesonide reduces lung injury and edema via inhibition of NF-kB phosphorylation and decreased secretion of adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory factors, which reduces local and systemic inflammation. Budesonide inhalation may be a potential approach for ARDS therapy in clinical practice.

### Pulmonary ultrasound-guided management of delayed pulmonary edema secondary to nitric acid fumes inhalation: a case report [^114Wn8Bx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In past clinical work, chest X-ray and CT are routinely used to evaluate pulmonary edema, but it cannot be ignored that bedside pulmonary ultrasound may be more convenient and accurate in identifying pulmonary edema.

In pulmonary ultrasound, if B-lines formed by the interface reflection of the coexistence of gas and liquid can be seen, pulmonary edema can be judged to a certain extent. Relevant data show that when three or more B-lines are seen between the bilateral intercostal spaces, the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing pulmonary edema are much higher than those of physical examination and chest X-ray. Picano et al. studied and believed that performing pulmonary ultrasound exploration on the anterior and lateral chest of the patient, the total number of B-lines can reflect the degree of pulmonary edema. Based on the observation of this case, the patient's condition continued to worsen in the first two days of the onset, and the lung images of the two CT examinations were similar, suggesting that the progress of the clinical symptoms is not completely synchronized with the CT changes. However, the number of B-lines seen by ultrasound increased.

Therefore, in the dynamic evaluation of pulmonary edema, pulmonary ultrasound examination may be more sensitive to reflect the changes of the condition than CT examination, which is worthy of further verification and application in clinical practice. This case suggests that the use of pulmonary ultrasound technology not only enables a rapid diagnosis but also semi-quantitatively assesses the patient's non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

### The impact of combined administration of surfactant and intratracheal budesonide compared to surfactant alone on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality rate in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome: a single-blind randomized clinical trial [^117NmT8v]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Infants exhibiting common clinical indications of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), such as grunting, retraction of the intercostal, subcostal, and substernal areas, nasal flaring, cyanosis, increased oxygen demand, and a respiratory rate exceeding 60 breaths per minute, along with typical radiological findings of RDS including a diffuse reticulonodular pattern and the classic ground-glass appearance in both lungs, as well as a significant increase in air bronchograms shortly after birth, were categorized based on severity using the Downes scoring system. Infants falling into the Moderate or Severe group were included in the study.

Infants meeting the following criteria were included in the study: gestational age less than 37 weeks, birth weight less than 2500 g, requirement for mechanical ventilation within 4 hours after birth, requirement for FIO2 greater than 30% for infants with a gestational age less than 28 weeks, and greater than 40% for infants with a gestational age above 28 weeks, as well as being candidates for surfactant prescription with expert doctor's opinion.

Infants were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria: weight less than 700 g, severe congenital anomalies, fatal cardiopulmonary disease, or other causes of respiratory distress, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia, that could be identified through X-ray or echocardiography.

### The impact of combined administration of surfactant and intratracheal budesonide compared to surfactant alone on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality rate in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome: a single-blind randomized clinical trial [^115BwQ3s]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

The covariate adaptive randomization method was utilized in this study to allocate participants into two groups. The researchers identified gestational age and birth weight as important factors that needed to be balanced across groups to mitigate potential confounding effects. To achieve this, a randomization algorithm was employed that took into account the values of these covariates for each participant. The algorithm adaptively allocated participants to treatment groups, ensuring a balanced distribution of gestational age and birth weight across the groups.

In this study, a random sequence of numbers was created using random table numbering by a person not involved in the research team. The created numbers were recorded on cards, and the cards were placed in sealed envelopes. As soon as the eligible participants entered the study, one of the envelopes was opened in order, revealing the participant's allocated group.

### Surfactant and budesonide for respiratory distress syndrome: an observational study [^116aLwcX]. Pediatric Research (2020). Low credibility.

In preterm infants on moderately high ventilator support, the addition of budesonide to surfactant lowered bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) rates by 20% without increased morbidity or mortality. The aim of this cohort comparison was to determine the safety and efficacy of the combination in infants with milder respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).

- **Methods**: In August 2016, we began administering budesonide (0.25 mg/kg) mixed with surfactant (Survanta 4 mL/kg) to all infants ≤ 1250 g who failed CPAP and required intubation. Infants were compared to a historical cohort (2013–2016) who received surfactant alone.

- **Results**: BPD or death did not change between the historical surfactant cohort (71%, n = 294) and the budesonide cohort (69%, n = 173). Budesonide was associated with a decrease in the need for continued mechanical ventilation, severe BPD type II or death (19–12%), grade III BPD or death (31–21%), and the median gestational age at discharge was 1 week earlier. Histologic chorioamnionitis was associated with decreased budesonide effects. Secondary morbidities such as NEC, IVH, ROP, and sepsis were similar.

- **Conclusion**: Overall BPD rates remained unchanged with the addition of budesonide. Budesonide was associated with decreased severity of BPD, decreased mechanical ventilation use, earlier discharge, and similar short-term outcomes.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^11355Tty]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

This recommendation is for children aged 0 to 4 years who have had three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in their lifetime or who have had two such episodes in the past year and are asymptomatic between respiratory tract infections. For this population, the Expert Panel recommends a short (7–10-day) course of ICS daily along with as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy starting at the onset of signs and symptoms indicating a respiratory tract infection. Respiratory tract infections were not confirmed by culture or PCR in the studies, and no further details on wheezing were provided.

- **Implementation of intermittent ICS dosing**:
	- One regimen used in two studies is budesonide inhalation suspension, 1 mg, twice daily for 7 days at the first sign of respiratory tract infection–associated symptoms. Although the efficacy of intermittent ICS dosing has high certainty of evidence, data regarding effects on growth are conflicting. Clinicians should carefully monitor length or height in children treated with the recommended regimen.

- **Caregiver guidelines**:
	- Caregivers can initiate intermittent ICS treatment at home without a visit to a health care provider when they have clear instructions. Clinicians should give caregivers written instructions on how to implement the recommended action plan at the onset of a respiratory infection. In addition, clinicians should review the plan with the caregiver at regular intervals.

### Inhaled corticosteroids use before hospitalization may be protective in children with direct lung injury [^113wSj7L]. Chest Critical Care (2024). Low credibility.

Respiratory illness is the most common reason for both hospitalization and ICU admission in children. Treatment for direct lung injury (DLI) primarily is supportive. Systemic corticosteroids may be used if DLI progresses to severe ARDS, with studies yielding mixed results.

- **Steroids have numerous anti-inflammatory effects**: Such as decreasing extravasation of fluid through intracellular junctions and limiting pulmonary edema, inhibiting neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, exerting anti-inflammatory effects via glucocorticoid receptors, and enhancing adrenergic receptors and effect. Studies of systemic corticosteroids in ARDS have demonstrated benefits in oxygenation, lung mechanics, and hemodynamics, with conflicting results on mortality and clinically relevant outcomes. These conflicts result from potential off-target side effects and inconsistencies in timing of initiation.

- **Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs)**: These have a localized and direct site of action for DLI, with minimal systemic absorption. ICS use in DLI may be beneficial prophylactically and in preventing progression to respiratory failure because drug delivery in later and more severe illness may be variable and may be affected by pulmonary edema and mismatch.

Studies in animal models suggest that ICSs can attenuate inflammation and can improve oxygenation, hemodynamics, and lung mechanics, particularly when ICSs are given before or early after lung injury. Two retrospective studies in adults suggest that prior ICS use in patients at risk of ARDS may protect against progression to actual ARDS, and this was most evident in patients with DLI.

### Pulmonary ultrasound-guided management of delayed pulmonary edema secondary to nitric acid fumes inhalation: a case report [^1116WXKp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Concentrated nitric acid can form nitrogen oxides through a spontaneous redox reaction. After inhalation, it has a stimulating effect on the respiratory tract and can cause inhalation lung injury, which is mainly manifested as non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema in imaging. Pulmonary ultrasound can dynamically monitor the severity of pulmonary edema at the patient's bedside.

- **Case presentation**: This article describes a 52-year-old female case who experienced chest tightness and dyspnea 8 hours after inhaling nitric acid fumes and was sent to the emergency room. Chest CT suggested diffuse exudation in both lungs, and dynamic B-lines could be seen by bedside pulmonary ultrasound. During the treatment, the dosage of hormones and the oxygen therapy plan were adjusted in a timely manner according to the evolution of B-lines under ultrasound. After treatment, her clinical symptoms gradually improved, and the re-examination of chest CT showed that the exudation in both lungs was gradually absorbed.

- **Conclusion**: This case reminds clinicians to be alert to the occurrence of delayed pulmonary edema when treating patients who inhale nitric acid fumes. At the same time, dynamic examination of bedside pulmonary ultrasound is of great value in the treatment of such patients.

### Budesonide ameliorates lung injury induced by large volume ventilation [^112eoNgR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Mechanical ventilation (MV) is indispensable for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is required for about 39% of patients in intensive care units. However, MV can damage injured lungs in patients with ARDS. Studies have shown that about 24% of ARDS patients treated with MV developed ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), resulting in a 40–50% mortality rate. MV with a large volume may lead to alveolar overstretching, increased alveolar-capillary permeability, and cause pulmonary edema and lung focal inflammation. Small tidal volume MV can reduce lung injury and lower the mortality of ARDS; however, ARDS remains a major problem still associated with a mortality of 25–45% in intensive care units. Therefore, it is imperative to develop alternative therapies to attenuate VILI.

Studies have demonstrated that the imbalance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of VILI. During VILI, cytokines are released, leucocytes are recruited to the lung, and lung permeability is increased, resulting in lung edema and deterioration of pulmonary gas exchange. Moreover, the cytokines released from injured endothelial and epithelial cells can enter the blood and cause systemic inflammation and injury to other organs.

Glucocorticoids can ameliorate VILI. However, the systemic use of glucocorticoids may cause immunosuppression and steroid resistance. Additionally, systemic glucocorticoid use was not found to improve the outcome of ARDS, but instead led to neuromuscular weakness and increased mortality risk.

### Pulmicort respules [^115uhePt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Read the patient information that comes with Pulmicort Respules before your child starts using it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your child's medical condition or treatment. If you have any questions about Pulmicort Respules, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.

- **What is Pulmicort Respules**: Pulmicort Respules is an inhaled corticosteroid medicine. It is a long-term maintenance medicine used to control and prevent asthma symptoms in children aged 12 months to 8 years. Inhaled corticosteroids help to decrease inflammation in the lungs. Inflammation in the lungs can lead to asthma symptoms. Pulmicort Respules helps reduce swelling and inflammation in the lungs and helps keep the airways open to reduce asthma symptoms.

Pulmicort Respules does not treat sudden symptoms such as wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain or tightness associated with an asthma attack. Always have a short-acting beta-agonist medicine (rescue inhaler) with you to treat sudden symptoms. If your child does not have an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator, ask your healthcare provider to have one prescribed for your child.

### The use of albuterol/budesonide as reliever therapy to reduce asthma exacerbations [^117KsrBD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Prevention of asthma exacerbations and reduction of systemic corticosteroid burden remain unmet needs in asthma. US asthma guidelines recommend concomitant short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as an alternative reliever at step 2. The Food and Drug Administration approved a pressurized metered-dose inhaler containing albuterol and budesonide for as-needed treatment or prevention of bronchoconstriction and for reducing exacerbation risk in patients with asthma aged ≥ 18 years. This combination is approved for use as a reliever with or without maintenance therapy, but it is not indicated for maintenance therapy (or for single maintenance and reliever therapy). Intervening with as-needed SABA-ICS during the window of opportunity to reduce inflammation during loss of asthma control can reduce exacerbation risk by exerting both genomic and nongenomic anti-inflammatory effects.

We propose that the use of albuterol-budesonide rather than albuterol as a reliever to manage episodic symptoms driven by acute bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation can improve outcomes. This combination approach, shown to decrease asthma exacerbations and oral corticosteroid burden in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma, represents a paradigm shift for asthma treatment in the United States. Further safety and efficacy studies should provide evidence that this type of reliever should be standard of care.

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety of nebulized beclometasone dipropionate and budesonide in severe persistent childhood asthma [^116mbTaE]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Inhaled steroids are recommended for long-term control of asthma, but their use may be limited in young children due to difficulties in using the associated inhaler device. The use of nebulizers may help to overcome this issue without compromising therapeutic efficacy or safety. This 14-week, multicentre, randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel-group study compared the efficacy and safety of nebulized corticosteroids in pediatric patients (aged 6 months to 6 years) with severe persistent asthma.

Beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) 800 microg/day suspension for nebulization and budesonide (BUD) 750 microg/day given by nebulization in a twice-daily regimen resulted in comparable clinical efficacy across all parameters when used in addition to the usual maintenance therapy.

- **Primary efficacy endpoint**: The number of patients who did not experience any major exacerbation was 40.4% and 51.7% in the BDP and BUD groups respectively in the ITT population (P = 0.28). The mean number of global exacerbations (major plus minor) decreased by -37.5% in the BDP group and -23.3% in the BUD group.

Both treatments were also associated with marked reductions in the number of nights with wheezing and the number of days of oral steroid use. Moreover, the two treatment groups had a similar adverse-event incidence and profile. There were 11 adverse events reported, with no serious adverse events related to treatment. Urinary cortisol levels and the time course of height and weight were unaffected by both treatments. Beclometasone dipropionate and budesonide were confirmed to have a neutral effect on ne.

### Pulmicort Flexhaler [^117W3BAJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

The administration of inhaled budesonide via a different Pulmicort dry-powder inhaler in doses up to 800 mcg/day (mean daily dose 445 mcg/day) or via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler in doses up to 1200 mcg/day (mean daily dose 620 mcg/day) to 216 pediatric patients (age 3 to 11 years) for 2 to 6 years had no significant effect on statural growth compared with non-corticosteroid therapy in 62 matched control patients. However, the long-term effect of inhaled budesonide on growth is not fully known.

The growth of pediatric patients receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including Pulmicort Flexhaler, should be monitored (e.g. via stadiometry). If a child or adolescent on any corticosteroid appears to have growth suppression, the possibility that he/she is particularly sensitive to this effect should be considered. The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained. To minimize the systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids, including Pulmicort Flexhaler, each patient should be titrated to the lowest dose that effectively controls his/her asthma [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

- **Geriatric use**: Of the total number of patients in controlled clinical studies receiving inhaled budesonide, 153 (n = 11 treated with Pulmicort Flexhaler) were 65 years of age or older, and one was age 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between these patients and younger patients. Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine differences in efficacy.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112CEtUu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Each group convened to develop initial recommendations for the individual PICO questions. The co-chairs and methodologists led the groups through a discussion of the evidence profiles and GRADE Evidence to Decision framework to determine the direction and strength of the recommendations (see online supplement). As part of the GRADE Evidence to Decision process, we considered the certainty of evidence, balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of an intervention, patient preferences and values, resource use, implications for health equity, acceptability of the intervention to stakeholders, and clinical feasibility. Evidence across the full spectrum of ARDS severity was unavailable for some interventions.

For those interventions, recommendations were limited to the specific severity subgroups (i.e. mild, moderate, or severe) for which evidence was sufficient, and no recommendation was made for the subgroups for which it was not. Each recommendation was designated as "strong" or "conditional" (see Table 2). After the individual groups generated draft recommendations, these were presented to the full panel for detailed discussion, input, and approval. Final recommendations were determined by consensus of the full panel. Consistent with the GRADE approach, we had planned to use voting for recommendations that could not achieve consensus through discussion, but this was not required.

- **Manuscript preparation**: The writing committee, composed of the chairs and co-chairs, was responsible for drafting and finalizing the manuscript.

### Pulmicort respules [^114JUsuY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid exhibiting potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. In standard in vitro and animal models, budesonide demonstrates approximately a 200-fold higher affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and a 1000-fold higher topical anti-inflammatory potency than cortisol (rat croton oil ear edema assay). As a measure of systemic activity, budesonide is 40 times more potent than cortisol when administered subcutaneously and 25 times more potent when administered orally in the rat thymus involution assay. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

	- The activity of Pulmicort Respules is due to the parent drug, budesonide. In glucocorticoid receptor affinity studies, the 22R form was two times as active as the 22S epimer. In vitro studies indicated that the two forms of budesonide do not interconvert.

	- The precise mechanism of corticosteroid actions on inflammation in asthma is not well known. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g. mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g. histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic- and non-allergic-mediated inflammation. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.

	- Studies in asthmatic patients have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activities and systemic consequences.

### Inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic lung disease in ventilated very low birth weight preterm infants [^113hGRey]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic lung disease (CLD) remains a serious and common problem among very low birth weight infants despite the use of antenatal steroids and postnatal surfactant therapy to decrease the incidence and severity of respiratory distress syndrome. Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, corticosteroids have been widely used to treat or prevent CLD. However, the use of systemic steroids has been associated with serious short and long-term adverse effects. Administration of corticosteroids topically through the respiratory tract might result in beneficial effects on the pulmonary system with fewer undesirable systemic side effects.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effect of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids administered to ventilator-dependent preterm neonates with birth weight < 1500 g or gestational age < 32 weeks after two weeks of life for the treatment of evolving CLD.

- **Search strategy**: Randomized and quasi-randomized trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - June 2007), EMBASE (1980 - June 2007), CINAHL (1982 - June 2007), reference lists of published trials, and abstracts published in Pediatric Research or electronically on the Pediatric Academic Societies website (1990 - April 2007).

### Symbicort [^113rDVjF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

The selection of budesonide 80 mcg is supported by a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 304 pediatric patients (152 budesonide, 152 placebo) aged 6 to less than 12 years with asthma. Results showed that budesonide 80 mcg (2 inhalations twice daily) provided statistically significantly greater improvement compared to placebo for the primary endpoint of change from baseline to the treatment period average in pre-dose morning PEF and the key secondary endpoint of change in pre-dose morning FEV1.

The selection of the formoterol dose is supported by a randomized, single-dose, placebo-controlled, active-controlled (Foradil Aerolizer 12 mcg), 5-way crossover study in which doses of 2.25, 4.5, and 9 mcg formoterol were administered in combination with budesonide in 54 pediatric patients aged 6 to less than 12 years with asthma. Results showed a dose response of formoterol compared to placebo for the primary endpoint of FEV1 averaged over 12 hours post-dose, and the 9 mcg group showed numerically similar results compared to the active control.

The confirmatory efficacy study was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study in which Symbicort 80/4.5 was compared with budesonide pMDI 80 mcg, each administered as 2 inhalations twice daily, in 184 pediatric patients aged 6 to less than 12 years with a documented clinical diagnosis of asthma. At trial entry, the children required daily medium-dose range inhaled corticosteroid therapy or a fixed combination of inhaled corticosteroid and LABA therapy, and exhibited symptoms despite treatment.

- **Study question**: What is the role of oral fluvoxamine plus inhaled budesonide in high-risk outpatients with early COVID-19?

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: 1,476 patients, comprising 898 females and 578 males.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Symptomatic adult patients with COVID-19 who have a known risk factor for progression to severe disease.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Acute respiratory symptoms due to other causes; a negative diagnostic test for COVID-19 associated with acute flu symptoms; dyspnea secondary to other acute and chronic respiratory causes or infections.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113crMig]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Although pooled analysis demonstrated a mortality benefit with moderate certainty of evidence, multiple caveats prompted a conditional recommendation. There is substantial heterogeneity in the dosing, timing, and duration of corticosteroids in clinical trials in patients with ARDS, resulting in uncertainty about the optimal course of treatment. Data addressing the short- and long-term adverse effects of corticosteroids are also limited; infectious complications could not be systematically evaluated, and there is low- to very low-certainty evidence for other safety outcomes. Additionally, previous studies assessing the use of corticosteroids for varied indications have demonstrated the potential for harm even when used in short courses.

- **Implementation considerations**: Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer. As such, they have the potential to reach and benefit a substantial number of patients. With regard to corticosteroid dosing and administration, although the panel was not comfortable making recommendations for a specific agent and course of therapy, there are some considerations that may help guide clinicians when selecting a regimen. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (i.e. severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit from corticosteroids, with regimens that have been defined and evaluated in large RCTs. For other ARDS etiologies, any of several regimens used in clinical trials may be appropriate.

### Salmeterol for the prevention of high-altitude pulmonary edema [^112DWWQY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Pulmonary edema results from a persistent imbalance between forces that drive water into the air space and the physiological mechanisms that remove it. Among the latter, the absorption of liquid driven by active alveolar transepithelial sodium transport plays an important role; a defect in this mechanism may predispose patients to pulmonary edema. Beta-adrenergic agonists up-regulate the clearance of alveolar fluid and attenuate pulmonary edema in animal models.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, we assessed the effects of prophylactic inhalation of the beta-adrenergic agonist salmeterol on the incidence of pulmonary edema during exposure to high altitudes (4559 m, reached in less than 22 hours) in 37 subjects who were susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary edema. We also measured the nasal transepithelial potential difference, a marker of transepithelial sodium and water transport in the distal airways, in 33 mountaineers who were prone to high-altitude pulmonary edema and 33 mountaineers who were resistant to this condition.

- **Results**: Prophylactic inhalation of salmeterol decreased the incidence of high-altitude pulmonary edema in susceptible subjects by more than 50 percent, from 74 percent with placebo to 33 percent (P = 0.02). The nasal potential-difference value under low-altitude conditions was more than 30 percent lower in the subjects who were susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary edema than in those who were not susceptible (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Prophylactic inhalation of a beta-adrenergic agonist reduces the risk of high-altitude pulmonary edema.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in obstructive airway disease [^114pHVQC]. Respiratory Care (2007). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids play an important role in the management of obstructive airway disease by suppressing airway inflammation, which is central to the pathophysiology of these conditions. In asthma, there is strong clinical evidence supporting the use of inhaled corticosteroids in mild, moderate, and severe persistent asthma to improve lung function, reduce exacerbations, and prevent death.

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inhaled corticosteroids improve symptoms and reduce the frequency of exacerbations and hospitalizations. They should be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation who have persistent symptoms despite optimal bronchodilator therapy. Although the adverse effects of corticosteroids are less significant when administered via inhalation rather than systemically, they remain important and must be considered. Newer inhaled corticosteroids with enhanced pharmacologic properties are being developed and will likely be available in the near future.

This injury manifests mainly as non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema in imaging, and pulmonary ultrasound can dynamically monitor the severity of pulmonary edema at the patient's bedside.

- **Case presentation**: This article describes a 52-year-old female who experienced chest tightness and dyspnea 8 hours after inhaling nitric acid fumes and was sent to the emergency room. Chest CT suggested diffuse exudation in both lungs, and dynamic B-lines could be seen by bedside pulmonary ultrasound. During the treatment of this patient, we adjusted the dosage of hormones and the oxygen therapy plan in a timely manner according to the evolution of B-lines under ultrasound. After treatment, her clinical symptoms gradually improved, and the re-examination of chest CT showed that the exudation in both lungs was gradually absorbed.

- **Conclusion**: This case reminds clinicians to be alert to the occurrence of delayed pulmonary edema when treating patients who inhale nitric acid fumes. At the same time, dynamic examination of bedside pulmonary ultrasound is of great value in the treatment of such patients.

### Inhaled fluticasone versus inhaled beclomethasone or inhaled budesonide for chronic asthma in adults and children [^114Gs1T5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and budesonide (BUD) are commonly prescribed inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma. Fluticasone propionate (FP) is a newer agent with greater potency in in-vitro assays.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy and safety of fluticasone to beclomethasone or budesonide in the treatment of chronic asthma.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trial register (January 2004) and reference lists of articles. We contacted trialists and pharmaceutical companies for additional studies and searched abstracts of major respiratory society meetings (1997 to 2003).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials in children and adults comparing fluticasone to either beclomethasone or budesonide in the treatment of chronic asthma.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and methodological quality. One reviewer extracted data. Quantitative analyses were undertaken using RevMan analyses 1.0.1.

- **Main results**: Fifty-six studies (12,119 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was variable. For a dose ratio of 1:2, FP produced a significantly greater FEV1 (0.14 litres, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.22), morning PEF (11.10 L/min, 95% CI 3.12 to 19.09 L/min), and evening PEF (9.31 L/min, 95% CI 5.12 to 13.5 L/min). This applied to all drug doses, age groups, and delivery devices. No differences between FP and BDP/BUD were seen for trial withdrawals. Symptoms and rescue medication use were widely reported, but few trials provided sufficient data for analysis.

### Budesonide ameliorates lung injury induced by large volume ventilation [^115SBJAj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a life-saving treatment for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but even minimal MV can induce ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Therefore, it is imperative to develop therapies that can attenuate VILI. In the study, we found that budesonide improves alveolocapillary permeability, increases the wet-to-dry (W/D) weight ratio and total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), inhibits inflammation, mitigates histological changes, and prevents apoptosis in VILI. Our data support that budesonide may reduce VILI. Although several studies have indicated that budesonide or systemic glucocorticoids can reduce lung injury in various models, and systemic glucocorticoids can ameliorate VILI, this is the first study to investigate the effect of inhaled budesonide on VILI. VILI is a serious and common problem in patients who need long-term and large volume ventilation, with major injury found in their lungs. In this study, we administered budesonide through inhalation to avoid the systemic effect of glucocorticoids and strengthen its local efficacy.

During large volume ventilation, overstretching of epithelial cells activates NF-kB and promotes NF-kB phosphorylation. Under stimulation from mechanical ventilation, many chemoattractant and pro-inflammatory factors, including IL-8, ICAM-1, and MIP-2, are released, and pulmonary macrophages are activated, recruiting neutrophils. The activated macrophages and neutrophils release pro-inflammatory factors and elastase, contributing to lung injury and leading to lung edema. In the study, we found that budesonide improved the oxygen index and reduced histological injury in the lung.

### Role of budesonide as maintenance therapy for children with asthma [^113zw4iz]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2003). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Inhaled corticosteroids are recognized as the preferred long-term control medication for persistent asthma based on their anti-inflammatory properties and significant evidence of efficacy. Inhaled budesonide is the most carefully characterized inhaled corticosteroid for childhood asthma. It is available for administration in children down to six months of age and, at the time of writing, has an excellent safety profile.

### Randomized clinical trial of a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and beta agonist in patients at risk of developing the acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112SbDhS]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Effective pharmacologic treatments directly targeting lung injury in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome are lacking. Early treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and beta agonists may reduce progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome by reducing lung inflammation and enhancing alveolar fluid clearance.

- **Design**: Double-blind, randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01783821). The primary outcome was longitudinal change in oxygen saturation divided by the FIO2 (S/F) through day 5. We also analyzed categorical change in S/F by greater than 20%. Other outcomes included the need for mechanical ventilation and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

- **Setting**: Five academic centers in the United States.

- **Patients**: Adult patients admitted through the emergency department at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome.

- **Interventions**: Aerosolized budesonide/formoterol versus placebo bid for up to 5 days.

- **Measurements and Main Results**: Sixty-one patients were enrolled from September 3, 2013, to June 9, 2015. Median time from presentation to the first study drug was less than 9 hours. More patients in the control group had shock at enrollment (14 vs 3 patients). The longitudinal increase in S/F was greater in the treatment group (p = 0.02) and independent of shock (p = 0.04). Categorical change in S/F improved (p = 0.01), but not after adjustment for shock (p = 0.15). More patients in the placebo group developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (7 vs 0) and required mechanical ventilation (53% vs 21%).

### Budesonide reduces hospital admission rates in preschool children with acute wheezing [^111Qu2oE]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether high doses of inhaled budesonide provide additional benefits to a standardized treatment regimen that includes systemic steroids and salbutamol in preschool patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute wheezing attacks. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial was conducted in children, aged 6 months to 6 years, with moderate or severe acute wheezing episodes, as determined by a pulmonary index score (PIS) of 7–13 points. The study compared the addition of budesonide 3mg versus placebo to standard acute asthma treatment, which included salbutamol and a single 1mg/kg dose of methylprednisolone given at the beginning of therapy.

The primary outcome was the differences in hospitalization rates within 4 hours. The secondary outcome was the difference in median PIS between treatment groups at 2 hours. Results from the study showed that one hundred patients were enrolled. The cumulative hospitalization rate at 120, 180, and 240 minutes were 0.72, 0.62, and 0.58 in the placebo group; and 0.44, 0.30, and 0.24 in the budesonide group. The discharge rate in the budesonide group was significantly higher than in the placebo group (log-rank = 12.407, P < 0.001). Expected mean discharge times were 200.4 minutes (95% CI = 185.3–215.5) for the placebo group and 164.4 minutes (95% CI = 149.4–179.4) for the budesonide group. The median (25–75%) PIS at the 120th minute was significantly lower in the budesonide group compared to the placebo group (5 [4–8] vs. 8 [5–9] respectively, P = 0.006).

In conclusion, the addition of budesonide nebulization may decrease the admission rate of preschool children who have acute wheezing episodes.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^1144behQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Background

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. The Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules might be useful in some settings; however, the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

Definitions of terms used in this section

"Intermittent" ICS dosing in this section includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. "Intermittent ICS dosing" does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. Intermittent ICS dosing allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. When to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual's decision (based on need, also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing), a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

"Controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The terms "ICS-LABA" refer to an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2-agonist combination.

### Nebulized budesonide inhalation suspension compared with cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution for asthma in young children: results of a randomized outcomes trial [^113F7rBo]. Pediatrics (2002). High credibility.

The availability of anti-inflammatory asthma medications for infants and young children has been limited. This study aimed to compare the effects of nebulized budesonide inhalation suspension and cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution on asthma-related health outcomes in young children with asthma.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, parallel-group, 52-week, open-label study in 36 US clinical sites. Patients included 335 children aged 2 to 6 years with persistent asthma, having been treated with at least one long-term control medication. A total of 287 children (86%) completed the study. Patients received either budesonide inhalation suspension, 0.5 mg daily (n = 168), or cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution, 20 mg four times daily (n = 167), for 8 weeks, followed by dose titration at the investigator's discretion. The main outcome measure was the rate of asthma exacerbations over 52 weeks. Secondary measures included times to first asthma exacerbation and first use of additional asthma therapy, asthma symptom scores, rescue medication use, and health care resource use.

- **Results**: The budesonide group had a mean (median) asthma exacerbation rate of 1.23 (0.99) per year compared with 2.41 (1.85) for the cromolyn group, with significantly longer times to first exacerbation and first use of additional long-term asthma medication. Greater improvements in asthma symptom scores, reduced use of rescue medication, and fewer urgent care visits were observed. Both treatments were well tolerated.

- **Conclusions**: Budesonide inhalation suspension was more effective than nebulized cromolyn sodium in young children with asthma.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 [^116fd37B]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids are well established for the long-term treatment of inflammatory respiratory diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and they have been investigated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The anti-inflammatory action of inhaled corticosteroids might have the potential to reduce the risk of severe illness resulting from hyperinflammation in COVID-19.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether inhaled corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of COVID-19 and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies up to 7 October 2021.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating inhaled corticosteroids for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, sex, or ethnicity. We included interventions of any type or dose of inhaled corticosteroids and comparisons of inhaled corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (with or without placebo). We excluded studies examining nasal or topical steroids.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. For risk of bias assessment, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

### Combination formoterol and budesonide as maintenance and reliever therapy versus combination inhaler maintenance for chronic asthma in adults and children [^113yYbyf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

Asthma is characterized by chronic inflammation of the airways and exacerbations with wheezing, chest tightness, and cough. Treatment with inhaled steroids and bronchodilators often results in good control of symptoms, prevention of further morbidity and mortality, and improved quality of life. Several steroids and beta2-agonists (long- and short-acting), as well as combinations of these treatments, are available in a single inhaler to be used once or twice a day, with a separate inhaler for relief of symptoms when needed for patients in Step 3 or higher, according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines. Budesonide/formoterol is also licensed for use as maintenance and reliever therapy from a single inhaler (SiT; sometimes referred to as SMART therapy). SiT can be prescribed at a lower dose than other combination therapy because of the additional steroid doses being received as reliever therapy. It has been suggested that using SiT improves compliance and hence reduces symptoms and exacerbations, but it is unclear whether it increases side effects associated with the use of inhaled steroids.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler (SiT) to be used for both maintenance and reliever therapy in asthma in comparison with maintenance treatment provided through combination inhalers with a higher maintenance steroid dose (either fluticasone/salmeterol or budesonide/formoterol), along with additional fast-acting beta2-agonists for relief of symptoms.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Airw
