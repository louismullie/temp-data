## Question

can a patient taking clopidrogel take NSAIDs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient taking clopidogrel can also take NSAIDs, and if so, how to manage the risks and what alternatives to consider. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of clopidogrel and NSAIDs and whether there is a mechanistic interaction. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about concomitant use. Next, I will review clinical evidence on bleeding and cardiovascular outcomes when NSAIDs are combined with clopidogrel. After that, I need to consider patient-specific risk factors and the role of gastroprotection. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and outline safer alternatives and monitoring steps.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology. Clopidogrel irreversibly inhibits platelet P2Y12, suppressing aggregation for the lifespan of platelets, which is about 7–10 days, so any added platelet inhibition or mucosal injury can compound bleeding risk, and NSAIDs impair platelet function and gastric mucosal defenses, creating a pharmacodynamic synergy toward gastrointestinal bleeding rather than a direct pharmacokinetic clash with clopidogrel metabolism [^115xsBA7] [^112Gn1u9].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position before drawing conclusions. Multiple FDA labels consistently warn that coadministration of clopidogrel with NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and they advise patients to inform clinicians about all NSAID use, which signals a recognized and clinically meaningful interaction that warrants caution rather than a categorical prohibition [^1173UiUB] [^111WP18y].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence. In a large Danish registry of post–myocardial infarction patients on antithrombotic therapy, concomitant NSAID use approximately doubled the risk of bleeding requiring hospitalization and increased cardiovascular events, with no safe therapeutic window even for short-term NSAID courses, which reinforces the label warning and suggests that even brief exposure is not risk-free [^1115GtQB] [^112DHpTa]. Hold on, I should also check whether this applies beyond VKA contexts; indeed, similar signals are seen with DOACs, where NSAID coadministration increases major bleeding, underscoring a class effect across antithrombotics when combined with NSAIDs [^113k8yWt] [^114J83fV].

> I need to ensure I am not overstating a categorical ban. The labels do not absolutely contraindicate NSAIDs with clopidogrel; they emphasize increased bleeding risk and recommend avoidance when possible, which means the decision should be individualized and risk-stratified rather than reflexively permissive or prohibitive [^1173UiUB] [^111WP18y].

> Let me consider patient-specific risk factors that tilt the balance. High gastrointestinal risk includes age over 65, prior peptic ulcer or GI bleeding, Helicobacter pylori infection, concomitant anticoagulant or corticosteroid use, and dual antiplatelet therapy, all of which magnify the risk of NSAID-induced upper GI bleeding when layered onto clopidogrel. Conversely, younger patients without GI history have lower absolute risk but still face relative risk amplification with NSAIDs [^1122mWiL] [^112TBDvD] [^1173UiUB].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of gastroprotection because it may modify risk. Proton pump inhibitors reduce NSAID-related GI bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, including post-MI cohorts, and contemporary guidance supports PPI use in patients at increased GI risk who require NSAIDs or antiplatelet therapy; however, I need to check the PPI–clopidogrel interaction concern, and while omeprazole and esomeprazole can reduce clopidogrel activation via CYP2C19 inhibition, pantoprazole or rabeprazole are reasonable alternatives with less CYP2C19 effect, and large within-person analyses suggest no clinically meaningful increase in ischemic events with PPIs overall, supporting gastroprotection when indicated [^116K6pvk] [^114x5NK8] [^1173UiUB] [^117Pv68Y].

> But wait, what if the patient truly needs an anti-inflammatory and acetaminophen is inadequate. I should confirm safer NSAID strategies: if an NSAID must be used, prefer a COX-2 selective agent at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and always co-prescribe a PPI in patients with any GI risk factor; naproxen is sometimes favored for cardiovascular risk profiles, yet even naproxen adds GI bleeding risk when combined with antiplatelets, so the net strategy remains to minimize exposure and maximize gastroprotection rather than assume neutrality [^1122mWiL] [^111mYRto] [^114LpeGN].

> I will now examine alternatives to avoid the combination altogether. Non-NSAID options such as acetaminophen, topical NSAIDs for localized pain, physical therapy, and, when appropriate, short-term opioids can reduce or obviate the need for systemic NSAIDs in clopidogrel-treated patients. If an NSAID is unavoidable, document the indication, counsel on bleeding signs, and arrange close follow-up to ensure the shortest possible course with ongoing GI risk mitigation [^notfound].

> Next, I should review peri-procedural and special contexts. If the patient needs surgery or high-risk endoscopic procedures, clopidogrel is typically held for about 5 days to mitigate bleeding, and NSAIDs themselves have their own washout intervals by half-life before procedures. This underscores that both agents independently contribute to procedural bleeding risk and should be managed proactively in procedural planning [^1173UiUB] [^112K2ZdP] [^112UrbLK].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. NSAIDs should generally be avoided with clopidogrel when alternatives suffice because of the approximately twofold increase in GI bleeding and the potential for added cardiovascular harm in high-risk patients. If an NSAID is absolutely necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time, prefer COX-2 selectivity, and co-prescribe a PPI, ideally pantoprazole or rabeprazole rather than omeprazole or esomeprazole, while monitoring for melena, hematemesis, anemia, and hemodynamic changes, and reassessing the need frequently to enable timely discontinuation [^1115GtQB] [^1122mWiL] [^114x5NK8].

> Finally, I should double-check that patient counseling aligns with labeling and evidence. Patients on clopidogrel should be told they will bruise and bleed more easily, should report any unexpected or prolonged bleeding promptly, and should disclose all OTC NSAIDs before starting any new medication. This shared decision-making ensures we do not inadvertently compound bleeding risk while preserving cardiovascular protection from clopidogrel [^112rLhV5] [^1173UiUB].

---

Patients on clopidogrel should **avoid NSAIDs** because coadministration significantly increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding [^111WP18y] and can impair cardiovascular outcomes [^1115GtQB]. If NSAIDs are absolutely necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration and add a proton pump inhibitor for gastroprotection [^116K6pvk] [^1122mWiL]. Prefer acetaminophen or COX-2 inhibitors when possible, and monitor closely for bleeding.

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms of interaction

Clopidogrel **irreversibly inhibits platelet aggregation** by blocking the P2Y12 receptor, reducing the risk of thrombotic events [^113Y8NBa]. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin synthesis and **impairing platelet function** [^113b1N7a]. Together, they produce additive antiplatelet effects that markedly increase bleeding risk, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding [^111WP18y].

---

## Clinical evidence of increased bleeding risk

Multiple studies and guidelines document a **significant increase in gastrointestinal bleeding** when NSAIDs are combined with clopidogrel:

- **GI bleeding risk**: Coadministration increases GI bleeding risk by approximately 2-fold [^notfound].
- **Major bleeding**: Higher rates of major bleeding, including gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhage, have been observed [^notfound].
- **Post-MI patients**: NSAID use after myocardial infarction increases bleeding and cardiovascular events, even with short-term use [^1115GtQB].

---

## Cardiovascular implications

NSAID use in patients with cardiovascular disease — especially those on antiplatelet therapy — is associated with **increased cardiovascular events** [^1176kzoV]. NSAIDs can cause sodium retention, hypertension, and thrombotic events, which may counteract the benefits of clopidogrel [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus **strongly advise against** routine coadministration of NSAIDs with clopidogrel:

- **Avoidance**: NSAIDs should be avoided in patients receiving clopidogrel unless absolutely necessary [^notfound].
- **Lowest dose**: If NSAIDs are necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^112TBDvD].
- **Gastroprotection**: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are recommended for gastroprotection in high-risk patients [^116K6pvk] [^1122mWiL].

---

## Alternative analgesic strategies

Given the significant risks, **consider alternatives**:

- **Acetaminophen**: Preferred for mild to moderate pain; does not significantly affect platelet function [^notfound].
- **COX-2 inhibitors**: May be considered in select cases but still carry bleeding and cardiovascular risks [^111mYRto].
- **Topical NSAIDs**: Lower systemic absorption and may be safer for localized pain [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring NSAID use

In select scenarios, NSAIDs may be unavoidable (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or acute pain). In these cases:

- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate individual bleeding and cardiovascular risk [^115LgN3U].
- **Monitoring**: Close monitoring for bleeding, gastrointestinal symptoms, and cardiovascular events [^112TBDvD].
- **Patient education**: Inform patients about bleeding signs and when to seek medical attention [^112TBDvD].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Avoid NSAIDs | Unless absolutely necessary [^113qecAZ] |
| Use lowest dose | Shortest duration if NSAIDs are necessary [^112TBDvD] |
| Gastroprotection | PPIs recommended for high-risk patients [^116K6pvk] |
| Alternatives | Acetaminophen, COX-2 inhibitors, topical NSAIDs [^115LgN3U] |
| Monitoring | Close monitoring for bleeding and cardiovascular events [^114LpeGN] |

---

Patients on clopidogrel should **generally avoid NSAIDs** due to increased bleeding risk. If NSAIDs are necessary, use the lowest dose for the shortest time, add gastroprotection, and monitor closely. Prefer acetaminophen or COX-2 inhibitors when possible.

Agents Concurrently Affecting Bleeding Risk

As mentioned above, bleeding complications increase when DOACs are coprescribed with antiplatelets (aspirin, P2Y 12 inhibitors) or agents with antiplatelet properties (NSAIDs, systemic corticosteroids, etc), and these combinations should be minimized whenever possible and carefully balanced against improved thrombosis prevention when clinically indicated. If concomitant therapy cannot be avoided, addition of H2 antihistamine receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors to mitigate gastrointestinal bleeding should be undertaken.

### Comparative effect of clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin alone on laboratory parameters: a retrospective, observational, cohort study [^111Eb4aE]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

The nature of antiplatelet therapy involves an inherent risk of bleeding complications. Some trials reported that the addition of aspirin to clopidogrel increases the risk of hemorrhage. Our study showed that GI bleeding occurred more frequently in patients receiving clopidogrel plus aspirin than in patients receiving aspirin alone. Although patients who had increased risk of bleeding, including diagnosis of severe hepatic insufficiency, renal failure, current peptic ulceration or history of systemic bleeding, were excluded from the study population, there was a possibility that some covariates at baseline might impact on the results of hemorrhagic events. For instance, the risk of GI bleeding is increased by administration of NSAIDs, advanced age and liver disease, but is reduced by administration of PPI and H2 blockers. In this study, we used two adjustment methods to control for these potential confounding covariates, and thereby found that the risk of GI bleeding was increased with combination therapy of clopidogrel and aspirin compared with aspirin alone, with a relative risk ranging from 2.06 with the multivariate model and 2.61 for propensity adjustment. Our results were similar to the results of two large-scale randomized clinical trials reporting that dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin increased the risk of GI bleeding approximately 2-fold compared with aspirin alone.

### The management of antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndrome patients with thrombocytopenia: a clinical conundrum [^111Q7v6v]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia can generally be classified as mild, moderate, or severe (Table 1). While a patient's risk of bleeding can increase even with mild thrombocytopenia, we believe a platelet count of < 100 × 10⁹ /L is clinically relevant, and warrants proactive measures to reduce the risk of bleeding (Table 2). What approach could clinicians take until further randomized trial evidence is available? We believe initial management should begin with identification and correction of any reversible causes of thrombocytopenia. If suspected as the instigating factor, medications associated with the development of thrombocytopenia such as unfractionated heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, furosemide, NSAIDs, and penicillin-based antibiotics should be discontinued.

Table 1
Classification of thrombocytopenia

Table 2
Strategies to minimize bleeding risk in patients with significant thrombocytopenia

It is our opinion that clopidogrel monotherapy should be administered to ACS patients with thrombocytopenia who are not undergoing PCI if their platelet count is < 100 × 10⁹/L but ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L and in the absence of bleeding (Figure 2). We suggest clopidogrel as opposed to aspirin monotherapy based on the results of the Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events (CAPRIE) randomized controlled trial. This trial demonstrated a statistically significant relative risk reduction in gastrointestinal bleeding with clopidogrel 75 mg as opposed to aspirin 325 mg (relative risk reduction of 31.8%, CI: 7.9–49.5, P = 0.012). Due to their association with higher bleeding rates, we propose prasugrel and ticagrelor be avoided in this cohort, though their study as monotherapy, particularly of ticagrelor with its twice daily dosing and reversible binding, would be of great interest. In patients with a platelet count < 50 × 10⁹/L or in the setting of active bleeding, we advise stopping all antiplatelet therapy and avoidance of PCI. The addition of a proton pump inhibitor would likely reduce the rates of gastrointestinal bleeding and would be advised. In ACS patients with thrombocytopenia undergoing PCI, second generation drug-eluting stents are preferable to bare-metal stents. While traditional teaching would advise the utility of bare-metal stents in patients at higher risk of bleeding, two recent randomized trials — Prospective Randomized Comparison of the BioFreedom Biolimus A9 Drug-Coated Stent versus the Gazelle Bare-Metal Stent in Patients at High Bleeding Risk (LEADERS FREE) and Zotarolimus-eluting Endeavor Sprint Stent in Uncertain DES Candidates (ZEUS) — demonstrated superior outcomes with second generation drug-eluting stents compared with bare-metal stents in patients at high bleeding risk (including patients with thrombocytopenia) who may need a shorter duration of DAPT. Based on the limited data from these trials, we would recommend that stented patients with ACS who have a platelet count of < 100 × 10⁹/L but ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L receive DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel for 1 month followed by a single antiplatelet agent thereafter.

### Antiplatelets and anticoagulants [^116msPyw]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Those of us who see patients with cardiovascular disorders frequently use antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents; the common agents are aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin. This editorial is a personal viewpoint about commonly used drugs, not so commonly used drugs, and drugs that are yet to be used clinically.

### NSAID use with antithrombotic therapy after MI… [^112DHpTa]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Design, Setting, and Participants Using nationwide administrative registries in Denmark, we studied patients 30 years or older admitted with first-time MI and alive 30 days after discharge. Subsequent treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel, or oral anticoagulants and their combinations, as well as ongoing concomitant NSAID use, was determined. In assessment of the relation of both antithrombotic and NSAID use in the entire population, we used dual therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel as the reference, since this is the recommended treatment for patients after an MI. In all other analyses, the reference was the analyzed antithrombotic treatment regimen without concomitant NSAID treatment. Table 2 and Table 3 report bleeding risk with concomitant NSAID use according to the most prevalent antithrombotic regimens. The combinations of aspirin plus clopidogrel with NSAIDs and oral anticoagulants plus single antiplatelet drug with NSAIDs was associated with a marked increase in bleeding risk compared with either treatment without a concomitant NSAID. The combination of aspirin plus clopidogrel with concomitant NSAIDs and aspirin with NSAIDs was associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The same pattern of associations with cardiovascular risk was present for the other individual antithrombotic groups. In this Danish nationwide study, concomitant use of NSAIDs was associated with increased risk of bleeding in patients who had experienced an MI. The association with increased risk was observed for all antithrombotic treatment regimens, and the association was apparent regardless of whether selective COX-2 inhibitors or nonselective COX inhibitors were involved.

There was no safe therapeutic window for concomitant NSAID use, because even short-term treatment was associated with increased risk of bleeding compared with no NSAID use. Confirming previous studies and despite increased bleeding complications, NSAIDs were not associated with decreased cardiovascular risk.

### The potential interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors: a systematic review [^112phSv6]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Clopidogrel is a widely prescribed thienopyridine for the prevention of atherothrombotic complications following acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). Clopidogrel is a prodrug that has no intrinsic antiplatelet activity without activation by hepatic metabolism through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Multiple CYP enzymes have been implicated in this process, but recently the CYP2C19 enzyme has assumed predominance as it is involved in both sequential oxidative steps. The possibility of drug interactions limiting clopidogrel's efficacy was raised several years following in vitro statin and clopidogrel studies, but without definitive clinical confirmation of increased adverse outcomes. Recently, mechanistic in vitro studies have suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may diminish clopidogrel's clinical efficacy via CYP2C19 competitive inhibition. Consistent with these in vitro observations, several clinical studies have shown higher cardiovascular events in clopidogrel patients exposed to PPIs compared to those not exposed, leading the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency to issue public alerts recommending the avoidance of prescribing PPIs in patients who also take clopidogrel. However, as the studies have largely been nonexperimental, the possibility of a spurious association due to bias needs to be attentively considered.

This is a clinically important question as many cardiac patients are also at high risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (due to age, smoking and concomitantly prescribed drugs), and PPIs may substantially mitigate this risk. Previous reviews of this interaction question have appeared, but they have not (1) been systematic, (2) provided a critical analysis of methodological issues or (3) integrated these safety concerns with prior knowledge of clopidogrel's time frame of action. The present review addresses these issues by performing a systematic and critical analysis of all clinical studies of this putative interaction.

### Risk of colonoscopic post-polypectomy bleeding in patients on single antiplatelet therapy: systematic review with meta-analysis [^114N7oxv]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Our meta-analysis has some limitations. First, we included only observational studies because RCTs assessing the PPB risk among patients on single antiplatelet therapy are not currently available.

Second, only one abstract assessed the PPB risk (both delayed and immediate) among patients on clopidogrel, and not any performed a sub-analysis among the other P2Y12i. Furthermore, PPB among patients in single antiplatelet therapy was the main outcome in only two included studies.

A recent RCT, published by Chan and colleagues, evaluated the risk of PPB with uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy vs placebo, taken until the day of colonoscopy. The results showed that a slightly larger proportion of patients continuing clopidogrel developed delayed (3.8% vs 3.6%) and immediate (8.5% vs 5.5%) post-polypectomy bleeding, although this difference was not statistically significant. However, only 7.7% of the polyps included in this RCT, were ≥ 10 mm in size, so the RCT is strongly underpowered for this subgroup analysis, and the generalizability of the conclusion for polyps > 10 mm is limited. Moreover, about 80% of patients were on DAPT and these data are hardly generalizable to a group of patients who are not on dual antiplatelet therapy. It is important to underline that PPB is rarely life threatening, whereas a thrombotic event caused by clopidogrel interruption can be harmful. Therefore, any discussion about the reduction in the risk of PPB is of secondary importance compared to cardiovascular thrombotic events caused by interruption of antiplatelet therapy.

Few meta-analyses evaluated the colonoscopic post-polypectomy bleeding in patients on antiplatelet therapy. However, none of these assessed the risk of PPB in single APAs. Two of these meta-analyses evaluated the PPB risk in patients exposed to both aspirin and NSAIDs. Moreover, Pigò et al. included patients who underwent colorectal polypectomy with snare, ESD, or EMR. Colorectal ESD on APAs, except for aspirin alone, were independent risk factors for delayed bleeding (OR 4.04; CI 1.44–11.30). ASGE guidelines recommend discontinuation of thienopyridines at least 5 to 7 days before high-risk endoscopic procedure or switching to aspirin monotherapy which may be continued safely in the peri-endoscopic period. Two well-conducted meta-analyses assessed the pooled relative risk ratio of colonoscopic PPB in patients who continued clopidogrel therapy; however, they both included patients on an uninterrupted single APAs therapy or DAPT.

### Being precise with anticoagulation to reduce adverse drug reactions: are we there yet? [^113k8yWt]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents

The DOAC product monographs contraindicate the concomitant use of other anticoagulants due to an increased bleeding risk. Caution is also warranted if co-prescribing DOACs and other drugs that elevate bleeding risk: these include antiplatelets, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and systemic corticosteroids (Table 1). A post hoc analysis of the RE-LY trial showed that the rate of major bleeding was higher in patients on concomitant antiplatelet drugs compared to those not on antiplatelet therapy (Table 1). Furthermore, in patients on a DOAC and antiplatelet therapy, dual antiplatelet treatment was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding than single antiplatelet therapy (Table 1). Subgroup analysis of the EINSTEIN-DVT and EINSTEIN-PE trials demonstrated that rivaroxaban-treated patients co-administered a NSAID had a 2.4-fold higher risk of a major bleed and those who concomitantly took aspirin had a 1.5-fold higher risk (Table 1). Aspirin and NSAID use increased the risk of major bleeding in apixaban-treated patients by approximately 30%. Patients with AF receiving antiplatelet therapy in addition to edoxaban had higher rates of bleeding and cardiovascular death than those not on antiplatelet therapy. It is therefore important to consider the patient–specific risk-benefit profile when DOACs are prescribed with permissible agents that may increase bleeding risk, and concurrent therapy should be administered for the shortest appropriate duration.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on prescribing drugs in pregnancy and breastfeeding: comorbidity medications used in rheumatology practice [^111bZUMB]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Clopidogrel

There was no demonstrable maternofoetal toxicity in 13 (mostly second and third trimester only) pregnancy exposures to clopidogrel. UKTIS does not report on clopidogrel.

LactMed considers various non-selective NSAIDs to be acceptable during breastfeeding and prefers ibuprofen because of its extremely low levels in breastmilk, short half-life and safe use in infants in doses much higher than those excreted in breastmilk, as an analgesic or anti-inflammatory agent in breastfeeding mothers. There was no information on COX2 inhibitors. Aspirin doses up to 325 mg daily are not excreted into breastmilk so LDA may be considered as an antiplatelet drug for use in breastfeeding women and is preferred to clopidogrel as no information is available on this drug. Recommendations for these drugs were based on evidence as shown in Supplementary Tables S5 and S6, available at Rheumatology online.

Recommendations for NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Discordant findings from retrospective, large studies with population controls on the use of non-selective NSAIDs in the first trimester of pregnancy raise the possibility of a low risk of miscarriage and malformation. Therefore, these drugs should only be used intermittently in the first trimester of pregnancy (GRADE 1B, SOA 97.3).
Intermittent rather than regular use of all non-selective NSAIDs except LDA is recommended throughout pregnancy and weaned from end of second trimester (26 weeks) to stop by gestational week 30 to avoid premature closure of the ductus arteriosus (GRADE 1B, SOA 98).
At present there are limited data on selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors; they should therefore be avoided during pregnancy (GRADE 2C, SOA 98.5).
Non-selective NSAIDs (especially ibuprofen) are compatible with breastfeeding (GRADE 1C, SOA 98.8).

Recommendations for LDA and clopidogrel in pregnancy and breastfeeding

LDA may be continued throughout pregnancy and NICE guidelines (2019) for hypertension in pregnancy advise treatment with LDA (for prophylaxis of pre-eclampsia) until delivery (GRADE 1B, SOA 99.0).
LDA is compatible with breastfeeding (GRADE 2C, SOA 99.8).
There are limited data on clopidogrel but it may be considered where alternative drugs are not suitable in pregnancy and breastfeeding (GRADE 2C, SOA 96.3).

Clopidogrel loading dose and platelet inhibition kinetics — loading with 300 mg results in more rapid platelet inhibition than 75 mg, 600 mg achieves the full antiplatelet effect after 2 to 4 h, 600 mg yields higher active metabolite levels and greater inhibition than 300 mg, and the incremental effect of 900 mg over 600 mg appears marginal; platelet function returns to normal 7 to 10 days after the last dose, and while aspirin is used at doses 2.5- to 10-fold over the 30-mg dose needed for full COX-1 inactivation, clopidogrel dosing produces only partial P2Y12 inhibition.

### Naproxen [^114LpeGN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Aspirin — drug interactions with nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — Concomitant administration of nonselective NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, should be avoided because these drugs can interfere with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin; a pharmacodynamic interaction between naproxen and aspirin has also been described, but this does not appear to occur with rofecoxib, celecoxib, or diclofenac; the US Food and Drug Administration has stated that ibuprofen can interfere with the antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d), potentially rendering aspirin less effective for cardioprotection or stroke prevention.

### Clopidogrel and interaction with proton pump inhibitors: comparison between cohort and within person study designs [^117Pv68Y]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and policy implications

In conclusion, these results suggest that the drug interaction between proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel does not result in clinical harm. The observed associations between proton pump inhibitor use and several harmful outcomes are likely to be non-causal and could be explained by differences between people. An analysis within individuals, which removes the effect of differences between people, found no association between proton pump inhibitor use and myocardial infarction. Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association recognise the conflicting nature of previous studies of this question and recommend re-evaluation of the need for proton pump inhibitor use in this setting. The use of a proton pump inhibitor with clopidogrel and aspirin is well proved to prevent harm through gastrointestinal bleeding, and we should continue to consider proton pump inhibitors as important prophylactic drugs in patients at high risk.

### Impact of proton pump inhibitor treatment on gastrointestinal bleeding associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use among post-myocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics: nationwide study [^116K6pvk]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This nationwide study suggests that PPIs reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with NSAID use among post-myocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics. Four PPIs (omeprazole, pantoprazole, lanzoprazole, esmoprazole) were individually associated with a lower risk of bleeding compared with non-use for the antithrombotic regimens examined and irrespective of whether selective COX 2 inhibitors or non-selective NSAIDs were prescribed.

Adverse cardiovascular effects associated with NSAIDs have led to discouragement of their use in patients with cardiovascular disease.NSAIDs have also been associated with a substantial independent risk of bleeding in patients already taking antithrombotics. Nevertheless, they continue to be prescribed quite extensively for patients with cardiovascular risks. Previous studies have reported that around 40% of Danish patients with myocardial infarction are exposed to NSAIDs, consistent with the 42.5% found here. PPIs reduce the risks of gastrointestinal complications associated with antithrombotics and with NSAIDs, including among patients at high risk treated with selective or non-selective NSAIDs. Our results support these findings in showing that concurrent PPIs were associated with a reduced risk of gastrointestinal bleeding among post-myocardial infarction patients taking both NSAIDs and antithrombotics.

Concern has been expressed that some PPIs might diminish the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel, most likely through inhibition of CYP2C19 mediated conversion of clopidogrel into its active form, but studies have been contradictory and definitive data are awaited. A similar situation exists regarding concerns that PPIs might impair the cardiovascular protective efficacy of aspirin. Consequently, PPIs are recommended for aspirin treated patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. American specialty guidelines recommend that in patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, a PPI should be used concomitantly with antithrombotics and with NSAID treatment. Our data suggest that PPI treatment probably has a beneficial effect regardless of underlying gastrointestinal risk and that when NSAIDs cannot be avoided in post-myocardial infarction patients, physicians might prescribe a PPI as well. Our study does not clarify whether PPIs might be safely omitted in specific subgroups of patients with a low risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: management of individuals with bleeding or thrombotic disorders undergoing abortion [^115gj123]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

Additional considerations — NSAIDs for post‑abortion pain in individuals with bleeding disorders or on anticoagulation: Nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and ketorolac, are generally recommended as safe and effective options for post‑operative pain without significant associations with increased post‑operative bleeding, hematomas, or complications; in individuals on anticoagulation or with coagulopathies, NSAIDs should be carefully assessed and tailored because most NSAIDs can enhance the activity of oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, or clopidogrel and potentially increase bleeding risk, and platelet function returns to normal within 10 hours after ibuprofen administration; use of NSAIDs for post‑abortion pain management is generally recommended but should be tailored with attention to possible interaction with anticoagulants. (GRADE 1C).

### Management of bleeding in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants [^113EVJTk]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The most important risk factor for hemorrhage in users of anticoagulants is the intensity of the anticoagulant dose. Studies suggest that with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of > 3.0 the incidence of major bleeding is twice as large as in studies with a target INR of 2.0–3.0. In a meta-analysis of studies in patients with prosthetic heart valves, a lower INR target range resulted in a lower frequency of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage with a similar antithrombotic efficacy. For dabigatran a clear relationship between dose and incidence of bleeding complications has been demonstrated in a clinical study in patients with atrial fibrillation, and all other DOACs have also demonstrated a similar dose-adverse event relationship.

Patient characteristics constitute another important determinant of the bleeding risk. Older patients have a 2-fold increased risk of bleeding, and the relative risk of intracranial hemorrhage (in particular at higher intensities of anticoagulation) was 2.5 (95% CI 2.3–9.4) in patients aged > 85 years compared with patients 70–74 years old. Comorbidity may also significantly increase the risk of bleeding. A case–control study in 1986 patients on anticoagulants showed that comorbidity (such as mild renal insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction, or diabetes) increased the risk of bleeding by about 2.5. Another very important determinant of the risk of bleeding is the combined use of medication that affects both the coagulation system and platelet function. Two meta-analyses, comprising six trials with a total of 3874 patients and 10 trials with a total of 5938 patients, found a relative risk of major bleeding when antithrombotic agents were combined with aspirin of 2.4 (95% CI 1.2–4.8) and 2.5 (95% CI 1.7–3.7), respectively. A population-based case–control study confirmed the high risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients using anticoagulants in combination with aspirin and/or clopidogrel. It should be noted that the combined use of the new anticoagulant agents and antiplatelet agents was discouraged in the clinical trials, whereas this is increasingly common in clinical practice and may also have a serious impact on the risk of hemorrhage. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) are also associated with an enhanced risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. The combined use of anticoagulants and NSAIDs may result in an 11-fold higher risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding as compared with the general population. This risk is not significantly lower when using selective inhibitors of COX-2. As DOACs are associated with a higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with conventional anticoagulants (see above), the effect of combined treatment with these agents and aspirin or NSAIDs may be even larger.

### Drug insight: aspirin resistance – fact or fashion? [^116Lk9he]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Medium credibility.

The term aspirin resistance has been used increasingly in clinical studies. The aim of this Review is to analyze the origin of this term, to discuss the biochemical, functional and clinical correlates of the phenomenon and to offer a conceptual framework to redefine the major determinants of variability between individuals in response to aspirin. Awareness needs to be increased of factors that might interfere with the desired antiplatelet effect of aspirin, particularly in terms of patients' adherence to treatment and avoidable drug interactions with some traditional NSAIDs. Gaining such knowledge could result in improved care of patients and might avoid the requesting of unnecessary platelet function tests of unproven clinical significance.

### The potential interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors: a systematic review [^11486kcH]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The issue of adverse outcomes associated with concomitant use of clopidogrel and PPIs has been assessed in previous reviews, as well as by American and European regulatory agencies, which concluded that the interaction is clinically significant. However, previous reviews have been dominated by studies with surrogate laboratory endpoints, were not systematic in identifying the clinical evidence, did not consider the putative interaction effect as a function of our previous knowledge of clopidogrel efficacy and did not provide a critical analysis of the methodological issues of each study. Lower-quality observational studies tend to overestimate effect size because of bias. In the case of regulatory agencies, the threshold to report putative clinical adverse effects is naturally low in an effort to protect public health. However, with the recent spate of controversies regarding the cardiovascular safety of approved drugs such as rofecoxib and rosiglitazone, there is perhaps a strong desire for these agencies to avoid appearing inactive and rather to be perceived as proactive. Nevertheless, it is disconcerting that the potential positive benefits of avoiding gastrointestinal bleeds in high-risk patients appear to have been minimized if not ignored and that regulatory decisions have been made not on a systematic assessment of the clinical evidence, but rather largely on surrogate laboratory data and isolated clinical studies of questionable validity. One regulatory agency has targeted specific PPIs as being culpable without a single valid clinical study to support this claim. Correctly or not, the impression is that the safety of the regulatory agencies from criticism has become more important than the critical assessment of public health safety.

### Rivaroxaban [^1117P6Tb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Avoid combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers (7.2, 7.3)
Anticoagulants: Avoid concomitant use (7.4)

7.1 General Inhibition and Induction Properties

Rivaroxaban is a substrate of CYP3A4/5, CYP2J2, and the P-gp and ATP-binding cassette G2 (ABCG2) transporters. Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors increase exposure to rivaroxaban and may increase the risk of bleeding. Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers decrease exposure to rivaroxaban and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

7.2 Drugs that Inhibit Cytochrome P450 3A Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems

Interaction with Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors

Avoid concomitant administration of rivaroxaban tablets with known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole and ritonavir) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Although clarithromycin is a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitor, pharmacokinetic data suggests that no precautions are necessary with concomitant administration with rivaroxaban tablets as the change in exposure is unlikely to affect the bleeding risk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Interaction with Combined P-gp and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors in Patients with Renal Impairment Rivaroxaban tablets should not be used in patients with CrCl 15 to < 80mL/min who are receiving concomitant combined P-gp and moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin) unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Drugs that Induce Cytochrome P450 3A Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems

Avoid concomitant use of rivaroxaban tablets with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John's wort) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.4 Anticoagulants and NSAIDs/Aspirin

Coadministration of enoxaparin, warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel and chronic NSAID use may increase the risk of bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Avoid concurrent use of rivaroxaban tablets with other anticoagulants due to increased bleeding risk unless benefit outweighs risk. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss if patients are treated concomitantly with aspirin, other platelet aggregation inhibitors, or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding — antiplatelet and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) management after diverticular hemorrhage: We recommend discontinuing nonaspirin NSAIDs after hospitalization for diverticular hemorrhage. (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest discontinuing aspirin for primary cardiovascular prevention after hospitalization for diverticular hemorrhage given the risks of recurrent diverticular hemorrhage. (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest continuing aspirin after hospitalization for diverticular hemorrhage for patients with an established history of cardiovascular disease given the benefits of reducing future ischemic events. (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We recommend that providers re-evaluate the risks vs benefits of continuing nonaspirin antiplatelets such as P2Y12 receptor antagonists in a multidisciplinary setting after hospitalization for diverticular hemorrhage given the demonstrated risks of recurrent diverticular hemorrhage. (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Supporting data include that the use of NSAIDs was associated with an increased risk of recurrent LGIB (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2–3.3), platelet aggregation inhibitors were associated with a second diverticular hemorrhage (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.15–1.88), and in a 295-patient cohort continuation of aspirin increased recurrent bleeding (HR 2.76, 95% CI 1.26–6.07) while being protective against serious cardiovascular events (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37–0.91) and death (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17–0.63).

### Nonvitamin K anticoagulants: risk of bleeding when interacting with other medications: a cohort study from Medicare [^116nrkcD]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients on nonvitamin K antagonist (NVKA) are usually taking other drugs. Potential interaction may increase the gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding risk associated with NVKA.

Methods

Observational cohort study using Medicare data from 2017 to 2020. Participants receiving a NVKA were included. A concomitant overlapping period while on NVKA was assessed for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), antiplatelets, glucocorticoids, aspirin and proton pump inhibitors (PPI). A logistic regression predicting either any bleeding or GI bleeding was conducted estimating the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results

A total of 102531 people on NVKA with mean age 77 years (SD = 9.8) and 55% females (N = 56671) were included. Previous history of GI bleeding occurred in 2908 (2.8%) participants, concomitant exposure to PPI occurred in 38713 (38%), SSRI in 16487 (16%), clopidogrel in 15795 (15.4%), NSAIDs in 13715 (13.4%) and glucocorticoids in 13715 (13.4%). Risk for any bleeding was shown for clopidogrel (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.44), prasugrel/ticagrelor (OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.58), glucocorticoids (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.34), and SSRIs (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.19). GI bleeding risk was shown for clopidogrel (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.34, 1.55), prasugrel/ticagrelor (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.20, 1.79), SSRIs (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.17) and glucocorticoids (OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.44). PPI use was correlated with both NSAID (r = 0.07, p ≤ 0.0001) and SSRI use (r = 0.09, p ≤ 0.0001).

Conclusion

NVKA concomitantly taken with antiplatelets, glucocorticoids, and SSRIs showed an increased risk for any bleeding and GI bleeding.

### Prasugrel hydrochloride (effient) [^1143stD6]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.1	General Risk of Bleeding

Thienopyridines, including Effient, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in TRITON-TIMI 38, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Major (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin ≥ 5 g/dL, or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI Minor (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of ≥ 3 g/dL but < 5 g/dL), bleeding events were more common on Effient than on clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The bleeding risk is highest initially, as shown in Figure 1 (events through 450 days; inset shows events through 7 days).

Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding.

Do not use Effient in patients with active bleeding, prior TIA or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)].

Other risk factors for bleeding are:

Age ≥ 75 years. Because of the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients ≥ 75 years of age, use of Effient is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14)].
CABG or other surgical procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Body weight < 60 kg. Consider a lower (5 mg) maintenance dose [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
Propensity to bleed (e.g., recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, active peptic ulcer disease, severe hepatic impairment, or moderate to severe renal impairment) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7, 8.8)].
Medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., oral anticoagulants, chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and fibrinolytic agents). Aspirin and heparin were commonly used in TRITON-TIMI 38 [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.4) and Clinical Studies (14)].

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^114x5NK8]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A matter for concern is the interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel. Based on pharmacokinetic studies, PPI therapy reduces the efficacy of clopidogrel by interfering with the hepatic CYP2C19-based activation. However, the clinical relevance of such a phenomenon is largely controversial. Indeed, a panel of experts of the European Society of Cardiology recently suggested that there is no conclusive evidence to discourage PPI use with clopidogrel due to a potential increased risk of ischemic events. Further, the only prospective study (the COGENT trial) demonstrated that omeprazole significantly reduces the rate of composite GI events but did not show any increase in the composite CV events in patients at high CV risk. Additionally, a recent meta-analysis, while confirming that the pharmacodynamic interaction between PPI and clopidogrel has no clinical significance, actually suggests that PPIs are a marker of increased CV risk in patients taking clopidogrel rather than a direct cause of worse outcomes. Nevertheless, PPIs that lack inhibition of CYP2C19 (i.e. pantoprazole or rabeprazole) might be preferred in clopidogrel users. No significant interaction between PPIs and the new antiplatelet agents (prasugrel or ticagrelor) has been documented.

Co-administration of aspirin and clopidogrel is associated with synergistic effects in causing serious GI bleeding. Indeed, epidemiological studies have invariably shown that combination of two antiplatelet drugs produces significant excess risk of UGIB. PPI co-treatment is also effective in reducing the risk of UGIB in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. It is worthwhile mentioning that – among patients with dual antiplatelet therapy and PPI co-therapy – GI bleeding episodes are more frequent in the lower GI tract; this changing pattern of bleeding likely reflects the success of gastroprotection.

Anticoagulants, either vitamin K antagonists or novel oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban, do not cause gastroduodenal mucosa injury per se. These medications may, however, facilitate bleeding of pre-existing PUs. While gastroprotection is generally not advised, unless a concomitant anti-platelet or NSAID therapy is prescribed, a very recent retrospective cohort study found that PPI co-therapy is associated with reduced risk of warfarin-related upper GI bleeding. As expected, the risk reduction was greatest in patients also taking antiplatelet drugs and/or NSAIDs, but was still significant in those without concurrent use of these medications.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^111EtXKx]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP 2024 — interventional pain procedures with perioperative antiplatelet exposure — bleeding outcomes: In a publication describing bleeding and neurological complications in interventional pain procedures, preprocedural aspirin or NSAID therapy was prevalent in 17,825 procedures or 30.7% without identifying clinically significant bleeding complications. Out of a total of 58,066 procedures, 22.4% were performed with perioperative administration of aspirin within 7 days, 12.1% had administration of NSAIDs within 7 days, and 1.6% had clopidogrel within 7 days. The series included 3,880 lumbar epidural injections and 304 thoracic interlaminar injections with over 50% of the epidural injections not assigned to a region, and investigators concluded that bleeding complications were rare in patients undergoing low or intermediate risk pain procedures even in the presence of antiplatelet medications.

### Anticoagulants with NSAID or aspirin… [^114J83fV]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

During NSAID-anticoagulant concomitant treatment, clinically relevant bleeding occurred with an event rate of 37. 5 per 100 patient-years vs
16. 6 per 100 patient-years during anticoagulant use only. Major bleeding during NSAID-anticoagulant treatment occurred with an event rate of 6. 5 per 100 patient-years, compared to
2. 0 per 100 patient-years during nonuse. For aspirin-anticoagulant concomitant treatment, clinically relevant bleeding occurred with an event rate of 36. 6 per 100 patient-years, compared to
16. 9 per 100 patient-years during aspirin nonuse. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with venous thromboembolism receiving anticoagulant therapy, concomitant use of an NSAID or aspirin is associated with an increased risk of clinically relevant and major bleeding.

A substantial proportion of these patients will receive anticoagulant therapy combined with aspirin and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 1, 2 Combined anticoagulant therapy and aspirin use has been associated with an approximate 1. 5-fold to
2. 5-fold increased bleeding risk in patients with atrial. Use of NSAIDs and platelet aggregation inhibitors was discouraged. However, if indicated, aspirin up to 100 mg/d and clopidogrel up to 75 mg/d were advised dosages. Concomitant medications taken during the study were collected at each site on an electronic case record form, and source verification was done by a clinical research associate. Our study, for the first time to our knowledge, showed a clinically important and statistically significant increase in clinically relevant bleeding and major bleeding in patients co-administered NSAIDs with anticoagulation. What are the clinical implications of our findings.

The doubled risk for bleeding should urge physicians to combine anticoagulation with either NSAID or aspirin therapy with caution and only if genuinely indicated, with no similarly effective and safer alternative treatment available. If indicated, patients treated with VKAs should be monitored carefully to avoid prolonged periods in the supratherapeutic zone, especially in those with an a priori enhanced bleeding risk.

This article discusses platelet active drugs as part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. New data on antiplatelet agents include the following: (1) the role of aspirin in primary prevention has been the subject of recommendations based on the assessment of cardiovascular risk; (2) an increasing number of reports suggest a substantial interindividual variability in the response to antiplatelet agents, and various phenomena of "resistance" to the antiplatelet effects of aspirin and clopidogrel; (3) the benefit/risk profile of currently available glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists is substantially uncertain for patients with acute coronary syndromes who are not routinely scheduled for early revascularization; (4) there is an expanding role for the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel in the long-term management of high-risk patients; and (5) the cardiovascular effects of selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors have been the subject of increasing attention.

### Clopidogrel kit [^116QyDkQ]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

7.1 CYP2C19 Inhibitors

Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Omeprazole or esomeprazole

Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel bisulfate with omeprazole or esomeprazole. In clinical studies, omeprazole was shown to reduce significantly the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel bisulfate when given concomitantly or 12 hours apart. A similar reduction in antiplatelet activity was observed with esomeprazole when given concomitantly with clopidogrel bisulfate. Dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole had less effect on the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel bisulfate than did omeprazole or esomeprazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

Coadministration of clopidogrel bisulfate and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

7.3 Warfarin (CYP2C9 Substrates)

Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) or INR in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, coadministration of clopidogrel bisulfate with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis.

However, at high concentrations in vitro, clopidogrel inhibits CYP2C9.

7.4 SSRIs and SNRIs

Since selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) affect platelet activation, the concomitant administration of SSRIs and SNRIs with clopidogrel may increase the risk of bleeding.

7.5 Repaglinide (CYP2C8 Substrates)

The acyl-β-glucuronide metabolite of clopidogrel is a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8. Clopidogrel can increase the systemic exposure to drugs that are primarily cleared by CYP2C8, thereby needing dose-adjustment and/or appropriate monitoring.

Concomitant administration of clopidogrel with repaglinide significantly increases systemic exposures to repaglinide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When concomitant use is required in a patient maintained on clopidogrel, initiate repaglinide at 0.5 mg with each meal and titrate based on blood glucose levels. Do not exceed a total daily dose of 4 mg. If concomitant use of clopidogrel is required in a patient stabilized on higher doses of repaglinide, down titrate the dose of repaglinide based on blood glucose levels to not exceed a total daily dose of 4 mg.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^113b1N7a]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Like the risk of gastrointestinal complications, the risk of cardiovascular complications can be affected by drug exposure. In a 2008 observational study, the risk of myocardial infarction was increased with higher doses and with exposure to slow-release formulations of NSAIDs, even after adjusting for the dose. Based on these and other safety findings, the American Heart Association recommends patients take the lowest effective dose of NSAIDs for the shortest duration of time.

The cardiovascular risk conferred by non-aspirin NSAIDs is likely associated with inhibition of COX-2–mediated production of PGI 2, which has a cardioprotective role in the circulatory system, promoting vasodilation, preventing platelet activation and cell adhesion, and counteracting the action of TxA 2, as well as several other stimuli. The antiplatelet effects of aspirin are mediated by irreversible inhibition of COX-1, resulting in profound and persistent reduction of TxA 2 production and TxA 2 -dependent platelet activation (for several days after aspirin administration). However, for most other traditional NSAIDs and coxibs, COX-1 inhibition is only transient and insufficient to translate into inhibition of atherothrombosis. The exception is naproxen, which has a long half-life and potently inhibits platelet COX-1 activity sufficiently to prevent platelet aggregation at high doses;, however, unlike aspirin, naproxen is a reversible inhibitor of COX-1 with variable effects across dosing intervals. Moreover, naproxen profoundly affects systemic PGI 2 biosynthesis, while aspirin (at a low dosage) has only a marginal effect on biosynthesis of PGI 2. Thus, as shown in the clinical data, naproxen is neutral with regard to cardiovascular risk, while aspirin is associated with a protective role.

### Age-specific risks, severity, time course, and outcome of bleeding on long-term antiplatelet treatment after vascular events: a population-based cohort study [^117CaecU]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Strengths of our study are its prospective population-based design with inclusion of all treated patients irrespective of age and frailty, long-term face-to-face follow-up, reliable ascertainment of bleeding events through multiple sources, and assessment of functional outcome, but there are some limitations. First, some analyses combined patients with cerebrovascular and coronary vascular events, although the early risk of bleeding might be higher after coronary events because of interventional strategies and greater use of dual antiplatelet therapy. However, the risk of bleeding and the association with age were similar when only bleeds occurring with single antiplatelet treatment were included. Second, although we had data for all prescribed medication of follow-up, and very few bleeds occurred secondary to prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids, we might have missed data for over-the-counter use of NSAIDs. Third, we found that non-major significant bleeding was unrelated to age, but older patients might be less likely to identify and report minor bleeding. However, any under-ascertainment of more minor bleeds at older ages would not alter our conclusions about the absolute risk of major bleeding. Fourth, we defined severity of bleeds using the CURE trial criteria, but no consensus exists about the optimal categorisation. Fifth, the estimated age-specific NNT for PPI use in prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeds was based on the assumptions that the efficacy of PPIs was the same for prevention of any bleed versus major bleed, was similar at different ages, and remained consistent with time. Sixth, our results focused mainly on aspirin-based antiplatelet treatment in secondary prevention because only a few of our patients were receiving long-term clopidogrel. However, the only previous large randomised trialof aspirin versus clopidogrel in secondary prevention of vascular events showed no significant difference in risk of major bleeding. Seventh, the predominant aspirin formulation in our cohort was 75 mg enteric coated, which will limit generalisability to countries in which other doses or formulations are common. Eighth, we did not attempt to estimate the number needed to harm in relation to potential adverse effects of long-term PPI use. In the absence of large randomised trials of long-term treatment, reliable estimation of any hazard is difficult (appendix p 39 lists detailed discussion for harms). Ninth, for the estimated net benefit of antiplatelet treatment, our estimates might have been conservative. We applied the reported two-times increased risk of major bleeding on aspirin in secondary prevention trials to all age groups and to all types of bleeding in our non-trial population. Finally, in our multivariable analyses of the association of age and major bleeding, we adjusted for known risk factors, but residual confounding cannot be excluded.

The 1.5%–1.9% of patients with CAD reported a prior reaction to aspirin, being gastrointestinal bleeding/intolerance the most frequent, followed by cutaneous symptoms, mainly manifested as urticaria/angioedema.
The frequency of HSRs to clopidogrel has been estimated at 1.6%, consisting mostly of a generalized exanthematous rash, which is a typical delayed reaction.
AHS is often overdiagnosed mainly because in many cases the diagnosis is made only on the basis of the clinical history.
Aspirin is rarely responsible for SNIUAA or SNIDHR. Therefore, STs and in vitro tests are not recommended in patients who report aspirin HSRs (Grade C).
NSAIDs may act as aggravating factors or cofactors in some HSRs to foods, which are often misdiagnosed as HSRs to NSAIDs
The DPT with aspirin plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of cross‐reactive types of NSAID hypersensitivity (Grade C).
LDAC is recommended in patients with CCS and in individuals at high risk of ASCVD with histories of HSRs to aspirin and/or other NSAIDs, excluding anaphylactic reactions and recent HSRs to aspirin at an antiplatelet dose (Grade C).
In STEMI patients with suspected or ascertained AHS, desensitization should be performed after PCI, and cangrelor or a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor should be used as a bridging strategy while the desensitization protocol is performed (Grade C).
In the management of patients with suspected or confirmed AHS and ACS‐NSTEMI, aspirin desensitization should be performed prior to coronary angiography, and intravenous APDs should be used only for bailout situations (Grade B).
PTs could be useful to evaluate patients reporting nonimmediate cutaneous reactions, particularly exanthemas associated with clopidogrel. Since IDTs are generally more sensitive than PTs, the use of IDTs should be recommended not only to identify the culprit drug but also to assess cross‐reactivity and find safe alternatives (Grade D).
DPT is the gold standard for diagnosing hypersensitivity to nonaspirin APDs in patients with mild/moderate reactions and negative STs and/or PTs (Grade D).
To secure safety and effectiveness of the desensitization to APDs, well‐established protocols should be followed (Grade C).
In patients with delayed cutaneous HSRs to clopidogrel, the use of a short course of oral glucocorticoids, without interrupting clopidogrel treatment, may be useful to manage their reactions (Grade D).
In patients reporting HSRs to thienopyridines, switching to an alternative thienopyridine is not recommended due to the risk of cross‐reactivity (Grade D).

### Risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in warfarin users… [^112kGzZf]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Odds ratios for the risk of hospitalization for upper GI hemorrhage while concomitantly using warfarin and celecoxib, rofecoxib, or nonselective NSAIDs were determined. Results. Conclusions Patients taking warfarin concomitantly with selective COX-2 inhibitors have an increased risk of hospitalization for upper GI hemorrhage. The risk appears similar to that of patients simultaneously taking warfarin and nonselective NSAIDs. NSAIDs leads to significant inhibition of COX-1–generated thromboxane A 2, impairing platelet aggregation, 6, 7 which may be further compounded by the concomitant use of warfarin. 8 Third, traditional NSAIDs can cause gastric erosion, thereby further increasing the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with warfarin.
9. among users of selective COX-2 inhibitors relative to users of nonselective NSAIDs.

10 While recent pharmacodynamic evidence suggests that at least 1 of the selective COX-2 inhibitors may slightly augment the pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin by increasing prothombin time, 14, 15 information on the clinical consequences of this combination of drug therapy is limited. 16 We conducted a population-based study of older adults to examine the association between the concomitant use of warfarin with these drugs and the risk of hospitalization for upper GI hemorrhage. The findings of this study suggest that increases in the risk of upper GI hemorrhage are similar in warfarin users concomitantly taking either nonselective NSAIDs or selective COX-2 inihibitors compared with patients not treated with these drugs. While the concomitant use of warfarin with NSAIDs is a recognized risk factor for GI hemorrhage, 4, 5 to our knowledge our study is the first to examine the comparative safety of the COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib in patients receiving warfarin.

Our findings suggest that the risk of upper GI hemorrhage is similarly heightened in warfarin users treated with either selective COX-2 inhibitors or nonselective NSAIDs. Given the observational nature of this study, our findings should be viewed as preliminary and require confirmation through well-designed clinical trials. Regardless, physicians and pharmacists who care for elderly patients taking warfarin should be aware of the potential risks of concomitant therapy with NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, particularly because the latter are among the fastest-growing class of prescription medications and have rapidly gained acceptance in clinical practice.

### Intracerebral hemorrhage following possible interaction between celecoxib and clopidogrel [^113LnTmH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of intracerebral hemorrhage following short-term, concomitant use of celecoxib and clopidogrel.

Case Summary

An 86-year-old white woman with a medical history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, heart failure, osteoarthritis, peptic ulcer disease, chronic airway limitation, and surgery for carcinoma of the bowel and breast began clopidogrel therapy following a syncopal episode. She also began taking celecoxib for osteoarthritis at the same time. Three weeks later, she presented with headaches and left hemiparesis. Computed tomography scan revealed intracerebral hemorrhage that had not been previously detected. Celecoxib and clopidogrel were discontinued, and she recovered fully.

Discussion

This is the first case describing a possible interaction between celecoxib and clopidogrel. A pharmacokinetic interaction mediated by CYP2C9 is possible. However, the hemorrhage may have been secondary to the effects of either drug alone or concomitant disease.

Conclusions

Celecoxib and clopidogrel have favorable risk profiles and, therefore, are prescribed widely among older people. However, clinicians should recognize that there may be an interaction between celecoxib and clopidogrel that increases the risk of hemorrhage in older people.

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (clopidogrel) [^1175yr4N]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Diminished Antiplatelet Activity in Patients with Impaired CYP2C19 Function

Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is achieved through an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [see Boxed Warning].

The metabolism of clopidogrel can also be impaired by drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, such as omeprazole or esomeprazole. Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole because both significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

5.2 General Risk of Bleeding

P2Y12 inhibitors (thienopyridines), including clopidogrel, increase the risk of bleeding.

P2Y12 inhibitors (thienopyridines), inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7 to 10 days). Because the half-life of clopidogrel's active metabolite is short, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.

Use of drugs that induce the activity of CYP2C19 would be expected to result in increased drug levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and might potentiate the bleeding risk. As a precaution, avoid concomitant use of strong CYP2C19 inducers [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Risk factors for bleeding include concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7)].

5.3 Discontinuation of Clopidogrel

Discontinuation of clopidogrel increases the risk of cardiovascular events. If clopidogrel must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for surgery with a major risk of bleeding), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with clopidogrel for five days prior to such surgery. Resume clopidogrel as soon as hemostasis is achieved.

5.4 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)

TTP, sometimes fatal, has been reported following use of clopidogrel, sometimes after a short exposure (< 2 weeks). TTP is a serious condition that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). It is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes [fragmented RBCs] seen on peripheral smear), neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Aspirin — high on-treatment platelet reactivity (aspirin resistance) — observational studies demonstrate that about one-third of patients treated with aspirin have less-than-expected inhibition of agonist-induced platelet aggregation with increased urinary thromboxane, and high platelet reactivity in patients prescribed aspirin has been consistently associated with a twofold to fourfold higher risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or death; estimates of prevalence are influenced by patient characteristics, concomitant therapies (particularly nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], eg, ibuprofen), the laboratory test used, the cutoff used to define high on-treatment reactivity, and patient compliance with aspirin therapy.

### Antiplatelet agents do not impact the hospital course in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding [^114oGnTD]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Use of antiplatelet agents (APAs) have been shown to increase the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding despite their cardiovascular benefits.

Aim

To understand the impact of APAs, we assessed the outcomes in patients admitted with acute GI bleeding to our hospital. We hypothesized there is no difference among GI bleeders admitted to the hospital while bleeding on or off APAs.

Methods

In an observational prospective cohort study, 104 sequential patients admitted with a diagnosis of GI bleeding were followed. Patients were classified as either on APA or not.

Results

Thirty of 104 (29%) patients were on long-term aspirin and/or clopidogrel on admission and 5 were taking nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, total of 35 (34%). There was no difference between patients using APA and those not using APA with regard to admission hemoglobin, age, presentation, source of bleed, total number of units transfused, intensive care unit admission rates, and overall length of stay. There was, however, a significant difference in the presence of hemodynamic compromise on initial presentation, with a higher proportion of APA users being orthostatic (51.4% vs 26% in nonusers, with P = 0.02, by Fisher exact test). Clopidogrel was safely restarted in high-risk patients with significant cardiac history.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that APA use did not significantly alter the course or outcome in GI bleeders admitted to our institution during their hospital stay.

### Adverse events associated with ERCP [^112UrbLK]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Periendoscopic antithrombotic management for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) — patients with coagulopathy or those started on anticoagulation within 3 days of ERCP have an increased risk of postprocedure bleeding. Use of aspirin or NSAIDs in the periprocedural period is safe, and current guidelines suggest that low doses of aspirin or NSAIDs may be continued safely in the periendoscopic period. For thienopyridines (ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel), it is recommended that these medications be discontinued at least 5 to 7 days before high-risk endoscopic procedures (eg, ERCP with sphincterotomy), with patients continued on or switched to aspirin monotherapy until the thienopyridine can be safely resumed.

### Managing adverse effects and drug-drug interactions of antiplatelet agents [^112Gn1u9]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Antiplatelet therapies have reduced the frequency of adverse events associated with plaque rupture in several clinical situations. These therapies include established antiplatelet agents (such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors) as well as new agents (such as prasugrel and ticagrelor). In this Review, we address the most important adverse events of antiplatelet therapy, including hemorrhage, hematologic reactions, and dyspnea. We discuss strategies to reduce the incidence of complications and outline potential methods to manage adverse reactions. Interactions between antiplatelet agents and other drugs — such as proton-pump inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, statins, warfarin, or NSAIDs — are also addressed, as well as specific issues relating to the use of antiplatelet therapies in elderly patients.

Figure 1
Algorithm for long-term NSAID therapy according to a patient's GI and CV risk factors.

In patients with high GI risk, testing for and eradicating H. pylori should be considered, but will be insufficient without ongoing gastroprotection. In these patients, if CV risk is low, a COX-2 selective inhibitor alone or ns-NSAID with a PPI appear to offer similar protection from upper GI events. However, according to recent evidence, only celecoxib will reduce mucosal harm throughout the entire (upper and lower) GI tract. This agent should be combined with a PPI in patients at very high risk of upper GI bleeding. When both GI and CV risks are high, the optimal strategy is to avoid NSAID therapy, if at all possible. If the NSAID therapy is deemed necessary, the therapeutic approach will depend on co-medication. If the patient is not on antiplatelet therapy (because, for instance, the benefits of primary prevention have been considered not to outweigh the risks), either naproxen or low-dose celecoxib could be considered, but should be combined with a PPI, while this COX-2 selective agent seems the most appropriate choice in patients on low-dose aspirin. It should be emphasized that the suggested algorithm should be viewed as a "general guidance", which needs to be tailored to the individual patient, taking into account co-morbidities and co-therapies.

### Prescription of and adherence to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and gastroprotective agents in at-risk gastrointestinal patients [^117Fnkmj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The development of adverse events is a well-known characteristic of NSAID therapy. The design and size of this study did not allow us to detect GI complications or determine whether poor adherence was associated with this serious adverse event. However, we were able to evaluate other patient-reported minor adverse events, which often are not recorded in databases, but are suspected to be the main reasons for stopping NSAID use. It should be noted that dyspepsia was the most commonly reported adverse event, and that patients who were non-adherent to GPA therapy had a significantly higher risk of this type of adverse event.

This study also investigated clinical determinants of poor adherence to either NSAID or GPA prescriptions. History of peptic ulcer disease and the presence of adverse events were predictors of poor adherence to NSAID prescriptions and seem related to the well-known GI risk associated with NSAIDs. Concomitant use of a non-aspirin antiplatelet agent was also associated with poor adherence to GPA prescriptions, and may be related to the current warning from regulatory agencies to take PPIs together with clopidogrel, although eventually this did not emerge as an independent factor. Frequent dosing (more than once daily) was a predictor of poor adherence to NSAID but not GPA prescriptions, which may be due to the fact that PPIs are taken once daily, while NSAIDs are taken several times per day. Short-term treatment (< 30 days) was a predictor of poor adherence for both therapies. The reason for this is unclear, because short-term NSAID treatment was the most frequent prescription type in our study. It is possible that patients who received longer periods of therapy suffered from more severe musculoskeletal diseases and pain, which would increase adherence during the relatively short period of observation (15 and 60 days); however, this characteristic was not recorded in our study.

### Clopidogrel bisulphate (clopidogrel) [^116gH1By]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

7.1 CYP2C19 Inhibitors

Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Omeprazole or esomeprazole

Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel bisulfate with omeprazole or esomeprazole. In clinical studies, omeprazole was shown to reduce significantly the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel bisulfate when given concomitantly or 12 hours apart. A similar reduction in antiplatelet activity was observed with esomeprazole when given concomitantly with clopidogrel bisulfate. Dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole had less effect on the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel bisulfate than did omeprazole or esomeprazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

Coadministration of clopidogrel bisulfate and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

7.3 Warfarin (CYP2C9 Substrates)

Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) or INR in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, coadministration of clopidogrel bisulfate with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis.

However, at high concentrations in vitr o, clopidogrel inhibits CYP2C9.

7.4 SSRIs and SNRIs

Since selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) affect platelet activation, the concomitant administration of SSRIs and SNRIs with clopidogrel may increase the risk of bleeding.

### Association of NSAID use with risk of bleeding and cardiovascular events in patients receiving antithrombotic therapy after myocardial infarction [^1115GtQB]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Antithrombotic treatment is indicated for use in patients after myocardial infarction (MI); however, concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could pose safety concerns.

Objective

To examine the risk of bleeding and cardiovascular events among patients with prior MI taking antithrombotic drugs and for whom NSAID therapy was then prescribed.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Using nationwide administrative registries in Denmark (2002–2011), we studied patients 30 years or older admitted with first-time MI and alive 30 days after discharge. Subsequent treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel, or oral anticoagulants and their combinations, as well as ongoing concomitant NSAID use, was determined.

Exposures

Use of NSAIDs with ongoing antithrombotic treatment after first-time MI.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Risk of bleeding (requiring hospitalization) or a composite cardiovascular outcome (cardiovascular death, nonfatal recurrent MI, and stroke) according to ongoing NSAID and antithrombotic therapy, calculated using adjusted time-dependent Cox regression models.

Results

We included 61,971 patients (mean age, 67.7 [SD, 13.6] years; 63% men); of these, 34% filled at least 1 NSAID prescription. The number of deaths during a median follow-up of 3.5 years was 18,105 (29.2%). A total of 5288 bleeding events (8.5%) and 18,568 cardiovascular events (30.0%) occurred. The crude incidence rates of bleeding (events per 100 person-years) were 4.2 (95% CI, 3.8–4.6) with concomitant NSAID treatment and 2.2 (95% CI, 2.1–2.3) without NSAID treatment, whereas the rates of cardiovascular events were 11.2 (95% CI, 10.5–11.9) and 8.3 (95% CI, 8.2–8.4). The multivariate-adjusted Cox regression analysis found increased risk of bleeding with NSAID treatment compared with no NSAID treatment (hazard ratio, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.81–2.26]), and the cardiovascular risk was also increased (hazard ratio, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.30–1.49]). An increased risk of bleeding and cardiovascular events was evident with concomitant use of NSAIDs, regardless of antithrombotic treatment, types of NSAIDs, or duration of use.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients receiving antithrombotic therapy after MI, the use of NSAIDs was associated with increased risk of bleeding and excess thrombotic events, even after short-term treatment. More research is needed to confirm these findings; however, physicians should exercise appropriate caution when prescribing NSAIDs for patients who have recently experienced MI.

### Nonvitamin K anticoagulants: risk of bleeding when interacting with other medications: a cohort study from Medicare [^116QBUGM]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Introduction

Patients on nonvitamin K antagonist (NVKA) are usually taking other drugs. Potential interaction may increase the gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding risk associated with NVKA.

Methods

Observational cohort study using Medicare data from 2017 to 2020. Participants receiving a NVKA were included. A concomitant overlapping period while on NVKA was assessed for nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), antiplatelets, glucocorticoids, aspirin and proton pump inhibitors (PPI). A logistic regression predicting either any bleeding or GI bleeding was conducted estimating the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results

A total of 102 531 people on NVKA with mean age 77 years (SD = 9.8) and 55% females (N = 56 671) were included. Previous history of GI bleeding occurred in 2 908 (2.8%) participants, concomitant exposure to PPI occurred in 38 713 (38%), SSRI in 16 487 (16%), clopidogrel in 15 795 (15.4%), NSAIDs in 13 715 (13.4%) and glucocorticoids in 13 715 (13.4%). Risk for any bleeding was shown for clopidogrel (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.44), prasugrel/ticagrelor (OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.58), glucocorticoids (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.34), and SSRIs (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.19). GI bleeding risk was shown for clopidogrel (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.34, 1.55), prasugrel/ticagrelor (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.20, 1.79), SSRIs (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.17) and glucocorticoids (OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.44). PPI use was correlated with both NSAID (r = 0.07, p ≤ 0.0001) and SSRI use (r = 0.09, p ≤ 0.0001).

Conclusion

NVKA concomitantly taken with antiplatelets, glucocorticoids, and SSRIs showed an increased risk for any bleeding and GI bleeding.

Discontinuation of clopidogrel increases the risk of cardiovascular events. If clopidogrel must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for surgery with a major risk of bleeding), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with clopidogrel for five days prior to such surgery. Resume clopidogrel as soon as hemostasis is achieved.

5.4 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)

TTP, sometimes fatal, has been reported following use of clopidogrel, sometimes after a short exposure (< 2 weeks). TTP is a serious condition that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). It is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes [fragmented RBCs] seen on peripheral smear), neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Medication Guide for Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

(See the end of this Medication Guide for a list of prescription NSAID medicines)

What is the most important information I should know about medicines called Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?

NSAID medicines may increase the chance of a heart attack or stroke that can lead to death. This chance increases:

with longer use of NSAID medicines
in people who have heart disease

NSAID medicines should never be used right before or after a heart surgery called a "coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)".

NSAID medicines can cause ulcers and bleeding in the stomach and intestines at any time during treatment. Ulcers and bleeding:

can happen without warning symptoms
may cause death

The chance of a person getting an ulcer or bleeding increases with:

taking medicines called "corticosteroids" and "anticoagulants"
longer use
smoking
drinking alcohol
older age
having poor health

NSAID medicines should only be used:

exactly as prescribed
at the lowest dose possible for your treatment
for the shortest time needed

What are Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?

### Clopidogrel bisulfate [^113EVUVW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Taking clopidogrel tablets with certain other medicines may increase your risk of bleeding.

Especially tell your doctor if you take:

aspirin, especially if you have had a stroke. Always talk to your doctor about whether you should take aspirin along with clopidogrel tablets to treat your condition.
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of NSAID medicines if you are not sure.
warfarin (Coumadin®, Jantoven®)
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of SSRI or SNRI medicines if you are not sure.
rifampin (used to treat severe infections)
other antiplatelet agents

Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your doctor or pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

How should I take clopidogrel tablets?

Take clopidogrel tablets exactly as your doctor tells you.
Do not change your dose or stop taking clopidogrel tablets without talking to your doctor first. Stopping clopidogrel tablets may increase your risk of heart attack or stroke.
Take clopidogrel tablets with aspirin as instructed by your doctor.
If you miss a dose, take clopidogrel tablets as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose. Take the next dose at your regular time. Do not take 2 doses of clopidogrel tablets at the same time unless your doctor tells you to.
If you take too much clopidogrel tablets, call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room right away.
Talk with your doctor about stopping your clopidogrel tablets before you have surgery. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking clopidogrel tablets at least 5 days before you have surgery to avoid excessive bleeding during surgery.

### Facts and controversies of aspirin and clopidogrel therapy [^115qUggf]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Because of the central role of platelets in mediating ischemic events, antiplatelet agents are critical components of atherothrombosis prevention. Given their robust safety and efficacy profiles, aspirin and clopidogrel are consistently recommended by evidence-based treatment guidelines. Despite these recommendations, controversies surrounding the appropriate application of aspirin and clopidogrel remain. Questions of appropriate dosing, length of therapy, and use of combination therapy are most pressing, and considerable debate exists regarding the variability of response to antiplatelet therapy, including the definition, measurement, and clinical relevance of responsiveness. This review discusses the facts and controversies surrounding the use of aspirin and clopidogrel. Overall, despite the existing controversies, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and/or clopidogrel remains a proven and essential therapeutic tool for safe and effective management of atherothrombotic risk in specific clinical settings.

### Clopidogrel with proton pump inhibitors: safe or not? [^111ZUvuE]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious complication associated with use of antiplatelet therapy, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are known to be beneficial in decreasing such risk. Several studies in the recent past have suggested concerns regarding interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs, presumably due to inhibition of clopidogrel activity and thus attenuation of its antiplatelet activity. A web-based literature and guidelines search was done using the keywords "clopidogrel", "omeprazole", "proton pump inhibitors" and "interaction". Of the available results, relevant studies (n = 11) were then systematically reviewed and summarized. The studies were categorized based on their retrospective or prospective nature. Most of the retrospective, observational studies suggested a link between the 2; however, recent prospective studies have shown no interaction, as well as a positive influence of PPIs in preventing the GI side effects of antiplatelet therapy. There is currently insufficient clinical evidence to suggest interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs and decision to add PPI therapy to clopidogrel should be guided by its clinical indications rather than as a routine prophylactic measure.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^116TDWTz]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Ulcer bleeding — prevention of recurrent bleeding and antiplatelet management are summarized as follows: Prevention of recurrent bleeding is directed by the etiology of the bleeding ulcer, and H. pylori should be eradicated if present and after cure is documented, no further therapy is needed. NSAIDs should be stopped; if they must be continued a low-dose of a COX-2-selective NSAID plus a PPI should be used. Patients with established cardiovascular disease who require aspirin or other antiplatelet agents should start proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and generally have antiplatelet therapy restarted as soon as possible after bleeding ceases (ideally within 1–3 days and certainly within 7 days). Those with idiopathic ulcers should receive long-term antiulcer therapy.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^113vm5uH]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs

Potential GI side effects of NSAID therapy are a concern for physicians. Traditionally, adverse upper-GI-tract effects have been the focus, but there is increasing recognition that lower-GI complications are also an important issue.–Infection with Helicobacter pylori is also relevant and may be more common in some populations.– H. pylori infection increases the risk of GI complications during NSAID therapy, and eradication of H. pylori prior to commencing long-term antiplatelet therapy is recommended to reduce GI risk.

Other risk factors for upper-GI-tract complications during NSAID therapy include older age (≥ 60 years), history of dyspepsia, concomitant use of corticosteroids and/or oral anticoagulants, and a history of peptic ulcer bleeding. In the last few decades, mortality rates in patients with NSAID-associated upper-GI bleed or perforation have increased. Serious GI complications necessitating emergency surgery or hospitalization can occur without prior symptoms. Approximately 60%–80% of arthritis patients hospitalized or requiring surgery for serious GI complications during NSAID therapy report no previous GI symptoms. This highlights the need for a proactive approach to risk management, given that lack of symptoms makes it difficult to intervene before GI events become life-threatening.

Patients were randomized to receive clopidogrel bisulfate or placebo, and were treated for up to one year. Patients also received aspirin and other standard therapies such as heparin. The use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors was not permitted for three days prior to randomization. Patients were randomized to receive clopidogrel or placebo, in combination with aspirin, for 28 days or until hospital discharge, whichever came first. The primary endpoints were death from any cause and the first occurrence of reinfarction, stroke or death. The patient population was 28% women and 58% age ≥ 60 years.

### A meta-analysis of complications attributed to anticoagulation among patients following cutaneous surgery [^114qv368]. Dermatologic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The frequency of postoperative bleeding and other complications in anticoagulated patients undergoing cutaneous surgery has not been firmly established and consensus on perioperative continuation of treatment is lacking.

Objective

The objective was to ascertain the risk of postoperative complications through meta-analysis of data pooled from previously published studies.

Methods

A PubMed search (1966–2005) was performed to identify controlled studies reporting bleeding and other complications among patients undergoing cutaneous surgery who were taking anticoagulant medications. Emphasis was placed on prescription anticoagulant medications (aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, clopidogrel) and over-the-counter herbal agents with anticoagulant properties.

Results

A total of six studies representing 1,373 patients met criteria for inclusion. Among patients taking aspirin or warfarin, 1.3 and 5.7% experienced a severe postoperative complication, respectively. Patients taking warfarin were nearly seven times as likely to have a moderate-to-severe complication compared to controls (OR, 6.69; 95% CI, 3.03–14.7), a statistically significant difference (p < .001). Patients taking aspirin or NSAIDs were more than twice as likely to have a moderate-to-severe complication compared to controls (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.97–4.13), a strong trend toward statistical significance (p = .06). There were no studies in the literature that examined the effects of combination anticoagulant therapy or the effect of herbal agents on postoperative risk of bleeding.

Conclusion

The results of this meta-analysis suggest that while low, the risk of bleeding among anticoagulated patients may be higher than baseline. Adequately powered prospective studies are required to more carefully delineate the risk of postoperative bleeding and other complications attributable to anticoagulation therapy. Particular emphasis should be placed on examining the effect of combination anticoagulant therapy as well as herbal agents with anticoagulant properties on risk of bleeding after cutaneous surgery.

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) [^111WP18y]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Combination use increases risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. (7.2)
Warfarin: Combination use increases risk of bleeding. (7.3)

7.1 CYP2C19 Inhibitors

Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of certain drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI)

Avoid concomitant use of Plavix with omeprazole or esomeprazole. In clinical studies, omeprazole was shown to reduce the antiplatelet activity of Plavix when given concomitantly or 12 hours apart. A higher dose regimen of clopidogrel concomitantly administered with omeprazole increases antiplatelet response; an appropriate dose regimen has not been established. A similar reduction in antiplatelet activity was observed with esomeprazole when given concomitantly with Plavix. Consider using another acid-reducing agent with minimal or no CYP2C19 inhibitory effect on the formation of clopidogrel active metabolite. Dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole had less effect on the antiplatelet activity of Plavix than did omeprazole or esomeprazole [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

Coadministration of Plavix and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

7.3 Warfarin (CYP2C9 Substrates)

Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) or INR in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, coadministration of Plavix with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis.

However, at high concentrations in vitr o, clopidogrel inhibits CYP2C9.

### Nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastroduodenal injury [^117NKjxN]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article reviews selected publications related to nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastroduodenal toxicity in recent years.

Recent Findings

This article provides a comprehensive review of the latest evidence on the epidemiology of NSAID-induced gastroduodenal injury, recommendations on optimal gastroprotective regimens among patients in need of NSAID, risk stratification approach by considering gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks, and negative interaction between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and clopidogrel.

Summary

Current evidence indicates that a PPI and a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective NSAID provides the best gastric protection. In light of potential cardiovascular hazard of NSAIDs, physicians should select an NSAID according to individual patients' cardiovascular risk (i.e., naproxen vs. a nonnaproxen NSAID). The choice of gastroprotective therapy depends on the number and nature of gastrointestinal risk factors. PPI co-therapy is recommended in patients with high gastrointestinal risk on aspirin. Whether there is any clinically important interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel remains uncertain.

ASIPP 2024 — procedural checklist for managing anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy during interventional techniques outlines patient evaluation of risk factors (age, diabetes, bleeding disorders, hypertension, obesity, low body weight, renal disease, low creatinine clearance) and identification of antithrombotic medications. Aspirin use is classified as "Primary Prophylaxis: Absence of established cardiovascular disease or risk factor" and "Secondary Prophylaxis: Presence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease", with the same primary/secondary categories listed for fish oil. The medication inventory includes antiplatelets (clopidogrel [Plavix], prasugrel [Effient], ticagrelor [Brilinta]); direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (dabigatran [Pradaxa], apixaban [Eliquis], rivaroxaban [Xarelto], edoxaban [Savaysa, Lixiana]); warfarin (Coumadin); identification of over-the-counter drugs influencing thrombolysis (garlic, vitamin E); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram [Celexa], fluoxetine [Prozac], escitalopram [Lexapro], paroxetine [Paxil], sertraline [Zoloft]); and NSAIDs. Subsequent steps include risk stratification and recommendations (low risk, moderate or intermediate risk, high risk), informed decision making, restarting of drugs, and postoperative monitoring.

### Safe prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis – an expert consensus addressing benefits as well as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^111M1t3E]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Putting the CV risk in OA patients into context, the incidence of the GI risk is higher than the CV risk, and COX-2 selective inhibitors have a lower GI risk than ns-NSAIDs. Taking all the available data from clinical trials, meta-analyses, and cohort studies into account, the overall CV risk is increased for both ns-NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors. For each COX-2 selective inhibitor, however, the reduction of complicated upper GI events was numerically greater than any increase in Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration events (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, or vascular death). There is no evidence of major differences between ns-NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors. Hitherto, there is no published RCT which has been specifically designed to compare CV risk between ns-NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors. Results of the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety versus Ibuprofen or Naproxen (PRECISION) study will provide important data on the comparative CV safety of celecoxib, ibuprofen, and naproxen. It is worthwhile mentioning that this trial, performed in a high CV risk population, is the first study specifically designed to assess the CV safety of anti-inflammatory drugs. Unfortunately, the trial has been delayed because of slow enrollment and full results are not expected until 2016.

Statement 9: COX-2 selective inhibitors do not interfere with the antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin. Level of Agreement: Strong Agreement (vote statement: a, 65.6%; b, 21.9%; c, 6.3%; d, 6.3%). Level of Evidence: A (vote grade: A, 77.4%; B, 16.1; C, 3.2%; D, 3.2%).

The benefits of low-dose aspirin use in secondary prevention clearly outweigh the risk. However, this is not the case for primary prevention, where recommendations for aspirin use should be individualized, taking into account the balance between benefits and risks, as well as individual patient values and preferences. Given that aspirin is a life-saving drug, discontinuing it or not adhering to the correct administration schedule enhances the risk of CV and cerebral events by more than three-fold. This risk was magnified by up to 90-fold in patients with intracoronary stents.

### Antiplatelet drug interactions [^117DCVJp]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Both laboratory studies in healthy volunteers and clinical studies have suggested adverse interactions between antiplatelet drugs and other commonly used medications. Interactions described include those between aspirin and ibuprofen, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the thienopyridine, clopidogrel, and drugs inhibiting CYP2C19, notably the proton pump inhibitors (PPI) omeprazole and esomeprazole. Other interactions between thienopyridines and CYP3A4/5 have also been reported for statins and calcium channel blockers. The ibuprofen/aspirin interaction is thought to be caused by ibuprofen blocking the access of aspirin to platelet cyclo-oxygenase. The thienopyridine interactions are caused by inhibition of microsomal enzymes that metabolize these pro-drugs to their active metabolites. We review the evidence for these interactions, assess their clinical importance and suggest strategies of how to deal with them in clinical practice. We conclude that ibuprofen is likely to interact with aspirin and reduce its anti-platelet action particularly in those patients who take ibuprofen chronically. This interaction is of greater relevance to those patients at high cardiovascular risk. A sensible strategy is to advise users of aspirin to avoid chronic ibuprofen or to ingest aspirin at least 2 h prior to ibuprofen. Clearly the use of NSAIDs that do not interact in this way is preferred. For the clopidogrel CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 interactions, there is good evidence that these interactions occur. However, there is less good evidence to support the clinical importance of these interactions. Again, a reasonable strategy is to avoid the chronic use of drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, notably PPIs, in subjects taking clopidogrel and use high dose H2 antagonists instead. Finally, anti-platelet agents probably interact with other drugs that affect platelet function such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and clinicians should probably judge patients taking such combination therapies as at high risk for bleeding.

### Safe prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis – an expert consensus addressing benefits as well as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^116rRHbj]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis of RCTs in rheumatologic conditions failed to show an increased CV risk associated with celecoxib compared to placebo, while a safety analysis from six RCTs, performed in patients with conditions other than arthritis, provided evidence of a differential CV risk as a function of celecoxib dose, regimen, and baseline CV risk. The risk appeared to be non-significant (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.6–2.0) for the 400 mg q.d. dose, intermediate for the 200 mg b.i.d. dose (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.1), and high for the 400 mg b.i.d. dose (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.5–6.1). The recent Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists meta-analysis also found a trend towards less risk with lower celecoxib doses. Indeed, the vascular effects of celecoxib 200 mg daily (the most widely used regimen) were statistically uncertain. In contrast to ns-NSAIDs, celecoxib does not impair the antiplatelet activity of low-dose aspirin, either alone or in combination with clopidogrel. This lack of interference with the antithrombotic action of antiplatelet drugs would make this COX-2 selective agent a suitable anti-inflammatory drug for patients receiving low-dose aspirin for CV or cerebrovascular prevention, despite the contrary opinion of the EMA. However, at the time when the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use issued its recommendations, much of the current evidence was not yet available. Although no specific data are available, the present recommendations should be valid for patients either on single or dual antiplatelet therapy.

### The David Y. graham lecture: use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in a COX-2 restricted environment [^111mYRto]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Recent evidence suggests that both cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors and nonselective NSAIDs, with the possible exception of naproxen, increase cardiovascular (CV) hazard. Clinicians should assess not only patients' GI risk but also their CV risk before prescribing these drugs. Patients with low CV risk can be managed according to their GI risk-low-risk patients (without risk factors) receive nonselective NSAIDs, medium risk patients (1–2 risk factors) receive COX-2 inhibitors or nonselective NSAIDs plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or misoprostol, whereas high-risk patients (multiple risk factors, previous ulcer complications, or concomitant anticoagulants) receive a COX-2 inhibitor plus a PPI or misoprostol. Among patients with high CV risk (e.g., prior cardiothrombotic events) who require NSAIDs, naproxen is preferred. These patients should receive a prophylactic PPI or misoprostol because the risk of ulcer bleeding is substantially increased with concomitant use of naproxen and low-dose aspirin. Substitution of clopidogrel for aspirin is not recommended in patients at risk for upper GI bleeding who require antiplatelet therapy. Patients with high GI and high CV risk should avoid NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. If antiinflammatory analgesics are required, the choice of therapy depends on the relative importance of GI and CV risks of individual patients. Combination of naproxen, low-dose aspirin, and a PPI or misoprostol is recommended if CV risk is the major concern (e.g., recent myocardial infarction). In contrast, combination of low-dose COX-2 inhibitor, low-dose aspirin, and a PPI or misoprostol is preferred if GI risk outweighs CV risk (e.g., recent ulcer bleeding and stable CV disease).

### Evidence-based management of anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113qecAZ]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) drug interactions — NSAIDs and antiplatelet agents: For nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), studies reported odds ratios (ORs) or risk ratios (RRs) from 1.9 (95% CI, 1.4–3.7) to 4.6 (95% CI, 3.3–6.5). COX-2–selective NSAIDs plus VKA showed variable bleeding outcomes, ranging from RR 1.4 (95% CI, 0.44–4.30) to OR 3.1 (95% CI, 1.4–6.7). Antiplatelet agents with VKA were associated with increased rates of bleeding, with estimates from OR 1.5 (95% CI, 1.05–2.2) to hazard ratio (HR) 3.1 (95% CI, 2.3–3.9), and aspirin plus clopidogrel plus VKA vs VKA alone was associated with HR 3.70 (95% CI, 2.89–4.76). Based on these risks, the guideline states, "we suggest avoiding concomitant treatment with NSAIDs, including COX-2-selective NSAIDs, and certain antibiotics (Grade 2C)" and "we suggest avoiding concomitant treatment with antiplatelet agents except in situations where benefit is known or is highly likely to be greater than harm (Grade 2C)".

For patients taking VKAs, we suggest avoiding concomitant treatment with antiplatelet agents except in situations where benefit is known or is highly likely to be greater than harm from bleeding, such as patients with mechanical valves, patients with acute coronary syndrome, or patients with recent coronary stents or bypass surgery (Grade 2C).

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^115w45pW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Antithrombotic and NSAID management after lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is summarized as follows: Non-aspirin NSAIDs increase incident and recurrent LGIB, with recurrence 77% among those continuing NSAIDs vs. 9% after discontinuation, and in 342 LGIB patients followed 19 months cumulative rebleeding was 17% without NSAIDs, 31% with current NSAIDs, and 47% on aspirin; multivariable analyses showed relative risk for NSAID use 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2–3.3), non-aspirin antiplatelets 1.8 (95% CI, 1.0–2.3), low-dose aspirin 1.3 (95% CI, 0.8–2.3), and higher risk with dual therapy (relative risk, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0–3.2), therefore non-aspirin NSAID use should be avoided in patients with a history of acute LGIB. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding has been reported more often than upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with antithrombotic regimens, including after percutaneous coronary intervention (74% vs. 26% of bleeds) and among US Veterans on composite antithrombotic therapy (70 vs 20/1,000 patient-years). For aspirin, after ulcer hemostasis rebleeding did not differ (10% vs. 5%) but 60-day all-cause mortality was lower with aspirin (1% vs. 13%), and a cohort study found a sixfold higher risk of death when aspirin was stopped; polypectomy data suggest similar bleeding with discontinuing vs. continuing aspirin. Accordingly, aspirin for secondary prophylaxis in established cardiovascular disease should not be discontinued in the setting of LGIB, whereas in patients without established cardiovascular disease aspirin for primary prophylaxis has little net benefit (0.07% absolute risk reduction per year) and should be avoided; decisions on other antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy require a multidisciplinary approach, and during the first 30 days after coronary stenting the risk of death and myocardial infarction is doubled with clopidogrel discontinuation. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is used as stated in the cited studies and context on the page.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding: an 86-year-old woman with peptic ulcer disease [^115X5oXg]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract is a common medical problem, with an incidence of 48 to 160 cases per 1000 adults per year and a mortality rate of 5% to 14%. The risk of gastrointestinal bleeding is increased with the use of antiplatelet medications including aspirin and clopidogrel, as well as warfarin or a combination of these medications. The recurrence rate for bleeding in patients who continue to take aspirin after an episode of peptic ulcer disease-related bleeding can reach up to 300 cases per 1000 person-years and varies by age, sex, and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Using the case of Ms S, an 86-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with an episode of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding, we address the management of patients who are receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy who present with gastrointestinal bleeding, including when to restart antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy, interventions to reduce the risk of bleeding recurrence, and the potential for drug interactions between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors.

Only a few studies have reported the risk of bleeding with continuation of antiplatelet drugs in patients undergoing ERCP and sphincterotomy. Using a nationwide database in Japan, Hamada et al reported that both sphincterotomy and balloon dilatation can be performed safely in patients taking aspirin. A small observational study reported 95 patients with uninterrupted antithrombotic therapy undergoing ERCP with minimal sphincterotomy and balloon dilation (aspirin plus clopidogrel in 55 patients, aspirin plus an anticoagulant in 45 patients, and triple therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel plus an anticoagulant in five patients). Among them, 14 received DOACs. The overall bleeding rate was 4%.

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine needle aspiration (FNA)

The risk of bleeding from EUS-FNA is around 1%. For EUS-FNA of pancreas cystic lesions, the rate of bleeding is up to 6%. In a prospective observational study, the bleeding rates with EUS-FNA were 0% (0/26), 33.3% (2/6) and 3.7% (7/90) in patients receiving aspirin/NSAIDs, LMWH and no drugs. There are no studies investigating the safety of EUS-FNA with continuation of non-aspirin antiplatelet drugs, warfarin or DOACs.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)

In a retrospective analysis of 990 patients undergoing PEG, the rates of bleeding were 3.6% and 2.7% with aspirin and clopidogrel, respectively. In another retrospective study of 450 patients, no post-PEG bleeding was observed in patients using anticoagulants including heparin and vitamin K antagonists. No studies exists on the safety of PEG in users of DOACs.

To date there is no convincing evidence that prophylactic endoscopic treatment can reduce the risk of bleeding in patients receiving antithrombotics. Pooled analyses from two separate meta-analyses have reported that prophylactic measures reduce the risk of post-polypectomy bleeding. However, it is uncertain whether the benefit can be extrapolated to patients receiving antithrombotics as all studies excluded patients receiving antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants.

### Clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors: influence of pharmacological interactions on clinical outcomes and mechanistic explanations [^113rdsBH]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2011). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is associated with a significant reduction in vascular ischemic events; however, gastrointestinal bleeding events are a major concern in high-risk and older patients. Clinical practice guidelines recommend combination therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and dual antiplatelet therapy to attenuate gastrointestinal bleeding risk. In addition, high on-treatment platelet reactivity has been associated with recurrent ischemic events. Whether or not the pharmacological interaction between clopidogrel and PPI, which results in diminished antiplatelet effect, adversely influences clinical efficacy is highly controversial and the subject of debate. Based on largely anecdotal post-hoc analyses, the U.S. Federal Drug Administration's and European Medicines Agency's recommendations discourage PPI use (particularly omeprazole) in patients treated with clopidogrel. However, many American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions experts do not support change in clinical practice guidelines recommendations without adequately powered, prospective, randomized clinical trial data.

Patients who have skin surgery may be taking medication that increases the likelihood of bleeding, such as clopidogrel, aspirin, warfarin, heparin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). All of these may increase the risk of perioperative and postoperative bleeding. This article examines the mechanism of action of clopidogrel, current practice, and evidence for or against continuing its use during skin surgery. The mechanisms of action of aspirin, warfarin, heparin and NSAIDS will also be briefly discussed.

### Proton pump inhibitors for gastroduodenal damage related to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin: twelve important questions for clinical practice [^117T6ige]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin are among the most commonly used medications worldwide. Their use is associated with significant gastroduodenal adverse effects, including dyspepsia, bleeding, ulcer formation, and perforation. Given their long-term use by millions of patients, there is a substantial impact at the population level of these complications. In this evidence-based review, we have endeavored to answer 12 commonly encountered questions in clinical practice that deal with the following: extent of the problem of NSAID/aspirin-induced gastroduodenal damage and its impact on public health; role of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the primary prevention, healing, and secondary prevention of NSAID/aspirin-induced gastroduodenal ulceration as assessed by using endoscopic end points; role of PPIs in the prevention of adverse clinical outcomes related to NSAID/aspirin use; whether PPIs are effective in NSAID-induced dyspepsia; comparison of PPI co-therapy with selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors for risk reduction of adverse clinical outcomes; role of PPIs in preventing rebleeding from aspirin ± clopidogrel therapy in high-risk patients; identifying high-risk patients who can benefit from PPI co-therapy; the role of other gastroprotective agents for prevention of NSAID/aspirin-induced gastroduodenal damage; and the cost-effectiveness of and limitations to the use of PPIs for prevention of gastroduodenal damage related to the use of NSAIDs or aspirin. We then summarized our recommendations on the use of PPIs for the clinical management of patients using NSAIDs or aspirin.

### Clopidogrel (Plavix) [^113vh2TJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Diminished Antiplatelet Activity in Patients with Impaired CYP2C19 Function

Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is achieved through an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [see Boxed Warning].

The metabolism of clopidogrel can also be impaired by drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, such as omeprazole or esomeprazole. Avoid concomitant use of Plavix with omeprazole or esomeprazole because both significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of Plavix [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2	 General Risk of Bleeding

P2Y12 inhibitors (thienopyridines), including Plavix, increase the risk of bleeding.

P2Y12 inhibitors (thienopyridines), inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7–10 days). Because the half-life of clopidogrel's active metabolite is short, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.

Use of drugs that induce the activity of CYP2C19 would be expected to result in increased drug levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and might potentiate the bleeding risk. As a precaution, avoid concomitant use of strong CYP2C19 inducers [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Risk factors for bleeding include concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7)].

5.3 Discontinuation of Plavix

Discontinuation of Plavix increases the risk of cardiovascular events. If Plavix must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for surgery with a major risk of bleeding), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with Plavix for five days prior to such surgery. Resume Plavix as soon as hemostasis is achieved.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^114DuB1s]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Interactions of NSAIDs with other drugs

NSAIDs are also differentiated by their potential for pharmacodynamic interactions with other drugs, such as aspirin, corticosteroids, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are often administered concomitantly for different reasons. Aspirin irreversibly acetylates the COX active site, preventing generation of TxA 2, a prothrombotic prostanoid involved in platelet activation and aggregation.NSAIDs characterized by a high affinity for platelet COX-1 (eg, ibuprofen, naproxen) may interfere with the antiplatelet effects of aspirin; in contrast, this effect has not been detected with NSAIDs having intermediate or high selectivity for COX-2.–Moreover, no interaction has been detected with low-dose paracetamol. Although further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the clinical relevance of these pharmacodynamic interactions, an analysis of the medical records of 7,107 patients with cardiovascular disease who received aspirin alone or aspirin plus an NSAID indicated that the risks of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related mortality were significantly higher for patients who received aspirin plus ibuprofen compared with those who received aspirin alone (P < 0.05), but not for patients who received aspirin plus diclofenac or aspirin plus any other NSAID (drugs not specified).

NSAID therapy in patients taking anticoagulant therapy with coumarins (vitamin K antagonists) should also be approached with caution. Coadministration of NSAIDs with coumarins may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding complications, particularly for naproxen. The increased risk of bleeding associated with concomitant use of NSAIDs and coumarins (eg, warfarin) results from displacement of the anticoagulant from plasma proteins by the NSAID, thereby increasing the plasma concentration of free coumarin and associated anticoagulant activity and bleeding risk.

### Prasterone and ibuprofen (prastera) [^112TBDvD]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal Effects-Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including ibuprofen tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1%of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4%of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients treated with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

### Clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin alone for the prevention of atherothrombotic events [^1135t3MA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

The study CHARISMA was published by Bhatt DL and colleagues in 2006 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the CHARISMA study, the trial question was: what is the effect of combination of clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with high-risk for atherothrombotic events? In the CHARISMA study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CHARISMA study, the population was: 15603 patients (4644 female, 10959 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with either clinically evident CVD or multiple risk factors for atherothrombotic events. The key exclusion criteria were receipt of oral antithrombotic medications or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs on a long-term basis, recent acute coronary syndrome, or requirement of clopidogrel after revascularization procedure. In the CHARISMA study, the interventions were: n = 7802 clopidogrel and aspirin (clopidogrel 75 mg/day and aspirin 75–162 mg/day) n = 7801 aspirin (aspirin 75–162 mg/day plus matching placebo). In the CHARISMA study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (6.8% vs. 7.3%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05). In the CHARISMA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalizations for ischemic events (16.7% vs. 17.9%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99) No significant difference in myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes, in patients with multiple risk factors (6.6% vs. 5.5%; RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.59). In the CHARISMA study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in severe bleeding (1.7% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.09; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.97–1.61). In the CHARISMA study, the conclusion was: in patients with either clinically evident CVD or multiple risk factors for atherothrombotic events, clopidogrel and aspirin were not superior to aspirin with respect to myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^115QyE5B]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Summary of the current evidence

Standard dose PPI therapy is advised for gastroprotection in all patients on anti-platelet therapy who are at increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (age > 65 years or concomitant use of corticosteroids or anticoagulants or history of PU). International Normalized Ratio monitoring is required when starting or stopping PPI therapy in vitamin K antagonist users. In patients receiving clopidogrel or vitamin K antagonists, choosing PPI lacking interference with the hepatic CYP450 enzymes might be preferred. No demonstrated interaction exists between PPIs and the novel oral anticoagulants.

Based on a documented efficacy, anti-platelet therapy (aspirin < 300 mg/daily, ticlopidine 100 mg/daily, clopidogrel 75 mg/daily) is widely used for both primary and secondary prevention of CV and cerebrovascular ischemic events. However, anti-platelet drugs may cause adverse GI events (gastroduodenal ulcerations/erosions, overt bleeding, occult bleeding, and – only seldom – a perforation), with a definite probability of death, particularly in the elderly. Therefore, gastroprotection is advised in those patients at increased GI risk during anti-platelet therapy. Increased risk factors include age above 65 years, concurrent use of steroid/anticoagulant therapy, or history of PU. Presence of relevant co-morbidities (heart failure, renal impairment, stroke, diabetes, on-going malignancy) and smoking are additional risk factors for both GI events and related mortality. Standard PPI-dose is the most effective gastroprotective therapy. Regrettably, PPI therapy is not effective in preventing bleeding lesions in either small intestine or colon induced by anti-platelet drugs, for which no protective strategies are today available.

### Impact of proton pump inhibitor treatment on gastrointestinal bleeding associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use among post-myocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics: nationwide study [^114HpEXf]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Antithrombotic, PPI, and NSAID treatment

We used claimed prescriptions of aspirin or clopidogrel to characterise patients as receiving either antithrombotic monotherapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) or dual therapy. We excluded post-myocardial infarction patients who received no antithrombotic (n = 15 353) or an oral anticoagulant only (n = 1440). We identified all claimed prescriptions for NSAIDs (ATC M01A, excluding glucosamine (M01AX05)). We categorised rofecoxib and celecoxib as cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective (COX 2) inhibitors; ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen as non-selective NSAIDs; and all other NSAIDs as "other" NSAIDs. The only NSAID available in Denmark without prescription is ibuprofen (since 2001). We categorised PPI treatment in one group (ATC A02BC); we also examined five individual PPIs — omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, esmoprazole, and rabeprazole.

We calculated exposure periods for NSAIDs and PPIs for each patient by estimating a daily dose after comparing the accumulated dose and the elapsed time from consecutive prescriptions for the drug under investigation. We determined ongoing exposure by dividing the number of tablets/capsules dispensed by the estimated average dosage. If only one prescription was registered for an individual, we used a standard dosage, defined as the minimal recommended dosage, to estimate the daily dose. We used information on increasing or decreasing dosage only to continuously assess whether tablets were available. We defined exposure as having occurred when patients had drug available and discontinuation as when they had no more drug available. Methods for determining dose and treatment duration have been described previously. For most patients, treatment regimens changed during the study period, so we treated NSAID and PPI use in the analysis as time varying exposures — that is, patients changed exposure group according to claimed prescriptions. Each patient's exposure group at inclusion defined baseline treatment, shown in the tablewith the covariante distributions (supplementary figure).

### Aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease: the association of aspirin dose and clopidogrel with thrombosis and bleeding [^112ttoSD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal aspirin dose for the prevention of cardiovascular events remains controversial.

Objective

To assess the incidence of and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes by investigator-determined aspirin dose in a primary prevention trial.

Design

Post hoc observational analyses of data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.

Setting

Outpatient.

Patients

15 595 patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors.

Intervention

Clopidogrel, 75 mg/d, or placebo, with aspirin, 75 to 162 mg/d, as selected by the investigators.

Measurements

Incidence of the composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death (efficacy end point), and incidence of severe or life-threatening bleeding (safety end point), at a median of 28 months (interquartile range, 23 to 31 months) of follow-up.

Results

Daily aspirin doses were categorized as less than 100 mg (75 or 81 mg) (n = 7180), 100 mg (n = 4961), and greater than 100 mg (150 or 162 mg) (n = 3454). The hazard of the primary efficacy end point was the same regardless of dose (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.80 to 1.13] for 100 mg vs. less than 100 mg, and 1.0 [CI, 0.85 to 1.18] for greater than 100 mg vs. less than 100 mg). The hazard of the primary safety end point also did not depend on dose (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.85 [CI, 0.57 to 1.26] for 100 mg vs. less than 100 mg and 1.05 [CI, 0.74 to 1.48] for greater than 100 mg vs. less than 100 mg). In patients also receiving clopidogrel, daily aspirin doses greater than 100 mg seemed to be non-statistically significantly associated with reduced efficacy (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.16 [CI, 0.93 to 1.44]) and increased harm (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.30 [CI, 0.83 to 2.04]).

Limitation

The analysis was post hoc, and aspirin use was not randomized or blinded.

Conclusion

Daily aspirin doses of 100 mg or greater were associated with no clear benefit in patients taking aspirin only and possibly with harm in patients taking clopidogrel. Daily doses of 75 to 81 mg may optimize efficacy and safety for patients requiring aspirin for long-term prevention, especially for those receiving dual antiplatelet therapy.

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (clopidogrel) [^1173BSRs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 CYP2C19 Inducers

Since clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of drugs that induce the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in increased drug levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel.

Rifampin strongly induces CYP2C19 resulting to both an increase level of clopidogrel active metabolite and platelet inhibition, which in particular might potentiate the risk of bleeding. As a precaution, avoid concomitant use of strong CYP2C19 inducers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 CYP2C19 Inhibitors

Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Omeprazole or Esomeprazole

Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole. In clinical studies, omeprazole was shown to reduce significantly the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel when given concomitantly or 12 hours apart. A similar reduction in antiplatelet activity was observed with esomeprazole when given concomitantly with clopidogrel. Dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole had less effect on the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel than did omeprazole or esomeprazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Opioids

As with other oral P2Y12inhibitors, coadministration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of clopidogrel, presumably because of slowed gastric emptying, resulting in reduced exposure to its metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Consider the use of a parenteral antiplatelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring coadministration of morphine or other opioid agonists.

7.4 Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

Coadministration of clopidogrel and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

7.5 Warfarin (CYP2C9 Substrates)

Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) or INR in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, coadministration of clopidogrel with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis.

However, at high concentrations in vitro, clopidogrel inhibits CYP2C9.

7.6 SSRIs and SNRIs

Since selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) affect platelet activation, the concomitant administration of SSRIs and SNRIs with clopidogrel may increase the risk of bleeding.

### Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) [^1124EnZN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs/Aspirin

In ROCKET AF, concomitant aspirin use (almost exclusively at a dose of 100 mg or less) during the double-blind phase was identified as an independent risk factor for major bleeding. NSAIDs are known to increase bleeding, and bleeding risk may be increased when NSAIDs are used concomitantly with XARELTO. Neither naproxen nor aspirin affected the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban (see Figure 3).

Clopidogrel

In two drug interaction studies where clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg daily maintenance dose) and XARELTO (15 mg single dose) were coadministered in healthy subjects, an increase in bleeding time to 45 minutes was observed in approximately 45% and 30% of subjects in these studies, respectively. The change in bleeding time was approximately twice the maximum increase seen with either drug alone. There was no change in the pharmacokinetics of either drug.

Drug-Disease Interactions with Drugs that Inhibit Cytochrome P450 3A Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems

In a pharmacokinetic trial, XARELTO was administered as a single dose in subjects with mild (CrCl = 50 to 79 mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (CrCl = 30 to 49 mL/min) receiving multiple doses of erythromycin (a combined P-gp and moderate CYP3A inhibitor). Compared to XARELTO administered alone in subjects with normal renal function (CrCl > 80 mL/min), subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment concomitantly receiving erythromycin reported a 76% and 99% increase in AUCinfand a 56% and 64% increase in Cmax, respectively. Similar trends in pharmacodynamic effects were also observed.

12.6 QT/QTc Prolongation

In a thorough QT study in healthy men and women aged 50 years and older, no QTc prolonging effects were observed for XARELTO (15 mg and 45 mg, single-dose).

Aspirin — efficacy and dose context in high-risk patients is summarized as follows: On the basis of > 100 randomized trials in high-risk patients, aspirin reduces vascular death by ∼15% and nonfatal vascular events by ∼30%. Complete or near-complete inhibition of platelet COX-1 can be achieved with low doses of aspirin (75–150 mg) given once daily, whereas 10- to 100-fold higher daily doses are required when the drug is used as an antiinflammatory agent rather than as an antiplatelet agent, and the benefit/risk profile of aspirin depends on dose because its GI toxicity is dose dependent.

### Safe prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis – an expert consensus addressing benefits as well as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^116i2YSu]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

COX-2 selective NSAIDs spare platelet COX-1 activity and do not affect platelet aggregation or bleeding time. Similarly, COX-2 selective inhibitors do not interfere with the anti-aggregant activity of low-dose aspirin both in healthy subjects and patients with coronary heart disease. Consistent with these results, in vitro studies on human platelets have shown that a low affinity for COX-1 and a high degree of COX-2 selectivity confers a low potential to block aspirin inhibition of platelet COX-1.

Taking all the above lines of evidence into account, COX-2 selective inhibitors should represent the anti-inflammatory drugs of choice for patients taking low-dose aspirin for CV or cerebrovascular prevention, provided the anti-inflammatory therapy is deemed necessary and cannot be avoided with alternative therapies. It should be emphasized, however, that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use stated - in 2005 - that " COX-2 inhibitors must not be used in patients with established ischemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease (stroke) ". Therefore, the benefits (i.e. lack of blunting of aspirin protection and the anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity) should be balanced against the possible CV risks, which ultimately depend on individual patients' clinical characteristics and co-medications.

- **Drug hypersensitivity reaction**: use caution in patients with hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines.
- **TTP**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as an increased incidence has been reported in patients receiving clopidogrel.

### NSAID-induced gastrointestinal and cardiovascular injury [^113arAxp]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent publications related to NSAID-induced adverse effects on the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems.

Recent Findings

This paper explores novel mechanisms of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal injury, highlights new composite endpoints evaluating adverse events of NSAIDs in the entire gastrointestinal tract, and combines published data to establish evidence-based guidance on the best use of NSAIDs to achieve optimal clinical outcomes whilst minimizing cardiovascular and gastrointestinal injuries.

Summary

NSAIDs can induce peptic ulcers via epithelial cell membrane disruption and the renin angiotensin system, independent of the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways, whereas mast cells and bile acid sensors may have a protective effect on NSAID-induced gastrointestinal damage. Patients with arthritis treated with a COX-2 inhibitor are less likely to develop upper and lower gastrointestinal complications than those who are treated with diclofenac plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). PPI therapy is recommended in patients receiving dual antiplatelet treatment but observational studies show that clopidogrel users taking PPIs have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Until further reliable controlled data are available, this potential, but currently unproven, clinical interaction can be minimized by widely separating the dosing of clopidogrel and PPI. Histamine-2 antagonists may be an alternative to PPI for the prevention of peptic ulcers in patients taking low-dose aspirin.

### Safe prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis – an expert consensus addressing benefits as well as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^114ttRNt]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

It is well established that low-dose aspirin exerts a life-saving antithrombotic effect, particularly in secondary prevention. However, a large cohort study and a meta-analysis of 35 RCTs, including 87,581 patients, have clearly shown that its use is associated with an increased risk of GI bleeding. This risk is further increased when aspirin is combined with clopidogrel or anticoagulants and appears to be independent of the formulation of aspirin used (e.g. buffered or enteric coated).

The well-known risk of upper GI events associated with the use of ns-NSAIDs is significantly enhanced by concomitant use of low-dose aspirin, a quite frequent clinical situation in older patients having both OA and CV co-morbidities. A large, hospital-based, case-control study, performed in Spain, found that adding low-dose aspirin to ns-NSAIDs, increased the risk of upper GI bleeding by more than two-fold. Similarly, a Canadian retrospective cohort study found a 62% increase in hazard ratio of hospitalization for GI events in patients taking these combinations, although the combination of celecoxib with low-dose aspirin was associated with a lower risk (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48–0.80) than the association of ns-NSAIDs plus low-dose aspirin.

When COX-2 selective inhibitors were examined as a class, conflicting results were reported by different studies. In the case of three epidemiological studies, one (a hospital-based, case-control) found a similar RR of upper GI bleeding when low-dose aspirin was combined with COX-2 selective inhibitors or ns-NSAIDs, while the others (nested case-control studies, performed in databases from the UK) observed an increased RR of upper GI complications when ns-NSAIDs or COX-2 selective agents were used together with an antiplatelet agent. However, in a meta-analysis of four RCTs including 17,276 patients, the RR for perforation, ulcer, and bleeding between the combination low-dose aspirin/COX-2 selective inhibitors and low-dose aspirin/ns-NSAIDs was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.62–0.95). However, these were post hoc analyses and not randomised comparisons, which suggest a possible bias by patient selection.

### Prasugrel hydrochloride (prasugrel) [^114L2g75]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 General Risk of Bleeding

Thienopyridines, including prasugrel, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in TRITON-TIMI 38, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Major (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin ≥ 5 g/dL, or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI Minor (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of ≥ 3 g/dL but < 5 g/dL), bleeding events were more common on prasugrel than on clopidogrel [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. The bleeding risk is highest initially, as shown in Figure 1 (events through 450 days; inset shows events through 7 days).

Figure 1: Non-CABG-Related TIMI Major or Minor Bleeding Events.

Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding.

Do not use prasugrel in patients with active bleeding, prior TIA or stroke [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4.1, 4.2)].

Other risk factors for bleeding are:

Age ≥ 75 years. Because of the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients ≥ 75 years of age, use of prasugrel is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1), USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.5), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3), and CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].
CABG or other surgical procedure [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].
Body weight < 60 kg. Consider a lower (5 mg) maintenance dose [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2), ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1), and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6)].
Propensity to bleed (e.g., recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, active peptic ulcer disease, severe hepatic impairment, or moderate to severe renal impairment) [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7, 8.8)].
Medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., oral anticoagulants, chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and fibrinolytic agents). Aspirin and heparin were commonly used in TRITON-TIMI 38 [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1, 7.2, 7.4) and CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].

### Management of patients with high gastrointestinal risk on antiplatelet therapy [^111WGdHg]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Increasing use of antiplatelet therapies is associated with increasing GI complications, such as ulceration and GI bleeding. Identification of high-risk patients and, in such patients, incorporation of strategies to reduce their GI risk would be clinically prudent. After assessment and treatment of H pylori in patients with prior ulcer or GI bleeding histories, further reduction in GI risk in other high-risk patients who require antiplatelet agents is primarily accomplished by prescribing drugs that when coadministered with antiplatelet agents protect against mucosal ulceration, primarily proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). However, observational studies indicate a higher cardiovascular event rate in patients taking PPIs along with clopidogrel and aspirin compared with that of patients undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy without PPIs. Whether concurrent use of a PPI with clopidogrel represents a safety concern or not is currently being evaluated by the US Food and Drug Administration. Until more specific regulatory guidance is available, current recommendations are that patients taking both PPIs and clopidogrel concurrently should probably continue to do so until more data become available.
