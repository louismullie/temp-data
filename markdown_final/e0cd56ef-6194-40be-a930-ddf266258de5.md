## Question

How early can preeclampsia and hellp start?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how early preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome can start in pregnancy, and what the earliest documented gestational ages are for each condition. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal diagnostic timing criteria for preeclampsia. Then, I should verify the typical gestational windows for HELLP syndrome and whether it ever occurs before 20 weeks. Next, I will examine the earliest reported cases and the contexts in which they occurred. After that, I should distinguish early-onset from extremely early or atypical presentations and consider mimics like TTP. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically useful answer with caveats and counseling points anchored to guidelines and high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic timing for preeclampsia. By contemporary definitions from ISSHP, NICE, and ACOG, preeclampsia is new-onset hypertension with proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks' gestation, and it may also present postpartum, which sets the canonical lower bound at 20 weeks for typical disease presentations [^113cChgi] [^116bACZ8].

> Wait, let me verify the earliest reported onset of preeclampsia. Although the formal definition requires onset at or after 20 weeks, there are rare atypical cases described before 20 weeks, often in the setting of underlying maternal disease such as antiphospholipid syndrome or fetal triploidy. For example, a well-documented case report describes HELLP syndrome at 15 weeks and 3 days, implying severe hypertensive disease physiology in that very early window, even though such presentations are exceptional and not encompassed by standard diagnostic criteria [^116cWZrd] [^114msuke].

> I need to check the typical timing of HELLP syndrome next. HELLP is generally a second- to third-trimester phenomenon, with most cases clustering between 28 and 36 weeks, and a substantial minority presenting in the first 48 hours postpartum; importantly, hypertension and proteinuria are absent in roughly 10–20% of cases, so HELLP can occasionally present without classic preeclampsia features, which complicates recognition [^115xCZYQ] [^112VGBPx] [^113h4ttZ].

> Hold on, I should verify how early HELLP has been documented. Beyond the 15+3-week case, systematic reviews and series document early-onset HELLP, including multiple cases before 28 weeks and some in the mid-second trimester. Notably, in antiphospholipid syndrome cohorts, HELLP has been reported as early as 18 weeks, reinforcing that while rare, HELLP can occur well before the usual third-trimester window when predisposing conditions are present [^112WkXGb] [^116Xtz8d].

> Let me consider the distinction between early-onset and extremely early disease. Clinically, early-onset preeclampsia and HELLP are typically defined by onset before 34 weeks, and these cases carry higher risks of maternal and neonatal morbidity. However, presentations before 20 weeks are considered atypical and mandate evaluation for underlying etiologies such as APS, molar pregnancy, or hereditary thrombotic microangiopathies that can mimic HELLP, because management and recurrence risk differ substantially [^113kQ5GP] [^1132p1cR] [^111xkz4k].

> I should double-check the practical clinical implications. For patients with prior early-onset preeclampsia or HELLP, first-trimester risk assessment is recommended to stratify recurrence risk and guide preventive strategies; in any current pregnancy, new-onset hypertension or end-organ dysfunction at or after 20 weeks warrants evaluation for preeclampsia with severe features, including HELLP, even if proteinuria is absent, and suspected HELLP should prompt urgent maternal stabilization and expeditious delivery planning once coagulopathy and severe hypertension are addressed [^115ciV3g] [^113cChgi] [^114T2PaT].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Typical preeclampsia begins at or after 20 weeks' gestation, but rare atypical cases have been reported before 20 weeks, often in the setting of underlying maternal disease. HELLP syndrome most often presents between 28 and 36 weeks or in the immediate postpartum period, yet documented cases extend down to 15+3 weeks, with credible clusters reported from 18 weeks onward in high-risk populations, so the practical answer is that while the earliest documented onsets are in the mid-to-late second trimester, exceptional presentations before 20 weeks do occur and require targeted evaluation for secondary causes [^113cChgi] [^116cWZrd] [^112WkXGb] [^116Xtz8d].

Preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome **most often begin after 20 weeks** [^113cChgi] of gestation, with HELLP typically presenting between 27 and 37 weeks [^112VGBPx]. Early-onset preeclampsia (before 34 weeks) and HELLP are less common but carry higher maternal and fetal risks [^113kQ5GP] [^114MiMkN]. HELLP can rarely occur before 20 weeks, usually with underlying disorders such as antiphospholipid syndrome or molar pregnancy [^116cWZrd] [^116Xtz8d]. Both can also present postpartum, most often within 48 hours but up to several days after delivery [^112VGBPx] [^113h4ttZ]. Early recognition and prompt management are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality [^113kQ5GP].

## Gestational age of onset for preeclampsia

Preeclampsia is **defined by new-onset hypertension** with proteinuria or other maternal organ dysfunction after 20 weeks' gestation [^113cChgi] [^112G3KYw]. It is classified by timing:

- **Early-onset preeclampsia**: onset before 34 weeks' gestation [^113kQ5GP]; associated with higher risks of maternal and fetal complications [^114iAxJ8].
- **Late-onset preeclampsia**: onset at or after 34 weeks' gestation [^113kQ5GP]; generally milder but still significant [^114iAxJ8].
- **Postpartum preeclampsia**: onset after delivery, typically within 48 hours but up to several weeks postpartum [^114msuke].

---

## Gestational age of onset for HELLP syndrome

HELLP syndrome — hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets — is a **severe manifestation of preeclampsia** [^113B6Wdf]. It usually presents in the **third trimester** (27–37 weeks) [^112VGBPx] but can occur earlier or postpartum [^112zBHqt]:

- **Antepartum HELLP**: Most cases occur before delivery, peaking between 27 and 37 weeks [^112VGBPx] [^115xCZYQ].
- **Postpartum HELLP**: Occurs in about 30% of cases, usually within 48 hours postpartum but up to several days later [^111TK9Um] [^112zBHqt].
- **Early-onset HELLP**: Rare before 20 weeks, typically associated with underlying conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome or molar pregnancy [^116cWZrd] [^116Xtz8d].

---

## Clinical implications of early onset

Early-onset preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome are associated with **significantly higher maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality** [^113kQ5GP] [^114MiMkN]. Maternal complications include severe hypertension, eclampsia, renal failure, liver hematoma, and coagulopathy [^115QGxVM]; fetal complications include growth restriction, prematurity, and neonatal death [^114iAxJ8]. Management often requires **prolonged hospitalization**, antenatal corticosteroids, and expedited delivery once maternal stabilization is achieved [^114T2PaT] [^1123PGAe].

## Gestational age of onset

| **Condition** | **Typical onset** | **Early-onset** | **Postpartum onset** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Preeclampsia | 20 weeks to term | < 34 weeks (early-onset) | Within 48 hours to several weeks postpartum |
| HELLP syndrome | 27–37 weeks | < 20 weeks (rare) | Within 48 hours to several days postpartum |

---

Preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome **most often begin after 20 weeks** [^113cChgi], with HELLP typically arising between 27 and 37 weeks [^112VGBPx]. Early-onset disease is less common but carries higher risks, and both can present postpartum [^116bACZ8].

### Cost-effectiveness of recurrence risk guided care versus care as usual in women who suffered from early-onset preeclampsia including HELLP syndrome in their previous pregnancy (the preCare study) [^114jjQXB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

A randomised controlled trial design is usually preferred over any other design. However, for this study such a design was not considered applicable. A before-after study was chosen (instead of a fully prospective, randomised study) because of the risk of care as usual being contaminated with the regular monitoring and intensive monitoring protocols. Because current care as usual is not standardised, and blinding of the participating gynaecologists with respect to predictive factors for recurrent disease is practically unfeasible, a randomised design could reduce the contrast between study arms and thereby threaten the validity of the results.

As the care provided to women assigned to regular monitoring is less intense, a possible consequence may be that the detection of clinical signs of preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome is somewhat later than in the current care as usual approach. However, we do not expect this to lead to adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, because the prediction model suggests that the recurrence rate in this group is low (< 1%) whereas there is also increased alertness for early signs of pregnancy complications in women with a history of preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome.

In summary, the PreCare study is designed to provide information on whether recurrence risk guided care is a worthwhile strategy compared to current care for pregnant women who suffered from preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome during their previous pregnancy.

### Risk factors for chronic hypertension 5 years after a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Eb6YB]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Gestational age at birth

Seven studies evaluated gestational age at birth as a potential risk factor. Among these, four studies reported an increased risk of chronic hypertension in women who delivered less than 37 weeks gestational age compared to those who delivered more than 37 weeks gestational age. Conversely, three other studies did not observe an altered risk of chronic hypertension, whereas one study found a significantly lower gestational age at birth in women who developed chronic hypertension, although the calculated hazard ratio was not significantly different from 1. Hence, it remains inconclusive whether preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestational age, is significantly associated with an elevated risk of chronic hypertension later in life.

Preeclampsia, eclampsia, and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet syndrome

Two studies investigated severe preeclampsia and/or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet syndrome (HELLP) as a risk factor for chronic hypertension. The first study defined severe preeclampsia as having SBP more than 160 mmHg, DPB greater than 110 mmHg, proteinuria greater than 5 g/24 h, or the presence of cerebral disturbances or pulmonary edema, or presence of HELLP syndrome or eclampsia, and found that severe preeclampsia was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing chronic hypertension later in life compared to mild preeclampsia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR) 3.61, 95% CI 3.43–3.80].

Another study observed no difference in hypertension at follow-up between women with preeclampsia with and without HELLP syndrome. Finally, women with eclampsia tend to exhibit a lower incidence of chronic hypertension (6%) than preeclamptic women without eclampsia (38%), but this was not statistically significant. Additionally, in women with eclampsia, a lower gestational age at diagnosis (< 31 weeks) was associated with an increased risk of chronic hypertension compared to those diagnosed at 37–41 weeks gestational age (17.9 vs. 4.8%). In conclusion, the relationship between severe preeclampsia and chronic hypertension is inconclusive, with studies showing mixed results regarding the association with HELLP and eclampsia.

### Severe HELLP syndrome masquerading as thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura: a case report [^111CFDKq]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) occurring in the postpartum period may be difficult to manage. They present as the combination of mechanical hemolytic anemia and consumption thrombocytopenia due to endothelial dysfunction. The cause of this endothelial aggression can be multiple: thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura (TTP), HELLP syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, atypical hemolytic and uremic syndrome or acute fatty liver of pregnancy. TTP results from a severe deficiency of ADAMTS13, which is a protease cleaving specifically von Willebrand factor chiefly produced by liver cells. There are two main causes, the production of anti-ADAMTS13 auto-antibodies and, more rarely, a genetic deficiency in ADAMTS13. First-line treatment is based on plasma exchange. HELLP syndrome occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy usually in association with preeclampsia and represents a form of TMA characterized by damage to the sinusoidal capillaries of the liver. Prompt delivery is the main treatment. We present a case illustrating the challenges in discriminating between different postpartum TMAs, with a focus on the distinction between TTP and HELLP syndrome. Specifically, we highlight how acute liver failure (ALF) stemming from HELLP may lead to TTP with a spectacular response to plasma exchanges.

Case

A 28-year-old, 33 + 4 weeks pregnant woman presented with severe preeclampsia complicated by ALF in the setting of partial liver necrosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and acute kidney injury. Greatly diminished levels of ADAMTS13 (< 5%) activity and neurological impairment suggested an initial diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was initiated and complete renal, neurological, hematological and hepatic recovery was observed. Secondary TTP induced by ALF due to HELLP syndrome was the final diagnosis.

Conclusion

Our case addresses the overlapping nature of postpartum TMAs and raises the possibility that HELLP-induced ALF may constitute an additional mechanism resulting in TTP, thereby opening a possible indication for TPE.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^111akAT7]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

The National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy has defined four categories of hypertension in pregnancy: chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. A maternal blood pressure measurement of 140/90 mm Hg or greater on two occasions before 20 weeks of gestation indicates chronic hypertension. Pharmacologic treatment is needed to prevent maternal end-organ damage from severely elevated blood pressure (150 to 180/100 to 110 mm Hg); treatment of mild to moderate chronic hypertension does not improve neonatal outcomes or prevent superimposed preeclampsia. Gestational hypertension is a provisional diagnosis for women with new-onset, nonproteinuric hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation; many of these women are eventually diagnosed with preeclampsia or chronic hypertension. Preeclampsia is the development of new-onset hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Adverse pregnancy outcomes related to severe preeclampsia are caused primarily by the need for preterm delivery. HELLP (i.e., hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome is a form of severe preeclampsia with high rates of neonatal and maternal morbidity. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice to prevent and treat eclampsia. The use of magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis in women with mild preeclampsia is controversial because of the low incidence of seizures in this population.

### Cost-effectiveness of recurrence risk guided care versus care as usual in women who suffered from early-onset preeclampsia including HELLP syndrome in their previous pregnancy (the preCare study) [^114xbHDV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

The health care problem

Although preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome are considered diseases of the first pregnancy, the risk of developing recurrent preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome is increased among parous women with preeclampsia and/or HELLP syndrome in their previous pregnancy. Sep et al. conducted a literature search in order to identify prediction tests for recurrent disease. The recurrence rates reported vary from none to 31 percent for preeclampsia and from 3 percent to 7 percent for HELLP syndrome. Fortunately, the majority of women with a history of preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome have uncomplicated subsequent pregnancies.

To the best of our knowledge there is at this moment no consensus about the management of pregnant women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome.

As a result, follow-up and counselling of these patients varies per centre, gynaecologist and patient, and is largely based on the perceived risk by the responsible care provider of recurrence of the disease in the next pregnancy and the level of anxiety of the patient and its resulting demand for care. Formerly preeclamptic patients are often subjected to various medical screening programmes to detect associated disorders, followed by additional exams by other specialists or the initiation of some management (postpartum evaluation). During a next pregnancy, care varies from regular surveillance by the gynaecologist to intensive surveillance and counselling in order to identify the onset of adverse pregnancy course as early as possible.

Development of prediction model

Although earlier studies have identified individual predictive factors for recurrent preeclampsia, a combination of variables for the prediction of recurrent preeclampsia has not been explored until recently. A simple prepregnant prediction rule which includes several predictive factors was developed by Sep et al. Unfortunately, patient data were collected from a single hospital and the number of included patients was limited (n = 186).

We developed a prediction model to estimate the individual recurrence risk of recurrence of early-onset preeclampsia and/or the HELLP syndrome. We used data of 407 women with early-onset preeclampsia and/or the HELLP syndrome in their first pregnancy, who had undergone subsequent postpartum screening and who had a recorded consecutive ongoing pregnancy for which maternal and neonatal outcomes were available. Data were collected from four university hospitals (Maastricht University Medical Centre, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam and University Medical Centre St. Radboud Nijmegen), and one tertiary referral hospital (Máxima Medical Centre Veldhoven).

Predictors of recurrent disease were preselected based on availability in the five different hospitals, previous literature and gynaecologists' expert opinion. Fasting circulating level of glucose measured at postpartum screening, gestational age at delivery of the first pregnancy, prior small-for-gestational-age newborn, chronic hypertension and maternal BMI before the second pregnancy proved to be the predictors within a logistic regression model (van Kuijk SMJ, Nijdam ME, Janssen KJ, Sep SJ, Peeters LL, Delahaije DHJ, Spaanderman ME, Bruinse HW, Franx A, van Rijn BB, Bots ML, Langenveld J, van der Post AM, Smits LJ: A preconceptional prediction model for recurrent early-onset preeclampsia and the HELLP syndrome, unpublished).

Since a model tends to perform best in the derivation sample, called 'overfitting', we used bootstrapping techniques to internally validate the model. A shrinkage factor was computed to shrink the regression coefficients in order to get a more conservative risk estimate.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^1145iFzc]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States and include chronic and gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome, eclampsia, and chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. For patients with chronic hypertension, oral antihypertensive therapy should be initiated or titrated at a blood pressure threshold of 140/90 mm Hg or greater. Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features can be managed with blood pressure monitoring, laboratory testing for disease progression, antenatal testing for fetal well-being, and delivery at 37 weeks' gestation. The use of antihypertensive drugs to control nonsevere hypertension in the setting of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia does not improve outcomes and is not recommended. Antihypertensive therapy should be initiated expeditiously for acute-onset severe hypertension to prevent hemorrhagic stroke. Preeclampsia with severe features requires immediate stabilization and inpatient treatment with magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis and antenatal corticosteroids (if preterm). Patients in the preterm period should receive antenatal corticosteroids without delaying delivery to complete courses. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy can worsen or initially present after delivery and account for up to 44% of pregnancy-related deaths in the first six days postpartum. Patients should be monitored closely in the early postpartum period. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are linked to poor long-term maternal and fetal outcomes, including increased maternal lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. Daily low-dose aspirin therapy starting at 12 to 16 weeks' gestation is safe and effective for reducing the risk of preeclampsia for patients with risk factors.

### Multicenter prospective clinical study to evaluate the prediction of short-term outcome in pregnant women with suspected preeclampsia (PROGNOSIS): study protocol [^112PF2bS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Methods/Design

Objectives

Primary study objectives

The primary objectives are:
To demonstrate that low ratios of sFlt-1/PlGF predict absence of preeclampsia/eclampsia/HELLP syndrome for 1 week after the baseline visit ("rule-out").
To demonstrate that high ratios of sFlt-1/PlGF predict diagnosis of preeclampsia/eclampsia/HELLP syndrome within 4 weeks after the baseline visit ("rule-in").

Cutoff-based algorithms will be developed as prediction models for each of these short-term outcomes using the serum sFlt-1/PlGF ratio. Should gestational age enhance the prediction performance, it will also be included.

### Maternal and perinatal outcome of women with early-onset severe pre-eclampsia before 28 weeks: is expectant management beneficial in a low-resource country? A prospective observational study [^111Nhsrs]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To study the maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with severe pre-eclampsia before 28weeks of pregnancy.

Methods

A descriptive study from a tertiary care center. All consecutive women with severe pre-eclampsia withonset before 28weeks of pregnancy were included. The details were collected in a predesigned structured proforma prospectively.

Results

The study cohort included 145 women with a mean maternal age of 26.97 ± 5.36years (range 19–47years). The mean duration of prolongation of pregnancy was 13.04 ± 10.57days (range 1–51days). A total of 29.7% (n = 43) of women had at least one major adverse maternal outcome, and the most common was HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome (n = 24,16.6%), followed by eclampsia (n = 12,8.3%). The stillbirth rate was high (n = 103,68.7%), and most occurred in the antepartum period. Of 47 (31.3%) neonates born alive, only eight (17.02%;8/47) survived up to 28days of life. Fetal growth restriction with Doppler abnormalities and neonatal sepsis were the most common reasons for perinatal mortality.

Conclusion

Expectant management should not be considered routinely when the onset of severe pre-eclampsia is before 25 +6 weeks of pregnancy. Between 26 and 27 +6 weeks it can be offered under close monitoring and the perinatal survival depends on the neonatal services available in their facility.

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111CyEZn]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Preeclampsia and eclampsia, including preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension — preeclampsia is a multiorgan system inflammatory syndrome characterized by hypertension with proteinuria or target organ dysfunction, and develops in 20% to 50% of individuals with chronic hypertension (superimposed preeclampsia). In preeclampsia, severe features or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) are associated with increased maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality. Eclampsia, the occurrence of convulsive seizures, is one of the most severe forms, and both preeclampsia and eclampsia can occur before, during, or after delivery; magnesium sulfate in addition to antihypertensive medications are the mainstay of treatment. Low-dose aspirin is the only routinely recommended intervention that has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and its sequelae when taken from 12 weeks of gestation in pregnant people at moderate and greater risk; pravastatin has been investigated in small studies but larger prospective studies are needed to confirm safety and efficacy.

### Implementation of first-trimester screening and prevention of preeclampsia: a stepped wedge cluster-randomized trial in Asia [^114iAxJ8]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy-specific multisystem hypertensive disorder that affects 2% to 5% of all pregnant women worldwide. In Asia, it has been reported that the incidence of preeclampsia is approximately 2%. It is the second leading cause of maternal mortality (14%), accounting for approximately 63 000 maternal deaths annually worldwide. Preeclampsia can be classified into early, preterm, late, and term preeclampsia based on the gestational age at delivery: < 34, < 37, ≥ 34, and ≥ 37 weeks of gestation, respectively. These classifications are essential because of the varying adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with each category. – Evidence has consistently shown that early or preterm preeclampsia is associated with an increased risk of severe pregnancy complications, including fetal growth restriction; low birth weight; preterm birth; placental abruption; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome; and stillbirth, compared to late or term preeclampsia. – Given the severity of the disorder, it is important to provide effective early screening and prevention for preterm preeclampsia.

### Morbidities and mortality in patients with hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^115SR1Zb]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

The frequencies of diagnosis and death emphasize the sex disparities among adults with hTTP. More women (117) than men (85) were diagnosed with hTTP. The difference occurred at age 20 to 39 years and was caused by the frequent diagnosis of hTTP during pregnancy. Excluding the 34 women who were diagnosed during pregnancy, the number of women (83) and men (85) diagnosed with hTTP and the ages at which they were diagnosed were similar (Figure 1). This observation suggests that many men and nulliparous women with hTTP are not diagnosed.

Among reported deaths in patients age 30 years or older, there are more men (7) than women (1). Our survival analysis also suggested that there are fewer deaths among older women (Figure 3B). This survival disparity may also be related to pregnancy. Women may have died during pregnancy with unrecognized hTTP. Death during pregnancy may be attributed to other causes that are much more common such as severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. Misdiagnosis may occur because both the clinical and pathologic features of severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome are similar to hTTP. Although the clinical features are similar, hTTP may occur earlier during gestation than severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. The gestational age at death of 3 women who died during pregnancy was 20, 23, and 28 weeks when preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome rarely occur. Another possible reason for fewer deaths in women older than age 30 years may be that subsequent management of women who are diagnosed and effectively treated during pregnancy could prevent subsequent deaths.

### Severe preeclampsia with and without HELLP differ with regard to placental pathology [^114a6Lbv]. Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the histopathology in placentas from patients with severe preeclampsia with and without hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome. An additional aim was to compare the prevalence of infants born small for gestational age in the 2 groups. The study is retrospective and includes 178 women who have been diagnosed at the Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge or at the Free University Medical Center between 2000 and 2005 with severe preeclampsia. A total of 96 women had severe preeclampsia without signs of HELLP (preeclampsia group), whereas 82 fulfilled the criteria for having HELLP syndrome (HELLP group). Infarction (P = 0.014), intervillous thrombosis (P < 0.001), and abruption (P = 0.002) were more common in the preeclampsia group than in the HELLP group. There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of accelerated villous maturation (P = 0.61), decidual arteriopathy (P = 0.27), or chorioamnionitis (P = 0.61). Furthermore, there was a higher mean placental weight, adjusted for gestational age, in the Swedish HELLP material than in the preeclampsia group (P < 0.001). Finally, mothers in the preeclampsia group gave birth significantly more often to small for gestational age babies than mothers suffering from HELLP syndrome (P < 0.001). The histopathologic profile and the range of placental lesions were partly different in the preeclampsia and HELLP patients. Considering the central role that placenta seems to have in preeclampsia, the present result might suggest that different underlying pathogenetic mechanisms and courses can be in play in patients with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome.

### The value of first trimester inflammatory indices in predicting the development of preeclampsia in the third trimester [^114nmHiW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, Özkan et al. (2024) also investigated these indices in a case-control study on HELLP syndrome, a severe variant of preeclampsia, in Türkiye. They found significantly elevated values for SII, SIRI, and AISI in patients with HELLP compared to controls. While our study excluded HELLP cases, the stark elevation in these markers in severe hypertensive states underscores the severity-dependent nature of systemic inflammation in pregnancy complications and supports the pathophysiological basis for using such indices.

In summary, the literature consistently demonstrates a link between elevated inflammatory markers and preeclampsia, particularly in its severe forms and later stages of pregnancy. Our study contributes to this body of knowledge by highlighting the potential for suppressed inflammatory activity in early pregnancy among women who develop preeclampsia. These findings underscore the importance of longitudinal studies to capture the dynamic changes in inflammatory markers throughout gestation and their implications for early diagnosis and management of preeclampsia.

This study has several limitations. First, its retrospective design may introduce selection and information biases. Second, although patients with known inflammatory or chronic conditions were excluded, subclinical inflammation could not be ruled out. Third, the study did not stratify patients into early- and late-onset preeclampsia, which may represent distinct clinical entities. Lastly, the predictive power of the evaluated indices was limited in multivariate and ROC analyses, suggesting that these markers should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical factors.

### Pre-eclampsia and risk of dementia later in life: nationwide cohort study [^114KuSkz]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Pre-eclampsia (exposure)

We considered a woman to have pre-eclampsia in a given pregnancy if she was registered with pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, or the HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome in the National Patient Register (ICD-8 codes 637.03, 637.04, 637.09, 637.19, 637.99, 762.19, 762.29, 762.39; ICD-10 codes O14.0-O15.9) after 20 weeks' gestation. We considered it unlikely that women with pre-eclampsia, the more severe forms in particular, would be registered with a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia early in pregnancy without also having confirmatory diagnoses registered around the time of delivery. Consequently, to be conservative and to improve the probability that women registered as having pre-eclampsia truly had pre-eclampsia, we also required that at least one diagnosis of pre-eclampsia be registered in the period from one month before delivery to seven days postpartum; we did not consider women whose only pre-eclampsia diagnoses were registered outside this period to have had pre-eclampsia. We treated history of pre-eclampsia as a time dependent variable, such that a woman could contribute person time in more than one exposure category during follow-up. However, once a woman had pre-eclampsia, she could not revert to the unexposed category; we assigned all subsequent person time to the "history of pre-eclampsia" category, even if she later had normotensive pregnancies.

In sub-analyses, we further categorised pre-eclampsia on the basis of gestational age at delivery, a proxy for timing of onset and severity of pre-eclampsia. We defined preterm pre-eclampsia as pre-eclampsia with delivery before 37 weeks' gestation and term pre-eclampsia as pre-eclampsia with delivery at or after 37 weeks' gestation.

### A prediction model for hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets syndrome in pre-eclampsia with severe features [^113177fW]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Pre‐eclampsia (PE) complicates 2%–8% of pregnancies, and approximately a third of them develop severe features. The hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome occurs in approximately seven per 1000 pregnancies and about 20% among patients with PE with severe features. While previous studies have recognized that HELLP syndrome is a complication of PE, several studies have shown that patients with severe PE who also developed HELLP syndrome experienced higher rates of maternal and neonatal complications compared to those with severe PE alone. Therefore, it is highly important for clinicians to be able to identify those patients with PE with severe features who are at higher risk to develop HELLP syndrome.

Previous studies have identified risk factors for HELLP syndrome in the general obstetric population. However, those studies did not specifically focus on patients with PE and severe features and, hence, there is lack of data regarding risk factors for developing HELLP syndrome among this highly selected population.

Thus, the aim of the current study was to identify risk factors for HELLP syndrome among patients diagnosed with PE with severe features and design a useful prediction score model.

Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome

Although the idea is controversial, some propose that HELLP is a severe form of preeclampsia. Others believe that it is an entity of is own. HELLP syndrome is defined by the presence of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia. It occurs in 0.17–0.85% of all pregnancies, more frequently in older multiparous Caucasian women (> 34 years). Seventy percent of cases are diagnosed antepartum, most frequently between the 27 th and 37 th week of gestation. The other 30% are diagnosed after delivery. Of these, 90% had preeclampsia during pregnancy. Approximately 5–10% of women with severe preeclampsia develop HELLP. The pathogenesis seems to be similar to preeclampsia, with generalized endothelial and microvascular injury resulting in microangiopathic anemia, periportal hepatic necrosis and thrombocytopenia.

Most of the patients complain of headache, nausea and vomiting, visual disorders and epigastric pain, and physical examination reveals pain in the right upper abdominal quadrant, weight gain and generalized edema. Early laboratory findings include hemolysis, characterized by high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (> 600 IU/L) with decreased haptoglobin values, non-conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated aminotransferases and thrombocytopenia.

The Mississippi Classification was developed to categorize the severity of HELLP syndrome (Table 3). If the platelet count is lower than 50,000/mm³, an association with disseminated intravascular coagulation can occur. The lack of an increase in platelet levels 96 h from delivery indicates a worse prognosis with possible evolution to multiple organ failure. PT and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) are normal in the early stages. As a consequence of secondary fibrinolysis and platelet aggregation, levels of fibrin products, d-dimers and thrombin–antithrombin complexes may be high. Some patients have renal involvement.

The following constitutes key background information on eclampsia:

- **Definition**: Eclampsia is the presence of new-onset grand mal seizures in women with preeclampsia.
- **Pathophysiology**: Eclampsia is caused by preeclampsia.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of eclampsia include hypertension, proteinuria, generalized edema, and convulsions with headache, RUQ epigastric pain, and visual changes either antepartum, intrapartum, or postpartum. Eclampsia is associated with increased maternal complications, including HELLP syndrome, abruptio placentae, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, aspiration pneumonia, cardiopulmonary arrest, liver hematoma, and respiratory distress syndrome.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Eclampsia is associated with a mortality rate ranging from 0–1.8% in developed countries and 14% in developing countries.

HELLP syndrome

HELLP syndrome was first described by Weinstein and constitutes an important and severe sub-section of pre-eclampsia.HELLP syndrome occurs in 10%–20% of women with severe pre-eclampsia, but can also develop in women without pre-eclampsia. Overall incidence is up to 0.9% of pregnancies. Risk factors are advanced maternal age, nulliparity, multiple pregnancy and previous pre-eclampsia or HELLP syndrome.

Diagnosis

HELLP syndrome usually presents between 28 and 36 weeks of gestation but may develop in the first week post partum. Patients may be asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms including right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, and malaise. Hypertension and proteinuria are present in up to 85% of cases.

Diagnostic criteria for HELLP syndrome, such as the Tennessee and Mississippi criteria (table 4), include the triad of haemolysis, thrombocytopaenia and deranged LFTs. When the triad is not fulfilled, it is termed incomplete HELLP or ELLP syndrome. There is typically a moderate increase in aminotransferases and a mild elevation in unconjugated bilirubin (table 2). Other features include an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), schistocytosis on peripheral smear and an elevated uric acid.PT can be raised in severe liver injury or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The elevation of aminotransferases is much greater in HELLP syndrome than in pre-eclampsia. Elevation of aminotransferases, rising LDH and uric acid in severe pre-eclampsia might indicate progression to HELLP syndrome which is important to recognise because of the potentially life-threatening nature of this syndrome. Liver biopsy is not indicated for diagnosis of HELLP syndrome and would be hazardous because of the risk of bleeding.

Other differential diagnoses to consider include haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and AFLP.

### The HELLP syndrome: clinical issues and management. A review [^112VGBPx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Occurrence and clinical symptoms

The HELLP syndrome occurs in about 0.5 to 0.9% of all pregnancies and in 10 to 20% of cases with severe preeclampsia. In about 70% of the cases, the HELLP syndrome develops before delivery with a peak frequency between the 27th and 37th gestational weeks; 10% occur before the 27th week, and 20% beyond the 37th gestational week. The mean age of pregnant women with HELLP syndrome is usually higher than in women with preeclampsia. Most white women with HELLP are multiparous. In the post-partum period the HELLP syndrome usually develops within the first 48 hours in women who have had proteinuria and hypertension prior to delivery. Although variable, the onset of the HELLP syndrome is usually rapid. The majority of women with the HELLP syndrome have had hypertension and proteinuria, which may be absent in 10–20% of the cases. Excessive weight gain and generalized oedema precede the syndrome in more than 50% of the cases.

Typical clinical symptoms are right upper abdominal quadrant or epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting. The upper abdominal pain may be fluctuating, colic-like. Many patients report a history of malaise some days before presentation. Up to 30–60% of women have headache; about 20% visual symptoms. However, women with a HELLP syndrome might also have unspecific symptoms or subtle signs of preeclampsia or non-specific viral syndrome-like symptoms. The symptoms usually continuously progress and their intensity often changes spontaneously. The HELLP syndrome is characterized by exacerbation during the night and recovery during the day.

Women with partial HELLP syndrome have fewer symptoms and develop less complications than those with the complete form. However, a partial or incomplete HELLP syndrome may develop to a complete form of the disorder. Partial or total reversal of the syndrome may also occasionally occur, albeit rarely.

For GDM, the exposure window was limited to vaccinations that occurred between the last menstrual period and 22 weeks of gestation to predate the timing of universal GDM screening and diagnosis, which typically occurs at 24–28 weeks of gestation. A propensity score was constructed for receiving COVID-19 vaccine during this timeframe. We compared individuals who received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose during pregnancy with unexposed persons and evaluated the association between COVID-19 vaccine and GDM using a Poisson model with robust variance.

For gestational hypertension and preeclampsia–eclampsia–HELLP syndrome, analyses were limited to comparing individuals who received a COVID-19 vaccine before 20 weeks of gestation compared with women unexposed during the entire pregnancy. We limited vaccine exposures for the HDP outcomes to those that occurred before 20 weeks of gestation to ensure that vaccination happened before diagnosis, which must occur at or after 20 weeks of gestation. Propensity scores were constructed for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine from last menstrual period to 20 weeks of gestation for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia–eclampsia–HELLP syndrome. We evaluated the associations among COVID-19 vaccine and these outcomes using a Poisson model with robust variance.

### The HELLP syndrome: clinical issues and management. A review [^111RHwxD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The HELLP syndrome is a serious complication in pregnancy characterized by haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count occurring in 0.5 to 0.9% of all pregnancies and in 10–20% of cases with severe preeclampsia. The present review highlights occurrence, diagnosis, complications, surveillance, corticosteroid treatment, mode of delivery and risk of recurrence.

Methods

Clinical reports and reviews published between 2000 and 2008 were screened using Pub Med and Cochrane databases.

Results and Conclusion

About 70% of the cases develop before delivery, the majority between the 27th and 37th gestational weeks; the remainder within 48 hours after delivery. The HELLP syndrome may be complete or incomplete. In the Tennessee Classification System diagnostic criteria for HELLP are haemolysis with increased LDH (> 600 U/L), AST (≥ 70 U/L), and platelets < 100 × 10⁹/L. The Mississippi Triple-class HELLP System further classifies the disorder by the nadir platelet counts. The syndrome is a progressive condition and serious complications are frequent. Conservative treatment (≥ 48 hours) is controversial but may be considered in selected cases < 34 weeks' gestation. Delivery is indicated if the HELLP syndrome occurs after the 34th gestational week or the foetal and/or maternal conditions deteriorate. Vaginal delivery is preferable. If the cervix is unfavourable, it is reasonable to induce cervical ripening and then labour. In gestational ages between 24 and 34 weeks most authors prefer a single course of corticosteroid therapy for foetal lung maturation, either 2 doses of 12 mg betamethasone 24 hours apart or 6 mg or dexamethasone 12 hours apart before delivery. Standard corticosteroid treatment is, however, of uncertain clinical value in the maternal HELLP syndrome. High-dose treatment and repeated doses should be avoided for fear of long-term adverse effects on the foetal brain. Before 34 weeks' gestation, delivery should be performed if the maternal condition worsens or signs of intrauterine foetal distress occur. Blood pressure should be kept below 155/105 mmHg. Close surveillance of the mother should be continued for at least 48 hours after delivery.

The HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver blood tests and low platelets) is a serious complication in pregnancy characterized by haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count occurring in 0.5 to 0.9% of all pregnancies and in 10–20% of cases with severe preeclampsia. Hepatic capsular rupture is a rare yet dramatic complication of HELLP syndrome. The majority of cases occur in multiparous women over the age of 30. Classically it presents with acute onset right upper quadrant pain in the presence of constitutional symptoms such as vomiting and pyrexia. However, symptoms and signs are usually non specific. Spontaneous hepatic rupture can be preceded by signs of hypovolaemic shock; yet the diagnosis is infrequently made prior to emergent laparotomy. We present the case of a 35 year old nulliparous woman with a second trimester gestational hepatic rupture associated with HELLP syndrome. We briefly discuss the aetiology, diagnostic difficulties and treatment options associated with this rare presentation.

### Hypertensive pregnancy disorder, an under-recognized women specific risk factor for heart failure? [^113g9Q9q]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) including pregnancy‐induced hypertension, preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count), occur in almost 10% of gestations and are a major cause of maternal death. Preeclampsia, a multi‐organ pregnancy disorder characterized by endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and multi‐organ hypoperfusion, occurs in 3–4% of gestations in the Western world. Any HDP is a marker of future CV disease (CVD) risk including cerebral vascular accidents, cardiac atherosclerotic event, atrial fibrillation, heart failure and cardiac death with a dose effect risk resulting in the highest risk being present in early‐ and preterm‐ preeclampsia. Conventional risk factors for heart failure include hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction, obesity, atrial fibrillation, and renal disease, all of which are highly present after HDP. Worse profiles in CV risk continue as early as 1 year postpartum after preeclampsia including higher levels of blood pressure (BP), low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, markers of insulin resistance and body mass index (BMI). Hypertension after preeclampsia explained 64% of the increased risk of CAD and 49% of the increased risk of heart failure in these women.

Screening

There is general agreement that women who suffered from HDP should undergo CV screening starting as early as possible to make women aware of their increased CV risk and allow appropriate prevention. Although the exact modality of screening and protocol of intervention has not been standardized, mainly due to limited available evidence‐based clinical research on antenatal and postnatal care, recent evidence suggests a potential role for early BP control with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors. Whether this will result in improved reverse remodelling and prevention of heart failure is subject for future research. Established and cost‐effective prevention strategies should be implemented in regular clinical care.

### The HELLP syndrome: clinical issues and management. A review [^113BFpov]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

It has been known for a long time that preeclampsia may be associated with haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia. Weinstein regarded signs and symptoms to constitute an entity separated from severe preeclampsia and in 1982 named the condition HELLP (H = Haemolysis, EL = Elevated Liver enzymes, LP = Low Platelets) syndrome. The HELLP is currently regarded as a variant of severe preeclampsia or a complication.

Diagnosis of the complete form of the HELLP syndrome requires the presence of all 3 major components, while partial or incomplete HELLP syndrome consists of only 1 or 2 elements of the triad (H or EL or LP).

The HELLP syndrome, a serious condition in its complete form, is associated with substantial risk for the mother and her foetus. A wide range of complications may arise and the condition represents diagnostic and therapeutic problems; timing and method of delivery are important.

The aim of this review is to present an update on maternal clinical issues of the syndrome, with special focus on diagnosis, complications, surveillance, timing and mode of delivery and risk of recurrence. Perinatal mortality and morbidity are briefly outlined and controversial aspects of corticosteroid (CS) treatment are particularly discussed.

Periviable birth — maternal health considerations and cesarean risks: Preterm birth is frequently associated with fetal malpresentation, making the choice of cesarean delivery a common issue; earlier cesarean delivery is associated with a higher likelihood of a vertical uterine incision (classical hysterotomy), which has more frequent perioperative morbidities than low transverse cesarean delivery and leads to recommendations for repeat cesarean delivery, and periviable cesarean delivery is associated with increased risk of uterine rupture in a subsequent pregnancy; beyond procedure-related risks, maternal morbidity and mortality may also arise from decisions not to intervene, such as expectant management after preterm premature rupture of membranes causing maternal infection or severe preeclampsia progressing to hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, underscoring the need to weigh risks in the context of parents' goals of care, potential for newborn survival with immediate delivery, likelihood of latency to improve newborn outcomes, and the possibility of severe adverse maternal outcomes with attempted pregnancy prolongation.

### The HELLP syndrome: clinical issues and management. A review [^116LoUPg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Kandler et al. reported that in the time span between 6 and 72 months (median 24 months) after delivery, 90% of children born from mothers with HELLP showed normal development or only minor disabilities. The mean gestational age was 33 weeks and the mean birth weight 1671 g. However, the neonatal outcome is poor before 25 weeks' gestation or with birth weights less than 700 g; after 26 weeks' gestation or in infants weighing more than 700 g it is substantially better.

We assume that differences in the outcome of the neonates depend on the study publication and also reflect the level of neonatal care. Infants born from mothers with the HELLP syndrome may develop thrombocytopenia and associated CP. However, it seems that a low gestational age at delivery is the main problem rather then HELLP in itself. Most neonates born from a woman with HELLP have a normal long-term development.

Management of pregnant women with HELLP syndrome

In general, there are three major options for the management of women with severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. These include:

1) Immediate delivery which is the primary choice at 34 weeks' gestation or later.

2) Delivery within 48 hours after evaluation, stabilization of the maternal clinical condition and CS treatment. At 27 to 34 weeks of gestation, this option appears appropriate and rational for the majority of cases.

3) Expectant (conservative) management for more than 48–72 hours may be considered in pregnant women before 27 weeks' gestation. In this situation, CS treatment is often used, but the regimens vary considerably.

Background

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, affecting approximately 3%–5% of pregnancies worldwide. Among these disorders, preeclampsia can progress to severe complications, including HELLP syndrome, a life-threatening condition characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet counts. HELLP syndrome occurs in 0.5% to 0.9% of all pregnancies and accounts for 10% to 20% of severe preeclampsia cases. It can be life-threatening, with reported maternal mortality rates as high as 24%. The clinical presentation of HELLP syndrome is complex and variable, often manifesting rapidly with right upper quadrant pain, hypertension, proteinuria, general malaise, nausea, and vomiting. However, in some cases, the onset is insidious, with hypertension and proteinuria absent in up to 15% of patients. These atypical presentations contribute to a high misdiagnosis rate, making early identification and intervention challenging.

Preeclampsia and eclampsia — including superimposed preeclampsia — clinical features and prevention/treatment: Preeclampsia, a multiorgan system inflammatory syndrome, is an HDP characterized by hypertension plus proteinuria or target organ dysfunction, and it develops in 20% to 50% of individuals with chronic hypertension (termed superimposed preeclampsia). Severe features or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome are associated with increased maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality. Eclampsia is the occurrence of convulsive seizures, and both preeclampsia and eclampsia can occur before, during, or after delivery; magnesium sulfate in addition to antihypertensive medications are the mainstay of treatment. Low-dose aspirin is the only routinely recommended intervention shown to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and its sequelae when taken from 12 weeks of gestation in pregnant people at moderate and greater risk, while pravastatin has been investigated only in small studies and larger prospective studies are needed to confirm safety and efficacy.

### Fatal outcome in a pregnant woman with HELLP syndrome and dengue [^114qwf6C]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome is a rare complication consisting of pregnancy-induced hypertension, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia. Dengue, caused by an arbovirus, manifests with fever, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhagic symptoms. We report a 26-year-old primigravida at 29 weeks of gestation from northern Peru with preeclampsia. During hospitalization, she developed fever, thrombocytopenia, and was diagnosed with severe dengue by a positive nonstructural protein 1 antigen test. Her condition worsened because of preeclampsia with signs of severity. She was admitted to the intensive care unit, and she did undergo a cesarean section. On the seventh day, she developed HELLP syndrome and multiple organ failure, culminating in her death on the ninth day. In endemic areas, it is important to consider clinical scenarios where the simultaneous manifestation of hypertensive disease and dengue may occur in the pregnant population, as timely diagnosis and appropriate management of both diseases are key to improve clinical outcomes.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116bACZ8]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Hypertension in pregnancy — definitions and diagnostic thresholds are specified as follows: Normotension requires no hypertension before pregnancy with systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 90 mm Hg. Chronic hypertension is defined by a hypertension diagnosis before pregnancy or SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and must be diagnosed before 20 wk of gestation. Gestational hypertension occurs with no hypertension before pregnancy; SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, sustained on 2 measurements at least 4 h apart; and is diagnosed ≥ 20 wk of gestation. Preeclampsia consists of gestational hypertension plus proteinuria or evidence of other organ dysfunction (thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, pulmonary edema, or severe headache or visual symptoms), is diagnosed ≥ 20 wk of gestation, and may occur postpartum. Mild to moderate hypertension is SBP 140–159 mm Hg or DBP 90–109 mm Hg, sustained on 2 measurements at least 4 h apart. Severe hypertension is SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg, sustained on 2 measurements 15 min apart. Superimposed preeclampsia is preeclampsia in a patient with a history of hypertension before pregnancy or before 20 wk of gestation and may occur postpartum. HELLP syndrome is a severe form of preeclampsia with evidence of hemolysis and associated elevations in liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia, may have atypical presentation without hypertension or proteinuria, and may occur postpartum. Eclampsia is a severe form of preeclampsia with generalized seizures and encephalopathy, may have atypical presentation without preceding hypertension, and may occur postpartum.

Background

The disease

Preeclampsia is defined as de novo development of hypertension (> 140/90 mmHg) in combination with proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation in pregnant women. One of the most severe forms of this disease is called the HELLP syndrome, which is derived from the acronyms of the symptoms (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets).

Preeclampsia (also termed early-onset preeclampsia) and HELLP syndrome may be life-threatening for both mother and child. In the mother, these disorders predispose to premature cardiovascular disorders such as chronic hypertension, ischemic heart disease and stroke later in life. Studies in children, born after preeclamptic pregnancies and who were relatively small at birth, have shown an increased risk of stroke in adult life, an increased risk of coronary heart disease and metabolic syndrome. Preeclampsia and especially HELLP syndrome are perceived by patients and their partners as a highly traumatic life event, both during and after pregnancy.

In the United States and Europe, the prevalence of clinically relevant preeclampsia is approximately 2% of all pregnancies, with HELLP syndrome complicating preeclampsia approximately in 10 to 20% of the cases. Maternal mortality rate in the Netherlands due to hypertensive disease during pregnancy amounts to 4.0 per 100,000 live births in 1993–2002.

Although several risk factors have been identified, it is difficult to develop effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of these disorders. Strategies applied nowadays are diverse and include antenatal surveillance, modification of lifestyle, dietary interventions and pharmacological therapy. In the last two decades, clinical guidelines for the management of preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome have been adopted in most developed countries.

Clinical management of preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome depends on the gestational age at onset, severity of symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, size and condition of the unborn infant, disease progression and response to symptomatic treatment.

Mild preeclampsia is usually managed expectantly, as opposed to the management of severe preeclampsia which is more pro-active consisting of the administration or magnesium sulphate, often combined with antihypertensives. When gestational age is less than 34 weeks and both maternal and fetal condition are satisfactory, it is usually recommended to prolong pregnancy for at least 48 hours to benefit optimally from the enhancing effect of corticosteroid administration on fetal lung maturation. Fetal surveillance is an important component of the management. Delivery is the only causal treatment and therefore, the management of choice from 37 weeks' gestation onward.

### Platelet count and indices as postpartum hemorrhage risk factors: a retrospective cohort study [^117FgkJL]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. The World Health Organization defines PPH as > 500 mL of blood loss and severe PPH (SPPH) as > 1000 ml. In the Netherlands, 4%–6% of pregnancies are complicated by SPPH, and this percentage has increased in high income countries over the past decade.

Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count of < 150 × 10⁹/L. In nonpregnant populations, thrombocytopenia is a well‐known risk factor for bleeding, particularly in the lower ranges of the platelet count (< 10–50 × 10⁹/L). It is the second most common hematologic anomaly in pregnant women, occurring in 7%–12% of pregnancies. Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy can have multiple causes. Approximately 75% is due to gestational thrombocytopenia, 20% to preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, and 3%–5% to other causes. Preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome, and HELLP syndrome severity, are established risk factors for PPH.

### Comparison of adverse maternal outcomes between early-and late-onset superimposed preeclampsia [^116o4qFX]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Superimposed preeclampsia (SIPE), defined as preeclampsia in individuals with chronic hypertension, is one of the most common complications, accounting for 13 to 40% of pregnancies with chronic hypertension. However, there are limited data regarding maternal outcomes of early- and late-onset SIPE in individuals with chronic hypertension. We hypothesized that early-onset SIPE was associated with increased odds of adverse maternal outcomes compared with late-onset SIPE. Therefore, we aimed to compare adverse maternal outcomes between individuals with early-onset SIPE and those with late-onset SIPE.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study of pregnant individuals with SIPE who delivered at 22 weeks' gestation or greater at an academic institution. Early-onset SIPE was defined as the onset of SIPE before 34 weeks' gestation. Late-onset SIPE was defined as the onset of SIPE at or after 34 weeks' gestation. Our primary outcome was a composite of eclampsia, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, maternal death, placental abruption, pulmonary edema, SIPE with severe features, and thromboembolic disease. Maternal outcomes were compared between early- and late-onset SIPE. We used simple and multivariate logistic regression models to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Results

Of 311 individuals, 157 (50.5%) had early-onset SIPE, 154 (49.5%) had late-onset SIPE. There were significant differences in the proportions of obstetric complications, including the primary outcome, HELLP syndrome, SIPE with severe features, fetal growth restriction (FGR), and cesarean delivery between early- and late-onset SIPE. Compared with individuals with late-onset SIPE, those with early-onset SIPE had increased odds of the primary outcome (aOR: 3.28; 95% CI: 1.42–7.59), SIPE with severe features (aOR: 2.72; 95% CI: 1.25–5.90), FGR (aOR: 6.07; 95% CI: 3.25–11.36), and cesarean delivery (aOR 3.42; 95% CI: 2.03–5.75).

Conclusion

Individuals with early-onset SIPE had higher odds of adverse maternal outcomes compared with those with late-onset SIPE.

Key Points

· We revealed the incidence of maternal outcomes in early- and late-onset SIPE. · Severe features were common in individuals with SIPE. · Early-onset SIPE was associated with increased adverse maternal outcomes compared with late-onset SIPE.

### HELLP syndrome: a rare, early presentation at 17 weeks of gestation [^116cWZrd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The occurrence of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome before 20 weeks of gestation is extremely rare. This condition has been reported in only few cases, and always in conjunction with other comorbidities such as fetal triploidy and the antiphospholipid syndrome.

Case

A 24-year-old woman was admitted at 15 weeks and 3 days of gestation with uncontrollable hypertension and proteinuria. An extensive workup did not reveal any underlying medical or obstetric conditions. Within 11 days of admission her condition deteriorated and the diagnosis of severe HELLP syndrome was supported by the findings of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and severe thrombocytopenia, all of which resolved after termination of the pregnancy.

Conclusion

Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome in women presenting with clinical manifestations or laboratory abnormalities consistent with this diagnosis, even before 20 weeks of gestation.

### Genetics of preeclampsia: paradigm shifts [^112Eo3WT]. Human Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

Segregation of preeclampsia into early-onset, placental and late-onset, maternal subtypes along with the acknowledgement of the contribution of epigenetics in placentally expressed genes proved to be a key first step in the identification of essential gene variants associated with preeclampsia. Application of this insight to other populations and related pregnancy-induced syndromes, such as HELLP, and acknowledgment of the features shared between chromosomal loci associated with preeclampsia in different populations provide the rationale for new strategies for the identification of susceptibility genes and for new and more effective diagnostic strategies.

### HELLP syndrome: recognition and perinatal management… [^111TK9Um]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The acronym HELLP was coined in 1982 to describe a syndrome consisting of emolysis, h levated e iver enzyme levels and l ow l latelet count. p 1The syndrome has been considered a variant of preeclampsia, but it can occur on its own or in association with preeclampsia. Pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome are related and overlap in their presentations. Because of the serious associated morbidity and mortality, family physicians who provide maternity care need to be aware of HELLP syndrome so that they can identify it early. Epidemiology and Risk Factors HELLP syndrome occurs in approximately 0. 2 to
0. 6 percent of all pregnancies. 3 In comparison, preeclampsia occurs in 5 to 7 percent of pregnancies. 3 Superimposed HELLP syndrome develops in 4 to 12 percent of women with preeclampsia or eclampsia. 3 When preeclampsia is not present, diagnosis of the syndrome is often delayed.
4.

The risk factors for HELLP syndrome differ from those associated with preeclampsia. The syndrome generally presents in the third trimester of pregnancy, although it occurs at less than 27 weeks of gestation in an estimated 11 percent of patients. 5 The syndrome presents antepartum in 69 percent of patients and postpartum in 31 percent of patients. 2 With postpartum presentation, the onset is typically within the first 48 hours after delivery; however, signs and symptoms may not become apparent until as long as seven days after delivery. Prognosis Patients who have had HELLP syndrome should be counseled that they have a 19 to 27 percent risk of developing the syndrome in subsequent pregnancies. 28 They also have up to a 43 percent risk of developing preeclampsia in another pregnancy. 28 Patients with class I HELLP syndrome have the highest risk of recurrence.

28 When the syndrome recurs, it tends to develop later in gestation and is generally less severe after two episodes. Patients who have had HELLP syndrome may subsequently use oral contraceptive pills safely. 29 Patients who develop atypical early-onset preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome should be screened for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. 30.

### Preeclampsia, genomics and public health… [^117DMWNx]. blogs.cdc.gov (2022). Medium credibility.

At 29 weeks pregnant, Erica was diagnosed with preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and signs of organ failure, most often liver or kidney damage. According to the Mayo Clinic, preeclampsia usually starts after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Though rarer, preeclampsia may also develop during the post-partum period. It can lead to seizure, stroke, preterm birth, or even death in the mother and/or baby. Due to Erica's preeclampsia symptoms, she did not carry her baby full-term. She delivered her baby during her 30th week of pregnancy. Though her baby did not have any major complications, her preeclampsia remained post-partum. Preeclampsia is estimated to occur in 5 to 7 percent of all pregnancies and is one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity. Annually, preeclampsia is responsible for over 70, 000 maternal deaths and 500, 000 fetal deaths worldwide. In the United States, the rate of preeclampsia in Black women is 60 percent higher than in White women.

Not only are Black women more likely to develop preeclampsia, but they are more likely to experience poorer outcomes associated with the condition, such as kidney damage and death. Currently, no recommended tests can predict the future onset of preeclampsia early in pregnancy. The standard of care for preeclampsia is to treat the pregnant woman once a complication has been diagnosed, which proves both insufficient and costly. Rasmussen and colleagues identified a cell free RNA signature that predicted pre-eclampsia several weeks before the onset of symptoms, with a positive predictive value of 32% and 75% sensitivity. Additionally, they found a decreased signal in hepatocyte, kidney, endothelial cell, and smooth muscle signatures across pregnancy development, and an increased platelet signal before 12 weeks of pregnancy for preeclampsia, which is consistent with common preeclampsia pathogenesis and with the specific diagnoses.

Moufarrej and colleagues suggested that a series of clinical tests can be used to help to identify and stratify the pathogenesis of preeclampsia in real time, thus meeting important objectives for obstetric care, such as characterizing and stratifying the development of preeclampsia in real time.

### HELLP syndrome with and without eclampsia [^113LALe3]. American Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

We assessed pregnancy outcomes for patients with HELLP syndrome (hemolysis; elevated liver enzymes; low platelet count) with and without concurrent eclampsia. We performed a retrospective investigation of data spanning three decades of patients with class 1 or 2 HELLP syndrome with concurrent eclampsia (HELLP + E) and patients with HELLP syndrome without eclampsia. Data were analyzed by appropriate tests for continuous or categorical outcomes with differences considered significant if P < 0.05. During 1981 to 1996 and 2000 to 2006, there were 693 patients with class 1 or 2 HELLP syndrome; altogether, 70 patients had HELLP + E. The only demographic difference was greater nulliparity in HELLP + E patients. Otherwise, inconsistent and clinically insignificant differences were observed between groups. Despite the relatively large size of the study groups, we were unable to detect a significant worsening of maternal or perinatal outcome in HELLP + E patients compared with HELLP patients. In our experience, eclampsia does not appear to contribute a significant adverse impact upon the course or outcome of HELLP syndrome pregnancies.

### Induction of labour versus expectant monitoring in women with pregnancy induced hypertension or mild preeclampsia at term: the HYPITAT trial [^114ZzvjQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnancy induced hypertension and preeclampsia are common complications of pregnancy. In many cases, the clinical presentation is mild, consisting only of mild hypertension and/or mild proteinuria at term. In other cases however, severe maternal and fetal complications such as eclampsia, abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, the Hemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelet count syndrome (HELLP), fetal growth restriction or even intra-uterine fetal death may occur. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy make a major contribution to maternal and neonatal mortality. In the Netherlands, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are the largest single cause of maternal mortality.

Approximately 10% to 15% of all pregnancies are complicated by hypertensive disorders. The vast majority of these cases occur after 32 weeks. The only causal treatment of the disease is delivery. In case of preterm pregnancies (28–34 weeks gestational age) complicated by preeclampsia expectant monitoring is advocated to increase the chance of fetal maturity, as long as the risks for the mother remain acceptable. Expectant management reduces neonatal complications and duration of neonatal stay in the intensive care unit in preterm pregnancies and is not associated with an increase in maternal complications.

In case of pregnancy induced hypertension or preeclampsia at term, the situation is different from preterm disease. In women with mild preeclampsia complications such as abruptio placenta and small for gestational age are similar to normotensive pregnancies. It is unclear whether in this situation expectant management is beneficial for the mother and her baby, since evidence is lacking. Despite this lack of evidence delivery is often recommended because of the unpredictability of the disease. Recent observational studies indicate that the onset of mild gestational hypertension or mild preeclampsia at or near term is associated with minimal to low maternal and neonatal morbidity. Despite the lack of evidence that would justify intervention, many obstetricians induce labour in women at term with pregnancy-induced hypertension or preeclampsia. Such a policy may increase the risk of assisted vaginal delivery and caesarean section, thus generating additional morbidity and costs. On the other hand, expectant management might lead to severe pregnancy complications like eclampsia, severe hypertension, HELLP syndrome, organ failure or an adverse neonatal outcome.

### Biomarkers and point of care screening approaches for the management of preeclampsia [^113cChgi]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Current methods for detecting and treating preeclampsia

Based on the guidelines from various global organizations, preeclampsia is generally defined as a condition that occurs in pregnancy or the postpartum period, characterized primarily by new-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension accompanied by evidence of end-organ injury. Specifically, the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP)defines preeclampsia as gestational hypertension accompanied by proteinuria or other maternal end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks of gestation. This includes neurological complications, pulmonary edema, hematological complications, acute kidney injury (AKI), liver involvement, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)identifies preeclampsia as new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with either proteinuria or other maternal organ dysfunction. This includes renal insufficiency, liver involvement, neurological complications, hematological complications, and uteroplacental dysfunction. In contrast, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)no longer considers proteinuria a necessary sign for diagnosing preeclampsia. ACOG's guidelines focus on elevated blood pressure with either proteinuria or other complications such as thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, or cerebral/visual symptoms.

While definitions of preeclampsia historically focused primarily on the combination of high blood pressure and proteinuria, modern guidelines recognize a broader spectrum of symptoms and complications. These include, but are not limited to, organ dysfunction (such as renal, liver, or neurological complications), hematological issues such as HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets) syndrome, and uteroplacental dysfunction. This evolution in the definition allows for a more comprehensive and sensitive approach to diagnosing and managing preeclampsia, with the ultimate aim of improving outcomes for both pregnant people and their neonates.

Most interventions for PE primarily address advanced presentations, incorporating the use of antihypertensive drugs to control severe hypertension and prevent maternal morbidity, corticosteroids to prevent neonatal morbidity, and preterm delivery if evidence of HELLP syndrome or other end-organ dysfunction arises –. Several preventive strategies with mixed efficacy, among them the administration of aspirin prior to 16-weeks' gestation, have been suggested to potentially mitigate PE risk. However, the effectiveness of these strategies hinges on the availability of screening technologies capable of detecting PE biomarkers at the earliest gestational stages, thereby enabling timely intervention.

### Liver imaging and pregnancy: what to expect when your patient is expecting [^1171Zt2u]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Pre-eclampsia

Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a progressive systemic disorder that affects 3–10% of all pregnancies and is defined by the association of new-onset arterial hypertension and proteinuria, although one of these elements is absent in 10–20% of cases. PE is a normal placentation disorder characterized by placental ischemia, widespread endothelial dysfunction, and systemic vasospasm. Most cases are diagnosed > 20 weeks of gestation (early PE), and in 20–30% of cases post-partum (late PE). The termination of pregnancy is the only confirmed treatment. In a population-based retrospective study in more than one million singleton deliveries, nulliparity, and maternal age ≥ 35 were the major risk factors for PE. Other known factors are obesity, chronic arterial hypertension, pregestational diabetes type 2, and prior PE. The decision and type of delivery should follow the usual obstetric rules; however, expedited delivery is recommended.

In non-complicated PE, any sudden deterioration must be promptly detected. Bedside abdominal US plays an important role, because it can identify new liver alterations, presence of peritoneal fluid, or portal vein thrombosis. When the liver is involved, portal thrombosis may be the first imaging sign and suggests severe disease requiring immediate delivery. Other signs of liver involvement are seen if PE progresses to eclampsia and HELLP syndrome. Imaging plays an important role when severe complications are suspected, but delivery should never be delayed when a clinical diagnosis is clearly established.

Eclampsia and HELLP syndrome

The worsening of PE involves multiple organ damage and is usually associated with eclampsia (defined as new onset of grand mal seizure activity and/or unexplained coma) and HELLP syndrome. The latter is characterized by the triad of hemolysis (H), elevated liver enzymes (EL), and low platelet (LP) count. HELLP occurs in 10–25% of the cases of PE, or 0.8–1% of all pregnancies. It develops during the third trimester or early post-partum (up to 4 weeks; 25% of cases). Symptoms range from epigastric, right upper quadrant, or scapular pain to sudden hypovolemic shock. The mortality rate is > 5%, and a rapid termination of pregnancy is required.

### Preeclampsia: the need for a biological definition and diagnosis [^116iFYiC]. American Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The centuries-old approach to the prevention of eclampsia and its associated maternal morbidity and mortality is based on the recognition of the presence of premonitory signs and symptoms such as hypertension and proteinuria. The spectrum of preceding signs and symptoms came to be known as preeclampsia, which is debatably considered to be an early stage on a clinical continuum possibly leading to eclampsia. The premonitory signs and symptoms were then construed as diagnostic criteria for the poorly understood syndrome of preeclampsia, and this led to a perpetual debate that remains subject to wide disagreement and periodic updates. In this commentary, we will draw attention to the fact that the criteria for preeclampsia should be viewed from the prism of a screening test rather than as diagnostic of a condition in itself. Focusing research on developing better diagnostic and screening methods for what is clinically important, namely maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality from hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, a long overdue upgrade from what was possible centuries ago, will ultimately lead to better management approaches to what really matters.

### Elevated sFlt-1 / PlGF ratio in women with suspected or confirmed early-onset preeclampsia and super-imposed preeclampsia complicated by HELLP syndrome as well as abnormal umbilical artery Doppler findings and non-reassuring fetal status requiring immediate delivery: a prospective cohort study [^112ogFVp]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

We aimed to investigate the effects of serum sFlt-1/PlGF ratio levels in women with suspected or confirmed early-onset preeclampsia and super-imposed preeclampsia (PE/SPE) on composite and individual adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, stratified by gestational age at blood sampling (< 34, 34–36, and ≥ 37 weeks). We also evaluated whether serum sFlt-1/PlGF ratio levels influenced the time interval from blood sampling to delivery. This prospective cohort study assessed serum levels of sFlt-1, PlGF, and the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in women with suspected or confirmed PE/SPE admitted to a tertiary maternal-fetal-neonatal center between 2012 and 2023. Finally, 241 women were analyzed. An elevated sFlt-1/PlGF ratio at < 34 weeks of gestation, but not at 34–36 or ≥ 37 weeks, was significantly associated with composite adverse maternal and fetal outcomes in women with suspected or confirmed PE/SPE. An sFlt-1/PlGF ratio of 400 was identified as the optimal cut-off level for predicting composite adverse maternal and fetal outcomes at < 34 weeks. Among women with suspected or confirmed early-onset PE/SPE, HELLP syndrome alone was significantly associated with an sFlt-1/PlGF ratio ≥ 400. Additionally, the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was significantly higher in women with HELLP syndrome, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler findings, or non-reassuring fetal status (NRFS) requiring immediate delivery, compared with those without these conditions. Furthermore, the interval from blood sampling to delivery significantly shortened with increasing sFlt-1/PlGF ratio. In conclusion, elevated sFlt-1/PlGF ratios were significantly associated with HELLP syndrome, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler findings, and NRFS requiring immediate delivery in women with suspected or confirmed early-onset PE/SPE. The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio at < 34 weeks of gestation, but not at 34–36 or ≥ 37 weeks, was associated with composite adverse maternal and fetal outcomes in women with suspected or confirmed preeclampsia and super-imposed preeclampsia (PE/SPE). In women with suspected or confirmed early-onset PE/SPE, the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was significantly higher not only in those with HELLP syndrome, but also in those with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler findings and non-reassuring fetal status (NRFS) requiring immediate delivery. Among women with suspected or confirmed early-onset PE/SPE, time to delivery from blood sampling decreased with increasing sFlt-1/PlGF ratio.

### ACG clinical guideline: liver disease and pregnancy [^115xCZYQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

HELLP syndrome — timing, diagnostic laboratory thresholds, and management are detailed: HELLP complicates up to 20% of cases of severe preeclampsia/eclampsia and typically presents between 28 and 36 weeks of gestation, with 30% manifesting symptoms in the first week postpartum. Diagnosis relies on hemolysis and thrombocytopenia with platelets < 100,000 cells/μL with elevations in AST, ALT, serum bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase; hypertension and proteinuria occur in up to 80% of cases, whereas jaundice occurs in only 5% of patients. Maternal mortality rates are 1–3%. When the ALT or AST is > 1,000 U/l or abdominal pain radiates into the right shoulder, cross-sectional imaging can assist in excluding hepatic complications. Glucocorticoids are often part of the therapeutic protocol in HELLP, especially in pregnancies < 34 weeks; however, a Cochrane review found no difference in the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality, or perinatal/infant death despite greater improvement in platelet count with dexamethasone. There is no contraindication to platelet transfusion, and transfusion to > 40,000 cells/μl is advised when invasive procedures are anticipated.

### First trimester prediction of HELLP syndrome [^111H5tG2]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate first-trimester maternal characteristics and biomarkers in pregnancies that subsequently develop HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome.

Method

Maternal history, biochemical, and biophysical parameters were compared between women who developed HELLP, preeclampsia (PE) without HELLP and controls. After determination of significant variables through univariate analysis a first-trimester prediction model was obtained by applying logistic regression analysis. Performance of the model was evaluated.

Results

Twenty participants with HELLP were compared with 147 patients that developed PE without HELLP and 2810 controls. Women with HELLP were more likely Caucasian, nulliparous and presented a higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) when compared with controls. As opposing to women who developed HELLP, women who developed PE without HELLP were more likely of African-American origin and presented an even higher first-trimester MAP. Enrollment biochemical and biophysical parameters were similar between HELLP and PE or controls. Ethnicity, nulliparity, history of previous PE, history of previous HELLP syndrome, and first-trimester MAP were primary risk factors. A prediction rule for HELLP syndrome had an area under the curve of 0.80, with 75% sensitivity for 79% specificity.

Conclusion

The majority of pregnancies that develop HELLP syndrome can be predicted in the first trimester. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Cost-effectiveness of recurrence risk guided care versus care as usual in women who suffered from early-onset preeclampsia including HELLP syndrome in their previous pregnancy (the preCare study) [^113xLaMd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

Study outcomes

Recurrence risk guided care will be compared with care as usual with respect to several outcomes.

Primary outcome is the occurrence of either early-onset preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome. Early-onset preeclampsia and early-onset HELLP syndrome are defined according to the criteria of the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy with the criterion of delivery before 34 weeks after the last menstrual period. Secondary clinical outcome measures are: gestational age of onset of preeclampsia, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, intrauterine growth restriction, caesarean section, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), gestational age at delivery and maternal/infant mortality. Other secondary outcome measures are societal costs, quality of life, anxiety, depression, development of posttraumatic stress, satisfaction with treatment, protocol adherence and cost-effectiveness.

Statistical analysis

Sample size

Sample size calculation was based on the expected fraction of women assigned to regular monitoring either on the basis of the prediction rule or gestational age at the time of previous delivery (67%), the expected failure rate within this category (2%), a type I error (one-sided) of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.2. In order to be able to exclude failure rates of 5% or more, 150 patients assigned to regular monitoring are needed. This means that results of about 225 patients in the recurrence risk based care are needed. The estimated number of 250 allows for drop out and incomplete data of 25 patients.

### Hyperreactio luteinalis could be a risk factor for development of HELLP syndrome: case report [^114X7cbw]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a unique case of hyperreactio luteinalis in pregnancy associated with ovarian torsion and subsequent development of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome.

Design

Case report.

Setting

University medical center.

Patient(S)

A 34-year-old primigravida woman with ovarian torsion in 13 weeks of pregnancy and subsequent intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and HELLP syndrome.

Intervention(S)

Laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy due to the ovarian torsion and cesarean section (CS) due to the development of HELLP syndrome.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

HELLP syndrome.

Result(S)

In the first trimester the patient had symptoms of acute abdomen due to the ovarian torsion. Both ovaries were enlarged and multicystic. Hormonal studies confirmed an abnormally elevated level of hCG (192.000 IU/L), mild hyperthireosis, and hyperandrogenemia. Laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. At 30 weeks of pregnancy, IUGR was confirmed sonographically and clinically, and at 33 weeks severe preeclampsia developed. One week later, HELLP syndrome occurred. Emergency CS was preformed, and she delivered a female newborn weighing 1,640 g. Seven days after delivery, blood pressure and hormonal status returned to normal.

Conclusion(S)

Hyperreactio luteinalis due to the abnormally high level of hCG in the first trimester could be a consequence of inappropriate trophoblast invasion and an early sign of subsequently developing preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome.

### Obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome: early variations of angiogenic factors are associated with adverse outcomes [^111bT69x]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Abruptio placenta was defined according to classical clinical prenatal signs and symptoms: vaginal bleeding accompanied by non-reassuring fetal status or uterine hypertonicity, or sonographic visualization of abruption, and evidence of retroplacental clots during examination of the delivered placenta. Cases were confirmed by histopathological diagnosis.

Birthweights were assessed by birthweight percentile charts customized for maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, parity, gestational age at delivery, and sex. Small-gestational-age newborn was defined as birthweight under the 10 th percentile, and severe when under the 5 th percentile.

Chronic hypertension was defined as hypertension (blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic or more) that was present before pregnancy or that was diagnosed before the 20 th week of gestation. The diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia in chronic hypertensive women needed one of the following findings: 1) in women with hypertension and no proteinuria early in pregnancy (< 20 weeks' gestation), new-onset proteinuria as defined above; 2) in women with hypertension and proteinuria before 20 weeks' gestation; 3) sudden increase in proteinuria; 4) in women whose hypertension has previously been well controlled sudden increase in blood pressure; 5) thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100,000 cells×10⁻⁹ L); or 6) increase in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase to abnormal levels.

HELLP syndrome was defined by the presence of all 3 of the following criteria: hemolysis [characteristic peripheral blood smear and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≥ 600 U/L or serum total bilirubin ≥ 20 μM/L-1], elevated liver enzymes [serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 70 U/L], and low platelet counts (< 100,000 cells×10 −9 L).

Samples

We used blood samples collected for platelet monitoring under LMWH treatment. EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples were obtained by clean venipuncture: the first one the day before LMWH starting, the second one the 4 th day of LMWH treatment, four hours after subcutaneous injection; both at 11.00 am (+ 30 minutes). After taking a platelet count, whole blood samples were centrifuged twice at 4000 g for 20 minutes, aliquots of platelet-poor plasma were then stored at −80°C until tested.

### Cost-effectiveness of recurrence risk guided care versus care as usual in women who suffered from early-onset preeclampsia including HELLP syndrome in their previous pregnancy (the preCare study) [^111nmVXL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

Motivation and relevance for the study

This lack of uniformity in the treatment of these patients asks for more standardisation, e.g. by providing care tailored to the individualised risk assessment.

Current policy may not be efficient. Since only a small percentage of these women develop early-onset recurrent disease in their next pregnancy, clinical management in the next pregnancy may benefit from subdividing these women into subgroups with or without increased risk. The care provided to these women can then be adjusted to their actual risk profile. Particularly former patients at low risk are expected to benefit from this type of risk stratification. Recurrence risk guided care could lead to a substantial reduction of (health care) costs and an increased quality of care.

We have recently developed a multiple-factor model for the prediction of recurrent early-onset preeclampsia and/or HELLP syndrome during the current pregnancy in women with a prior pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia and/or HELLP syndrome (van Kuijk SMJ, Nijdam ME, Janssen KJ, Sep SJ, Peeters LL, Delahaije DHJ, Spaanderman ME, Bruinse HW, Franx A, van Rijn BB, Bots ML, Langenveld J, van der Post AM, Smits LJ: A preconceptional prediction model for recurrent early-onset preeclampsia and the HELLP syndrome, unpublished).

The PreCare study (pregnant women with previous preeclampsia: efficiency of care based on recurrence risk estimation), was designed to (1) estimate cost-effectiveness of recurrence risk guided care versus care as usual for pregnant women with a previous pregnancy being complicated by preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome and (2) to validate the prediction model externally on the basis of the results of a prospective cohort and to update the prediction model if necessary. To this end, we will use the prediction model to differentiate the intensity of monitoring of pregnant women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia and/or HELLP syndrome. Patients are assigned to either the 'regular monitoring' or 'intensive monitoring' protocol. We will compare this strategy, referred to as recurrence risk guided care, with usual care for these patients in The Netherlands.

### Accurate prediction of total PlGF (placental growth factor) from free PlGF and sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1): evidence for markedly elevated PlGF levels in women with acute fatty liver of pregnancy [^115ERmWL]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Participants With No Preeclampsia, Preeclampsia, or HELLP Syndrome

We aimed to compare all women with AFLP to 12 gestational age (GA) matched women with either no preeclampsia, confirmed preeclampsia, or HELLP syndrome, given that the values of sFlt-1, free, and total PlGF alter with advancing gestation. Available residual serum samples from these three groups were collected from a previously conducted prospective cohort study in which the sFlt-1/free PlGF ratio was measured in singleton pregnancies with suspected or confirmed preeclampsia, between 2013 and 2016 at 3 hospitals in the Netherlands. This study was approved by the research ethics committee (MEC-2013–202), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Venous blood was taken at study entry only and was stored at −80 °C until analysis, which was conducted at the end of the study, to avoid influence on decision making of the obstetricians. Preeclampsia was defined as the presence of new-onset hypertension (systolic blood pressure of ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 90 mm Hg) and proteinuria (protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/mmol or ≥ 300 mg/24 hours or 2+ dipstick) at or after 20 weeks' gestation, according to the 2001 International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy definition, which was in effect at the time of study initiation.HELLP syndrome was defined as a reduction of platelet count < 100 × 10⁹/L, an elevation of ALT (alanine aminotransferase) or AST (aspartate aminotransferase) 2-fold the upper limit of normal, and an elevated LDH (lactate dehydrogenase; 2-fold the upper reference limit or > 650 IU/L) according to the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy 2013 definition. Women who had a partial HELLP syndrome (≥ 2 of the HELLP criteria) at time of blood sampling but later developed HELLP syndrome were also considered as HELLP syndrome. Women who were initially suspected of preeclampsia but did not fulfill the diagnosis of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or HELLP syndrome throughout their pregnancy were defined as no preeclampsia.

### Multicenter prospective clinical study to evaluate the prediction of short-term outcome in pregnant women with suspected preeclampsia (PROGNOSIS): study protocol [^115qioPY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia is a serious multi-organ complication in pregnant women defined by the new onset of hypertension and proteinuria at gestational week 20 or after. It is a leading cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality and represents a considerable healthcare resources burden in developed countries.

The current "gold standard" for preeclampsia diagnosis involves blood pressure measurement and determination of protein in urine. However, because of its syndromal nature and the varying clinical presentation of preeclampsia phenotypes, the specificity and reliability of these assessments to predict who will develop preeclampsia, eclampsia, or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome is poor. As a consequence, women with signs or symptoms associated with preeclampsia are often unnecessarily hospitalized for intensive monitoring until preeclampsia is ruled out. Conversely, women who require hospitalization may be overlooked because preeclampsia was not predicted based on the current diagnostic criteria. Improving the sensitivity and accuracy of assays for predicting preeclampsia has the potential to prevent over-diagnosis and over-treatment of women with suspected preeclampsia and may allow more efficient allocation of healthcare resources according to the patient's risk.

It is estimated that one-fifth of antenatal admissions, two-thirds of referrals to day-care assessment units and one-quarter of obstetric admissions to intensive care units in developed countries are preeclampsia-related. Healthcare costs for preeclampsia are high due to a high rate of cesarean deliveries, premature births and an increased requirement for neonatal care. World Health Organization figures indicate that hypertension during pregnancy accounts for 16% of maternal deaths in industrialized countries and up to 25% in developing countries, even though most deaths due to preeclampsia and eclampsia are avoidable through timely diagnosis and management.

Although the etiology is not yet completely understood, preeclampsia is a heterogeneous syndrome driven by disturbed placental function in early pregnancy and an imbalance of angiogenic factors, such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1; also known as sVEGFR-1), placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble endoglin (sEng). In preeclampsia, excess placental secretion of sFlt-1 and sEng inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor β1 signaling, respectively, resulting in endothelial cell dysfunction. sFlt-1 also antagonizes circulating pro-angiogenic PlGF, resulting in decreased PlGF expression in preeclamptic women. Late-onset preeclampsia (after 34 weeks) is associated with less dramatic dysregulation of angiogenic factors than early-onset preeclampsia.

### Early pregnancy triglycerides and blood pressure: a combined predictor for preeclampsia [^114BMNQx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related hypertensive disease, is defined as maternal hypertension and the onset of new organ or uteroplacental dysfunction and usually appears after 20 weeks of gestation. This disorder is a major contributor to perinatal complications and fatalities for both mothers and children. Preeclampsia complicates approximately 1–5% of pregnancies worldwide, with regional variations and is linked to significant long-term cardiovascular conditions and ailments. Preeclampsia can be classified by gestational onset (early-onset: < 34 weeks; late-onset: ≥ 34 weeks) and severity. Severe cases involve blood pressure > 160/110 mmHg with end-organ complications (e.g. HELLP syndrome, foetal growth restriction < 10th percentile), while mild cases present with blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg and proteinuria without severe features. In addition, research has indicated that early preventive measures, including low-dose aspirin treatment, can significantly lower the occurrence of developing preeclampsia. Consequently, identifying high-risk individuals in the initial stages of pregnancy is essential to minimize adverse maternal and offspring outcomes and initiate timely, appropriate therapeutic interventions. For populations with identified high-risk factors, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), renal disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and pregestational diabetes, specific clinical management, including the use of serum markers for predicting preeclampsia, can be provided throughout the entire pregnancy period to prevent the occurrence and reduce the risk of preeclampsia. However, for patients with no obvious high-risk profile, routine screening typically includes measurements of early biochemical markers, ultrasound assessments, and arterial pressure measurements during the first trimester. Interest is on the rise in assessing whether combinations of routine screening indicators can effectively identify populations at increased risk of preeclampsia.

### Circulating levels of thrombospondin-1 are decreased in HELLP syndrome [^113AMP3B]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia is characterised by an imbalance of circulating pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. The syndrome of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count (HELLP) develops mostly on the ground of preeclampsia, and one of its important features is the severe disturbance of the coagulation system, intravascular coagulopathy. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is derived from the endothelium and platelets, and exerts potent pro-thrombotic and anti-angiogenic effects. Our aim was to determine, whether its circulating levels are altered in preeclampsia and in HELLP syndrome.

Methods

We enrolled 45 pregnant women with early-, 43 with late-onset preeclampsia, 21 with HELLP-syndrome, 45 with uncomplicated pregnancy and 20 non-pregnant controls in our case-control study. TSP-1 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results

Circulating TSP-1 levels were lower in HELLP syndrome compared to all other study groups, while they were unaltered in preeclampsia compared to the control groups. There was a significant positive linear correlation between TSP-1 levels and platelet count in HELLP syndrome. In patients with more severe HELLP syndrome, TSP-1 levels were significantly lower compared to women suffering from a milder form of HELLP syndrome.

Conclusions

Circulating thrombospondin-1 levels are decreased in HELLP syndrome and they seem to reflect disease severity, lower levels representing a more severe state. Nevertheless, despite its potent anti-angiogenic effect, our results suggest that circulating TSP-1 does not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.

### Multicenter prospective clinical study to evaluate the prediction of short-term outcome in pregnant women with suspected preeclampsia (PROGNOSIS): study protocol [^111xyEuY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Exclusion criteria

Women with manifest preeclampsia are excluded from the study. Manifest preeclampsia is defined as the presence of proteinuria ≥ 2+ by dipstick urinalysis (or ≥ 0.3 g protein/24 hours or ≥ 30 mg/dL protein in spot urine or spot urine protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg protein/mmol creatinine) AND reproducible elevated blood pressure (≥ 140 mmHg systolic and/or ≥ 90 mmHg diastolic) or current antihypertensive treatment. Women with a confirmed diagnosis of HELLP syndrome are also not eligible for study participation.

Other exclusion criteria include concomitant participation in another clinical study (with the exception of existing biobanks as agreed upon between individual clinical sites and the study sponsor); treatment with an investigational medicinal product during the 90 days prior to enrollment; being an employee at the investigational site; or being a relative or spouse of the investigator.

Definitions of preeclampsia-associated conditions and of maternal and fetal outcomes (diagnostic criteria)

To overcome any lack of consensus, specific diagnostic criteria for each preeclampsia-related disorder are defined in the protocol and must be strictly followed by all investigators: preeclampsia/eclampsia is to be diagnosed according to the criteria defined by the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines, with other established sources used to define specific criteria for HELLP syndrome, early-/late-onset preeclampsia, preterm delivery and adverse neonatal outcomes (IUGR; small for gestational age) (Table 2).

### HELLP syndrome at… [^112WkXGb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

We performed a systematic review to evaluate the clinical presentation and maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancies with early-onset HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome.

Data Sources

PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were queried from inception through January 1, 2023 with the following terms: "HELLP syndrome", "HELLP", "hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets", "hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome", "pre-viable", "peri-viable", "previable", "periviable", "first trimester", "second trimester", "before 23 weeks", " < 23 weeks", " < 23 week gestation", and "before 23 weeks gestation". We also included an additional case from our institution.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Abstracts, unpublished studies, and review articles were excluded, yielding 46 studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Methods

Two reviewers (N.S. I. and M.H.M.) performed the study selection and subsequent data extraction independently, after which the results were reviewed together. PRISMA guidelines were followed, and our study was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42021292692).

Results

A total of 55 patients had 58 pregnancies complicated by early-onset HELLP syndrome, including 3 with recurrent HELLP. The most common presenting signs/symptoms were abdominal pain (35/45; 78%), hypertension (32/49; 65%), nausea/vomiting (16/45; 36%), headache (13/45; 29%), and edema (8/45; 18%). Lactate dehydrogenase ≥ 600 IU/L was observed in 21 of 31 (68%) cases, whereas liver enzyme abnormalities and thrombocytopenia were reported in 48 of 51 (94%) and 50 of 54 (93%) cases, respectively. Maternal complications were encountered in 25 of 56 (45%) cases. The most common complications were hepatic (13/56; 23%), central nervous system-related (11/56; 20%), and respiratory (11/56; 20%). In 36 of 57 (63%) cases, pregnancy was terminated. Of the 21 continued pregnancies, early fetal death (at < 20 weeks' gestation) was reported in 10 (48%), stillbirth in 6 (28%), and neonatal demise in 2 (10%). Living neonates were reported in 3 of 21 (14%) cases, all delivered at 23 weeks. The perinatal mortality rate was 73% (8/11). One case (2%) reported maternal death. Antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed in 14 of 29 (48%) cases.

Conclusion

Early-onset HELLP syndrome presents with symptoms similar to those observed in later gestation. Maternal complications are life-threatening, with the most common complications being hepatic, central nervous system-related, and respiratory. Fetal outcomes are poor.

### A narrative synthesis of factors that affect women speaking up about early warning signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia and responses of healthcare staff [^117N6Zb5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia is a major obstetric problem affecting 2–8% of pregnancies and is a leading global cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. It is a pregnancy specific disease characterised by de-novo development of concurrent hypertension and proteinuria, sometimes progressing into a multisystem disorder. The potential adverse perinatal outcomes include intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth and fetal death. If untreated, pre-eclampsia can develop into eclampsia when maternal seizures develop. HELLP Syndrome (Haemolysis, Elevated liver enzymes and Low Platelet) is regarded as a variant of severe pre-eclampsia and can occur in 10–20% of cases with severe pre-eclampsia.

The incidence of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia varies internationally. Eclampsia is is more common in developing countries than in high income countries. For example, in Latin America and the Caribbean hypertensive disorders are responsible for around 26% of maternal deaths, whereas in Africa and Asia they contribute to around 9% of deaths. The incidence of pre-eclampsia is reported to have increased in the USA, which may be related to an increased prevalence of predisposing factors such as chronic hypertension, diabetes and obesity.

For the purposes of this synthesis pre-eclampsia was defined as "a combination of a new hypertension and proteinuria and typically occurs after 20 weeks gestation". Severe pre-eclampsia is pre-eclampsia with severe hypertension and/or symptoms and/or biochemical and/or haematological impairment and eclampsia is defined as a convulsive condition associated with pre-eclampsia which can also present for the first time in the postnatal period. For purposes of brevity in the remainder of the paper the term pre-eclampsia should also be understood to include severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia unless otherwise indicated.

One of the challenges for treating pre-eclampsia and preventing further deterioration is determining how best to enable early detection. If women or their partners and families are able to raise early warnings about potential signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia in pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period, they may be able to receive appropriate intervention to prevent onset of severe pre-eclampsia from developing. Early warning signs of severe pre-eclampsia, which can deteriorate very quickly, include specific physical symptoms such as severe headaches that does not resolve with simple painkillers, problems with vision, such as blurring or flashing before the eyes, severe pain just below the ribs, heartburn that does not resolve with antacids, rapidly increasing swelling of the face, hands or feet and feeling very unwell.

### Prepregnancy and early pregnancy calcium supplementation among women at high risk of pre-eclampsia: a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^112ng1vi]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

HELLP syndrome = haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count. *Severe pre-eclamptic complications index: severe pre-eclampsia, early-onset pre-eclampsia (< 32 weeks' gestation), eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, placental abruption, or severe gestational hypertension. †Severe maternal morbidity and mortality index: maternal admission to intensive care, eclampsia, severe pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, HELLP syndrome, renal failure, or death.

Statistical analysis

The sample size calculation was informed by the WHO trial of calcium supplementation in the second half of pregnancy, where hypertension occurred in 14% of the relatively low-risk participants who received calcium supplementation from 20 weeks' gestation. The risk of recurrent pre-eclampsia for women with previous pre-eclampsia or eclampsia is estimated to be at least 25%. We calculated that, to show a reduction in pre-eclampsia from 25% to 15%, we would need 540 participants with pregnancies continuing beyond 20 weeks' gestation (0.05 α level, 80% power; calculated using Epi Info software (CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA). We anticipated that 50% of participants recruited would become pregnant during the trial. Allowing for a miscarriage rate of 15% and loss to follow-up of 10%, we needed to recruit approximately 1440 participants who were not pregnant. Enrolment would be stopped once we were able to predict reaching our primary sample size (ie, the 540 participants with pregnancies continuing beyond 20 weeks' gestation).

### The HELLP syndrome in the antiphospholipid syndrome: retrospective study of 16 cases in 15 women [^116Xtz8d]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the characteristics of the haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and its influence on the subsequent pregnancies.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of 16 episodes of HELLP complicating APS in 15 women.

Results

HELLP was complete in 10 cases and partial in six. It occurred during the second trimester in seven cases (the earliest at 18 weeks' gestation), the third trimester in seven cases, and the day following delivery in two cases. Pre-eclampsia was present in six cases and eclampsia in five. Outcome of pregnancies was: live birth (n = 8), stillbirth (n = 2) and fetal death (n = 6). APS was primary in nine women and secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in six. HELLP revealed primary APS in six cases. Seven women were not treated. Low dose aspirin was empirically prescribed in one woman whose APS had been undiagnosed despite a history of two fetal deaths. In the other women, therapy consisted of aspirin (n = 8), low molecular weight heparin with a dose varying between 3000 and 12 000 U daily (n = 5), and high dose immunoglobulin every 4 weeks (n = 2), hydroxychloroquine (n = 4), and prednisone (n = 6). Six women had seven subsequent pregnancies, 3–6 years after the complicated pregnancy. HELLP recurred at 33 weeks' gestation in one woman with SLE treated with prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, aspirin, and enoxaparin, and pregnancy ended in live birth. One woman became pregnant after in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer, but pregnancy ended in fetal death despite prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, and enoxaparin. Four women had five uneventful pregnancies with 100 mg daily aspirin and heparin.

Conclusions

APS may be revealed by HELLP. In APS, HELLP is associated with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia in most cases and seems to occur earlier than in the general population. Heparin plus aspirin may prevent obstetric complications in the subsequent pregnancies.

### Clinical differences between early-onset HELLP syndrome and early-onset preeclampsia during pregnancy and at least 6 months postpartum [^113WX2yW]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to evaluate whether clinical and laboratory variables differ between former patients who had HELLP syndrome and former patients who had preeclampsia (PE) without HELLP.

Study Design

We compared early-onset HELLP (n = 75) with early-onset PE (n = 40) with respect to clinical features during the hypertensive complication and to metabolic, hemodynamic, and hemostatic variables determined at least 6 months postpartum.

Results

HELLP differed from PE by a borderline higher frequency of eclampsia (13% vs 3%) during the complication, and by a lower prevalence of hypertension (19% vs 33%), proteinuria (2% vs 23%), thrombophilia (6% vs 27%), obesity (9% vs 33%), hypertriglyceridemia (1% vs 15%), hyperglycemia (0% vs 11%), and elevated levels of fasting homocysteine (6% vs 21%) at least 6 months postpartum.

Conclusion

Women with HELLP had fewer signs of abnormalities consistent with the metabolic syndrome and a 4-fold lower prevalence of thrombophilia as compared with PE women without HELLP.

HELLP — features, labs, and diagnostic considerations: Typically arises in the second or third trimester with abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting and commonly coexists with preeclampsia. Prevalence is 0.2%-0.6% (preeclampsia affects 3%-5%). Risk factors include preexisting hypertension, diabetes mellitus, advanced maternal age, multiple gestations, and prior preeclampsia. Laboratory findings include AST and ALT typically > 500 units/L, bilirubin < 5 mg/dL, and hemolysis with markedly elevated LDH > 600 units/L. Diagnosis is clinical with maternal organ dysfunction, including renal, hepatic, neurologic, or hematologic complications, uteroplacental dysfunction, or fetal growth restriction.

### Comparison of clinical features and pregnancy outcomes in early-and late-onset preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome: a 10-year retrospective study from a tertiary hospital and referral center in China [^114MiMkN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Early-onset preeclampsia (EO-PE) and late-onset preeclampsia (LO-PE) are different subtypes of preeclampsia. We conducted this study to analyze the similarities and differences in the clinical features and pregnancy outcomes in EO- and LO-PE with HELLP syndrome.

Methods

This was a retrospective study in a tertiary hospital. Eighty-three parturients with HELLP syndrome were allocated into two groups based on the timing of preeclampsia onset: EO-PE with HELLP (n = 47) and LO-PE with HELLP (n = 36).

Results

In total, 31.9% and 63.9% of women in the EO-PE with HELLP and LO-PE with HELLP groups, respectively, were asymptomatic at diagnosis (P = 0.004, OR = 0.265 (0.106–0.662)). Headache or visual symptoms were more frequent in the EO-PE group than in the LO-PE group (48.9% vs. 25%, P = 0.026, OR = 0.348 (0.135–0.896)). Women in the EO-PE with HELLP group had higher SBP and DBP than those in the LO-PE with HELLP group. Laboratory tests, including platelets, liver function, and hemolysis, which are the main indicators for the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome, showed almost no significant differences between the two groups, with kidney function being the only difference observed. Women in the EO-PE with HELLP group had higher Scr than those in the LO-PE with HELLP group. The degree of proteinuria was higher in the EO-PE group than in the LO-PE with HELLP group. The incidence of severe maternal complications was significantly higher in the EO-PE group than in the LO-PE with HELLP group (25.5% vs. 5.6%, P = 0.016, OR = 0.172 (0.036–0.824)). In total, 57.4% and 8.3% of neonates in the EO-PE and LO-PE with HELLP groups were admitted to the NICU, and the difference was statistically significant, even after adjustment for the delivery week (P = 0.009, OR = 0.830 (0.729–0.944)). Postpartum HELLP syndrome was more common in the LO-PE group than in the EO-PE group (30.6% vs. 4.3%, P = 0.001, OR = 9.9 (2.031–48.256)).

Conclusions

Compared with LO-PE with HELLP patients, EO-PE with HELLP patients have more obvious kidney damage, higher blood pressure and a higher risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Patients with LO-PE need to be alerted to the occurrence of HELLP syndrome after delivery.

### Current insights into thrombotic microangiopathies: thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and pregnancy [^111xkz4k]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

The complex relation between thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and pregnancy is concisely reviewed. Pregnancy is a very strong trigger for acute disease manifestation in patients with hereditary TTP caused by double heterozygous or homozygous mutations of ADAMTS13 (ADisintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin type 1 domains, no. 13). In several affected women disease onset during their first pregnancy leads to the diagnosis of hereditary TTP. Without plasma treatment mother and especially fetus are at high risk of dying. The relapse risk during a next pregnancy is almost 100% but regular plasma transfusion starting in early pregnancy will prevent acute TTP flare-up and may result in successful pregnancy outcome. Pregnancy may also constitute a mild risk factor for the onset of acute acquired TTP caused by autoantibody-mediated severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. Women having survived acute acquired TTP may not be at very high risk of TTP relapse during an ensuing next pregnancy but seem to have an elevated risk of preeclampsia. Monitoring of ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor titre during pregnancy may help to guide management and to avoid disease recurrence. Finally, TTP needs to be distinguished from the much more frequent hypertensive pregnancy complications, preeclampsia and especially HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, Low Platelet count) syndrome.

### Diagnosis and management of atypical preeclampsia-eclampsia [^114msuke]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia, eclampsia, and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome are major obstetric disorders that are associated with substantial maternal and perinatal morbidities. As a result, it is important that clinicians make timely and accurate diagnoses to prevent adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes associated with these syndromes. In general, most women will have a classic presentation of preeclampsia (hypertension and proteinuria) at > 20 weeks of gestation and/or < 48 hours after delivery. However, recent studies have suggested that some women will experience preeclampsia without ≥ 1 of these classic findings and/or outside of these time periods. Atypical cases are those that develop at < 20 weeks of gestation and > 48 hours after delivery and that have some of the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia without the usual hypertension or proteinuria. The purpose of this review was to increase awareness of the nonclassic and atypical features of preeclampsia-eclampsia. In addition, a stepwise approach toward diagnosis and treatment of patients with these atypical features is described.

All women aged 18–45 years, with a singleton/twin pregnancy of gestation at 11–14 weeks desiring to continue the pregnancy and agreeing to deliver at the above hospitals are included in the study.

Exclusion criteria

Women are excluded if they have a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), seizure disorder or liver disease. Women whose fetus is diagnosed to have a congenital abnormality at the 18–22 weeks scan are excluded, as are women with bleeding disorders, HIV infection or HBsAg.

Diagnosis of preeclampsia

As per the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), 2013 guidelines, preeclampsia is diagnosed by the occurrence of new-onset hypertension along with new-onset proteinuria. Hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg on at least two measurements taken at least 4 h apart. Proteinuria is defined as the excretion of 300 mg protein or higher in a 24 h urine specimen, or a protein/ creatinine ratio ≥ 0.3, or 1+ or higher on a dipstick test performed on two random urine samples collected at least 4 h apart. Preeclampsia, in the absence of proteinuria is now defined as the presence of hypertension along with any one of the following: thrombocytopenia, impaired liver function, development of renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema, or new-onset cerebral or visual disturbances.

Women who develop complications due to preeclampsia, including eclampsia, placental abruption, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) and fetal death are also included. Gestational age will be based on the last menstrual period (LMP) date unless it differs from the gestation derived from the crown rump length at the first ultrasound scan (11–14 weeks) by > +/− 7 days, in which case the latter will be used. By using an LMP-based gestation rather than ultrasound-based gestation will enable us to detect differences in early fetal growth between case and control groups. Management of preeclampsia will be as per the clinician's discretion and will be carefully documented.

### HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome versus severe preeclampsia: onset at… [^1158o3Cw]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

Our purpose was to determine whether the onset of the HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome in women at ≤ 28.0 weeks' gestation is associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in comparison with the risk for women with severe preeclampsia but without the HELLP syndrome at a similar gestational age.

Study Design

Sixty-four patients with either the HELLP syndrome (n = 32) or severe preeclampsia but absent HELLP syndrome laboratory test results (n = 32), admitted at ≤ 28.0 weeks' gestation between July 1, 1992, and April 30, 1999, were studied. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. Statistical analysis was performed by the Student t test and the Fisher exact test.

Results

There were no significant differences between the 2 groups regarding African-American race (59% vs 75%), nulliparity (50% vs 56%), or the use of corticosteroids (59% vs 78%). There were no maternal deaths. One woman with the HELLP syndrome had a liver hematoma. The rate at which transfusion of blood products was required was significantly greater in women with the HELLP syndrome than in those with severe preeclampsia only (25% vs 3%; P < .05). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to eclampsia (16% vs 13%), abruptio placentae (6% vs 9%), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (13% vs 0%), pulmonary edema (13% vs 6%), acute renal failure (3% vs 0%), pleural effusion (3% vs 3%), or ascites (6% vs 16%). No significant differences were found between the 2 groups with respect to neonatal death (11% vs 17%), respiratory distress syndrome (78% vs 86%), or composite neonatal morbidity.

Conclusions

Except for the need for transfusion of blood products in women with the HELLP syndrome, onset at ≤ 28.0 weeks' gestation is not associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes in comparison with the risk for women with severe preeclampsia but without the HELLP syndrome at a similar gestational age.

### Cost-effectiveness of recurrence risk guided care versus care as usual in women who suffered from early-onset preeclampsia including HELLP syndrome in their previous pregnancy (the preCare study) [^111GHgPY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome may have serious consequences for both mother and fetus. Women who have suffered from preeclampsia or the HELLP syndrome, have an increased risk of developing preeclampsia in a subsequent pregnancy. However, most women will develop no or only minor complications. In this study, we intend to determine cost-effectiveness of recurrence risk guided care versus care as usual in pregnant women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia.

Methods/Design

We developed a prediction model to estimate the individual risk of recurrence of early-onset preeclampsia and the HELLP syndrome. In a before-after study, pregnant women with preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome in their previous pregnancy receiving care as usual (before introduction of the prediction model) will be compared with women receiving recurrence risk guided care (after introduction of the prediction model). Eligible and pregnant women will be recruited at six university hospitals and seven large non-university tertiary referral hospitals in the Netherlands. The primary outcome measure is the recurrence of early-onset preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome in women allocated to the regular monitoring group. For the economic evaluation, a modelling approach will be used. Costs and effects of recurrence risk guided care with those of care as usual will be compared by means of a decision model. Two incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated: 1) cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (mother unit of analysis) and 2) cost per live born child (child unit of analysis).

Discussion

This is, to our knowledge, the first study that evaluates prospectively the efficacy of a multivariable prediction rule for recurrent hypertensive disease in pregnancy. Results of this study could either be integrated into the current guideline on Hypertensive Disorders in Pregnancy, or be used to develop a new guideline.

### The role of vitamin D in pre-eclampsia: a systematic review [^1157Rnxe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Each day, 830 women die from preventable pregnancy-related causes; low- and middle-income countries bear the greatest burden of disease. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia (PE), and eclampsia, are among the major complications that account for approximately 14% of maternal mortality. Pregnancy induced hypertension, defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg on two consecutive occasions ≥ 6 h apart occurring after 20 weeks of pregnancy, complicates approximately 10% of all pregnancies worldwide. Pre-eclampsia (PE) is hypertension and proteinuria (protein in urine ≥ 0.3 g/24 h (1+ dipstick) on two occasions ≥ 6 h apart) or edema. It is a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality and complicates 2% to 8% of pregnancies. Early onset severe PE (EOSPE) is diagnosed between 20 to 34 weeks gestation and is associated with a 20-fold increased risk for maternal mortality compared to PE after 34 weeks gestation called late onset severe PE (LOSPE). Pregnant women who show signs of pregnancy induced hypertension or PE can develop eclampsia, which is the occurrence of unexplained seizures.

The complications of PE include eclampsia, disseminated intravascular coagulation and the HELLP syndrome (hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets). Risks to the fetus include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and fetal death. Pathognomonic features shared by PE and IUGR include abnormal placental implantation and reduced trophoblastic invasion. Similarly, EOSPE and LOSPE are associated with fetal death, perinatal death, and severe neonatal morbidity. For example, in an analysis of 456,668 singleton births in Washington state, EOSPE was associated with high risk of fetal death; the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 5.8 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 4.0–8.3 vs. 1.3 for LOSPE (95% CI: 0.8–2.0). The aOR for perinatal death/severe neonatal morbidity was 16.4 (95% CI: 14.5–18.6) in EOSPE and 2.0 (95% CI: 1.8–2.3) in LOSPE. Women with a history of PE also have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease later in life.

### Differentiating and managing rare thrombotic microangiopathies during pregnancy and postpartum [^1132p1cR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

The most common thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) of pregnancy is the well-recognized syndrome of preeclampsia with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. However, rare TMAs, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, complement-mediated hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, may occur during pregnancy or postpartum and present with features similar to those of preeclampsia with severe features. Early recognition and treatment of these infrequently encountered conditions are key for avoiding serious maternal morbidities with long-term sequelae and possible maternal or fetal death. Differentiating between preeclampsia with severe features and these rare TMAs is diagnostically challenging as there is significant overlap in their clinical and laboratory presentation. Given the rarity of these TMAs, high-quality evidence-based recommendations on diagnosis and management during pregnancy are lacking. Using current objective information and recommendations from working groups, this report provides practical clinical approaches to diagnose and manage these rare TMAs. This report also discusses how to manage individuals with a history of these rare TMAs who are planning to conceive. To optimize favorable outcomes, a multidisciplinary approach including obstetricians, maternal-fetal medicine specialists, hematologists, and nephrologists alongside close clinical and laboratory monitoring is vital.

### Comparison of clinical features and pregnancy outcomes in early-and late-onset preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome: a 10-year retrospective study from a tertiary hospital and referral center in China [^113kQ5GP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous syndrome that affects 3–5% of pregnancies. It is usually characterized by hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation and may lead to multisystem disorders. It is one of the main causes of maternal, fetal, and neonatal mortality worldwide.

Early-onset preeclampsia (EO-PE) and late-onset preeclampsia (LO-PE) have different characteristics and are generally considered to be subtypes of preeclampsia. Regarding the timing of disease onset, EO-PE occurs before 34 weeks of gestation, and LO-PE occurs at 34 weeks of gestation or later. Genetic association studies suggest that EO-PE is more strongly associated with intrinsic placental factors, while LO-PE is more strongly associated with predisposing maternal factors rather than placental involvement, which suggests that the two subtypes may be different forms of preeclampsia with different etiologies. The two subtypes also have different risk factors and may lead to different pregnancy outcomes. However, studies that compare clinical parameters or laboratory biomarkers between EO- and LO-PE are limited.

HELLP syndrome is a severe form of preeclampsia characterized by microangiopathic hemolysis, abnormal liver function tests, and thrombocytopenia, with or without proteinuria or severe hypertension. It often has an acute onset, with rapid and sometimes sudden deterioration of the maternal and fetal conditions, and may cause serious complications without early recognition and appropriate clinical intervention. The presence of HELLP syndrome is associated with an increased risk of maternal death and increased rates of maternal morbidities such as acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), placental abruption, liver hemorrhage or failure and stroke.

Since it was first described by Weinstein in 1982, numerous studies have been published in an attempt to refine the diagnostic criteria for this syndrome, to identify risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes and to reduce maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with this syndrome. However, studies investigating the differences in clinical features and pregnancy outcomes of HELLP syndrome between different subtypes of preeclampsia are limited.

Given that EO and LO-PE are different subtypes of preeclampsia, we conducted this study to analyze the similarities and differences in the clinical symptoms, laboratory biomarkers, clinical course, recovery times, and maternal and neonatal outcomes between EO and LO-PE with HELLP syndrome.

### Recurrence risk of a delivery before 34 weeks of pregnancy due to an early onset hypertensive disorder: a systematic review [^114nZ56J]. American Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Early onset hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcome. The risk of recurrence influences parents' choices on subsequent pregnancies and the counseling obstetrician, but evidence so far has been limited. We performed the first systematic review on the risk of recurrence of hypertensive disorders that had caused delivery < 34 weeks. We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for articles published until September 2009 that report on pregnancy outcome after an earlier pregnancy complicated by early hypertension, preeclampsia, or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome, which resulted in a delivery before 34 weeks. Recurrence rates of premature deliveries due to hypertensive disorders were calculated for each study separately. Pooled data were calculated. The search retrieved 36 relevant articles, of which 11 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These 11 studies reported on 2377 patients (range 18 to 1754 patients per study), who had 2461 deliveries. Seven studies were included for further calculation. The pooled risk of a delivery before 34 weeks due to recurrence of hypertension, preeclampsia, or HELLP was 7.8% (95% confidence interval 6.7 to 9.0%). Opposed to some previous studies, the overall recurrence rate is generally low. The pooled recurrence risk of an early onset hypertensive disorder is approximately 8%.

Pregnancy physiology and disease manifestations in RMD — Pregnancy changes may impact manifestations of RMD, including pregnancy-related increased intravascular volume that may worsen already abnormal cardiac or renal function, the expected 50% increase in glomerular filtration rate during pregnancy that may worsen preexisting stable proteinuria, pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability increasing RMD-associated thrombosis risk, and calcium demand of fetal bone development and breastfeeding that may worsen maternal osteoporosis. Normal pregnancy symptoms may falsely mimic symptoms of active RMD, and pregnancy-induced hypertension syndromes (preeclampsia) may be confused with lupus nephritis, scleroderma renal crisis, or vasculitis flare; HELLP syndrome or eclampsia may resemble severe disease flare.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in 166 pregnancies: 1955–2006 [^111MQk8B]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

A review of pregnancy-associated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in 166 pregnancies was undertaken using 92 English-language publications from 1955 to 2006. Initial and recurrent TTP presents most often in the second trimester (55.5%) after 1–2 days of signs/symptoms; postpartum TTP usually occurs following term delivery. TTP with preeclampsia (n = 28) exhibits 2–4 times higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values and lower total lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to AST ratios (LDH to AST ratio = 13:1), compared with TTP without preeclampsia (LDH to AST ratio = 29:1). Maternal mortality is higher with initial TTP (26% vs 10.7%), especially with concurrent preeclampsia (44.4% vs 21.8%, P < .02). Although maternal mortality with TTP has substantially declined when plasma therapy is utilized, delay of diagnosis and therapy for initial TTP confounded by preeclampsia/hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome remains a significant maternal-perinatal threat. Rapid and readily available laboratory testing to quickly diagnose TTP and HELLP syndrome/preeclampsia is desperately needed to improve care.
