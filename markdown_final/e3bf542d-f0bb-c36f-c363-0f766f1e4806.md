## Question

Solid- vs. cell-based assay for HLA antibodies after allo-HSCT?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which assay to use for detecting HLA antibodies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and how to integrate solid-phase versus cell-based methods into practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why HLA antibody testing matters after allo-HSCT. Then, I should compare solid-phase and cell-based assays on analytical performance and operational feasibility. Next, I will review the strength of evidence and guideline positions. After that, I need to check practical thresholds, monitoring cadence, and how to handle assay limitations like the prozone effect. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, risk-stratified recommendation and note where complementary testing still adds value.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. Donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) are a recognized barrier to engraftment and are associated with primary graft failure and poor graft function across mismatched settings, with meta-analytic data showing roughly a 7-fold increased risk of primary graft failure in DSA-positive patients, and prospective and retrospective cohorts linking higher DSA levels to worse outcomes in haploidentical, unrelated, and cord blood transplantation [^625f6061] [^2a6ce018] [^93d79903].

> Now, I should compare assay methodologies carefully. Solid-phase immunoassays, particularly Luminex-based single antigen bead assays, offer high sensitivity and specificity, enable allele-level resolution including HLA-DQ and HLA-DP specificities, and provide semiquantitative readouts via mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), which supports risk stratification and serial monitoring. However, they are semiquantitative, not FDA-cleared for quantification, and can be confounded by prozone-like effects at very high antibody levels, which can artifactually lower MFI unless mitigated by dilution or EDTA treatment [^cc234ff3] [^c303953a] [^84bd4420] [^53118bc8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cell-based assays. Cell-based crossmatches (CDC and flow cytometric) detect functional antibody activity against intact donor cells and remain valuable for assessing cytotoxic potential, but they require viable donor lymphocytes, have lower sensitivity than solid-phase assays, and cannot define fine specificities such as HLA-DQ/DP, which limits their standalone utility for comprehensive DSA assessment in modern mismatched transplantation [^b4eff07f] [^87c6ae9e].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence and guideline direction. Multiple contemporary ASTCT consensus documents converge on a single position: solid-phase assays are the preferred primary modality for both screening and identification of HLA antibodies in allo-HSCT, with cell-based assays reserved as complementary tests when available. This is echoed by disease-specific ASTCT sections and aligns with broader transplant guidance favoring solid-phase methods for HLA antibody detection [^87c6ae9e] [^5ec7a1f3] [^7b2e3dba] [^0c8f702b].

> I need to ensure I translate this into practical thresholds and monitoring. For haploidentical transplants, DSA at or above about 2,000 MFI is associated with increased risk and often triggers desensitization; for single cord blood transplantation, even 1,000 MFI carries risk and warrants mitigation. Very high levels above roughly 20,000 MFI are particularly challenging to reduce and correlate with high rates of graft failure despite therapy. Monitoring should be frequent around conditioning and infusion, with at least weekly testing during desensitization and early engraftment, and consideration of complement-binding assays (e.g. C1q) to refine risk when DSA are present [^ebbb214f] [^93d79903] [^1388eb1e] [^2ca35069].

> Wait, let me verify how to handle assay limitations so I don't misclassify risk. At very high DSA levels, solid-phase assays can underestimate strength due to antigen saturation or interference; diluting serum and/or adding EDTA can reverse this prozone-like effect and reveal true titers, which is crucial before concluding that DSA have "cleared" or dropped to safe levels. This is a recognized pitfall that can mislead clinical decision-making if not addressed [^84bd4420] [^b474df7c] [^f8366cca].

> But wait, what if the donor is fully matched and the crossmatch is negative — do I still need solid-phase testing? I should double-check the pre-transplant workup guidance. ASTCT recommends HLA antibody testing for all candidates undergoing mismatched transplants, and many centers extend screening broadly because sensitization from prior transfusion, pregnancy, or transplantation can produce DSA even in seemingly well-matched pairs; thus, routine solid-phase screening is prudent to avoid missed DSA that could threaten engraftment [^170aaf91] [^87c6ae9e].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. Primary testing should be with solid-phase assays for screening and single antigen bead identification, ideally timed within one month pre-conditioning and repeated if transfusion exposure or other sensitizing events occur. Complementary cell-based crossmatching can be added when donor cells are available to assess functional cytotoxicity, particularly when solid-phase DSA are present or when there is discordance between clinical suspicion and solid-phase results. If DSA are detected, quantify with MFI, assess complement-binding potential, mitigate prozone effects when indicated, and escalate to desensitization when thresholds are exceeded, with close serial monitoring until engraftment and DSA clearance are achieved [^170aaf91] [^87c6ae9e] [^1388eb1e] [^2ca35069].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Solid-phase assays are the recommended first-line method for HLA antibody detection after allo-HSCT because they provide the sensitivity, specificity, and allele-level resolution needed to identify clinically significant DSA and guide risk mitigation; cell-based crossmatches remain useful adjuncts but should not replace solid-phase testing in contemporary mismatched transplantation practice [^87c6ae9e] [^5ec7a1f3] [^7b2e3dba].

Solid-phase assays are **preferred** for HLA antibody detection after allo-HSCT because they offer higher sensitivity and specificity [^53118bc8], enable allele-level resolution (including HLA-DQ/DP) [^cc234ff3], and provide semiquantitative results (MFI) for risk stratification [^e921613a]. Cell-based assays (CDC/FCXM) are **less sensitive**, require viable donor cells, and cannot define specificities; they should be used only as complementary tests or when solid-phase results are inconclusive [^87c6ae9e] [^b4eff07f]. Solid-phase assays should be performed routinely pre-HSCT and monitored serially, with cell-based assays reserved for select scenarios [^170aaf91] [^87c6ae9e].

## Assay methodologies

### Solid-phase assays

Solid-phase assays (e.g. Luminex single antigen beads) detect HLA antibodies using purified HLA antigens on beads or plates, providing **high sensitivity and specificity** [^53118bc8] and enabling detection of antibodies against HLA class I and II, including HLA-DQ and HLA-DP [^cc234ff3]. They report antibody strength as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), supporting semiquantitative assessment and risk stratification [^e921613a].

---

### Cell-based assays

Cell-based assays (CDC and flow cytometric crossmatch) detect antibodies using viable donor lymphocytes, assessing functional antibody activity. CDC relies on complement-mediated lysis, whereas flow cytometry detects antibody binding to donor cells. These assays are **less sensitive**, require viable donor cells, and cannot define specific HLA specificities [^b4eff07f].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

### Solid-phase assays

- **ASTCT 2024 guidelines**: Recommend solid-phase assays as the primary method for HLA antibody screening and identification in allo-HSCT due to superior sensitivity, specificity, and ability to detect allele-specific antibodies, including HLA-DQ and HLA-DP [^87c6ae9e] [^be35b6d7].
- **Clinical utility**: Solid-phase assays enable early detection of donor-specific antibodies (DSA), which are associated with increased risk of primary graft failure and delayed engraftment [^625f6061] [^2a6ce018]. They also support desensitization strategies and serial monitoring of antibody levels [^e921613a].
- **Limitations**: Solid-phase assays can detect very high antibody levels inaccurately due to prozone effects, which can be mitigated by serum dilution or EDTA treatment [^84bd4420] [^b474df7c].

---

### Cell-based assays

- **ASTCT 2024 guidelines**: Recommend cell-based assays only as complementary tests, not for routine screening, due to lower sensitivity, specificity, and the need for viable donor cells [^87c6ae9e] [^b4eff07f].
- **Clinical utility**: Cell-based assays may be useful when solid-phase results are inconclusive or when functional assessment of antibodies is needed [^notfound].
- **Limitations**: Lower sensitivity, inability to define specific HLA specificities, and logistical challenges in obtaining viable donor cells limit their routine use [^b4eff07f].

Alloantibodies directed against HLA antigens, are a barrier to long-term solid organ allograft survival. The clinical impact of preformed, donor-directed HLA alloantibodies range from acceptable risk to unequivocal contraindication for organ transplantation. HLA antibodies are key factors that limit patient access to donor organs. Serological methods were once the only approach to identify HLA antigens and antibodies. Limitations in these technologies led to the development of solid phase approaches. In the early 1990s, the development of the polymerase chain reaction enabled DNA-based HLA antigen testing to be performed. By the mid-1990s, microparticle-based technology that utilized flow cytometry for analysis was developed to detect both classes I and II HLA antibodies. These methodologies revolutionized clinical histocompatibility testing. The strengths and weaknesses of these assays are described in detail in this review.

### Understanding solid-phase HLA antibody assays and the value of MFI [^c7a45595]. Human Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

As the practice of medicine becomes more reliant on imaging and laboratory tests, medical decisions will be increasingly based on numbers. Accordingly, following the introduction of solid-phase testing to the HLA testing repertoire, laboratory directors and physicians have employed preset mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) thresholds as the basis for decisions in the management of transplant patients. However, what do MFI values mean? The literature is rife with reports detailing numerous factors that influence antibody assessment including (but not limited to) sensitization history of the patient, level of mismatch between donor and recipient, presence of interfering substances in the serum, whether the antigen on multiplex beads is native or denatured, day-to-day and technologist variability, and the historical performance of an assay in a given institution. How are these variables incorporated into the interpretation of MFI values? Herein, the pitfalls and complexities of single antigen bead (SAB) testing and interpretation are discussed with specific attention to what can and cannot be inferred by MFI.

### HLA donor-specific antibodies in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: challenges and opportunities [^09e51adc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell recipients may have preformed antibodies directed against foreign HLA antigens. The use of partially HLA-mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell donors allows for the possibility of the presence of circulating HLA donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) in the recipient. The presence of DSAs at the time of stem cell infusion increases the risk of primary graft failure. More recently developed technology using solid phase immunoassays (SPIs) with fluorochrome-conjugated beads has greatly improved the ability to detect and classify DSAs. When used in combination with the classic lymphocytotoxic complement-dependent and flow cytometric crossmatch tests, SPIs help provide DSA strength assessment. Parous females frequently harbor DSAs. DSAs tend to be of higher intensity when directed against haploidentical first-degree relatives. DSA assessment requires frequent monitoring as their relative strength can change over time. Although the criteria that constitutes a prohibitive DSA is unknown, desensitization techniques can result in engraftment rates as experienced in fully HLA-matched allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation recipients.

### Evolution of HLA testing for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: importance of the candidate's antibody profile for donor selection [^1aa5b7df]. Human Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for several malignant and non-malignant diseases. Access to this life saving therapy was limited by the requirement of an HLA matched donor. Introduction of platforms allowing transplantation with haploidentical and partially mismatched donors has enlarged the donor pool so that most candidates have a possible donor. HLA circulating antibodies specific for the donor's mismatched antigens may cause delayed engraftment and primary graft failure. The role of the HLA laboratory supporting HSCT has expanded to provide HLA antibody detection and monitoring for selection of compatible donors and for monitoring of desensitization treatments. This review gives an outline of the evolution of HSCT and HLA and the current tools available to the HLA team to support donor selection and desensitization treatments in this new era of transplantation.

### ASTCT consensus recommendations on testing and treatment of patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies [^84bd4420]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Solid-phase immunoassays — summary and recommendations state that solid-phase immunoassays have limited capability to detect very high levels of DSA due to interferences with the binding site of fluorescence-conjugated antibodies on HLA antibodies, and that this falsely lower anti-HLA antibody detection/identification (previously called "prozone effect") can be reversed by dilutions and/or by adding EDTA to the recipient serum.

Anti-HLA antibody testing and donor selection — DSA are associated with primary graft failure and delayed engraftment leading to inferior transplant outcomes in HLA-mismatched allogeneic HSCT; anti-HLA antibodies testing should be part of the pre-HSCT work-up, performed within 1 month before starting conditioning regimen in all candidates of HSCT using related, unrelated or cord blood grafts with mismatched HLA antigens or alleles (Grade of recommendation: B, Levels of evidence 2++); to optimize donor cell engraftment, graft function and survival, a donor without corresponding HLA is preferred for a recipient with anti-HLA antibodies, in addition to other donor-related factors affecting transplant outcomes (Grade of recommendation: B, Levels of evidence 2++).

### ASTCT consensus recommendations on testing and treatment of patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies [^cc234ff3]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Solid-phase immunoassays — assay characteristics and limitations include that solid-phase immunoassays test antibodies in recipient serum using purified HLA molecules, which conjugate to microtiter plates or to polystyrene beads; the strength of anti-HLA antibodies, reported as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), can be quantitatively analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or semi-quantitatively by conventional flow cytometer or a fluoroanalyzer (Luminex); the Luminex beads platform has 3 formats ("mix or screen beads", "panel reactive antibody or phenotype", and "single antigen"); this method is semiquantitative, convenient, and has the highest sensitivity and specificity compared to the other assays; limitations include detection of bead-bound non-HLA antibodies, false positives from manufacture-related conformational changes ("cryptic epitope"), and issues with the inhibition effect (sometimes inaccurately referred to as the "prozone effect"); an initial serum pretreatment step has been used to potentially eliminate test inhibitors and more consistently achieve accurate MFI levels.

### Solid phase assays for HLA antibody detection in clinical transplantation [^0d92bb76]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

The complement dependent microlymphocytotoxicity assay has been used for over 40 years for detecting HLA antibodies in transplant patients. This method has been replaced recently by more sensitive solid phase assays such as ELISA and bead based technology including the Luminex method. The introduction of these techniques into clinical practice has revealed previously undetected sensitisation in some patients and allowed the accurate assignment of antibody specificities directed at HLA-DQ and HLA-DP which was not previously possible. However it is emerging that despite the advantage of sensitivity some HLA antibodies defined by these assays are not associated with hyperacute or acute rejection. The role in allograft rejection of antibody titre and non-complement fixing antibodies, which are also detected by these methods, are areas currently under consideration.

### On solid-phase antibody assays [^9613cbcf]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

There is considerable evidence that pre-operative and post-operative anti-human leukocyte antigen (anti-HLA) antibodies are deleterious in thoracic transplantation. While debate continues in heart and lung transplantation on the role of and the diagnosis and treatment of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), central to the discussion is our ability to detect anti-HLA antibodies. This perspective outlines the concerns elicited by new technology for detection of anti-HLA antibodies using solid-phase assays, and highlights the need for functional assays to further understand the clinical significance of these antibodies.

### Depletion of donor-specific anti-HLA A2 alloantibodies in a hematopoietic cell transplant recipient using directed mismatched platelet transfusions [^389fedb2]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Donor-specific anti-HLA alloantibodies (DSA) are a risk factor for graft failure in HLA-mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. This seems to be particularly true when DSA can be detected at a high level in solid-phase assays, or are complement binding as detected in the C1q allo-antibody assay and the complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) crossmatch. DSA may also have a negative impact on overall survival after reduced intensity conditioning. With increasing use of HLA-mismatched stem cell donors and improved diagnostic methods for anti-HLA antibodies, this problem becomes clinically even more relevant. Reduction of DSA prior to transplantation is able to reduce the risk of graft failure and facilitates engraftment. However, it is still unclear which method is the most suitable for desensitization. Here we report the successful desensitization prior to a HLA-A2 mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in a highly immunized patient, demonstrating the incremental effect of directed HLA-A2 mismatched platelet transfusions on the DSA level.

### The role of HLA antibodies in allogeneic SCT: is the 'type-and-screen' strategy necessary not only for blood type but also for HLA? [^a0986c83]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

The role of HLA antibodies in SCT has drawn increasing attention because of the significantly increased number of patients who receive HLA-mismatched SCT, including cord blood transplantation, haploidentical SCT and unrelated SCT. Technical advancements in the methods of HLA Ab testing have realized rapid, accurate and objective identification, as well as quantification of specific HLA antibodies. Recent clinical studies have suggested that the presence of donor-specific HLA antibodies (DSA) in patients is associated with graft failure in HLA-mismatched SCT when the above-listed stem cell sources are used and results in different impacts. Of note, most of the 'HLA-matched' unrelated SCT actually involve HLA mismatches in HLA-DP and the presence of antibodies against this locus has been reported to be associated with graft failure. Thus, HLA Ab should be examined as a work-up for all patients who undergo SCT from 'alternative donors'. The simplest route for preventing HLA Ab-mediated graft failure in Ab-positive patients is to avoid donors who possess the target Ag of HLA antibodies. If SCT from such donors must be performed, treatment for DSA before SCT may improve the chances of successful donor engraftment.

### ASTCT consensus recommendations on testing and treatment of patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies [^156252d3]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (testing), ASTCT 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize the following regarding the two methods to identify anti-HLA antibodies in allogeneic HSCT:

- cell-based assays are now infrequently used due to limitations in both sensitivity and specificity and the requirement for viable donor lymphocytes

- solid-phase immunoassays are increasingly utilized because they can reliably identify antibodies, even with HLA-allele specificity, including HLA-DQ- and HLA-DP-specific antibodies; solid-phase assays are typically semiquantitative, unless titration is performed, and are limited by cost.

### ASTCT consensus recommendations on testing and treatment of patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies [^6d272caf]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) are an important cause of engraftment failure and may negatively impact survival outcomes of patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using an HLA-mismatched allograft. The incidence of DSA varies across studies, depending on individual factors, detection or identification methods and thresholds considered clinically relevant. Although DSA testing by multiplex bead arrays remains semiquantitative, it has been widely adopted as a standard test in most transplant centers. Additional testing to determine risk of allograft rejection may include assays with HLA antigens in natural conformation, such as flow cytometric crossmatch, and/or antibody binding assays, such as C1q testing. Patients with low level of DSA (< 2,000 mean fluorescence intensity; MFI) may not require treatment, while others with very high level of DSA (> 20,000 MFI) may be at very high-risk for engraftment failure despite current therapies. By contrast, in patients with moderate or high level of DSA, desensitization therapy can successfully mitigate DSA levels and improve donor cell engraftment rate, with comparable outcomes to patients without DSA. Treatment is largely empirical and multimodal, involving the removal, neutralization, and blocking of antibodies, as well as inhibition of antibody production to prevent activation of the complement cascade. Desensitization protocols are based on accumulated multicenter experience, while prospective multicenter studies remain lacking. Most patients require a full intensity protocol that includes plasma exchange, while protocols relying only on rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin may be sufficient for patients with lower DSA levels and negative C1q and/or flow cytometric crossmatch. Monitoring DSA levels before and after HSCT could guide preemptive treatment when high levels persist after stem cell infusion. This paper aims to standardize current evidence-based practice and formulate future directions to improve upon current knowledge and advance treatment for this relatively rare, but potentially serious complication in allogeneic HSCT recipients.

Future directions — assay turnaround and protocol variability — solid-phase immunoassays and C1q binding assay require 2–5 days for turnaround time, which limits timely intervention in highly sensitized patients or those with rebound DSA; desensitization protocols vary across centers with different DSA level cutoffs, and a large, prospective, multicenter study is necessary with evaluation of individualized strategies potentially tailored to a patient's DSA levels.

Complement-binding immunoassays for donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) — Complement-binding immunoassays detect anti-HLA antibodies or DSA that can activate the classical complement pathway and a positive C1q assay is associated with high levels of DSA and unfavorable transplant outcomes; although C1q-binding correlates roughly to DSA levels (> 10,000 MFI) and is unclear for intermediate levels (2,000−10,000 MFI), we recommend that complement-binding immunoassays be used before and after desensitization for patients with DSA⩾2,000 MFI in haploidentical HSCT (or > 1,000 MFI in single CBT), and alternatively a flow cytometric crossmatch may be used; grade of recommendation: C, levels of evidence: 2-.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to stem cell transplantation (management of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies, testing), ASTCT 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that solid-phase immunoassays have limited capability to detect very high levels of donor-specific antibodies due to interferences with the binding site of fluorescence-conjugated antibodies on HLA antibodies. Consider diluting and/or adding EDTA to the recipient serum to reverse this falsely lower anti-HLA antibody detection/identification.

Cell-based assays — methods and capabilities note that cell-based assays can be performed by complement-dependent cytotoxicity or flow cytometric crossmatch; the flow cytometric crossmatch has higher sensitivity compared to complement-mediated cytotoxicity, is independent from complement binding, and therefore flow cytometric crossmatch can detect both lower complement-binding and non-complement-binding antibodies.

### Donor HLA-specific abs: to BMT or not to BMT? [^4e8b283a]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The engraftment failure associated with Abs to donor-specific HLA (DSA) limits options for sensitized BMT candidates. Fourteen of fifteen patients with no other viable donor options were desensitized and transplanted using a regimen of plasmapheresis and low-dose i.v. Ig modified to accommodate pre-BMT conditioning. DSA levels were assessed by solid-phase immunoassays and cell-based crossmatch tests. DSA levels were monitored throughout desensitization and on day -1 to determine if there was any DSA rebound that would require additional treatment. A mean reduction in DSA level of 64.4% was achieved at the end of desensitization, with a subsequent reduction of 85.5% after transplantation. DSA in 11 patients was reduced to levels considered negative post-BMT, whereas DSA in three patients remained at low levels. All 14 patients achieved donor engraftment by day +60; however, seven patients suffered disease relapses. Four patients experienced mild, grade 1 GVHD. Factors influencing the response to desensitization include initial DSA strength, number, specificity, DSA rebound and a mismatch repeated from a prior transplant. While desensitization should be reserved for patients with limited donor options, careful DSA assessment and monitoring can facilitate successful engraftment after BMT.

### Can solid phase assays be better utilized to measure efficacy of antibody removal therapies? [^a7d27ecc]. Human Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Antibody removal therapies are used for patients with antibody-mediated-rejection or those requiring desensitization to become transplantable. Accurate measurement of antibody levels prior to, and during treatment, are required to choose the best therapeutic approach, and to provide measure of treatment efficacy. Currently, the FDA does not regard solid-phase assays for HLA-antibody identification as a reliable surrogate-marker for treatment efficacy. Serum samples from 40 patients (58 assays; > 2200 positive data points) undergoing antibody-removal-therapies were tested as sample-pairs, pre- and post-treatment. MFI values of IgG and C1q single-antigen-bead assays were compared with antibody titer values (serial dilutions). Antibody reduction was tracked and the differences in pre-to-post-treatment values were calculated as delta-reduction of antibody levels. Dynamic patterns of titration studies reduced effects of serum-inherent inhibitory factors (prozone-like); eliminated over-saturation limitations, and provided better estimation of antibody-binding strength compared with the other methods. Moreover, delta-reduction of antibody values using titration studies was significantly more uniform compared with either IgG or C1q tests. Analyzing antibody results using only C1q positive or only higher MFI values did not change the overall magnitude of results. Overall, titration studies provided better estimate of responsiveness to treatment and thus can serve as companion to monitoring efficacy of antibody-removal therapies.

### Routine solid phase multiplex anti-HLA antibody tests predict platelet refractoriness [^f80f7755]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

No validated screening methods identify patients at risk for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alloimmune-mediated platelet refractoriness (alloPR). We determined if bead-based HLA antibody tests could predict risk of developing HLA alloPR.

Methods

Hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant patients screened for HLA antibodies without prior refractoriness were identified. Phenotype bead screening results were compared between patients who later did and did not develop alloPR.

Results

Seven of 27 patients identified subsequently developed alloPR. The panel reactive antibody (PRA) and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the 10 most reactive beads in the initial screen were significantly higher among patients who later developed alloPR (P < .001). Specifically, PRA of more than 30% and mean MFI of 1,500 or more in the most reactive beads identified at-risk patients. Administration of HLA-compatible platelets yielded significant posttransfusion count increments compared with routine platelets.

Conclusions

HLA antibody screening by phenotype bead assay may prospectively identify at-risk patients for the development of alloPR. However, clinical trials are needed to validate these findings.

Donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies in HLA-mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) — risk, testing, and desensitization thresholds are outlined as follows: Donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) are an important cause of engraftment failure and may negatively impact survival; multiplex bead array testing is widely adopted though semiquantitative; additional risk assessment may include flow cytometric crossmatch and C1q testing. Patients with low DSA (< 2,000 mean fluorescence intensity; MFI) may not require treatment, whereas very high DSA (> 20,000 MFI) may be at very high risk for engraftment failure despite current therapies. In patients with moderate or high DSA, desensitization therapy can successfully mitigate DSA levels and improve donor cell engraftment rate, with comparable outcomes to patients without DSA; treatment is largely empirical and multimodal (removal/neutralization/blocking of antibodies and inhibition of antibody production to prevent complement activation). Monitoring DSA levels before and after HSCT could guide preemptive treatment when high levels persist after stem cell infusion.

### The road to HLA antibody evaluation: Do not rely on MFI [^5460f025]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Technological advances in HLA laboratory testing undoubtedly improved the sensitivity and specificity of HLA antibody assessment but not without introducing a set of challenges regarding data interpretation. In particular, the introduction of solid-phase single-antigen bead (SAB) antibody assessment brought the belief that mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was a quantifiable value. As such, MFI levels heavily influenced HLA antibody reporting, monitoring, and clinical practice. However, given that SAB testing was neither intended for nor approved to be quantifiable, is the use of MFI in current clinical and laboratory practice valid? What, if anything, does this numerical value actually reveal about the pathogenic potential of the antibody? What are the pitfalls and caveats associated with reporting MFI? Herein, we travel the road to HLA antibody assessment and explore the reliability of MFI values to make clinical decisions.

DSA monitoring cadence and prognostic threshold — at least weekly monitoring after starting desensitization or stem cell infusion for approximately one month, until antibody clearance or successful engraftment, has been applied in some studies, and DSA above 1,000 MFI at day 7 was associated with primary poor graft function compared with DSA < 1,000 MFI (33% vs. 0%, P = 0.040); monthly monitoring after stem cell infusion has been described but its clinical relevance remains uncertain.

### Diagnostic accuracy of solid phase HLA antibody assays for prediction of crossmatch strength [^012fcae6]. Human Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Solid phase antibody assays are increasingly used to provide quantitative measures of donor-specific HLA antibodies for assessment of pretransplant risk, although cell-based crossmatches continue to serve as gold standards for determination of donor HLA antibody strength. This study determined the ability of HLA antibody solid phase assays to predict the strength of cell-based flow cytometric (FC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) crossmatches. Eighty-two recipient/donors pairs were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to determine the accuracy of donor-specific median fluorescence intensity values (Σ MFI) from single antigen bead assays for predicting strong FC and CDC crossmatches. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of optimal Σ MFI values were highest for predicting strong T cell FCs. Σ MFI values showed good sensitivity for predicting positive direct and AHG-augmented CDC crossmatches (91% and 94%, respectively), but with lower specificity (67% each). Specificity and sensitivity for predicting positive B cell CDC crossmatches were 73% and 84%. Σ MFI values derived from single antigen bead assays can predict strong flow and positive CDC crossmatches, but with tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity. The results support the use of solid phase assays for quantitative virtual crossmatching and as a replacement for cell-based crossmatching.

Histocompatibility testing is essential for donor identification and risk assessment in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Additionally, it is useful for identifying donor specific alleles for monitoring donor specific antibodies in post-transplant patients. Next-generation sequence (NGS) based human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing has improved many aspects of histocompatibility testing in hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplant. HLA disease association testing and research has also benefited from the advent of NGS technologies. In this review we discuss the current impact and future applications of NGS typing on clinical histocompatibility testing for transplant and non-transplant purposes.

### Comprehensive assessment and standardization of solid phase multiplex-bead arrays for the detection of antibodies to HLA [^f84a2190]. American Journal of Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Solid phase multiplex-bead arrays for the detection and characterization of HLA antibodies provide increased sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional lymphocyte-based assays. Assay variability due to inconsistencies in commercial kits and differences in standard operating procedures (SOP) hamper comparison of results between laboratories. The Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation Antibody Core Laboratories investigated sources of assay variation and determined if reproducibility improved through utilization of SOP, common reagents and normalization algorithms. Ten commercial kits from two manufacturers were assessed in each of seven laboratories using 20 HLA reference sera. Implementation of a standardized (vs. a nonstandardized) operating procedure greatly reduced MFI variation from 62% to 25%. Although laboratory agreements exceeded 90% (R²), small systematic differences were observed suggesting center specific factors still contribute to variation. MFI varied according to manufacturer, kit, bead type and lot. ROC analyses showed excellent consistency in antibody assignments between manufacturers (AUC > 0.9) and suggested optimal cutoffs from 1000 to 1500 MFI. Global normalization further reduced MFI variation to levels near 20%. Standardization and normalization of solid phase HLA antibody tests will enable comparison of data across laboratories for clinical trials and diagnostic testing.

### The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) consensus guidelines for the detection and treatment of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) in haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation [^3debba77]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Haploidentical donors are now increasingly considered for transplantation in the absence of HLA-matched donors or when an urgent transplant is needed. Donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) have been recently recognized as an important barrier against successful engraftment of donor cells, which can affect transplant survival. DSA appear more prevalent in this type of transplant due to higher likelihood of alloimmunization of multiparous females against offspring's HLA antigens, and the degree of mismatch. Here we summarize the evidence for the role of DSA in the development of primary graft failure in haploidentical transplantation and provide consensus recommendations from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplant Group on testing, monitoring, and treatment of patients with DSA receiving haploidentical hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of candidates for kidney transplantation [^53118bc8]. Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

KDIGO HLA antibody assays and HLA typing scope — There are two basic assays for detecting HLA antibodies: cytotoxic and solid phase. Cytotoxic assays are both insensitive and non-specific, with frequent false positive results due to irrelevant IgM or non-HLA antibodies, whereas solid phase assays are engineered to specifically detect HLA antibodies and are significantly more sensitive, although far more specific than cytotoxic assays some non-specificity may occur with solid phase assays as well. Where resources permit the use of single antigen bead assays, full delineation of antibody specificities should be performed to permit calculation of a cPRA and compilation of a list of antibody specificities for comparison to all future potential donors. Notwithstanding regulatory requirements of any particular jurisdiction, complete HLA typing by molecular method is optimal; at a minimum, typing should be completed at loci required to interpret any detectable HLA antibodies, and optimally, HLA typing should be completed at all loci (HLA-A, B, C; DRB1, 3, 4, 5; DQA1, DQB1; DPA1, DPB1).

### Genotyping applications for transplantation and transfusion management: the emory experience [^441fffe6]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Current genotyping methodologies for transplantation and transfusion management employ multiplex systems that allow for simultaneous detection of multiple HLA antigens, human platelet antigens, and red blood cell (RBC) antigens. The development of high-resolution, molecular HLA typing has led to improved outcomes in unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplants by better identifying compatible alleles of the HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 antigens. In solid organ transplantation, the combination of high-resolution HLA typing with solid-phase antibody identification has proven of value for highly sensitized patients and has significantly reduced incompatible crossmatches at the time of organ allocation. This database-driven, combined HLA antigen/antibody testing has enabled routine implementation of "virtual crossmatching" and may even obviate the need for physical crossmatching. In addition, DNA-based testing for RBC antigens provides an alternative typing method that mitigates many of the limitations of hemagglutination-based phenotyping. Although RBC genotyping has utility in various transfusion settings, it has arguably been most useful for minimizing alloimmunization in the management of transfusion-dependent patients with sickle cell disease or thalassemia. The availability of high-throughput RBC genotyping for both individuals and large populations of donors, along with coordinated informatics systems to compare patients' antigen profiles with available antigen-negative and/or rare blood-typed donors, holds promise for improving the efficiency, reliability, and extent of RBC matching for this population.

Several approaches have been developed, including administration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) or selective α/β T-cell and B-cell depletion; however, graft failure mediated by residual host T-cells or donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) remains a major obstacle associated with high treatment-related mortality.

Presensitization against a broad array of HLA is associated with prolonged waiting times and inferior kidney allogaft survival. Although the use of solid phase assay (SPA) for the detection and characterization of anti-HLA antibodies provides greater sensitivity than complement-dependent lymphocytotoxicity (CDC) assay, it often detects donor specific antibodies (DSA) which turn out to be clinically irrelevant. Our data reinforce the concept that these two types of assays should be used in parallel for pre-and post-transplantation monitoring of anti-HLA antibodies in recipients of solid organ allografts.

### Transfer of donor anti-HLA antibody expression to multiple transplant recipients: a potential variant of the passenger lymphocyte syndrome? [^3a91b2dc]. American Journal of Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Antibody-mediated rejection, whereby transplant recipient B cells and/or plasma cells produce alloreactive anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies, negatively influences transplant outcomes and is a major contributor to graft loss. An early humoral immune response is suggested by the production of anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies (DSA) that can be measured using solid phase assays. We report the early posttransplant coexistence of a shared anti-HLA antibody profile in 5 solid organ transplant recipients who received organs from the same donor. Retrospective analysis of the donor's serum confirmed the presence of the same anti-HLA profile, suggesting the transfer of donor-derived anti-HLA antibodies, or the cells that produce them, to multiple solid organ transplant recipients. The time frame and extent of transfer suggest a novel variant of the passenger lymphocyte syndrome. These findings have important implications for the consideration of all posttransplant antibody measurements, particularly the interpretation of non-DSAs in the sera of transplant recipients.

The introduction of more sensitive solid phase assays in addition to the current gold standard, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, will have an obvious impact on the allocation provided that the results have the same value. However, in contrast to a positive complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch because of donor HLA-specific antibodies, which is considered a contraindication for transplantation, antibodies detected in the solid phase are a risk factor rather than a contraindication. Furthermore, the higher sensitivity of Luminex-based screening assays, especially, will lead to a significantly higher number of highly sensitized patients and may affect the exclusivity of the acceptable mismatch program, which was initiated to give priority to highly sensitized patients. More data on the clinical relevance of antibodies detected by solid phase assays are necessary before their relevance for organ allocation can be established.

### Flow cytometry with anti HLA-antibodies: a simple but highly sensitive method for monitoring chimerism and minimal residual disease after HLA-mismatched stem cell transplantation [^74f9468c]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Transplantation of HLA-mismatched stem cells may allow determination of chimerism status of single cells by differential expression of HLA molecules. Monoclonal antibodies against HLA antigens can be used to determine the HLA type of sub-populations by standard flow cytometry. Blood samples from 23 patients transplanted from HLA-mismatched family donors were monitored using HLA-specific antibodies. Suitable antibodies could be found for all donor recipient pairs by using differences in HLA Bw4 and Bw6 groups or other serological antigens. Pretransplant controls of donor and recipient were used to correct for variable fluorescence intensities of the antibodies and sub-populations. Owing to the high sensitivity, cell populations with a minimum frequency of 0.1% were detectable. Flow-cytometric analysis was confirmed by chimerism analysis of immunomagnetically isolated T cells by standard PCR technique. In addition to chimerism evaluation, HLA antibodies improved the detection of leukemic cells after transplantation with aberrant phenotype. In conclusion, flow cytometry using antibodies against HLA antigens is an interesting tool for determination of chimerism and minimal residual disease after HLA-mismatched transplantation. Information about the chimerism status is given on a single-cell level and allows fast and convenient analysis of sub-populations.

### Defining the structural basis for human alloantibody binding to human leukocyte antigen allele HLA-A✱11: 01 [^d190520c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

These data represent the first step in deriving a detailed understanding of the biology of human anti-HLA alloantibodies. Based on these data, we propose that 2E3 represents an antibody that can be developed upon HLA sensitization, and provides insights on the antibody germline recombination that underlies a well-defined HLA allele specificity. This is important because the detection of polyclonal anti-HLA antibodies in allosera based on the current solid-phase assay is not enough to predict chronic rejection responses. While many groups have described significantly worse graft outcomes in DSA-positive patients, others have shown that HLA-specific DSAs can be detected in long-term graft survivors with stable graft function. This suggests that there is a degree of heterogeneity in the functionality and pathogenicity of an alloantibody response that cannot be assayed based on our current methods. Factors that include the specific epitope targeted, titer, affinity, and subclass have been proposed to influence the pathogenicity of an alloantibody response –. Thus, the repertoire of monoclonal human anti-HLA antibodies and structurally defined epitopes needs to expand to improve upon our predictive assays for triaging transplant recipients into those who should tolerate their graft in the long-term versus those who will require careful monitoring for the onset of chronic antibody-mediated rejection.

### Donor-specific antibodies and primary graft failure in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^625f6061]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

With the increasing number of non-matched donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCTs) has come increasing evidence regarding factors affecting graft outcomes. One factor affecting graft outcomes currently being evaluated is anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies (DSAs). In this, we analyzed the clinical relevance of anti-HLA DSAs in patients who have undergone HSCT at a population level by conducting a systematic review of existing literature. A comprehensive search was conducted through PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, and Web of Science from inception to January 1, 2021. A meta-analysis was performed of the association between anti-HLA DSAs and primary graft failure (PGF) with further subgroup analyses. The search was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 920 eligible citations were identified, out of which 15 studies were included in the final meta-analyses after application of rigorous selection criteria and independent review. A total of 2436 patients were included in these 15 studies. Patients with anti-HLA DSAs prior to undergoing HSCT had a 7.47-fold increased risk of PGF failure compared with patients without anti-HLA DSAs (odds ratio, 7.47; 95% confidence interval, 4.54 to 12.28, P < .001; I² = 28.91%, P = 0.1315). In subgroup and meta-regression analyses, area, Newcastle Ottawa Scale score, mean fluorescence intensity cutoff, primary disease, HSCT type, graft source, and pretransplantation desensitization did not affect the impact of anti-HLA DSAs on PGF. There also was no significant difference in impact between HLA class I and II on PGF. We conclude that the prior presence of anti-HLA DSAs has a negative impact on graft outcomes in recipients of haploidentical and umbilical cord blood HSCT.

Solid-phase testing

Pretransplant panel-reactive antibody was determined using FlowBeads (One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA). Because various techniques for specificity determination were used throughout the years, data were not comparable. Therefore, to make data comparable and more sensitive, we (1) retested donor HLA using SSP (One Lambda) to identify minor histocompatibility antigens (Cw, DP) not determined originally and (2) retested serums collected pretransplant and 6 and 12 months post transplant using one lot of single antigen bead assay on Luminex platform. Specificities and mean fluorescent intensities were determined following the manufacturer's instructions (GenProbe, San Diego, CA). DSAs are specificities against donor HLA antigens. Non-DSAs are specificities directed against HLA antigens other than the donor's. Positive FCXM in the absence of anti-HLA specificities were considered non-HLA antibodies.

Statistics

Results were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier survival curve, two-way t -tests, and χ² test using Graphpad Prism Software (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA). Significance was defined as P ≤ 0.05.

Study Overview Allogeneic blood or bone marrow transplant remains the definitive curative treatment for many with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. In recent years, increased use of alternative -matched) donors has led to increased rates of donor specific antibodies. DSA are pre-formed HLA-antibodies in the recipient directed against the donor's class I and/or class II HLA antigens. DSA can be formed by exposure to foreign HLA antigens most commonly by pregnancy, blood transfusions, and previous organ or blood transplantation. High levels of circulating anti-HLA antibodies directed towards mismatched donor HLA antigens at the time of alloBMT can dramatically increase the risk of primary graft failure.

The strength of these donor specific antibodies can be assessed with several methodologies including cross-matched cellular based assays or the more sensitive solid phase immunoassay that estimates antibody level. In this single-institution study at the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, we will identify patients in whom alloBMT is indicated, but where DSA levels are above a pre-defined threshold using a proprietary algorithm that combines information from flow cytometric crossmatch and SPI -DSA Semi-Quant Screen Score).

3.2 HLA antibody subclass

Cell‐based and solid‐phase assays testing for HLA antibodies traditionally identify antibodies of the IgG isotype. However, these assays do not distinguish between stronger complement‐fixing IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses from the lesser complement‐fixing IgG2 and IgG4, given that the detection reagent is specific for all Fcγ. Different routes of allosensitization trigger distinct patterns of IgG subclasses directed against HLA. 33, 34, 35 Preliminary studies of HLA antibody subclasses suggest that IgG2 and IgG4 do not constitute a large proportion of HLA DSAs. Rather, HLA IgG1 and IgG3 are the predominant subclasses associated with graft rejection and graft loss. 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 Although preformed IgG3 DSAs may be associated with risk of acute rejection, DSAs of the IgG2 and IgG4 subclasses are not associated with absence of rejection (i.e. these subclasses are not demonstrably benign). 36, 41 This may be due to the fact that IgG4 arises from repeated antigen stimulation such as is seen in allergy or chronic infection and that the γ2 and γ4 genes are further downstream on the germline and often only produced after sequential switching from other γ immunoglobulins. 28, 42, 43, 44, 45 Importantly, current reagents to determine IgG subclasses in the context of HLA‐SAB assays have cross‐reactivity/lack of specificity. 46 Moreover, all studies to date attempting to define the IgG subclass of HLA antibodies have conceded that 10%‐20% of total IgG‐positive HLA antibodies could not be classified by any of the 4 IgG subclass‐specific reagents. 36 Other technical limitations include difficulties in directly comparing concentrations of the individual IgG subclasses, different affinities of reagents, and the relative abundance of each subclass. 34, 47, 48 Finally, virtually all patients present with a mixture of HLA DSA subclasses. All of these aforementioned issues make it difficult to draw robust conclusions regarding mechanisms of injury related to a given subclass of DSA and their individual impact on transplant outcome.

Gaps requiring further research:
Development of analytically validated reagents to study different strengths/titers of IgG antibody subclass in the context of commercially available HLA antibody testing platforms.
Longitudinal analyses of HLA antibody subclasses are needed, given that this is a dynamic and responsive biological system.
The mechanisms of graft injury by different subclasses are unknown and need to be confirmed in experimental transplant models and in situ in allografts. This is required for assessing treatment strategies aimed at manipulating IgG subclass diversity.

DSA and the diagnosis of ABMR

Terasaki et al identified HLA antibodies in the serum of patients after transplantation nearly 45 years ago. However, the importance of a low-strength antibody that is undetectable by cell-based methodology was not recognized until studies from the same group, three decades later, discovered a strong association between HLA antibodies detected by solid-phase assays and graft failure.

DSA may be directed against HLA or other endothelial cell antigens, and its presence is required for the diagnosis of acute and chronic active ABMR. In addition, there is growing evidence supporting the roles of preformed and de novo DSA as independent risk factors for acute and chronic ABMR and graft loss. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that the presence of DSA before transplantation was associated with a twofold greater risk of acute rejection and a 75% greater risk of graft loss. Despite these findings, our understanding of the biological relevance of DSA remains limited. In vitro studies suggest that anti-HLA class I alloantibodies result in endothelial cell injury and activation through both complement-dependent and complement-independent pathways. However, little is known about signal transduction in response to class II antibodies or the pathogenesis of DSA-induced renal allograft injury in actual patients. It is important to note that not all DSA fix complement or cause ABMR and, conversely, not all episodes of acute graft injury with capillary inflammation and C4d deposition are associated with DSA being detectable with standard assays. In fact, the majority of patients with DSA maintain normal kidney function for years and have long-term outcomes similar to nonsensitized patients.

Another important limitation is that currently available HLA antibody tests are qualitative and have not been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for quantitative measurements. More studies are needed to identify risk stratification strategies on the basis of semiquantitative measures of DSA and calculated panel reactive antibody (PRA), subclasses of immunoglobulin G anti-HLA antibodies, and C1q complement-fixing DSA. Pending the results of collaborative standardization studies, consensus guidelines on the testing and clinical management issues associated with HLA and non-HLA antibodies in transplantation were recently published. These recommendations are intended to provide guidance on the use and clinical application of contemporary methods for HLA antibody detection.

### ASTCT consensus recommendations on testing and treatment of patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies [^93d79903]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

DSA levels associated with clinical significance — haploidentical transplantation: Pre-transplant IgG donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) ≥ 5,000 MFI on single-antigen bead assay were reported as a significant risk factor for engraftment failure in haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and some reported that graft failure occurs only in patients with DSA > 5,000 MFI at the time of HSCT. Very high pre-transplant DSA levels > 20,000 MFI were very difficult to decrease to safe levels using current desensitization methods and were significantly associated not only with engraftment failure, but also with poor platelet engraftment, higher non-relapse mortality (NRM), and inferior survival, while lower level DSA appear to be less deleterious. In a prospective study, DSA > 2,000 MFI correlated with primary poor graft function and increased NRM; a 2,000 MFI cutoff was proposed because no engraftment failures were observed when DSA were below 2,000 MFI in a larger case-controlled retrospective study, and in patients with DSA > 2,000 MFI the risk for engraftment failure appears to progressively increase with higher DSA levels, and if antibodies bind complement.

Patients at risk for sub-optimal outcome post-transplant are defined as having a PRA > 10% or donor-directed antibodies at the time of transplantation. Post-transplantation monitoring for donor-specific antibodies (DSA) should be performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-operatively, with low-risk patients monitored annually after the first year and sensitized patients more frequently. DSA testing should be performed for any patient presenting with symptoms or signs of graft dysfunction.

### Utility of HLA antibody testing in kidney transplantation [^2e27ba71]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

HLA antigens are polymorphic proteins expressed on donor kidney allograft endothelium and are critical targets for recipient immune recognition. HLA antibodies are risk factors for acute and chronic rejection and allograft loss. Solid-phase immunoassays for HLA antibody detection represent a major advance in sensitivity and specificity over cell-based methods and are widely used in organ allocation and pretransplant risk assessment. Post-transplant, development of de novo donor-specific HLA antibodies and/or increase in donor-specific antibodies from pretransplant levels are associated with adverse outcomes. Although single antigen bead assays have allowed sensitive detection of recipient HLA antibodies and their specificities, a number of interpretive considerations must be appreciated to understand test results in clinical and research contexts. This review, which is especially relevant for clinicians caring for transplant patients, discusses the technical aspects of single antigen bead assays, emphasizes their quantitative limitations, and explores the utility of HLA antibody testing in identifying and managing important pre- and post-transplant clinical outcomes.

Figure 2
Call for immediate action: highlights area where progress can be achieved within the near future, or where action is required in order to drive progress

The clinical utility of an assay requires evidence of an improved, measurable, clinical outcome that is directly related to the use of the test; that is, the test should add significant value to patient care. This takes into consideration how the assay is interpreted and how results are reported (positive/negative vs continuous scale) and applied. Unfortunately, while proper evaluation of an assay's clinical utility requires prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs), to date new assays in the field of transplantation report prospective/retrospective observational correlations, at best. In the absence of RCTs, evaluation of clinical utility is inferred based on systematic reviews and/or meta‐analytic approaches.

A systematic review collects, critically appraises, and summarizes the empirical evidence that fits a prespecified eligibility criterion. Meta‐analysis is a statistical approach that assigns a point estimate (of an unknown "common truth") from individual studies and pools results of multiple studies based on a weighted average. Most often, the random‐effects model is used to express heterogeneity across disparate studies. A key benefit of this approach is the accumulation of information to reach higher statistical power. The end result, however, is an estimate of a mean parameter across population‐of‐studies rather than a population of patients. 6, 7 This is especially true in publications assessing HLA antibodies as different studies use different testing methods and criteria to define the presence or absence of those antibodies.

A significant limitation of both systematic reviews and meta‐analysis is "publication bias". 8, 9, 10 It is well established that most manuscripts accepted for publication report on research that shows a significant result, usually in favor of a new treatment/test. "Negative result" submissions are rarely published. Thus, a literature search is fundamentally biased as it is unlikely to identify publications with negative results. Many studies have identification problems arising from imperfections in the internal and external validity of the study, which cannot be fixed by the use of meta‐analysis. It was therefore reported that the relevance of systematic reviews and meta‐analysis to personalized patient care is not evident and cannot replace well‐designed prospective clinical trials. 11 See the call for immediate action in this regard (Figure 2).

DSA levels — summary and recommendations: Current evidence suggests that DSA < 2,000 MFI in haploidentical HSCT and < 1,000 MFI in single CBT have minimal impact on graft outcome and desensitization is not required. (Levels of evidence 2+). We recommend repeated DSA testing within 2 weeks of starting conditioning regimen in transplant recipients with previous history of low level DSA (< 2,000 MFI in haploidentical HSCT and < 1,000 MFI in single CBT) who have high risk of increased DSA levels such as receiving multiple units of blood transfusion or granulocyte infusion. (Grade of recommendation: C; Levels of evidence 2-). Higher DSA levels are associated with poor graft function, graft failure, and worse survival. A DSA level > 1,000 MFI for CBT and > 2,000 MFI for haploidentical and unrelated HSCT might serve as a threshold to initiate desensitization. (Grade of recommendation: C, Levels of evidence 2+).

Where resources permit the use of single antigen bead assays, full delineation of antibody specificities should be performed to permit the calculation of a cPRA and compilation of a list of antibody specificities for comparison to future potential donors.

4 ALLO‐SPECIFIC B AND T CELL IMMUNE MEMORY

Although HLA antibodies in the circulation pose best known apparent and immediate risk to the allograft, many patients may harbor adaptive memory T and B cell responses that, at the time of clinical consideration, are not apparent. STAR 2017 identified the lack of available assays to robustly detect B and T cell memory that have the potential to rapidly mount allo‐specific responses as a significant gap. Here we provide a more in‐depth summary of available assays.

4.1 B cells

Current assays to determine prior sensitization to HLA antigen measure preformed circulating HLA antibodies (IgG). This reflects antibody production by long‐lived plasma cells in the bone marrow and/or ongoing generation of short‐lived plasma cells. Yet, humoral sensitization that resulted in the generation of memory B cells that are capable of mounting an amnestic response early posttransplant remain undetected. 62, 63, 64 When driven into recall responses, the majority of memory B cells rapidly convert into antibody‐secreting cells (ASCs) and produce highly specific HLA antibodies, leading to acute AMR. 64 Prior sensitizing events resulting in HLA antibody generation may have occurred decades before transplant assessment, and as such, the breadth and strength of antibodies detected in the circulation may not reflect the breadth and depth of plasma cells or memory B cells that had been generated at the time of antigen exposure. In addition, loss of plasma cells or memory B cells may independently occur over time. 65, 66 Finally, there is a qualitative difference in affinity between memory B cells that tend to have lower B cell receptor affinity compared with antibodies produced by plasma cells (Table 3). 67

### Preformed cytotoxic antibodies in potential allograft recipients: recent data [^68feaf3a]. Human Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Presensitization to donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA) remains a major barrier to cell and organ transplantation, thereby contributing to patient mortality. The risks associated with transplantation in the presence of preformed antidonor HLA antibodies range from hyperacute rejection and increased frequency and severity of rejection to no appreciable effect on transplant outcome. Recent evidence has emphasized the importance of immunologic history, anti-HLA antibody class and titer, and differential organ susceptibility to antibody-mediated damage to explain differences in risk for antibody-mediated rejection. Furthermore, in studies of endothelial cells, ligation of class I molecules by subsaturating concentrations of antibodies stimulated expression of cell survival proteins, raising the possibility that, under certain conditions, antibodies promote graft accommodation providing a mechanism for the endothelium to resist immune and inflammatory damage. The discovery of capillary-bound C4d as a robust diagnostic marker for antibody-mediated rejection, coupled with the development of solid-phase assays for the identification of HLA-specific antibodies, has enhanced our ability to detect antibody-mediated rejection and interpret cross-match results. With new diagnostic tools and immunosuppression regimens such as plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy targeting the humoral immune response, it is time for a concerted effort to reassess the role of alloantibodies in acute and chronic rejection.

Risk factors for developing anti-HLA antibodies and donor-specific antibodies — higher anti-HLA antibody prevalence has been reported among female compared with male recipients, and higher anti-HLA antibody levels have been noted in parous compared with nulliparous females, with pregnancy representing a strong risk factor; this risk increases in child donor to mother recipient hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and may be amplified by a higher number of pregnancies. Female recipients were observed to have higher DSA levels compared to male recipients. Middle-age and older patients were more likely to have detectable anti-HLA antibodies compared with pediatric or younger patients. Exposure to foreign HLA antigens from transfusions of cellular blood products was reported to increase risk of HLA alloimmunization, particularly with platelet and leukocyte containing products, whereas mature red blood cells express HLA class I at low level and platelets express HLA class I antigens.

### Non-donor specific anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies are not associated with poor outcome in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [^5b21db0a]. Human Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Testing for anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies has now become standard practice in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and anti-HLA antibodies (both donor specific and non-donor specific) are being identified and have many potential consequences. Most studies suggest that donor-specific HLA antibodies lead to adverse outcomes, though little is reported on non-donor specific anti-HLA antibodies. We present the results of a retrospective cohort analysis of 157 patients who received HSCT at the University of Rochester over a period of four years. We identified 45 patients (28.7%) who had detectable anti-HLA antibodies, while only one patient (0.6%) had donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies. Patients with prior pregnancies and multiple transfusions were at increased risk to develop antibodies. In our cohort, the presence of non-donor specific anti-HLA antibodies did not significantly impact overall survival, progression free survival, graft failure, or transplant-related mortality.

DISCUSSION

There is strong evidence that anti-HLA antibodies contribute to the development of CR, the leading cause of renal allograft failure. While it is hoped that post-transplant alloantibody surveillance might facilitate early diagnosis, there are few guidelines regarding how monitoring should be performed and results interpreted. This report summarizes our experience in attempting to develop a utilitarian and clinically informative monitoring paradigm by correlating clinical outcome with longitudinal changes in FCXM and solid-phase assay reactivity occurring during the first post-transplant year. We intentionally excluded patients with preoperatively negative FCXM who typically experience excellent graft survival and minimal CR. We also excluded nine patients with preoperatively positive FCXM because of non-HLA antibodies and a small subgroup of group I (n = 3) with slower antibody elimination. Instead, we focused our attention upon patients with preoperatively positive FCXM because of preformed anti-HLA antibody who, at this center, have poorer graft survival. Changes in specificity techniques throughout the years made original specificity data incomparable. To standardize the data, we reassayed patient serum for anti-HLA specificities using one lot of single antigen beads on a Luminex platform and also retested donor HLA for minor histocompatibility antigens not determined originally. Consistent with a recent report, the enhanced sensitivity of single antigen bead testing allowed identification of DSA and non-DSA in 100% of study patients.

Temporal changes in alloantibody levels were consistent whether measured using FCXM or solid-phase assay. Two post-transplant profiles emerged and showed different clinical outcomes. Patients showing complete elimination of alloantibody enjoyed excellent graft survival and few complications. In contrast, patients failing to eliminate alloantibody had poorer outcomes and higher incidence of CR. Following delineation of specific groups, pretransplant antibody characteristics were compared with the hope that some distinguishing parameters would predict post-transplant outcome. However, similar to previous reports, pretransplant characteristics proved inadequate indicators of post-transplant developments. Before transplant, groups were equivalent in terms of demographics, donor characteristics, alloantibody levels, and specificities. Alloantibodies against class I predominated in all groups. However, group II did show a greater total amount of non-DSA against class II than group I.

In the present study, we summarize six cases (four renal transplant recipients, one multivisceral recipient, and one heart-and-lung transplant recipient) to illustrate the role of the histocompatibility laboratory in providing the most comprehensive workup to assess the risk of graft dysfunction associated with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). These cases illustrate the potential risk assessment for AMR in various situations: (1) in patients exhibiting low levels of DSA pretransplantation; (2) protocol immunosuppression minimization during stepwise weaning; and (3) desensitization protocols. Furthermore, increased sensitivity of DSA determination is indicated for the interpretation of focal C4d and its clinical significance. The clinical relevance of monitoring for circulating DSA with solid-phase single-antigen assays is also discussed. These cases exemplify the rationale for all patients to be monitored for DSA post-transplantation, with the frequency adjusted based on the individual risk for AMR.

### Donor-specific anti-HLA abs and graft failure in matched unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^a899343b]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Anti-HLA donor-specific Abs (DSAs) have been reported to be associated with graft failure in mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; however, their role in the development of graft failure in matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation remains unclear. We hypothesize that DSAs against a mismatched HLA-DPB1 locus is associated with graft failure in this setting. The presence of anti-HLA Abs before transplantation was determined prospectively in 592 MUD transplantation recipients using mixed-screen beads in a solid-phase fluorescent assay. DSA identification was performed using single-Ag beads containing the corresponding donor's HLA-mismatched Ags. Anti-HLA Abs were detected in 116 patients (19.6%), including 20 patients (3.4%) with anti-DPB1 Abs. Overall, graft failure occurred in 19 of 592 patients (3.2%), including 16 of 584 (2.7%) patients without anti-HLA Abs compared with 3 of 8 (37.5%) patients with DSA (P = 0.0014). In multivariate analysis, DSAs were the only factor highly associated with graft failure (P = 0.0001; odds ratio = 21.3). Anti-HLA allosensitization was higher overall in women than in men (30.8% vs 12.1%; P < .0001) and higher in women with 1 (P = 0.008) and 2 or more pregnancies (P = 0.0003) than in men. We conclude that the presence of anti-DPB1 DSAs is associated with graft failure in MUD hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

### Post-transplantation antibody monitoring and HLA antibody epitope identification [^09e6aab6]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

We earlier reviewed the reasons to believe that HLA antibodies are the cause of chronic rejection. In this review we shall focus on two questions: first, why is it important to test transplant recipients for alloantibody post-transplantation? Recent large-scale prospective studies on the effect of alloantibodies on graft survival showed that rates of graft failure more than doubled in recipients who had alloantibodies compared with antibody-free patients. The causal relationship between alloantibody and transplant rejection-especially chronic rejection-has been demonstrated both experimentally and clinically. We recommend universal testing of allograft recipients for antibodies since that will help clinicians identify this obvious risk factor and take appropriate action to minimize deterioration of transplant function. Second, why is it important to identify HLA antibody epitopes? Since HLA antibody is a potential cause of graft rejection, identifying the epitope-or antigenic determinant-to which an antibody binds, becomes very important. Such identification lets clinicians target the real transplant antigen and may lay a foundation for the development of new treatments and/or new matching strategies to reduce the occurrence of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). Now that natural HLA antibodies have been identified; it is important to distinguish these from donor-specific epitopes. The establishment of 103 HLA class I epitopes, 83 class II, and 7 major-histocompatibility-complex class I-related chain A (MICA) epitopes is reviewed. Single antigen bead technology has been important in identifying the epitopes by experiment.

### 7th international immunoglobulin conference: transplantation [^cb159d00]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

The data presented highlight the complexity of the immune response during transplantation. Early identification and characterization of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSAs) allows for identification of patients at high risk of transplant rejection and offers information regarding appropriate intervention strategies. The availability of new diagnostic tools can also detect the presence of complement-binding antibodies, providing further information as to the cytotoxic potential of these antibodies. It is particularly encouraging to note that monitoring transplant recipients for the presence of various immune cells or immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels can provide detailed information regarding those at high risk for complications and therefore increased morbidity and mortality. Intervention strategies, either before or after transplantation, may potentially increase the long-term survival of allografts, thus enhancing patient outcomes. Future trials are warranted to assess these strategies in more detail.
