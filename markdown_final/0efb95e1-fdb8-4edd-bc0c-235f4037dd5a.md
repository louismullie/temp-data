## Question

After a CVA successfully treated with tPA, how long should Brilinta be continued?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long Brilinta (ticagrelor) should be continued after an acute ischemic stroke successfully treated with IV tPA. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory labeling and who was actually studied in the pivotal stroke trials. Then, I should verify whether thrombolysis recipients were included or excluded. Next, I will review AHA/ASA guideline recommendations on antiplatelet timing and choice after tPA. Finally, I will synthesize the safety profile and evidence gaps to decide if ticagrelor has a role here and, if not, outline the standard approach and duration with supported options [^114NF5z5] [^1129PSqf].

> Let me first confirm the labeled indication and the core evidence base. Ticagrelor is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS ≤ 5) or high-risk TIA, with a regimen of a 180 mg loading dose followed by 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days, based largely on the THALES program where ticagrelor was added to aspirin in the first 30 days after minor stroke or high-risk TIA [^114NF5z5] [^114Unmk1] [^111P4SpK].

> Wait, let me verify whether patients who received thrombolysis (tPA) were represented in those trials. In THALES, patients who had received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were excluded, and the same exclusion applied in SOCRATES, which compared ticagrelor to aspirin monotherapy in acute non-severe stroke or TIA and prohibited IV or intra-arterial thrombolysis within 24 hours before randomization [^111P4SpK] [^115xmg75].

> Hold on, I should verify the FDA labeling language because that often clarifies scope. The U.S. prescribing information explicitly notes that patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and states that the use of Brilinta in such patients is not recommended, which directly addresses the post-tPA setting for acute ischemic stroke [^1129PSqf].

> At first glance, I might think THALES' benefit could support broader early ticagrelor use after ischemic stroke; but wait, that would be a misapplication because THALES' signal for reduced stroke or death at 30 days with ticagrelor plus aspirin was generated in patients with non-cardioembolic minor strokes or high-risk TIA who did not receive thrombolysis, and it came with higher severe bleeding rates, reinforcing caution even in the studied population [^1123TWQT] [^111P4SpK] [^1115oNuX].

> Next, I should review guideline-aligned practice after IV alteplase. Standard management is to withhold antiplatelet therapy for the first 24 hours after alteplase, obtain follow-up brain imaging to exclude hemorrhagic transformation, and then initiate aspirin monotherapy if no hemorrhage is present; dual antiplatelet therapy is reserved for select patients with minor non-cardioembolic stroke or high-risk TIA who did not receive IV thrombolysis, consistent with the CHANCE/POINT paradigm and subsequent recommendations [^115GgZv4] [^1151QBwL].

> But wait, what if data from thrombolysis in other vascular beds could apply here? The TREAT trial in STEMI patients treated with fibrinolysis showed ticagrelor had noninferior TIMI major bleeding versus clopidogrel at 30 days; however, that myocardial infarction context and extracranial bleeding risk profile are not directly translatable to acute ischemic stroke where intracranial hemorrhage risk dominates, so I should not extrapolate that to post-tPA stroke care [^1146ZnfP].

> I need to ensure dosing clarity is preserved for when ticagrelor is appropriate. In patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS ≤ 5) or high-risk TIA who did not receive thrombolysis, ticagrelor is initiated with a 180 mg loading dose followed by 90 mg twice daily for up to 30 days, typically in combination with aspirin per the THALES regimen; however, in patients who received tPA, the labeling advises against ticagrelor because that population was excluded from THALES and is not recommended for use [^114Unmk1] [^111P4SpK] [^1129PSqf].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit. Brilinta (ticagrelor) should not be initiated after IV tPA for acute ischemic stroke because thrombolysis recipients were excluded from THALES and the FDA labeling explicitly states use in such patients is not recommended; the bleeding risk without supportive evidence of benefit makes this an unfavorable risk-benefit scenario, so the appropriate pathway is aspirin monotherapy started 24 hours post-tPA after imaging rules out hemorrhage, whereas ticagrelor-based regimens are reserved for non-thrombolyzed minor stroke or high-risk TIA for up to 30 days when indicated [^1129PSqf] [^115GgZv4] [^111P4SpK] [^114Unmk1].

> I should double-check one nuance on stroke severity thresholds. The ticagrelor stroke indication is limited to NIHSS ≤ 5 and exploratory analyses in THALES evaluated NIHSS 4–5 separately, but importantly, the labeling still cautions that patients with NIHSS > 5 and those receiving thrombolysis were not studied and use is not recommended in those groups, reaffirming that post-tPA patients should not receive ticagrelor in this context [^116Qu4LF] [^1129PSqf].

---

Brilinta (ticagrelor) is **not recommended after tPA-treated stroke** [^1129PSqf] because patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from the THALES trial [^111P4SpK] and from the FDA-approved indication. If used off-label, the duration is **30 days** (90 mg twice daily with aspirin 75–100 mg daily) [^111P4SpK] [^114Unmk1], but this is not guideline-supported [^115GgZv4] and carries increased bleeding risk [^112tEvPk]. Standard practice is to use aspirin alone after tPA, and ticagrelor should be avoided in this setting [^1129PSqf].

---

## Clinical trial evidence and guidelines

- **THALES trial**: Evaluated ticagrelor plus aspirin in acute non-cardioembolic stroke or high-risk TIA, excluding patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours [^111P4SpK] [^114JXPGR].

- **FDA labeling**: Indicates ticagrelor for acute ischemic stroke or TIA [^114NF5z5], but explicitly excludes patients who received thrombolysis [^1129PSqf].

- **AHA/ASA guidelines**: Recommend aspirin alone after tPA; dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with ticagrelor is not recommended in this context.

---

## Recommended duration of ticagrelor therapy

The **standard duration** is 30 days (90 mg twice daily with aspirin 75–100 mg daily) [^114Unmk1] for patients not receiving thrombolysis [^111P4SpK]. Post-tPA, ticagrelor is **not recommended** [^1129PSqf]; if used off-label, limit to **30 days** with careful bleeding risk assessment [^112tEvPk].

---

## Risks and benefits

The **benefits** include reduced recurrent ischemic events in non-thrombolysed patients [^111P4SpK] [^1115oNuX], while the **risks** include increased bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage [^112tEvPk], especially after thrombolysis [^1129PSqf].

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Bleeding risk**: High after tPA; ticagrelor increases this risk [^112tEvPk] [^1129PSqf].

- **Patient selection**: Use only in non-thrombolysed patients with minor stroke or high-risk TIA [^111P4SpK] [^114JXPGR].

- **Monitoring**: Close monitoring for bleeding and dyspnea is required [^1129PSqf] [^113tgrnt].

---

## Summary table

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended ticagrelor duration** | **Evidence/guideline** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-thrombolysed minor stroke or high-risk TIA | 30 days (90 mg BID + aspirin) | - THALES trial [^111P4SpK] <br/> - FDA labeling [^114NF5z5] |
| Post-tPA stroke | Not recommended | - FDA labeling [^1129PSqf] <br/> - AHA/ASA guidelines [^115GgZv4] |

---

Ticagrelor is **not recommended after tPA-treated stroke** [^1129PSqf] because these patients were excluded from trials [^111P4SpK] and labeling [^114NF5z5]; if used off-label, limit use to **30 days** [^114Unmk1] with careful bleeding risk assessment [^112tEvPk].

### Brilinta [^111P4SpK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study involving 11,016 patients. It compared Brilinta (90 mg twice daily) versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days, with ischemic stroke assessed as a secondary endpoint.

Patients eligible for the study were those aged ≥ 40 years with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score ≤ 5) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2 score ≥ 6 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis ≥ 50% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible.

Participants were randomized within 24 hours of the onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either Brilinta (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo. This was administered alongside a background of aspirin, initially 300–325 mg and then 75–100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days.

Brilinta demonstrated superiority over placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1%. This effect was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint, with a 19% RRR and a 1.1% ARR.

### European stroke organisation expedited recommendation for the use of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy early after minor stroke and high-risk TIA [^112tEvPk]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Low credibility.

In people with a non-cardioembolic mild to moderate ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA, does early initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor, compared to aspirin monotherapy, reduce the risk of stroke recurrence?

The THALES study was the only identified trial and included 11,016 people with high-risk TIA or minor ischaemic stroke. Participants were given either ticagrelor plus aspirin or a matching placebo plus aspirin. Outcomes were assessed at 30 days. Compared with aspirin alone, dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor and aspirin:

- **Significantly reduced the risk of ischaemic stroke at 30 days**: (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.93, absolute reduction 1.3%, moderate quality evidence).

- **Significantly reduced the risk of any stroke at 30 days**: (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.95, absolute reduction 1.2%, moderate quality evidence).

- **Significantly increased the risk of intracranial haemorrhage**: (HR 3.33, 95% CI 1.34 to 8.28, absolute risk increase 0.3%, low quality evidence).

- **Significantly increased the risk of severe bleeding**: (HR 3.99, 95% CI 1.74 to 9.14, P = 0.001, absolute risk increase of 0.4%, low quality evidence).

Across three trials, treatment with an aspirin and clopidogrel-based DAPT regimen for 21 days following a high-risk TIA or minor stroke would be expected to prevent 26 ischaemic strokes for every 1000 patients treated but may not increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage.

In the one included study, treatment with an aspirin-ticagrelor-based DAPT regimen for 30 days after high-risk TIA or minor or moderate stroke was assessed.

### Brilinta [^1129PSqf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Risk of bleeding**: Drugs that inhibit platelet function, including Brilinta, increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) > 5, and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES. Therefore, the use of Brilinta in such patients is not recommended.

- **Discontinuation of Brilinta in patients treated for coronary artery disease**: Discontinuation of Brilinta will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If Brilinta must be temporarily discontinued (e.g. to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), it should be restarted as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with Brilinta for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding and resume Brilinta as soon as hemostasis is achieved.

- **Dyspnea**: In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with Brilinta developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to Brilinta, further actions should be considered based on clinical evaluation.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of ticagrelor PO (also known as Brilinta):

- **Cardiac arrhythmias, bradycardia**: Use caution in patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, second- or third-degree AV block, or syncope.

- **Dyspnea**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mild to moderate intensity dyspnea has been observed in patients treated with ticagrelor.

- **Exacerbation of central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respirations**: Use extreme caution in patients with pre-existing central sleep apnea.

### Ischemic benefit and hemorrhage risk of ticagrelor-aspirin versus aspirin in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^1115oNuX]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

This analysis from the THALES trial suggests that the benefits of 30-day treatment with ticagrelor-aspirin outweigh the risks. In treating 1000 patients with acute mild-moderate ischemic stroke or TIA, 12 major ischemic events would be expected to be avoided and 3 major hemorrhages would be produced compared with aspirin alone. The net benefits accrued across a spectrum of demographic and presenting characteristics.

### Extended dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor 60 mg in patients with prior myocardial infarction: The design of ALETHEIA, a multi-country observational study [^115wtwxY]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

The 5000 person-years on treatment threshold is considered as the minimum number required for sufficient precision in clinical outcome assessment. While this threshold is expected to be met, person-years on treatment is a function of both time on treatment and the number of patients. It is thereby influenced by the databases' available duration of longitudinal data as well as their national coverage.

To allow contextualization of patient characteristics, reference cohorts of non-ticagrelor patients will be described at a similar time point from their qualifying myocardial infarction (MI) as will be observed among the patients initiating ticagrelor 60 mg. In routine clinical practice, patients treated for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may continue being prescribed a P2Y12 inhibitor more than 12 months after an MI, despite not being intended for extended antiplatelet treatment. To limit the inclusion of such patients in the non-ticagrelor P2Y12 inhibitor cohort, categorization of patients into either reference cohort will be based on their treatment at a minimum of 15 months after their qualifying MI.

Exposure to non-ticagrelor P2Y12 inhibitors or lack of exposure to P2Y12 inhibitors may therefore be assessed after the index date for some patients, introducing a survival bias to patients in the reference cohort. Although the extent of this bias cannot be quantified a priori, the impact is likely minimal given the short maximum timeframe between the index date (≥ 12 months post-MI) and the time of treatment assessment (≥ 15 months post-MI).

### Ticagrelor added to aspirin in acute nonsevere ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack of atherosclerotic origin [^115QmUfp]. Stroke (2020). High credibility.

- **Trial design and oversight**: THALES was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group trial conducted at 414 sites in 28 countries. The Executive Committee designed and oversaw the conduct and analysis of the trial in collaboration with the sponsor, AstraZeneca. Details of the study rationale, design, and methods have been described previously. Given the results of the POINT trial (Platelet Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke) and the CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events), the study assumptions were adjusted after trial initiation to a lower hazard ratio, requiring fewer primary endpoints and a smaller sample size.

The trial was approved by the relevant ethics committee for each participating site. Descriptions of the trial leadership, committees, and investigators are provided in the materials available online with the full text of this article.

An independent Data Monitoring Committee regularly oversaw the safety of the patients and the integrity and conduct of the study based on patient accrual throughout the trial. The trial analyses were conducted by the sponsor under the direction of the Executive Committee. The first author, who had full access to the data, wrote the first draft of the article. The article was reviewed, edited, and approved by all authors, who decided to publish the data. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for adherence to the study protocol and statistical analysis plan, both of which are available online.

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^111qZNJa]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). High credibility.

Ticagrelor is an oral, reversible, direct-acting inhibitor of the adenosine diphosphate receptor P2Y12, known for its rapid onset and more pronounced platelet inhibition compared to clopidogrel.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial, we compared ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose, 90 mg twice daily thereafter) and clopidogrel (300-to-600-mg loading dose, 75 mg daily thereafter) for the prevention of cardiovascular events. The trial involved 18,624 patients admitted to the hospital with an acute coronary syndrome, with or without ST-segment elevation.

- **Results**: At 12 months, the primary endpoint — a composite of death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke — occurred in 9.8% of patients receiving ticagrelor, compared to 11.7% of those receiving clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.92; P < 0.001). Predefined hierarchical testing of secondary endpoints showed significant differences in the rates of other composite endpoints, as well as myocardial infarction alone (5.8% in the ticagrelor group vs. 6.9% in the clopidogrel group, P = 0.005) and death from vascular causes (4.0% vs. 5.1%, P = 0.001), but not stroke alone (1.5% vs. 1.3%, P = 0.22). The rate of death from any cause was also reduced with ticagrelor (4.5%, vs. 5.9% with clopidogrel; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the rates of major bleeding between the ticagrelor and clopidogrel groups (11.6% and 11.2%, respectively; P = 0.43), although ticagrelor was associated with a higher rate of major bleeding not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting.

### Ticagrelor plus aspirin for 1 month, followed by ticagrelor monotherapy for 23 months vs aspirin plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by aspirin monotherapy for 12 months after implantation of a drug-eluting stent: a multicentre, open-label, randomised superiority trial [^114owJzS]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin for 1 month followed by ticagrelor alone, improves outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention compared with standard antiplatelet regimens.

- **Methods**: GLOBAL LEADERS was a randomized, open-label superiority trial conducted at 130 sites across 18 countries. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with a biolimus A9-eluting stent for stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 75–100 mg aspirin daily plus 90 mg ticagrelor twice daily for 1 month, followed by 23 months of ticagrelor monotherapy, or standard dual antiplatelet therapy with 75–100 mg aspirin daily plus either 75 mg clopidogrel daily (for patients with stable coronary artery disease) or 90 mg ticagrelor twice daily (for patients with acute coronary syndromes) for 12 months, followed by aspirin monotherapy for 12 months. Randomization was concealed, stratified by center and clinical presentation (stable coronary artery disease vs. acute coronary syndrome), and blocked, with randomly varied block sizes of two and four.

	- The primary endpoint at 2 years was a composite of all-cause mortality or non-fatal centrally adjudicated new Q-wave myocardial infarction, as assessed by a core lab in a blinded manner. The key secondary safety endpoint was site-reported bleeding assessed according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium criteria (grade 3 or 5). Analysis was conducted by intention to treat.

### Ticagrelor vs clopidogrel after fibrinolytic therapy in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction: A randomized clinical trial [^1146ZnfP]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). High credibility.

The bleeding safety of ticagrelor in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with fibrinolytic therapy remains uncertain. To evaluate the short-term safety of ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel in these patients, we conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial with blinded end point adjudication. This trial enrolled 3,799 patients under 75 years old with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, receiving fibrinolytic therapy across 152 sites in 10 countries from November 2015 through November 2017. The prespecified upper boundary for noninferiority for bleeding was an absolute margin of 1.0%.

Patients were randomized to receive ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose, 90 mg twice daily thereafter) or clopidogrel (300 mg to 600 mg loading dose, 75 mg daily thereafter). Randomization occurred with a median time of 11.4 hours post-fibrinolysis, and 90% of the patients had been pretreated with clopidogrel.

- **Main outcomes and measures**:
	- The primary outcome was thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) major bleeding through 30 days.

- **Results**:
	- The mean (SD) age was 58.0 (9.5) years, with 2,928 of 3,799 patients (77.1%) being men, and 2,177 of 3,799 patients (57.3%) being white. At 30 days, TIMI major bleeding had occurred in 14 of 1,913 patients (0.73%) receiving ticagrelor and in 13 of 1,886 patients (0.69%) receiving clopidogrel (absolute difference, 0.04%; 95% CI, -0.49% to 0.58%; p < 0.001 for noninferiority).

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes [^111bNpuq]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of coronary artery disease, particularly concerning antiplatelet therapy, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of ticagrelor monotherapy at 90 mg BID. This approach can serve as an alternative to dual or other single antiplatelet therapy in patients with chronic coronary syndrome or those stabilized post-ACS who have undergone PCI. These patients should have been initially treated with ticagrelor-based dual antiplatelet therapy and should remain at high ischemic risk without being at high bleeding risk.

### Ticagrelor added to aspirin in acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in prevention of disabling stroke: A randomized clinical trial [^1123TWQT]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

The THALES trial showed that ticagrelor added to aspirin resulted in a 17% relative risk reduction of stroke or death compared with placebo added to aspirin alone, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 92 to avoid one stroke or death by day 30. In this new analysis, ticagrelor significantly prevented disabling stroke or death, defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) greater than 1, in patients with recurrent stroke at day 30, with an NNT of 133 to prevent one disabling stroke or death and 112 to prevent one disabling or fatal ischemic stroke.

These results were strengthened by the sensitivity analysis evaluating different disability cutoffs (mRS > 2 and mRS > 3) and refute assumptions that ticagrelor plus aspirin did not significantly reduce recurrent disabling stroke. From both a patient perspective and societal viewpoint, the prevention of a disabling stroke is the most important treatment goal. It is noteworthy that, until now, among other antiplatelet strategies, only aspirin during the first 90 days following an ischemic stroke had shown a significant reduction in disabling stroke, which was one reason aspirin is considered the standard of care for treating ischemic stroke within the first 30 or 90 days.

In the Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trial, the combination of clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone showed a nonsignificant reduction in disabling ischemic stroke. Indeed, clopidogrel plus aspirin only showed significant reduction in disabling stroke or death following a pooled analysis of the CHANCE and POINT trials.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

A total of 258 adverse events occurred during the entire trial period, of which 188 occurred during the 4‐week trial intervention period: 98 events in 39 patients in the TIC group and 90 events in 37 patients in the TIC+ASP group. There were 53 bleeding events during the 4‐week intervention period: 20 in the TIC group and 33 in the TIC+ASP group. Bleeding was predominantly subcutaneous or dermal in both groups and was mild; all bleeding events were classified as Bleeding Academic Research Consortium Type 1. One major adverse cardiac event, a fatal acute coronary syndrome, occurred during the 4‐week trial intervention period in the TIC+ASP group.

### Antiplatelet therapy following ischaemic stroke - Continue or change pre-existing therapy [^114G7KaP]. European Stroke Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is routinely prescribed early after ischaemic stroke. Many patients are already taking antiplatelet therapy, and it is unknown whether these patients should continue the same antiplatelet treatment or switch to a different regimen.

- **Methods**: We selected patients with ischaemic stroke from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive database who were prescribed antiplatelets both before and after their stroke and who had detailed records of adverse events after stroke. We compared patients who changed to a new antiplatelet regimen after their stroke to those who continued the same regimen. The primary outcome was re-ischaemic stroke within 90 days after their index stroke, and the secondary outcome was intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) or extracranial haemorrhage (ECH). We used logistic regression analysis and adjusted for age and baseline NIHSS.

- **Results**: A total of 1129 participants were included. Of these, 538 subjects changed their antiplatelet regimen post-stroke, and 591 continued the same regimen. A re-ischaemic event occurred in 4.1% of subjects who changed regimen and 4.3% who continued unchanged (adjusted OR = 0.93; 95% CI 0.54–1.75, p = 0.929). The incidence of ICH and ECH within the first 90 days was similar in both groups: 2.4% vs. 2.6% (adjusted OR = 1.02; 95% CI 0.48–2.18, p = 0.955) for ICH, and 4.7% vs. 2.9% (adjusted OR = 1.82; 95% CI 0.96–3.43, p = 0.065) for ECH.

- **Discussion**: The analysis was performed using non-randomised registry data.

- **Conclusion**: In patients who suffer ischaemic stroke while taking antiplatelets, a

### Brilinta [^114jxGVx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients who miss a dose of Brilinta to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, Brilinta tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and consumed. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Do not administer Brilinta with another oral P2Y12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

- **Acute coronary syndrome or a history of myocardial infarction**: Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of Brilinta. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of Brilinta twice daily during the first year following an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of Brilinta twice daily. Initiate Brilinta with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with Brilinta based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Coronary artery disease but no prior stroke or myocardial infarction**: Administer 60 mg of Brilinta twice daily. Generally, use Brilinta with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)**: Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of Brilinta and then continue with 90 mg twice daily.

PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing Brilinta (N = 9333) to clopidogrel (N = 9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapies, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) who presented within 24 hours of the onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study's primary endpoint was the composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke.

Eligible patients included those who had already been treated with clopidogrel and could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded from the study. Furthermore, patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating, and those who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from the study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, although randomization was not stratified by this intent.

All patients randomized to Brilinta received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel if clopidogrel therapy had not already been administered. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at the investigator's discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75–100 mg was implemented.

### Brilinta [^114NF5z5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Brilinta is a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, Brilinta is superior to clopidogrel. It also reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS.

Brilinta is further indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While its use is not limited to this setting, its efficacy was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Lastly, Brilinta is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score ≤ 5) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA).

- **Acute coronary syndrome or a history of myocardial infarction**: Brilinta reduces the risk of CV death, MI, and stroke in patients with ACS or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Additionally, it reduces the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

- **Coronary artery disease but no prior stroke or myocardial infarction**: Brilinta is indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with CAD at high risk for such events [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. While its use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of Brilinta was established in a population with T2DM.

### Review of the ticagrelor trials evidence base [^114ybFvn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

It is challenging to compare the results of antiplatelet therapy across different randomized clinical trials because of differences in endpoint definitions, primary endpoints, and patient populations. Nevertheless, a review of the ticagrelor randomized clinical trial evidence base suggests that, in the context of decreased ischemic risk in the treatment era and increased emphasis on bleeding risk and net clinical benefit, clinical conventional wisdom and clinical trial guideline support for the superior benefit of more potent platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibition with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel may be overemphasized.

### European stroke organisation expedited recommendation for the use of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy early after minor stroke and high-risk TIA [^116XWGX5]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Low credibility.

- **Loading and maintenance doses**: The single loading dose of clopidogrel used in the trials varied from 300 mg to 600 mg. We suggest giving a single loading dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel in patients not already taking the relevant medication, followed by the daily maintenance dose for up to 21 days. The dose of aspirin used in the trials varied from 50 mg to 325 mg and was at the treating physician's discretion for up to 21 days.

- **THALES study recommendations**: In the THALES study, a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor and a single loading dose of 300 or 325 mg of aspirin was used. This was followed by 90 mg twice daily of ticagrelor and 75 to 100 mg of aspirin. We suggest following this dosing regimen.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, particularly in relation to antiplatelet therapy, the AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to support increasing the dose of aspirin or switching to an alternative antiplatelet agent for additional benefit in secondary stroke prevention in patients experiencing a noncardioembolic AIS while taking aspirin.

### Efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy by clinical presentation: Pre-specified analysis of the GLOBAL LEADERS trial [^111wXa5s]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel for a duration of 6 to 12 months following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) and DAPT with aspirin and a potent P2Y12 inhibitor (ticagrelor or prasugrel) for a duration of 12 months in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Long‐term aspirin monotherapy is recommended for all patients.

With the advent of potent P2Y12 inhibitors, more evidence is needed on antiplatelet strategies that optimize the balance between bleeding risk and cardiovascular protection in ACS and SCAD. For instance, in the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial, treatment with ticagrelor as compared with clopidogrel (both given in combination with aspirin) reduced the rate of major adverse cardiac events and all‐cause mortality in patients with ACS. However, ticagrelor has not been tested in the setting of elective PCI for SCAD.

Likewise, the optimal dose and duration of aspirin therapy in combination with ticagrelor have not been investigated. The establishment of aspirin as the main antiplatelet used after PCI stems from studies that are outdated with contemporary practice. Whether monotherapy with more potent antiplatelet medications may obviate the need for combination treatment with aspirin warrants further study in ACS and SCAD.

In the GLOBAL LEADERS trial, the experimental regimen consisting of ticagrelor and aspirin DAPT for 1 month, followed by ticagrelor monotherapy for 23 months was not superior to standard DAPT for.

### Brilinta [^115f1G1o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. Tmax was delayed by 1–2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post-loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine.

Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition.

- **Figure 8**: Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor

See the Dosage and Administration section for more details.

- **Effects of Brilinta on other drugs**

In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5, and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. Additionally, ticagrelor is a BCRP inhibitor. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin, and cyclosporine, refer to Figure 9.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

The 2019 AHA/ASA guidelines recommend considering dual antiplatelet therapy, specifically aspirin and clopidogrel, within 24 hours after symptom onset. This therapy is advised to continue for 21 days in order to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke for up to 90 days from symptom onset. This applies to patients presenting with minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, with an NIHSS score of 3 or less, who have not received intravenous alteplase.

### Review of the ticagrelor trials evidence base [^11786Jmq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Ticagrelor is a platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor approved for use in patients with acute coronary syndromes, coronary artery disease, and low‐moderate risk acute ischemic stroke or high‐risk transient ischemic attack. Clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor on ischemic and bleeding outcomes for different indications and with varying treatment approaches. As a result, there is a large body of clinical evidence demonstrating different degrees of net clinical benefit compared with other platelet inhibitor drugs based on indication, patient characteristics, clinical presentation, treatment duration, and other factors. We provide a review of the major trials of ticagrelor in the context of other randomized trials of clopidogrel and prasugrel to organize the volume of available information, elevate corroborating and conflicting data, and identify potential gaps as areas for further exploration of optimal antiplatelet treatment.

### Ticagrelor added to aspirin in acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in prevention of disabling stroke: A randomized clinical trial [^1178ik8g]. JAMA Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

In the THALES trial, we randomized patients with a noncardioembolic, nonsevere ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA to receive ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg, twice daily, for days 2–30) or placebo within 24 hours of symptom onset. All patients received aspirin (300–325 mg on day 1 followed by 75–100 mg daily for days 2–30). In the trial, we prespecified an exploratory analysis on the outcome of disability following a recurrent stroke, including a comparison of the proportion of disabling strokes with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score greater than 1 (mRS = 6 being death) at 30 days in both groups, and of the mRS distribution of recurrent ischemic strokes at 30 days.

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in minor stroke or transient ischemic attack with intracranial artery stenosis: A post hoc analysis of CHANCE-2 [^1127pixL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy primary outcome was a new ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke within 90 days. Secondary efficacy outcomes included:

- **New ischemic stroke**: Within 90 days.
- **New ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke**: Within 30 days.
- **Vascular event**: Composite of stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction, and vascular death.
- **Disabling stroke**: With a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≥ 2 within 90 days, and ordinal severity of stroke or TIA within 90 days. Severity was measured by a 6-level scale, including subsequent stroke or TIA events and the mRS score at 3 months as follows: fatal stroke (stroke with a subsequent score on the mRS of 6), severe stroke (stroke with a subsequent score on the mRS of 4 or 5), moderate stroke (stroke with a subsequent score on the mRS of 2 or 3), or mild stroke (stroke with a subsequent score on the mRS of 0 or 1), as well as TIA and no stroke or TIA.

The primary safety outcome was severe or moderate bleeding defined according to the GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries) criteria at 90 days. Secondary safety outcomes included any bleeding, mild bleeding, and death through 90 days of follow-up. Members of an independent clinical-event adjudication committee, who were unaware of the trial group assignments, confirmed all reported efficacy and safety outcomes based on available medical records, including imaging.

### Brilinta [^116itEZB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months, with a median follow-up time of 33 months. Patients were predominantly male (76%), Caucasian (87%), with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy.

- **Kaplan-Meier curve**: The Kaplan-Meier curve shows the time to the first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), or non-fatal stroke. Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of Brilinta in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for Brilinta plus aspirin versus aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens, respectively. Although the efficacy profiles of the two regimens were similar, the lower dose had lower risks of bleeding and dyspnea.

- **Table results**: In PEGASUS, the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite endpoint from 1 to 360 days (17% RRR) and from 361 days and onwards (16% RRR) were similar. The treatment effect of Brilinta 60 mg over aspirin appeared similar across most predefined subgroups.

Note: The figure presented in the study analyzed effects in various subgroups, all of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits are shown.

### Brilinta [^113tgrnt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Brilinta has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients.

- **Bleeding in PLATO**: The PLATO study investigated the reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to the first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event is shown in Figure 1. The frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events occurred within the first 30 days. No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with Brilinta compared to clopidogrel.

In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who experienced bleeding are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2.

- **Major fatal/life-threatening CABG-related bleeding**: Figure 2 illustrates the bleeding incidents by the number of days from the last dose of the study drug to the CABG procedure. The X-axis indicates days from the last dose of the study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended withholding the study drug before CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. In cases of elective or non-urgent surgery, the study drug was temporarily interrupted as specified by local practices.

### Brilinta [^116yw1Ci]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent.

- **Mechanism of action**: The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 μM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 μM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in the clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

### When less becomes more: Insights on the pharmacodynamic effects of aspirin withdrawal in patients with potent platelet P2Y inhibition induced by ticagrelor [^116162N6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Dual‐antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor is recommended by guidelines to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications and ischemic events in patients experiencing an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. This strategy was developed in light of the synergism in antithrombotic effects achieved with the blockade of both the cyclooxygenase 1 enzyme induced by aspirin and the P2Y12 signaling pathway by selective inhibitors (i.e. clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor).

In this context, clopidogrel has been the most studied P2Y12 inhibitor in pharmacodynamic investigations. The potent P2Y12 inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor followed the footsteps of investigations using clopidogrel and were developed for patients with ACS in adjunct to aspirin as an unmovable backbone therapy. Although improvements in the design of coronary stents and intravascular techniques have made the duration of DAPT for preventing stent thrombosis a less critical issue than in the past, it is also known that extended DAPT duration in high‐risk subjects exerts a protective effect not only on stented coronary segments but on the coronary vasculature as a whole.

The emphasis on a mandatory and possibly extended period of DAPT comes despite the known and unavoidable risk of bleeding complications. Twenty years of DAPT trials have established this approach as a reference standard, and therefore trials investigating emerging strategies to reduce bleeding typically use guideline‐recommended DAPT as a control.

### One-year outcomes of early therapy with ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in loss-of-function carriers with stroke or TIA trial [^1112sUQr]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The Ticagrelor or Clopidogrel with Aspirin in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events II (CHANCE-2) trial showed that among Chinese patients with minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) who were carriers of CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles, dual-antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor-aspirin reduced the 90-day risk of stroke without increased severe or moderate bleeding compared with clopidogrel-aspirin. However, whether dual-antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor was superior to clopidogrel beyond the 90 days of follow-up remained unclear. In this study, we reported 1-year follow-up outcomes of the CHANCE-2 trial.

- **Methods**: The CHANCE-2 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 202 centers in China. Patients with a minor stroke or TIA who carried CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles were randomized within 24 hours after symptom onset, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive ticagrelor and placebo clopidogrel or to receive clopidogrel and placebo ticagrelor for 90 days; both groups received aspirin for the first 21 days. After day 90, treatment was as per the choice of the clinician and the patient.

- **Results**: Among 6,412 patients, the proportion of patients on ticagrelor plus aspirin, clopidogrel plus aspirin, ticagrelor alone, clopidogrel alone, aspirin alone, other antiplatelet, and no antiplatelet beyond month 3 to 1 year was 0.09%, 1.56%, 0.13%, 2.66%, 73.65%, 0.78%, and 21.13% in the ticagrelor-aspirin group and 0.03%, 1.63%, 0.19%, 2.60%, 72.83%, 0.66%, and 22.06% in the clopidogrel-aspirin group.

### Brilinta [^113FoHyd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Severe hepatic impairment**: Avoid use of Brilinta in patients with severe hepatic impairment, as it is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of Brilinta in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Central sleep apnea**: Central sleep apnea (CSA), including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR), has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment.

- **Laboratory test interferences**: Brilinta has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests, including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay, for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y12-receptor on healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient's serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with Brilinta is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of Brilinta interference, it is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT.

### Ischemic benefit and hemorrhage risk of ticagrelor-aspirin versus aspirin in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^112rqxuc]. Stroke (2021). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants have been shown to reduce ischemic events in various clinical settings, including specific populations of patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). This benefit is accompanied by an increased risk of hemorrhage. Primary efficacy outcomes frequently include safety elements, such as hemorrhagic events, often obscuring the understanding of benefit in relation to risk, since individual events are included in both benefit and safety endpoints. The problem is exacerbated when outcomes are compared across different trials. While a single composite outcome measure that incorporates risks and benefits could be utilized to avoid confusion in weighing risks and benefits, such composites obscure the actual trade-offs of treatments that inherently carry risks.

The THALES trial (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Ticagrelor and Aspirin for Prevention of Stroke and Death) demonstrates this issue. In 11,016 patients with acute mild-to-moderate ischemic stroke or TIA randomized to 30-day treatment with ticagrelor combined with aspirin (ticagrelor-aspirin) or aspirin alone, ticagrelor-aspirin reduced stroke or death (primary efficacy outcome) but, to a lesser degree in absolute terms, increased severe hemorrhage (primary safety outcome). Its primary efficacy outcome, stroke, or death included hemorrhagic events that were also counted in the primary safety outcome. Thus, weighing these outcomes is an inaccurate assessment of risk and benefit and obscures detection of subgroups that may experience differential benefits and risks.

### Effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy after short-duration dual antiplatelet therapy in PCI patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1132DAyW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, is the standard treatment for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES). However, the optimal duration of DAPT remains debated due to the need to balance ischemic event reduction with bleeding risks. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy after short-duration DAPT (1 to 3 months) compared to extended DAPT, focusing on major bleeding and cardiovascular outcomes.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ticagrelor monotherapy after short-duration DAPT to extended DAPT were identified from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Data on major bleeding, major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), myocardial infarction, stroke, stent thrombosis, and mortality were analyzed, and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model. Five RCTs involving 32,393 patients were included.

Ticagrelor monotherapy significantly reduced MACCE (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.77 to 0.99; p = 0.04) and major bleeding (RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.77; p = 0.0008) compared to extended DAPT. It also significantly reduced all-cause mortality (RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.99; p = 0.04) and cardiovascular death (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.94; p = 0.02). The incidence of myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and stroke were similar between the groups.

### The role of ticagrelor in acute ischaemic stroke and high-risk TIA management [^114JXPGR]. Journal of Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Ticagrelor and aspirin or aspirin alone in acute ischaemic stroke or TIA: The THALES study is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 414 centers in 28 countries across Europe, Asia, and America. It compared aspirin alone to aspirin and ticagrelor in 11,016 participants with non-cardioembolic cerebral infarction and mild disability (NIHSS score ≤ 5) or high-risk TIA (ABCD2 score ≥ 6). The primary outcome was stroke or death within 30 days, and secondary outcomes were first subsequent ischaemic stroke and disability at 30 days.

There was a significant difference in stroke or death within 30 days: 6.6% in the aspirin-only group compared to 5.5% in the aspirin and ticagrelor group (p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in disability at 30 days between these groups. There was also a significant increase in severe bleeding in the combination therapy group (0.5% compared to 0.1% with aspirin alone, p = 0.001), which remains significant following Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

This study suggests a benefit of combination therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor in patients with mild-to-moderate non-cardioembolic cerebral infarction compared to aspirin alone, but with an increased bleeding risk. The number needed to treat was 92 in this study, with a number needed to harm for severe bleeding of 263. Therefore, this study offers evidence to support combination therapy, although it is unclear whether the risk of bleeding is acceptable. It is important to note that patients who underwent thrombolysis and thrombectomy were excluded.

### SPL drug information for ticagrelor [^113uDpTV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of ticagrelor PO (also known as Brilinta) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. In Australia and the United Kingdom, the use of ticagrelor is not recommended. In the United States, it should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Furthermore, ticagrelor should be used with extreme caution near term and during labor and obstetric delivery because of the possibility of maternal postpartum hemorrhage.

### Effect of ticagrelor monotherapy vs ticagrelor with aspirin on major bleeding and cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome: The TICO randomized clinical trial [^113SReWU]. JAMA (2020). High credibility.

Discontinuing aspirin after short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) was evaluated as a bleeding reduction strategy. However, the strategy of ticagrelor monotherapy has not been exclusively evaluated in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

- **Objective**: To determine whether switching to ticagrelor monotherapy after 3 months of DAPT reduces net adverse clinical events compared with ticagrelor-based 12-month DAPT in patients with ACS treated with drug-eluting stents.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A randomized multicenter trial was conducted in 3056 patients with ACS treated with drug-eluting stents between August 2015 and October 2018 at 38 centers in South Korea. Follow-up was completed in October 2019.

- **Interventions**: Patients were randomized to receive ticagrelor monotherapy (90 mg twice daily) after 3-month DAPT (n = 1527) or ticagrelor-based 12-month DAPT (n = 1529).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was a 1-year net adverse clinical event, defined as a composite of major bleeding and adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, or target-vessel revascularization). Prespecified secondary outcomes included major bleeding and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events.

- **Results**: Among 3056 patients who were randomized (mean age, 61 years; 628 women [20%]; 36% ST-elevation myocardial infarction), 2978 patients (97.4%) completed the trial. The primary outcome occurred in 59 patients (3.9%) receiving ticagrelor monotherapy after 3-month DAPT and in 89 patients (5.9%) receiving ticagrelor-based 12-month DAPT.

### Brilinta [^111vQweK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were over 65 years old, and 15% were over 75 years. The median exposure to the study drug was 276 days. Approximately half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel, and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during the PLATO study. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline, and 93% received a statin sometime during the study.

- **Table 7**: Shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, as well as for overall mortality.

- **Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 10)**: Displays time to first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12‑month treatment period (RRR 16%).

Among 11,289 patients with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated "definite") than with clopidogrel (1.9%) [hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50–0.91; p = 0.009]. The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents.

### Brilinta [^111EvHGb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis).

- **Lactation**: There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Brilinta.

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of Brilinta have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in an adequate and well-controlled study conducted in 101 Brilinta-treated pediatric patients, aged 2 to < 18, for reducing the rate of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease.

- **Geriatric use**: About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were ≥ 65 years of age and at least 15% were ≥ 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients.

- **Hepatic impairment**: Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse effects.

### Ticagrelor effects on myocardial infarction and the impact of event adjudication in the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial [^112vTAnQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

This study sought to report the treatment effect of ticagrelor on myocardial infarction (MI) and the strategy for and impact of event adjudication in the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial.

In PLATO, ticagrelor reduced cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

A clinical events committee (CEC) prospectively defined and adjudicated all suspected MI events based on events reported by investigators and by triggers on biomarkers. Treatment comparisons used CEC-adjudicated data and, per protocol, excluded silent MI.

Overall, 1,299 MIs (610 ticagrelor, 689 clopidogrel) reported by the CEC occurred during the trial. Of these, 1,097 MIs (504 ticagrelor, 593 clopidogrel) contributed to the primary composite endpoint. Site investigators reported 1,198 MIs (580 ticagrelor, 618 clopidogrel). Ticagrelor significantly reduced overall MI rates (12-month CEC-adjudicated Kaplan-Meier rates: 5.8% ticagrelor, 6.9% clopidogrel; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75 to 0.95). Nonprocedural MI (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.01) and MI related to percutaneous coronary intervention or stent thrombosis tended to be lower with ticagrelor. MIs related to coronary artery bypass graft surgery were few, but a numerical excess was observed in patients assigned ticagrelor. Analyses of overall MIs using investigator-reported data showed similar results but did not reach statistical significance ([HR]: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78 to 1.00).

In patients with ACS, ticagrelor sign.

### Time course for benefit and risk of ticagrelor and aspirin in acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^113bfvvQ]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Platelet activation remains elevated in patients for at least one month after an acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), although the exact duration is uncertain. During this period, more intense antiplatelet treatment is warranted. Ticagrelor is a potent antiplatelet agent that reversibly binds and inhibits the P2Y12 receptor on platelets. In contrast to clopidogrel, it is direct-acting without the requirement of metabolic activation. However, the efficacy benefit of intensive dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with ticagrelor and aspirin may come at the cost of a small increase in bleeding.

No previous study has investigated the temporal course of benefit and risk to attempt to define an optimal duration of ticagrelor-aspirin treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke or TIA. In addition to the overall benefit and risk of ticagrelor-aspirin treatment in the THALES trial, the results of the present study suggest that the treatment benefit of ticagrelor-aspirin occurs predominantly in the first week and remains during the entire 30-day period. Although the present analysis indicated that ticagrelor treatment, even if initiated five days after event onset, may still be beneficial, it should not discourage emergent treatment whenever possible. Additionally, the findings of initiation time of ticagrelor treatment should be considered cautiously because they are based on post hoc exploratory analysis of modeled results.

This study has several limitations. First, this secondary analysis on treatment patterns over time is exploratory and thus does not meet the standards of evidence of a primary clinical trial. All patients were involved.

### Efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: A meta-analysis [^112ngrFb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The study systematically reviews existing literature to compare clinical outcomes associated with ticagrelor monotherapy versus other antiplatelet regimens.

- **Methodology**: Rigorous databases were searched for relevant studies up to 2021. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by multiple independent reviewers to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the findings.

- **Results**: The analysis indicates that ticagrelor monotherapy is associated with a decreased risk of bleeding events compared to dual antiplatelet therapy. However, no significant difference in major adverse cardiac events was observed between the groups.

- **Conclusion**: Ticagrelor monotherapy appears to offer a favorable safety profile with comparable efficacy to traditional dual antiplatelet therapy. Further randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm these findings.

### Efficacy and safety of ticagrelor and aspirin in patients with moderate ischemic stroke: An exploratory analysis of the THALES randomized clinical trial [^116Qu4LF]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Prior trials of dual antiplatelet therapy excluded patients with moderate ischemic stroke. These patients were included in the Acute Stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack Treated With Ticagrelor and ASA for Prevention of Stroke and Death (THALES) trial, but results have not been reported separately, raising concerns about safety and efficacy in this subgroup.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor plus aspirin in patients with moderate ischemic stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score of 4 to 5).

- **Design, Setting, and Participants**: The THALES trial was a randomized trial conducted at 414 hospitals in 28 countries from January 2018 to December 2019. This exploratory analysis compared patients with moderate stroke (baseline NIHSS score of 4 to 5) with patients with less severe stroke (NIHSS score of 0 to 3). A total of 9983 patients with stroke were included in the present analysis, after excluding 2 patients with NIHSS scores greater than 5 and 1031 patients with transient ischemic attack. Data were analyzed from March to April 2021.

- **Interventions**: Ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily on days 2 to 30) or placebo within 24 hours after symptom onset. All patients received aspirin, 300 to 325 mg, on day 1, followed by aspirin, 75 to 100 mg, daily on days 2 to 30. Patients were observed for 30 additional days.

- **Main Outcomes and Measures**: The primary outcome was time to stroke or death within 30 days. The primary safety outcome was time to severe bleeding.

### Age-dependent effect of ticagrelor monotherapy versus ticagrelor with aspirin on major bleeding and cardiovascular events: A post hoc analysis of the TICO randomized trial [^111mtYUy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Although it remains uncertain which single antiplatelet therapy is most effective and safe after short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), short-term DAPT followed by aspirin monotherapy has shown a higher incidence of myocardial infarction. This increase is driven by a surge of events just after DAPT cessation, as indicated in the SMART-DATE trial (6-Versus 12-Month or Longer Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome) among patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

In the STOPDAPT-2 trial (Short and Optimal Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Everolimus-Eluting Cobalt-Chromium Stent), clopidogrel monotherapy after short-term DAPT increased the tendency, although not statistically significant, for myocardial infarction. For clopidogrel monotherapy after short-term DAPT, there was a decreased response to clopidogrel attributable to genetic polymorphisms, particularly in patients with ACS.

Meanwhile, ticagrelor has superior pharmacodynamic effects over clopidogrel, regardless of genotype differences. Ticagrelor monotherapy after short-term DAPT improved bleeding outcomes without increasing the risk of ischemic events after DAPT termination in recent trials. Hence, potent P2Y12 inhibitor-based monotherapy after short-term DAPT may be a good option without increasing both bleeding and ischemic risks in patients with ACS and a high bleeding risk, such as elderly patients.

### Review of the ticagrelor trials evidence base [^116Ap4Zo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Ticagrelor is a platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor approved for use in patients with acute coronary syndromes, coronary artery disease, and low to moderate risk acute ischemic stroke, or high-risk transient ischemic attack. Clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor on ischemic and bleeding outcomes for different indications and with varying treatment approaches. As a result, there is a large body of clinical evidence demonstrating different degrees of net clinical benefit compared with other platelet inhibitor drugs based on indication, patient characteristics, clinical presentation, treatment duration, and other factors.

We provide a review of the major trials of ticagrelor in the context of other randomized trials of clopidogrel and prasugrel to organize the volume of available information, elevate corroborating and conflicting data, and identify potential gaps as areas for further exploration of optimal antiplatelet treatment.

### Brilinta [^116F2bvg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The THEMIS study (NCT01991795) was a double-blind, parallel group study in which 19,220 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), but no history of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, were randomized to receive twice daily Brilinta or placebo, on a background of 75–150 mg of aspirin. The primary endpoint was the composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints.

Patients were eligible to participate if they were ≥ 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or angiographic evidence of ≥ 50% lumen stenosis of at least one coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least six months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past six months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorders were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from the study drug.

Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. The cohort was predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone CABG, and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the United States was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk.

### Brilinta [^111L5p1n]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There is currently no known treatment to reverse the effects of Brilinta, and ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Treatment of overdose should follow local standard medical practice. Bleeding is the expected pharmacologic effect of overdosing. If bleeding occurs, appropriate supportive measures should be taken.

Platelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of Brilinta in healthy volunteers and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding.

Other effects of overdose may include gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or ventricular pauses. Monitor the ECG.

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug eluting stents: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111w1ne4]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

Repeat revascularisation and cerebrovascular accidents

Repeat revascularisation data were available from seven studies (n = 16,351). Short-term duration of dual antiplatelet therapy yielded similar results compared with 12-month duration (event rate 3.06% [153/4,994 patients] vs 2.63% [132/5,026]; odds ratio 1.17 [95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.48]; P = 0.20; I^2 = 0%). Results with extended dual antiplatelet therapy were comparable to those with 12-month therapy (2.80% [89/3,176] vs 2.35% [74/3,155]; 1.20 [0.88 to 1.64]; P = 0.25; I^2 = 0%).

- **Fig 5 individual and summary odds ratios**: For the endpoint of repeat revascularisation, data stratified by duration of dual antiplatelet therapy: short-term (12 months) versus 12 months.

All studies (n = 32,287) provided data for cerebrovascular accidents. These events occurred in 0.45% of patients (36/7,975) with short-term dual antiplatelet therapy versus 0.49% (39/8,020) with 12-month therapy (odds ratio 0.93 [95% confidence interval 0.59 to 1.46]; P = 0.75; I^2 = 0%). Similarly, we did not see any significant differences in cerebrovascular accidents when comparing extended duration with 12-month duration (0.78% vs 0.84%; 0.93 [0.66 to 1.31]; P = 0.67; I^2 = 0%).

### Ticagrelor-based antiplatelet regimens in patients with atherosclerotic artery disease-a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^113XNn9h]. American Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Randomized trials did not consistently support the superiority of ticagrelor, as monotherapy or in combination with aspirin, in terms of efficacy or safety, in patients with atherosclerotic artery disease.

- **Methods**: Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and scientific session abstracts were searched for trials of patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease (with > 1,000 participants and a follow-up ≥ 3 months) randomly assigned to ticagrelor-based or conventional antiplatelet therapies. Trial-level hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled using a fixed- or random-effect model (in case of significant heterogeneity) with inverse variance weighting. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Other outcomes were myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and major bleeding.

- **Results**: Overall, 77,489 patients received either ticagrelor-based (n = 38,721) or conventional antiplatelet regimens (n = 38,768) in 6 trials. The primary outcome occurred in 4.5% of patients treated with experimental therapy and 4.9% of patients treated with control therapy (HR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.81–1.01; p = 0.07). Overall, patients treated with ticagrelor-based versus conventional antiplatelet regimens showed no significant difference in terms of all-cause death, MI, stroke, or major bleeding after 20 months. However, in trials of patients with coronary artery disease as the primary diagnosis, the risk for all-cause death (HR = 0.84 [0.77–0.91], P < .001) and MI (HR = 0.87 [0.80–0.94], P = .007) was significantly reduced by experimental therapy.

### Brilinta [^113M5apb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetics

Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers.

- **Absorption**: Brilinta can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median tmax of 1.5 hours (range 1.0–4.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median tmax of 2.5 hours (range 1.5–5.0). The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor Cmax but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The Cmax of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC.

- **Bioequivalence**: Brilinta as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and Cmax within 80–125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median tmax of 1.0 hour (range 1.0–4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0–8.0) for AR-C124910XX.

### Ticagrelor added to aspirin in acute nonsevere ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack of atherosclerotic origin [^112vQdkV]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

Among patients with a transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic strokes, those with ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis of cervicocranial vasculature have the highest risk of revascular events.

- **Methods**: In the double-blind THALES (The Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Ticagrelor and ASA for Prevention of Stroke and Death) trial, we randomized patients with a noncardioembolic, nonsevere ischemic stroke, or high-risk transient ischemic attack to ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily for days 2–30) or placebo added to aspirin (300–325 mg on day 1 followed by 75–100 mg daily for days 2–30) within 24 hours of symptom onset. This paper reports a prespecified analysis in patients with and without ipsilateral, potentially causal atherosclerotic stenosis ≥ 30% of cervicocranial vasculature. The primary endpoint was the time to occurrence of stroke or death within 30 days.

- **Results**: Of 11,016 randomized patients, 2,351 (21.3%) had ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis. After 30 days, a primary endpoint occurred in 92/1,136 (8.1%) patients with ipsilateral stenosis randomized to ticagrelor and in 132/1,215 (10.9%) randomized to placebo (hazard ratio 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.96], P = 0.023), resulting in a number needed to treat of 34 (95% CI, 19–171). In patients without ipsilateral stenosis, the corresponding event rate was 211/4,387 (4.8%) and 230/4,278 (5.4%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.74–1.08]; P = 0.23, P interaction = 0.245). Severe bleeding occurred in 4 (0.4%) and 3.

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^115myrjm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). High credibility.

The study PLATO, published by Wallentin L and colleagues in 2009 in the journal *N Engl J Med*, is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and unstable angina. The trial question was: what is the effect of ticagrelor in patients with acute coronary syndromes? The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: The study involved 18,624 patients, comprising 5,288 females and 13,336 males.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients admitted to the hospital with an acute coronary syndrome, with or without ST-segment elevation.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Any contraindication against the use of clopidogrel, fibrinolytic therapy within 24 hours before randomization, need for oral anticoagulation therapy, increased risk of bradycardia, and concomitant therapy with a strong cytochrome P-450 3A inhibitor or inducer.

- **Interventions**:
	- Ticagrelor group: 9,333 patients received a 180 mg loading dose, followed by 90 mg twice daily.
	- Clopidogrel group: 9,291 patients received a 300–600 mg loading dose, followed by 75 mg daily thereafter.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant decrease in death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke (9.8% vs. 11.7%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.92).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in myocardial infarction (5.8% vs. 6.9%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95).
	- Significant decrease in death from vascular causes (4% vs. 5.1%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.91).
	- Significant decrease in death from any cause (results cut off in the original text).

### Ticagrelor versus aspirin in acute stroke or transient ischemic attack [^115xmg75]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The SOCRATES study, published by Johnston SC and colleagues in 2016 in The New England Journal of Medicine, examined the effect of ticagrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) included a population of 13,199 patients, consisting of 5,483 females and 7,716 males.

- **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**: Participants included those with non-severe ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA who had not received intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis and were not considered to have a cardioembolic stroke. Key exclusion criteria encompassed planned specific antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy, planned revascularization procedures that would require stopping study treatment within 7 days post-randomization, hypersensitivity to ticagrelor or aspirin, history of atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular aneurysm, suspicion of cardioembolic cause for TIA or stroke, or those who had undergone intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy within 24 hours before randomization.

- **Interventions**: The intervention groups were: 6,589 patients receiving ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily for days 2 through 90) and 6,610 patients receiving aspirin (300 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for days 2 through 90).

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome showed no significant difference in the time to occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death at 90 days, with rates of 6.7% for ticagrelor and 7.5% for aspirin (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1).

### Efficacy and safety of ticagrelor and aspirin in patients with moderate ischemic stroke: An exploratory analysis of the THALES randomized clinical trial [^113RBNZY]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is a pivotal strategy for the early management of minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). The efficacy and safety of DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin have been evaluated in patient populations with TIA or acute ischemic stroke with baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores of 3 or less (range 0–42; higher scores indicate more severe stroke) in the Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Non-Disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial and Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trial. Based on these studies, the guidelines recommend early, short (21 days) combination treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin for patients with high-risk TIA and minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke with an NIHSS score of 3 or less.

In the Acute Stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack Treated With Ticagrelor and ASA for Prevention of Stroke and Death (THALES) trial, DAPT with ticagrelor and aspirin was evaluated in patients with TIA or acute ischemic stroke with NIHSS scores of 5 or less, within which approximately 30% of the patient population had NIHSS scores of 4 or 5 at randomization. The THALES trial demonstrated that compared with aspirin alone, DAPT with ticagrelor and aspirin reduced the risk of stroke or death within 30 days. Few severe bleeding events were observed; however, these were more common in the ticagrelor plus aspirin group. Patients with stroke with baseline NIHSS scores of 4 to 5 could potentially respond differently than those with lower scores.
