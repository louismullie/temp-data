## Question

EFFICACY OF ZETIA VS. STATINS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how ezetimibe (Zetia) compares with statins, including LDL-lowering efficacy, cardiovascular outcomes, the role of combination therapy, safety, and guideline positioning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanistic differences and why effects might be additive. Then, I should quantify LDL-C reductions with each agent alone and together. Next, I will review hard outcomes data, reconcile any apparent contradictions, and appraise safety/tolerability. After that, I should align the synthesis with major guideline recommendations and consider special populations. Finally, I will provide a concise, actionable answer that reflects the totality of evidence [^111WoJZk] [^114Wj6SJ].

> Let me first confirm the mechanisms, because mechanistic complementarity often predicts additive LDL-C lowering. Statins inhibit hepatic HMG-CoA reductase, reducing cholesterol synthesis and upregulating LDL receptors, whereas ezetimibe blocks intestinal cholesterol absorption by targeting NPC1L1 at the brush border; mechanistically, that should add on top of statins rather than replace their potency, which sets my prior that combination therapy lowers LDL-C more than either alone [^111rzKim].

> Now, I should quantify LDL-C lowering with monotherapy. Ezetimibe 10 mg typically lowers LDL-C by about 18–25% in randomized trials and labeling data; for example, FDA data report roughly a 19% reduction versus placebo, whereas a head-to-head trial showed fluvastatin XL 80 mg cut LDL-C by 32.8% compared with 15.6% for ezetimibe, underscoring that statins are materially more potent as single agents; hold on, I should verify consistency — yes, this pattern holds across multiple datasets, so the directional conclusion is robust [^112vz2JC] [^111gz1ya] [^114BHA5T].

> Next, I will examine combination therapy because I need to ensure we are not overcalling "synergy". Pooled and comparative analyses show that adding ezetimibe to an ongoing statin produces substantially greater LDL-C reductions than simply doubling the statin dose, with typical additional relative reductions in the mid-20% range and higher target attainment; however, the effect is best described as additive rather than synergistic, and network/meta-analyses indicate combination therapy yields modestly greater absolute LDL-C lowering than high-intensity statin monotherapy by several mg/dL on average — let me double-check the magnitude — about a 6.6 mg/dL advantage in pooled analyses, which is clinically meaningful for high-risk patients [^112Zg9B7] [^114VQNXt] [^115aXyE8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions on outcomes; I need to separate statin outcomes, ezetimibe monotherapy outcomes, and ezetimibe add-on outcomes. Statins have an unparalleled outcomes base with consistent reductions in mortality, MI, stroke, and revascularization across diverse populations, forming the bedrock of lipid-lowering therapy; ezetimibe monotherapy, in contrast, has not demonstrated clear reductions in major cardiovascular events in robust trials to date. Wait, the FDA label for ezetimibe–simvastatin historically stated no incremental benefit beyond simvastatin alone; I should reconcile that with newer data — IMPROVE-IT definitively showed that adding ezetimibe to simvastatin after ACS produced a modest but statistically significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, and a 2022 network meta-analysis also found fewer MI and stroke events with ezetimibe add-on, so the current totality supports incremental benefit when added to statins, even if monotherapy evidence remains limited [^112vz2JC] [^111EYUiu] [^113f3qJV] [^113UCpzm] [^116kCpeb] [^114Wj6SJ].

> I will now examine safety and tolerability because that often drives the clinical choice between intensifying statins versus combining with ezetimibe. Muscle-related symptoms and discontinuation are more frequent with higher-intensity statins, whereas ezetimibe is generally well tolerated; randomized and pooled data indicate lower risks of myalgia and discontinuation with moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe compared with high-intensity statin monotherapy, which is particularly relevant for patients with prior muscle symptoms. I should double-check glycemic effects — high-intensity statins raise diabetes risk, and observational and trial data suggest add-on ezetimibe does not worsen glucose control; but wait, the ezetimibe/simvastatin label notes increases in HbA1c and fasting glucose have been reported with statins including the combination product, so I need to nuance this: the preponderance of clinical evidence implicates statin dose more than ezetimibe per se, yet vigilance for dysglycemia remains prudent [^111gz1ya] [^114VQNXt] [^112mHpb3] [^1158mLMP] [^114K4voh].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to ensure my synthesis is aligned with standards of care. Major societies recommend statins as first-line for LDL-C lowering and event reduction, adding ezetimibe if LDL-C goals are not met on maximally tolerated statins or if true statin intolerance limits dosing; European and Canadian guidelines explicitly endorse ezetimibe add-on after 4–6 weeks at maximum tolerated statin in ASCVD or very high-risk patients, and support ezetimibe as an alternative when statins are not tolerated at any dose, with consideration of PCSK9 inhibitors for persistent elevation despite statin plus ezetimibe; shared decision-making is emphasized given modest absolute risk reductions with nonstatin add-ons [^111WoJZk] [^115Qxm5F] [^114fcfPZ] [^117SeqmU] [^114maNHF] [^112SYNSK].

> Let me consider special populations, because therapeutic trade-offs may shift with age or comorbidity. In older adults, especially those ≥ 75 years, moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe can achieve similar efficacy with fewer intolerance-related discontinuations compared with high-intensity statins, supporting a lower-dose combination strategy when tolerability is a concern; I should confirm robustness — the RACING trial subgroup analysis is well conducted, while smaller open-label trials point in the same direction but are less definitive, so I will weight the randomized evidence more heavily in recommending combination therapy for elderly patients at risk for SAMS [^112onuwQ] [^113SrUQq].

> I need to ensure the practical sequencing is clear. Start with a maximally tolerated statin because of superior potency and outcomes; if LDL-C remains above target, add ezetimibe rather than merely doubling the statin dose, as doubling typically yields only a small incremental LDL-C reduction and is more likely to provoke intolerance; in true statin intolerance, ezetimibe monotherapy provides a modest 15–25% LDL-C reduction and is reasonable, with consideration of PCSK9 inhibitors if targets are still unmet in very high-risk settings per guidelines [^112Zg9B7] [^111WoJZk] [^114maNHF] [^112SYNSK] [^112vz2JC].

> But wait, what if baseline LDL-C is already low post-ACS; does ezetimibe still help? The IMPROVE-IT subgroup analysis showed that the relative risk reduction with ezetimibe add-on was generally consistent across baseline LDL-C strata, with benefit tracking the absolute LDL-C difference achieved, supporting the "lower is better" paradigm even when starting levels are modest, which reinforces adding ezetimibe in very high-risk secondary prevention when goals are not met on statins alone [^113f3qJV] [^111EYUiu].

> Pulling this together, I should give a direct, clinically actionable answer. Statins remain markedly more effective than ezetimibe as monotherapy for LDL-C lowering and have unequivocal cardiovascular outcome benefits; ezetimibe monotherapy lowers LDL-C by roughly 18–25% but lacks robust outcomes evidence alone, whereas adding ezetimibe to statins produces additional LDL-C reductions and modest but significant event reduction after ACS, with a favorable tolerability profile that often outperforms simply escalating statin dose; therefore, ezetimibe's optimal role is adjunctive to maximally tolerated statin therapy or as an alternative in statin-intolerant patients, in line with modern guidelines [^112vz2JC] [^111gz1ya] [^111EYUiu] [^113UCpzm] [^111WoJZk] [^114maNHF].

Statins remain the **first-line therapy** [^115Qxm5F] for LDL-C lowering and cardiovascular risk reduction, with **LDL-C reduction** of 30–50% and robust event reduction [^114Wj6SJ]. Ezetimibe monotherapy lowers LDL-C by 18–25% [^112vz2JC] [^114BHA5T] and is **less effective** than statins for LDL-C [^111gz1ya] and event reduction [^116kCpeb]. Adding ezetimibe to statins provides an **additional ~20% LDL-C reduction** [^112Zg9B7] and modestly reduces cardiovascular events [^111EYUiu], especially in high-risk patients [^113UCpzm]. Ezetimibe is well tolerated [^114BHA5T] and appropriate for statin-intolerant patients [^114fcfPZ] [^111HEAPL] or as add-on when LDL-C goals are unmet [^111WoJZk] [^114maNHF].

- **Statins**: Generally well tolerated [^111HEAPL]; muscle-related side effects in 5–10% of patients [^111gz1ya].
- **Ezetimibe**: Well tolerated [^112vz2JC] with minimal side effects [^114BHA5T].
- **Combination therapy**: Well tolerated, with lower incidence of muscle symptoms than high-intensity statins alone [^114VQNXt] [^113SrUQq].

---

## Clinical guidelines

Guidelines recommend statins as the **first-line therapy** [^115Qxm5F] for LDL-C lowering and cardiovascular risk reduction, and **ezetimibe as add-on therapy** when LDL-C goals are not achieved on statins [^111WoJZk] or for statin-intolerant patients [^114fcfPZ] [^114maNHF].

---

## Patient populations

Statin-intolerant patients may use **ezetimibe** [^114fcfPZ] [^111HEAPL] as a suitable alternative, while **high-risk patients** — including those with high cardiovascular risk or familial hypercholesterolemia — benefit from **combination therapy** [^111EYUiu] [^113UCpzm].

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^114BHA5T]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Ezetimibe, the only available cholesterol absorption inhibitor, lowers LDL-C by inhibiting Niemann-Pick C1-like protein 1 in the upper small intestine. Ezetimibe is available at a single dose of 10 mg daily and specifically lowers LDL-C levels by 18% to 25%; the ezetimibe-statin combination can lower LDL-C by up to 70%. Ezetimibe is well tolerated with minimal side effects.

The cardiovascular benefit of ezetimibe was demonstrated in the Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial study, which enrolled 18,144 patients with acute coronary syndrome. The study showed that reducing LDL-C from 1.8 to 1.4 mmol/L by adding ezetimibe to statin therapy over 7 years was associated with a further ~7% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, which was even more pronounced among patients with diabetes. Other randomized trials showed cardiovascular benefit of ezetimibe when used as monotherapy in patients over 75 years and in combination with a statin in patients with renal impairment. Ezetimibe is a second-line agent in clinical practice guidelines and is often prescribed to statin-intolerant patients.

### Statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitors to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular events [^114Wj6SJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the physiologically normal levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the thresholds for development of atherosclerosis and adverse coronary events are in the 30- to 70-mg/dl range. More patients have been studied in randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of statins on outcomes than any other drug class in the history of medicine. This cumulative body of evidence documents that atherosclerosis progression is halted and coronary heart disease events are minimized when statin therapy with or without ezetimibe, and possibly proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, is used to drive down the LDL-C to a range of about 30 to 50 mg/dl. Thus far, these agents appear to be safe even when LDL-C is lowered to about 50 mg/dl, although more robust outcome and safety data are required, particularly for the PCSK9 inhibitors and very low LDL-C levels (e.g. down to 25 mg/dl). In conclusion, the national guidelines specifying only the use of a high-potency statin without specific LDL-C goals may lead to substantial undertreatment of high-risk patients, leaving them vulnerable to future adverse cardiovascular events.

### Efficacy and safety of adding ezetimibe to statin therapy among women and men: Insight from IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial) [^111EYUiu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

This prespecified analysis of IMPROVE‐IT demonstrated that adding ezetimibe to statin therapy reduces LDL‐C and cardiovascular events after an acute coronary syndrome, in both women and men. These robust efficacy and safety data support the use of intensive lipid-lowering therapy with ezetimibe added to a statin, particularly in a high‐risk population of women as well as men, to optimize cardiovascular outcomes.

### Efficacy and tolerability of fluvastatin XL 80 mg alone, ezetimibe alone, and the combination of fluvastatin XL 80 mg with ezetimibe in patients with a history of muscle-related side effects with other statins [^111gz1ya]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Although statin treatment is generally well tolerated, it is estimated that 5% to 10% of patients develop muscle-related side effects (MRSEs), which can lead to the use of less effective nonstatin alternatives or the complete cessation of lipid-lowering therapy. This study was designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of extended-release fluvastatin (fluvastatin XL) and ezetimibe, both alone and in combination, in patients who have experienced MRSEs with other statins. This was a double-blind, double-dummy trial involving 199 mostly moderate- or high-risk dyslipidemic patients. Participants were randomized to receive fluvastatin XL 80 mg/day (n = 69), ezetimibe 10 mg/day (n = 66), or a combination of fluvastatin XL 80 mg/day plus ezetimibe 10 mg/day (n = 64) for a duration of 12 weeks.

Fluvastatin XL lowered low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 32.8% compared to a 15.6% reduction with ezetimibe, resulting in a between-group difference of -17.1% with a 95% confidence interval of -23.6 to -10.7.

### Intolerance to statins: Mechanisms and management [^111HEAPL]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

When no statin is tolerated or the maximal tolerable dose of statins fails to reduce LDL cholesterol to target levels, nonstatin therapies should be used.

- **Nonstatin medications**: The most commonly used drug is ezetimibe. Ezetimibe, either as monotherapy or added to 80 mg fluvastatin XL daily in patients with prior statin intolerance, was well tolerated and produced a 15% reduction in LDL cholesterol. It should be noted that currently, there are no studies that demonstrate ezetimibe's efficacy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

- **Bile acid sequestrants (BAS)**: Another option to reduce cholesterol absorption is the use of BAS, which were proven to reduce cardiovascular events in the Lipid Research Clinics Study Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT). BAS can be combined with ezetimibe to produce a greater reduction in LDL cholesterol. The use of BAS is associated with a high rate of gastrointestinal side effects, leading to discontinuation rates as high as 40–60%. Colesevelam has a better side effect profile and may lead to better patient compliance.

- **Niacin**: Niacin at daily doses from 500 to 2,000 mg lowers LDL cholesterol by approximately 20%. Given as monotherapy in the Coronary Drug Project study, niacin reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Niacin can also be used in combination with BAS and ezetimibe in statin-intolerant patients requiring a large reduction in LDL cholesterol. The use of niacin is limited by its side effects, mainly flushing, which can lead to the drug being discontinued in up to 25% of patients.

In extreme cases, when both cardiovascular risk and LDL cholesterol levels remain inadequately managed, additional interventions may be necessary.

### Pcsk9 inhibitors and ezetimibe with or without statin therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113UCpzm]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

To compare the impact of ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes in adults taking maximally tolerated statin therapy or who are statin intolerant, a network meta-analysis was performed.

The data sources included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to 31 December 2020. Randomised controlled trials of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors with ≥ 500 patients and follow-up of ≥ 6 months were selected based on eligibility criteria.

- **Main outcome measures**: We performed frequentist fixed-effects network meta-analysis and GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation) to assess the certainty of evidence. Results included relative risks (RR) and absolute risks per 1000 patients treated for five years for non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. Absolute risk differences were estimated assuming constant RR (estimated from network meta-analysis) across different baseline therapies and cardiovascular risk thresholds; the PREDICT risk calculator was used to estimate cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention. Patients were categorised at low to very high cardiovascular risk. A guideline panel and systematic review authors established the minimal important differences (MID) of 12 per 1000 for MI and 10 per 1000 for stroke.

In the results, 14 trials assessing ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors among 83,660 adults using statins were identified. Adding ezetimibe to statins reduced MI (RR 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.94) and stroke (RR 0.82; 0.71).

### Safety and efficacy of moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe in elderly patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113SrUQq]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

High-intensity statin therapy significantly reduces mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, moderate-intensity statins are often preferred for elderly patients due to their higher risk of intolerance to high-intensity statins.

- **Objective**: To compare the incidence of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and the effect on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels between elderly ASCVD patients receiving high-intensity statin monotherapy and those receiving moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe in a combination therapy.

- **Method**: In a prospective, multicenter, open-label trial conducted in South Korea, 561 patients aged 70 years or above with ASCVD were randomly assigned to receive either moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy (rosuvastatin 5 mg with ezetimibe 10 mg) or high-intensity statin monotherapy (rosuvastatin 20 mg) over 6 months. The primary endpoint was the incidence of SAMS, and the key secondary endpoint was the achievement of target LDL-C levels (< 70 mg/dL) within 6 months.

- **Results**: The primary endpoint showed a lower incidence of SAMS in the combination therapy group (0.7%) compared to the high-intensity statin monotherapy group (5.7%, p = 0.005). Both groups achieved similar LDL-C levels, with 75.4% in the combination therapy group and 68.7% in the monotherapy group reaching target levels.

- **Conclusion**: Moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy offers a lower risk of SAMS and similar LDL-C reduction in elderly patients with ASCVD.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114VQNXt]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

It remains controversial whether adding ezetimibe to low/moderate-intensity statins has a more beneficial impact on the treatment efficacy and safety of patients with existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) compared to high-intensity statin regimens.

- **Hypothesis**: A combination of low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe might be more effective and safer than high-intensity statin monotherapy.

- **Methods**: We searched databases for randomized controlled trials comparing lipid profile alterations, drug-related adverse events, and MACE components between high-intensity statin monotherapy and low/moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe combination therapy. Pooled risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: Our comprehensive search resulted in 32 studies comprising 6,162 patients treated with monotherapy against 5,880 patients on combination therapy. Combination therapy was more effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels compared to monotherapy (MD = -6.6, 95% CI: -10.6 to -2.5); however, no significant differences were observed in other lipid parameters. Furthermore, the combination therapy group experienced a lower risk of myalgia (RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13–0.57) and discontinuation due to adverse events (RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.51–0.74). The occurrence of MACE was similar between the two treatment groups.

- **Conclusions**: Adding ezetimibe to low/moderate-intensity statins resulted in a greater reduction in LDL-C levels, and a lower rate of myalgia occurred in this group.

### 2021 Canadian cardiovascular society guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults [^114maNHF]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to ezetimibe, the CCS 2021 guidelines recommend intensifying lipid-lowering therapy with ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitor therapy for secondary prevention in all patients with CVD. This is advised if LDL-C remains ≥ 1.8 mmol/L (or non-HDL-C ≥ 2.4 mmol/L or ApoB ≥ 0.7 g/L) while receiving the maximally tolerated statin dose.

### Baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and clinical outcomes of combining ezetimibe with statin therapy in IMPROVE-IT [^113f3qJV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

The 2018 U.S. cholesterol management guideline recommends additional lipid-lowering therapy with ezetimibe for secondary prevention in very high-risk patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 70 mg/dL, despite maximally tolerated statin.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between baseline LDL-C above and below 70 mg/dL and the benefit of adding ezetimibe to statin in patients post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

- **Methods**: IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of ezetimibe/simvastatin vs. placebo/simvastatin in post-ACS patients followed for a median of 6 years. A total of 17,999 patients were stratified by LDL-C at qualifying event into three groups: 50- < 70, 70- < 100, and 100–125 mg/dL. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, major coronary events, or stroke.

- **Results**: Absolute differences in median LDL-C achieved at 4 months between treatment arms were similar (17–20 mg/dL). The effect of ezetimibe/simvastatin vs. placebo/simvastatin on the primary endpoint was consistent regardless of baseline LDL-C of 50- < 70 mg/dL (HR: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.80–1.05]), 70- < 100 mg/dL (HR: 0.93 [95% CI: 0.87–1.01]), or 100–125 mg/dL (HR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.86–1.03]; P interaction = 0.95). Normalized relative risk reductions per 1-mmol/L difference in achieved LDL-C at 4 months between treatment arms were 21% in patients with baseline LDL-C of 50- < 70 mg/dL, 16% in those with 70- < 100 mg/dL, and 13% in those with 100–125 mg/dL.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^112vz2JC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ezetimibe was evaluated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials involving 1,719 patients with primary hyperlipidemia. The results showed that ezetimibe significantly lowered total cholesterol by 13%, LDL-C by 19%, Apo B by 14%, and triglycerides by 8%, while increasing HDL-C by 3% compared to placebo. The reduction in LDL-C was consistent across various demographics, including age, sex, and baseline LDL-C levels.

Simvastatin was assessed in two large, placebo-controlled clinical trials: the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Trial (with 4,444 patients) and the Heart Protection Trial (with 20,536 patients). These studies evaluated the effects of simvastatin in patients at high risk of coronary events due to existing coronary heart disease, diabetes, peripheral vessel disease, or history of stroke or other cerebrovascular disease. Simvastatin was demonstrated to significantly reduce the risk of total mortality by decreasing coronary heart disease deaths, the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke, and the need for coronary and non-coronary revascularization procedures.

No incremental benefit of the combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has been established beyond that demonstrated for simvastatin alone.

- **Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in pediatric patients**: The effects of ezetimibe coadministered with simvastatin were evaluated in a study involving 126 patients compared to 122 on simvastatin monotherapy. This multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial, followed by an open-label phase, included 142 males and 106 postmenarchal females, aged 10 to 17 years (mean age 14.2 years), of which 43% were females, 82% White, 4% Asian, 2% Black or African American, and 13% of other ethnicities.

### Achieving goal lipid levels with ezetimibe plus statin add-on or switch therapy compared with doubling the statin dose. A pooled analysis [^112Zg9B7]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

Evaluate the lipid-altering effects of adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin therapy, statin titration, or switching from statin monotherapy to either a more potent statin or ezetimibe/simvastatin.

- **Methods**: A pooled analysis of patient-level data from 17 double-blind, active or placebo-controlled studies included 8,667 hypercholesterolemic adults. Participants were randomized to receive ezetimibe 10 mg added to ongoing statins, statin titration (doubling), or a switch from ongoing statins to either rosuvastatin 10 mg or ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/20 and 40 mg). The percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was estimated by analysis of variance. The percent of patients achieving LDL-C and other guideline-recommended targets, as well as target lipid levels by baseline distance to goal, was evaluated.

- **Results**: The LDL-C percent change from baseline was -26.0 for ezetimibe added to ongoing statin therapy, -27.6 for switching from ongoing statin to ezetimibe/simvastatin, -19.7 for switching to rosuvastatin 10 mg, and -9.7 for dose doubling of the ongoing statin. For patients within 0.8 mmol/L (30 mg/dL) of the target at baseline, LDL-C target attainment rates were 75.9% for adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin, 72.8% for switching to ezetimibe/simvastatin, 61.8% for switching to rosuvastatin, and 44.3% for statin dose-doubling. Improvements in other lipids and achievement of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B targets among this patient group were largest for ezetimibe added to ongoing statins and switching to ezetimibe/simvastatin.

### 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: Lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk [^111WoJZk]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

For the management of dyslipidemia, particularly in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and acute coronary syndrome, the 2020 EAS/ESC guidelines recommend adding ezetimibe. This step should be taken if the LDL-C goal is not achieved after 4–6 weeks on a maximum tolerated dose of a statin.

### Ezetimibe for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality events [^116kCpeb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity, and high levels of blood cholesterol are considered major modifiable risk factors for CVD. The use of statins is the preferred treatment strategy for the prevention of CVD; however, some individuals at high risk for CVD are intolerant to statin therapy or unable to achieve their treatment goals with the maximal recommended doses of statin. Ezetimibe is a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor, though whether it has a positive effect on CVD events remains uncertain. Results from clinical studies are inconsistent, and a thorough evaluation of its efficacy and safety for the prevention of CVD and mortality is necessary.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe for the prevention of CVD and all-cause mortality.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Web of Science on 27 June 2018, and two clinical trial registry platforms on 11 July 2018. We checked reference lists from primary studies and review articles for additional studies. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ezetimibe versus placebo or ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs versus other lipid-modifying drugs alone in adults, with or without CVD, and which had a follow-up of at least 12 months.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and contacted trialists to obtain missing data. We performed statistical analyses.

### Ezetimibe: Rationale and role in the management of hypercholesterolemia [^112vG42B]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. Plasma LDL levels are partially dependent on cholesterol absorption in the intestine and the rate of intrinsic cholesterol synthesis. Therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-reductase inhibitors has often proven successful in reducing plasma LDL levels. However, a significant number of patients do not reach their target LDL levels despite statin therapy.

Drugs that inhibit cholesterol absorption are a useful adjunct to lipid-lowering therapy by statins. This review discusses the mechanisms involved in intestinal absorption of cholesterol and its transport as potential targets of newer agents that affect cholesterol absorption. The use of bile acid sequestrants and esters of plant stanols, as well as other intestinally active agents for reducing plasma LDL levels, has been limited by side effects and difficulties in patient compliance.

In contrast, the new selective cholesterol transporter inhibitor ezetimibe has been demonstrated to reduce plasma LDL alone or in combination with statins without significant adverse effects. In spite of the robust lipid-lowering data with ezetimibe, questions about clinical outcomes, safety, and efficacy in various combinations remain.

### Effect of switching from statin monotherapy to ezetimibe/simvastatin combination therapy compared with other intensified lipid-lowering strategies on lipoprotein subclasses in diabetic patients with symptomatic cardiovascular disease [^116ZKVCk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

This analysis showed that switching from S10 or A20 therapy to more‐intensive lipid‐lowering therapies had favorable effects on several biomarkers considered to be important measures of atherogenic dyslipidemia in diabetic patients with symptomatic CVD. Switching to combination ES10/20 provided greater reductions from baseline in LDL‐P as well as attainment of LDL‐P levels < 990 nmol/L compared with doubling the statin dose, and reductions that were comparable with R10. Switching to the combination ES10/20 therapy also resulted in modest increases in HDL‐P that were significantly greater than doubling the starting dose and were similar to R10. Combination ES10/20 therapy improved Lp‐PLA2 activity significantly more than statin dose‐doubling, comparably with R10, and moderately decreased Lp‐PLA2 concentration. Overall, the treatment effects on these atherogenicity markers were consistent with the lipid changes demonstrated in the full cohort of the original study.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115aXyE8]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The search strategy yielded a total of 3,060 articles. After removing duplicates and screening articles, 32 trials were included in the meta‐analysis. Inter‐reader agreement was high (κ coefficient = 0.9).

The included articles consisted of 12,042 ASCVD patients, among which 5,880 (48.42%) participants received low/moderate‐intensity statin with ezetimibe, whereas 6,162 participants received high‐intensity statin monotherapy. The included studies employed various statins, namely rosuvastatin (n = 5), atorvastatin (n = 12), simvastatin (n = 3), pravastatin (n = 1), multiple statins (n = 10), and one study used both atorvastatin and multiple statins. Approximately half of the studies were blinded (47%), while blindness was not mentioned in 40% of studies. Only two studies used a placebo in the monotherapy arm. The duration of treatment in these studies ranged from 1 to 36 months from baseline.

- **Laboratory data**: Twenty-one studies compared high‐intensity statin monotherapy with low/moderate‐intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy on LDL‐C levels in ASCVD patients. The combination therapy demonstrated a greater reduction in LDL‐C levels compared to monotherapy (MD = −6.6, 95% CI: −10.6 to −2.5). However, a high degree of heterogeneity was noted among the included studies (I² = 84%, p < 0.01). The preliminary inspection of the funnel plot and Egger's regression showed no statistical evidence of publication bias.

### Effects of combined ezetimibe and simvastatin therapy as compared with simvastatin alone in patients with type 2 diabetes: a prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial [^115Vgwv6]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Inhibited gastrointestinal cholesterol absorption by add-on ezetimibe therapy reduced cholesterol levels in patients with persistent dyslipidemia despite statin therapy. Advantages of dual- versus single-drug lipid-lowering therapy, however, could not be definitively established since the effects of ezetimibe combined with a given dosage of a statin were compared with those of monotherapy with another competitor statin or even with the same statin but given at higher dosages.

To address this issue, the Ezetimibe and Simvastatin in Dyslipidemia of Diabetes (ESD) study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00157482) compared the lipid-lowering effects of ezetimibe or placebo added to the same background statin therapy in type 2 diabetic patients with persistent hypercholesterolemia despite HMG-CoA reductase inhibition.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114KYHYj]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The difference between the effect of high‐intensity statin monotherapy and low/moderate‐intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy on HDL‐C, TG, TC, and hs‐CRP was evaluated in 18, 16, 17, and 14 studies, respectively. All of the analyses demonstrated no significant difference in terms of HDL‐C (MD = 3.1, 95% CI: −1.5 to 7.7), TG (MD = −4.7, 95% CI: −16.5 to 6.1), TC (MD = −0.6, 95% CI: −13.1 to 11.9), and hs‐CRP (MD = 0, 95% CI: −0.0 to 0.0) levels between the treatment arms. Considerable heterogeneity was noted among the studies, with I 2 values of 99% (p = 0) for HDL‐C, 78% (p < 0.01) for TG, 99% (p < 0.01) for TC, and 31% (p = 0.13) for hs‐CRP.

Although no significant publication bias was observed for HDL‐C, TG, and hs‐CRP, the inspection of the funnel plot and Egger's test demonstrated the existence of publication bias for TC. Subgroup analyses based on the statin class and treatment duration did not reveal any significant differences between the efficacy of the two treatment arms. Among the studies analyzing HDL‐C subgroups, heterogeneity was attributed to the atorvastatin subgroup. In the case of TC, heterogeneity was influenced by studies involving multiple statins and atorvastatin.

### Safety and efficacy of ezetimibe/simvastatin combination versus atorvastatin alone in adults ≥ 65 years of age with hypercholesterolemia and with or at moderately high/high risk for coronary heart disease (the VYTELD study) [^115GW9Ra]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

More than 80% of coronary heart disease-related mortality occurs in patients aged ≥ 65 years. Guidelines recommend low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol targets for these at-risk patients. However, few clinical studies have evaluated lipid-lowering strategies specifically in older adults. This multicenter, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of the usual starting dose of ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/20 mg) versus atorvastatin (10 or 20 mg) and the next higher dose of ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/40 mg) versus atorvastatin (40 mg) in 1,289 hypercholesterolemic patients aged ≥ 65 years, with or without cardiovascular disease.

Patients randomized to ezetimibe/simvastatin experienced greater percent decreases in LDL cholesterol: -54.2% for 10/20 mg compared to -39.5% and -46.6% for atorvastatin 10 mg and 20 mg, respectively, and -59.1% for 10/40 mg compared to -50.8% for atorvastatin 40 mg (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). The number of patients attaining LDL cholesterol < 70 mg/dl (51.3% for 10/20 mg, 68.2% for 10/40 mg) and < 100 mg/dl (83.6% for 10/20 mg; 90.3% for 10/40 mg) was significantly larger compared to those receiving atorvastatin for all prespecified dose comparisons (p < 0.05 to < 0.001).

A significantly larger percentage of high-risk patients achieved LDL cholesterol < 70 mg/dl with ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg (54.3%) versus atorvastatin 10 mg (10.9%, p < 0.001) or 20 mg (28.9%, p < 0.001), and with ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 mg (69.2%) versus atorvastatin 40 mg (38.2%, p < 0.001). A significantly larger percentage of intermediate-risk patients achieved LDL cholesterol targets, continuing the trend observed in high-risk groups.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^111rzKim]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Plasma cholesterol is derived from intestinal absorption and endogenous synthesis. Ezetimibe and simvastatin contain ezetimibe and simvastatin, two lipid-lowering compounds with complementary mechanisms of action.

	- **Ezetimibe**: Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol by the small intestine. The molecular target of ezetimibe is the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits cholesterol absorption, leading to decreased delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This results in a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increased clearance of cholesterol from the blood.

	- **Simvastatin**: Simvastatin is a prodrug hydrolyzed to its active β-hydroxyacid form, simvastatin acid, after administration. Simvastatin acid and its metabolites inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a cholesterol precursor.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Ezetimibe and simvastatin reduce total cholesterol (total-C), LDL-C, apolipoprotein (Apo) B, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) in patients with hyperlipidemia. In a two-week clinical trial involving 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentra.

### Efficacy and diabetes risk of moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe versus high-intensity statin after percutaneous coronary intervention [^1158mLMP]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). High credibility.

Although not causing acute symptoms, impaired glucose homeostasis by statins is one of the critical side effects. In a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, high-intensity statin therapy was associated with an increased risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) compared with moderate-intensity statin therapy. Meanwhile, adding ezetimibe did not affect glucose metabolism, and no harmful effect was observed at very low LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) attained with add-on treatment with ezetimibe.

In contrast, a large genetic study that assessed lifelong exposure to lower LDL-C levels due to the carriage of genetic variants of NPC1L1, the target of ezetimibe, showed an increased risk of diabetes and suggested that effects on glucose homeostasis may be a class effect of LDL-C lowering agents. There has been scarce clinical data on the effect of new-onset DM by long-term ezetimibe combination therapy. Although this is an observational study, our large clinical dataset shows the benefit of the ezetimibe combination and dose reduction of statin on the development of DM in patients who received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

The Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International (IMPROVE-IT) trial, published in 2015, demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits of adding ezetimibe to moderate-intensity statin therapy, likely influencing clinical practice in our study population. During the study period from 2012 to 2017, the use of moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe increased notably, from 10.7% in 2015 to 20.4% in 2016, and further to 30.4% in 2017. Despite this increased adoption of the combination therapy, the efficacy of moderate-intensity sta

### Treatment with ezetimibe plus low-dose atorvastatin compared with higher-dose atorvastatin alone: Is sufficient cholesterol-lowering enough to inhibit platelets [^115toMAb]? Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

We sought to test the platelet inhibitory and anti-inflammatory effects of a higher statin dosage compared with combined treatment with ezetimibe plus a low statin dose.

Reducing the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statins induces important pleiotropic effects such as platelet inhibition. An insufficient LDL-C reduction often is treated with ezetimibe, an intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitor, in combination with a low statin dose. It is not known whether this combination therapy has the same pleiotropic effects as a statin monotherapy.

Fifty-six patients with coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to receive either 40 mg/day of atorvastatin or 10 mg/day of ezetimibe plus 10 mg/day of atorvastatin for 4 weeks. The levels of LDL-C, platelet activation markers after stimulation, platelet aggregation, and plasma chemokine levels (i.e. regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted [RANTES]) were measured before and after changing lipid-lowering medication.

- **Results**: Platelet activation markers (P-selectin) after stimulation with adenosine diphosphate were reduced by 40 mg/day of atorvastatin (-5.2 ± 1.6 arbitrary units) but not by ezetimibe plus low-dose atorvastatin (2.1 ± 1.8 arbitrary units; p < 0.005) despite a similar reduction of LDL-C (atorvastatin -1.01 ± 0.18 mmol/l vs. ezetimibe plus atorvastatin -1.36 ± 0.22 mmol/l, p = NS). Thrombin receptor-activating peptide-induced platelet aggregation as well as plasma RANTES levels were reduced by 40 mg/day of atorvastatin but not.

### Implications for REDUCE IT in clinical practice [^112Z5fEV]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Statin therapy is effective in primary and secondary prevention, but substantial residual risk remains on statin treatment, especially among high-risk and very high-risk patients. Add-on therapy with ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors provides additional risk reduction through further reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Elevated triglycerides and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins contribute to atherogenesis and to the residual risk on statin therapy.

The addition of icosapent ethyl to statins has recently been shown to markedly lower the risk of ASCVD events in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and high-risk patients with type II diabetes mellitus. These data are discussed in the context of guidelines and synthesized in a decision pathway to guide combination lipid-lowering therapy in patients at high ASCVD risk.

### Association between baseline, achieved, and reduction of CRP and cardiovascular outcomes after LDL cholesterol lowering with statins or ezetimibe: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111qLxY1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

LDL‐C (low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol) and inflammation are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Lowering LDL‐C with statins or ezetimibe and inhibiting inflammation with canakinumab significantly reduce major cardiovascular events. hsCRP (high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein) is a predictor of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality, as well as total cholesterol and blood pressure. Several lipid‐lowering therapies (i.e. statins and ezetimibe) have proven to reduce hsCRP independently of LDL‐C reduction. However, it is inconclusive whether benefits from LDL‐C lowering are associated with baseline CRP concentrations. Larger cardiovascular benefits were observed after statin therapy among patients with elevated baseline CRP concentrations in some trials, but not in others. Similarly, whether achieved and reduction of CRP concentrations would affect benefits from more‐intensive LDL‐C lowering is unknown. We sought to determine whether the benefits of LDL‐C–lowering therapy on cardiovascular events are related to baseline, achieved levels, or the magnitude of reduction in CRP concentrations.

- **Indications and usage**: Nexlizet, a combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe, is indicated as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapies, to reduce LDL-C in adults with primary hyperlipidemia, including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH).

- **Bempedoic acid component**: The bempedoic acid component of Nexlizet is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization in adults who are unable to take recommended statin therapy (including those not taking a statin) with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or a high risk for a CVD event but without established CVD.

### Combination moderate-intensity statin and ezetimibe therapy for elderly patients with atherosclerosis [^112onuwQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

The routine use of high-intensity statins should be considered carefully in elderly patients because of their higher risk of intolerance or adverse events.

- **Objectives**: We evaluated the impact of moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy compared with high-intensity statin monotherapy in elderly patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

- **Methods**: In this post hoc analysis of the RACING (Randomized Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Lipid-lowering with Statin Monotherapy Versus Statin/Ezetimibe Combination for High-risk Cardiovascular Diseases) trial, patients were stratified by age (≥ 75 years and < 75 years). The primary endpoint was a 3-year composite of cardiovascular death, major cardiovascular events, or nonfatal stroke.

- **Results**: Among the 3,780 enrolled patients, 574 (15.2%) were aged ≥ 75 years. The rates of the primary endpoint were not different between the moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy group and the high-intensity statin monotherapy group among patients aged ≥ 75 years (10.6% vs 12.3%; HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.54–1.42; P = 0.581) and those < 75 years (8.8% vs 9.4%; HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.74–1.18; P = 0.570) (P for interaction = 0.797). Moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy was associated with lower rates of intolerance-related drug discontinuation or dose reduction among patients aged ≥ 75 years (2.3% vs 7.2%; P = 0.010) and those < 75 years (5.2% vs 8.4%; P < 0.001) (P for interaction = 0.159).

- **Conclusions**: Moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy should be considered as a therapeutic option for elderly patients with ASCVD, given the potential for reduced drug intolerance and similar efficacy to high-intensity statin monotherapy.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112mHpb3]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Our findings demonstrated that the combination therapy approach was more effective in reducing LDL‐C levels compared to statin monotherapy; however, no significant difference was noted in other lipid parameters. Our results aligned with a previous meta‐analysis study conducted by Ah et al, which reviewed all studies until 2021. Their study included 18 publications and showed that adopting low/moderate‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe was more effective in reducing not only LDL‐C but also other lipid parameters and hs‐CRP. However, their data were older, and many recent studies were omitted from the analysis, especially those published in the last 2 years.

In contrast to the aforementioned systematic review, our study focuses exclusively on patients with a history of CVD to minimize the confounding effect of non‐cardiovascular conditions such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia on outcomes. Furthermore, unlike the previous study, we conducted a subgroup analysis to investigate the effect of low/moderate‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe therapy in different statin types and treatment durations.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: A randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^115A9Xm5]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

The primary goal in treating dyslipidemia is to reduce LDL‐C levels according to cardiovascular risk, and other components of the lipoprotein‐lipid profile also contribute to the residual CVD risk. Other lipoprotein subsets that transport cholesteryl esters in the circulation, such as very low‐density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate‐density lipoprotein (IDL), and chylomicron remnants, are also proatherogenic. Therefore, all cholesteryl esters carried by lipoproteins other than HDL (non‐HDL‐C), TG levels, or the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL‐C also predict cardiovascular events. Apolipoprotein, embedded in the phospholipid bilayer of the lipoproteins, plays a crucial role in determining their function. HDL‐C particles primarily contain Apo AI and Apo AII, whereas LDL‐C particles are mainly associated with Apo B. Although HDL‐C has been traditionally associated with a protective effect against cardiovascular risk, it is important to note that HDL functionality, rather than concentration, is more strongly predictive of cardiovascular outcomes. HDL particles exert various atheroprotective functions, including reverse cholesterol transport, and antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory effects, which are not fully captured by HDL‐C levels alone. Measuring Apo B provides more comprehensive clinical information than measuring LDL‐C alone, as Apo B reflects the presence of other atherogenic lipoproteins, such as VLDL and IDL, in addition to LDL‐C.

### Effect of switching from statin monotherapy to ezetimibe/simvastatin combination therapy compared with other intensified lipid-lowering strategies on lipoprotein subclasses in diabetic patients with symptomatic cardiovascular disease [^115rGJKL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The lipid changes observed in this subgroup analysis were generally similar to those reported in the full cohort of the original trial, in which switching to ezetimibe/simvastatin (ES) combination therapy improved LDL‐C lowering and achievement of LDL‐C levels < 70 and < 100 mg/dL compared with doubling the baseline statin dose and switching to R10. Other studies have also reported that switching from low‐dose statin monotherapy to ES combination therapy significantly improved LDL‐C lowering compared with doubling the statin dose and switching to R10. Taken together, these results indicate that more intensive lipid-lowering therapy may contribute to improved lipid management in these high-risk patients.

Given that measurement of on‐treatment levels of LDL‐P may be more predictive of residual cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk than LDL‐C when the two measures are discordant, it has been suggested that intensification of lipid-lowering therapy is reasonable to consider when elevated LDL‐P is present in patients receiving statin therapy. To assess the response to lipid-lowering therapy, LDL‐P targets have been proposed based on population equivalent levels for LDL‐C targets (< 20th percentile for high‐ and very high‐risk patients). It should be noted that while treatment targets for LDL‐C, non–HDL‐C, and apoB have been recommended in various national dyslipidemia guidelines, LDL‐P targets have not been endorsed. Achievement of LDL‐P targets that are equivalent to LDL‐C and non–HDL‐C targets based on population percentiles has been shown to require intensive therapy.

### Upfront combination of statin and ezetimibe for patients with acute coronary syndrome: Time for a new approach [^114vMd6p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) is a cornerstone in the management of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, which reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and subsequent cardiovascular events. Statins not only lower LDL-C levels but also exert beneficial anti-inflammatory effects among patients with ACS, a phenomenon known as the pleiotropic effect. However, statins are linked with subjective myalgia (muscle pain with normal enzymes), which has been described as a nocebo effect. This condition occurs in up to 30% of patients and often leads to dose reduction, switching to an alternative statin therapy, or adding a nonstatin LLT. These adjustments aim to avoid the risk of nonadherence or discontinuation of therapy, which in turn might affect cardiovascular outcomes.

Ezetimibe, a commonly prescribed nonstatin LLT, targets the NPC1L1 (Niemann–Pick C1–like 1) protein, reducing the absorption of cholesterol from the intestine. In the IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial) trial, 18,144 patients with recent ACS were randomly assigned to a combination of high-dose simvastatin–ezetimibe (40–10 mg) versus simvastatin monotherapy (40 mg). The primary endpoint, which included a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, coronary revascularization within 30 days after randomization, or nonfatal stroke, was significantly lower with the combination of simvastatin–ezetimibe at seven years (hazard ratio [HR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.89–0.99]; P = 0.016).

### Lipid-altering efficacy and safety profile of combination therapy with ezetimibe/statin vs. statin monotherapy in patients with and without diabetes: an analysis of pooled data from 27 clinical trials [^116Mubo3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

This post hoc analysis compared the lipid-altering efficacy and safety of ezetimibe 10 mg plus statin (EZE/statin) versus statin monotherapy in hypercholesterolemic patients with and without diabetes.

A pooled analysis of 27 previously published, randomized, double-blind, active- or placebo-controlled clinical trials was conducted. It comprised 21,794 adult patients with (n = 6541) and without (n = 15,253) diabetes receiving EZE/statin or statin alone for 4–24 weeks to evaluate percentage change from baseline in lipids and other parameters. Consistency of the treatment effect across the subgroups was tested using treatment × subgroup interaction. No multiplicity adjustments were made.

Treatment effects within both subgroups were generally consistent with the overall population. EZE/statin was more effective than statin alone in improving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TGs), non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein (apo) B, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in the overall population and both subgroups. Patients with diabetes achieved significantly larger reductions in LDL-C, TC, and non-HDL-C compared with non-diabetic patients. Incidences of adverse events or creatine kinase elevations were similar between groups. A small but significantly higher incidence of alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase elevations was seen in patients receiving EZE/statin (0.6%) versus statin monotherapy (0.3%) in the overall population.

### Association of baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and percentage low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibition [^116NyvuC]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is an important modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It is unclear whether the percentage LDL-C lowering with pharmacotherapies differs based on baseline LDL-C levels.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between baseline LDL-C levels and the percentage LDL-C reduction with a statin, ezetimibe, and a PCSK9 inhibitor.

This secondary exploratory study analyzed data from three randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials: Aggrastat to Zocor-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 21 (A to Z-TIMI 21), Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT), and Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER) of lipid-lowering therapies (statin, ezetimibe, and a PCSK9 inhibitor). The participants included those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Analyses took place from April to October 2020.

- **Interventions**:
	- **In A to Z-TIMI 21, there was a 1**:1 randomization to simvastatin, 40 mg daily for 30 days followed by 80 mg daily thereafter versus placebo for 4 months followed by simvastatin, 20 mg daily thereafter.
	- **In IMPROVE-IT, there was a 1**:1 randomization to ezetimibe, 10 mg daily plus simvastatin, 40 mg daily versus placebo plus simvastatin, 40 mg daily.
	- **In FOURIER, there was a 1**:1 randomization to evolocumab, 140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly versus matching placebo.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The percentage LDL-C reduction at either 1 month (A to Z-TIMI 21, IMPROVE-IT) or 3 months (FOURIER) as a function of baseline LDL-C levels.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: A randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^115EAQgm]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

- **The benefits of low‐intensity statin combination therapy over moderate‐intensity statin therapy**: Lowering LDL‐C improves clinical outcomes and statins are recommended as the mainstay of lipid‐lowering therapy. Therefore, recent lipid guidelines recommend LDL‐C reduction based on cardiovascular risk. Clinical guidelines suggest moderate‐intensity statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40–75 years without diabetes and at a moderate cardiovascular risk, or in patients with diabetes aged 40–75 years. Although the initial lowering of LDL‐C levels with statins is effective, further reductions require disproportionately larger dose increases. This is because statin‐induced reductions in serum cholesterol can lead to increased cholesterol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, diminishing the efficacy of higher statin doses. Typically, doubling the statin dose from the minimum effective dose yields only an additional 6% reduction in serum LDL‐C concentration. Moreover, side effects associated with statins include myopathy, new‐onset diabetes, and increased risk of hepatotoxicity.

	- The SEARCH trial compared the effects of 80 mg versus 20 mg of simvastatin in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. The trial demonstrated a higher risk of myopathy in high‐dose simvastatin (0.9%) compared to the low‐dose group (0.03%). Similarly, the JUPITER trial, which compared rosuvastatin 20 mg to placebo, reported a higher incidence of new‐onset diabetes in the rosuvastatin group (3.0% vs. 2.4%).

### Comparison of effects of ezetimibe/simvastatin versus simvastatin versus atorvastatin in reducing C-reactive protein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [^115LDB9g]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The lowering effects of ezetimibe/simvastatin combination therapy on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were compared with those of simvastatin or atorvastatin monotherapy in a large cohort of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

To compare ezetimibe/simvastatin with simvastatin, data were combined from three identical, prospective 12-week trials. In these trials, patients were randomized to receive:

- **Placebo**
- **Ezetimibe 10 mg**
- **Ezetimibe 10 mg added to simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg**
- **Simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg**:

To compare ezetimibe/simvastatin with atorvastatin, data were analyzed from a phase III double-blind, active-controlled study. Patients were randomized equally to receive:

- **Ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/10, 10/20, 10/40, or 10/80 mg**
- **Atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg for 6 weeks**:

When averaged across doses, ezetimibe/simvastatin produced significantly greater reductions in LDL cholesterol (52.5% vs. 38.0%, respectively) and CRP levels (31.0% vs. 14.3%, respectively) compared to simvastatin alone. At each individual simvastatin dose, co-administration with ezetimibe led to significant further CRP reductions versus simvastatin alone. Ezetimibe/simvastatin was significantly more effective at lowering LDL cholesterol than atorvastatin when pooled across doses (53.4% vs. 45.3%, respectively) and in each milligram-equivalent dose comparison. Reductions in CRP of similar magnitude were observed with ezetimibe/simvastatin and atorvastatin, both when averaged across doses and at each milligram-equivalent statin dose comparison.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^116y3Pr8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a multicenter, double-blind, 6-week trial, 1,902 patients with primary hyperlipidemia were randomized to one of eight treatment groups: ezetimibe and simvastatin (10 mg/10 mg, 10 mg/20 mg, 10 mg/40 mg, or 10 mg/80 mg) or atorvastatin (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg).

Across the dosage range, when patients receiving ezetimibe and simvastatin were compared to those receiving milligram-equivalent statin doses of atorvastatin, ezetimibe and simvastatin lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin. Only the 10 mg/40 mg and 10 mg/80 mg ezetimibe and simvastatin doses increased HDL-C significantly more than the corresponding milligram-equivalent statin dose of atorvastatin. The effects of ezetimibe and simvastatin on TG were similar to the effects seen with atorvastatin.

In a multicenter, double-blind, 24-week, forced-titration trial, 788 patients with primary hyperlipidemia were randomized to receive coadministered ezetimibe and simvastatin equivalent to ezetimibe and simvastatin (10 mg/10 mg and 10 mg/20 mg) or atorvastatin 10 mg. For all three treatment groups, the dose of the statin was titrated at 6-week intervals to 80 mg. At each pre-specified dose comparison, ezetimibe and simvastatin lowered LDL-C to a greater degree than atorvastatin.

### Variability of the LDL-C lowering response to ezetimibe and ezetimibe + statin therapy in hypercholesterolemic patients [^113n1cCd]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

We compared the variability of LDL-C-lowering responses to treatment with ezetimibe + statins versus statins in hypercholesterolemic patients.

- **Methods**: An analysis of patient-level data was pooled from 27 double-blind, placebo and/or active-controlled studies comprising 21,671 patients. These patients were treated with ezetimibe + statins versus statins as first-line (statin-naïve/wash-out) or second-line (on statin, randomized to ezetimibe versus placebo [add-on] or ezetimibe versus uptitrated statin [uptitrate]) therapy for 6–24 weeks. Variances, including standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and root mean squared error (RMSE) adjusted for various factors, for the percentage change from baseline in LDL-C were compared.

- **Results**: In first-line and second-line add-on studies, the variability (SD, RMSE) of the percentage change from baseline in LDL-C was lower in ezetimibe + statin-treated patients compared to those treated with statins, with or without covariates. Although differences were small, they were statistically significant due to the large sample size. In second-line uptitrate studies, ezetimibe + statin treatment resulted in greater unadjusted variability (SD) versus statin therapy; however, the adjusted variability (RMSE) was significantly lower. Relative variability (CV, defined as SD/mean) was lower for ezetimibe + statins compared to statin therapy across all study types, showing more pronounced effects in second-line add-on and uptitrate studies. This was attributed to larger mean LDL-C reductions in the ezetimibe + statin groups versus the statin groups. When assessed by individual study/type, statin brand, potency, or dose, the CVs remained lower for ezetimibe + statins compared to statins in second-line settings.

### Consistency in efficacy and safety of ezetimibe coadministered with statins for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in women and men [^11629ndS]. Journal of Women's Health (2004). Low credibility.

Women are often not treated as aggressively as men to control levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), despite evidence that women and men realize comparable cardiovascular benefits from lipid-lowering therapy. Statins are the most effective drugs currently available for treating hypercholesterolemia. Despite the impressive cholesterol-lowering capacity of statins, many patients on statin therapy fail to reach established target levels of LDL-C. The cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, blocks the intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol, a mechanism of action complementary to that of statins, which inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Ezetimibe coadministered with statins produces significant incremental reductions in LDL-C compared with statin monotherapy.

- **Methods**: Four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced-parallel group trials compared the efficacy and safety of statin monotherapy (lovastatin or pravastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg; simvastatin or atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg) vs. ezetimibe 10 mg plus statin (as above). A gender subset analysis (women, n = 1065; men, n = 796) on data pooled across these four trials was carried out to determine whether ezetimibe plus statin for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia is equally efficacious in women and men.

- **Results**: Compared with statin monotherapy, ezetimibe plus statin demonstrated greater efficacy in reducing blood levels of LDL-C, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides and raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

### The effects of statin monotherapy and low-dose statin/ezetimibe on lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A₂ [^115HeJZf]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Many of the pleiotropic effects of statins remain to be elucidated. Hypothesis: Different statin regimens with similar lipid-lowering efficacy may have different effects on biomarkers of atherothrombosis, including lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A₂ (Lp-PLA₂).

- **Methods**: After a 4-week dietary lead-in, 82 hypercholesterolemic patients were randomized to one of two treatment groups: atorvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin/ezetimibe 5 mg/5 mg. After 8 weeks of drug treatment, the groups were compared for percent change in lipid parameters, Lp-PLA₂, interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and fibrinogen.

- **Results**: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering was comparable between the two groups (-47% ± 11% and -49% ± 7% in the atorvastatin and combination groups, respectively). Although Lp-PLA₂ was reduced in both groups, the reduction was greater in the atorvastatin group (-42% and -9% [median], respectively, P = 0.03). Although IL-6 was decreased only in the atorvastatin group, IL-6 changes were not significantly different between the two groups. The changes in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and fibrinogen were similar in each group.

- **Conclusions**: Atorvastatin monotherapy was stronger at reducing plasma Lp-PLA₂ than the low-dose atorvastatin/ezetimibe combination after equivalent LDL-C lowering. This result may provide evidence of potential statin effects beyond the lowering of LDL-C.

### The efficacy of ezetimibe added to ongoing fibrate-statin therapy on postprandial lipid profile in the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112Gfss8]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

A gap between lipid goals and the achievements in clinical practice prompts an investigation to find the best combination protocol for diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia. In this trial, fasting and postprandial serum triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol decreased significantly with all three modes of treatment. Adding ezetimibe to gemfibrozil not only had no further effect on lowering fasting TG but also might attenuate the beneficial effect of gemfibrozil on postprandial TG and HDL-C. However, co-administering gemfibrozil and ezetimibe improved the effect of gemfibrozil on total cholesterol, LDL-C, and Apo-B concentrations. The best effect on serum fasting and postprandial total cholesterol, and also LDL-C, was seen with the combination of ezetimibe and atorvastatin, achieving a 38% reduction rate.

Efficacy, safety, and tolerability are the ideal characteristics of a second drug to complement either statins or fibrates as the first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia in diabetic patients. Ezetimibe is a hypocholesterolemic drug that selectively inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption. Besides the effect on LDL-C levels, an additional property related to reducing the metabolism of long-chain fatty acids and blocking apo-B48 formation might be the mechanism of the chylomicron lowering effect of ezetimibe. Furthermore, ezetimibe might reduce cholesterol availability for VLDL endogenous synthesis in the liver and affect hypertriglyceridemia. Also, new animal-based research revealed that treatment with ezetimibe not only inhibits cholesterol uptake but may also modulate intestinal processes.

### Trends in use of ezetimibe after the ENHANCE trial, 2007 through 2010 [^116EVeAS]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Results from the Ezetimibe and Simvastatin in Hypercholesterolemia Enhances Atherosclerosis Regression (ENHANCE) trial, announced in January 2008, demonstrated that ezetimibe use lowered cholesterol levels but did not slow the progression of atherosclerosis.

The objective was to examine the association of this announcement with national patterns of ezetimibe prescribing, including medication initiation and discontinuation, as well as predictors of use.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Retrospective analysis of a national sample of adults 18 years or older who were continuously enrolled in plans of a large US pharmacy benefit manager from 2007 to 2010.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Lipid-lowering therapy prescription claims were categorized as ezetimibe-containing treatments or any other lipid-lowering agent. Initiation was defined as an ezetimibe claim without another in the prior 180 days; discontinuation, as an ezetimibe claim without another in the subsequent 180 days.

From 2007 to 2010, 29.1% of the 10,597,296 continuously eligible adults obtained at least one lipid-lowering agent prescription. Among these adults, 17.8% were prescribed ezetimibe and 95.3% another lipid-lowering agent, predominantly statins. Ezetimibe use peaked in January 2008, when 2.5% of all adults were ezetimibe users, but declined to 1.8% by December 2010. The ENHANCE trial announcement was associated with a nonsignificant 0.16% fewer monthly ezetimibe users (P = 0.11) but a significant 0.14% more monthly monotherapy users and 0.30% fewer users of ezetimibe concomitant with other lipid-lowering agents.

### New agents to reduce cholesterol levels: Implications for nephrologists [^112yeg8Y]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Statins and ezetimibe effectively reduce the burden of cardiovascular (CV) disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Unfortunately, many subjects still die or have CV events despite cholesterol-lowering therapy. This is particularly true in patients with more advanced CKD.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease that induces the degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor by targeting it for lysosomal destruction. Its inhibition causes a dramatic fall in cholesterol levels on top of maximized statin therapy.

- **Therapeutic approaches**: This goal is obtained with different therapeutic approaches, spanning from monoclonal antibodies to nonsense oligonucleotides and silencing RNA (siRNA). Two human monoclonal antibodies are approved for clinical use; they are still very expensive. Both agents significantly lower cholesterol levels. Evolocumab and alirocumab significantly reduce the risk for CV disease without relevant safety issues.

Inclisiran is an siRNA molecule that produces PCSK9-specific RNA silencing. Data from a Phase II study showed significant cholesterol-lowering efficacy. The experience accumulated so far is limited in the CKD population.

PCSK9 inhibition also has the potential to reduce the burden of CV in this subset by obtaining a much greater decrease in serum cholesterol compared with statin therapy or ezetimibe. Doubts exist that this approach will improve the outcome of dialysis patients, in whom vascular calcifications predominate.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UxjEg]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of global mortality and disability, with elevated serum lipid levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), as one of its major risk factors. Lowering LDL-C is crucial in mitigating the negative outcomes of CVD, especially in patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statins are the first-line therapy for patients with ASCVD for LDL-C elevations, but many patients on low/moderate-intensity statin regimens fail to attain target LDL-C levels. Contemporary guidelines recommend high-intensity statins for hyperlipidemia treatment; however, they present challenges such as drug interactions and dose-dependent adverse events.

An alternative approach is combining ezetimibe, a non-statin drug, with a tolerated statin dosage. Ezetimibe has shown efficacy in lowering LDL-C alongside a more favorable safety profile. However, previous meta-analyses have shown conflicting information regarding the superiority in efficacy or safety profile of high-intensity statin monotherapy compared to low/moderate-intensity statin combined with ezetimibe therapy. Given the recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of these two lipid-lowering strategies in ASCVD patients.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targeting with pitavastatin + ezetimibe for patients with acute coronary syndrome and dyslipidaemia: The HIJ-PROPER study, a prospective, open-label, randomized trial [^114Sroos]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

As noted previously, even in the era of intensive statin therapy, ACS patients with dyslipidaemia may not reach their targeted LDL-C or obtain improved clinical outcomes. These challenges are now being considered in a number of clinical trials. Although no data are yet available on cardiovascular outcomes, it seems feasible that statins in combination with non-statin drugs might provide greater lipid lowering and thus prove more effective in the prevention of cardiovascular events than statins alone, particularly in high-risk populations. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prospective clinical trials have yet evaluated the effects of LDL-C targeting therapy on subsequent cardiovascular outcomes in ACS patients.

To explore this question, we needed a drug regimen that would reliably reduce LDL-C to the aggressive target level of < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L). We decided to combine a statin with ezetimibe, an intestinal cholesterol transporter inhibitor that selectively inhibits cholesterol absorption by blocking the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 receptor. Two recent studies that demonstrated the benefits of a combination of statin plus ezetimibe in patients with CAD support our choice of ezetimibe.

We hypothesized that we could achieve intensive LDL-C lowering by administering ezetimibe in conjunction with a standard dose of statin, and that this treatment would be more beneficial for secondary prevention than statin monotherapy in ACS patients with dyslipidaemia.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^111vb9m6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The individual components of major vascular events (MVE) in all patients ever allocated to ezetimibe and simvastatin or placebo are presented in Table 14. Among patients not on dialysis at baseline, ezetimibe and simvastatin did not reduce the risk of progressing to end-stage renal disease compared with placebo (RR 0.97: 95% CI 0.89 to 1.05).

- **Simvastatin cardiovascular outcome trials in adults at high risk of coronary heart disease events**: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centered trial [the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Trial (Trial 4S)], the effect of therapy with simvastatin on total mortality was assessed in 4,444 adult patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) (history of angina and/or a previous myocardial infarction) and baseline total cholesterol (total-C) between 212 and 309 mg/dL who were on a lipid-lowering diet. In Trial 4S, patients were treated with standard care, including a lipid-lowering diet, and randomized to either simvastatin 20–40 mg/day (n = 2,221) or placebo (n = 2,223) for a median duration of 5.4 years.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: A clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^112SYNSK]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

In adults with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8 mmol/L (> 70 mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

- **Practice**: Most guidelines emphasize LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, to achieve these goals in very high-risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible, so physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention, nor do they report absolute benefits and harms and potential treatment burdens in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences.

- **Recommendations**: The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision-making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high risk.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^115DYcfv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In the primary intent-to-treat analysis, 639 (15.2%) of 4193 patients initially allocated to ezetimibe and simvastatin and 749 (17.9%) of 4191 patients initially allocated to placebo experienced a major vascular event (MVE). This corresponded to a relative risk reduction of 16% (p = 0.001) (see Figure 1). Similarly, 526 (11.3%) of 4650 patients ever allocated to ezetimibe and simvastatin and 619 (13.4%) of 4620 patients ever allocated to placebo experienced a major atherosclerotic event (MAE), a subset of the MVE composite that excluded non-coronary cardiac deaths and hemorrhagic stroke, corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 17% (p = 0.002). The trial demonstrated that treatment with ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/20 mg versus placebo reduced the risk for MVE and MAE in this CKD population. The trial design precluded drawing conclusions regarding the independent contribution of either ezetimibe or simvastatin to the observed effect.

- **Treatment effect**:

	- The treatment effect of ezetimibe and simvastatin on MVE was attenuated among patients on dialysis at baseline compared with those not on dialysis. Among 3023 patients on dialysis at baseline, ezetimibe and simvastatin reduced the risk of MVE by 6% (RR 0.94: 95% CI 0.80 to 1.09) compared with a 22% reduction (RR 0.78: 95% CI 0.69 to 0.89) among 6247 patients not on dialysis at baseline (interaction P = 0.08).

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^113hH4tT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When patients receiving ezetimibe and simvastatin were compared to those receiving all doses of simvastatin, ezetimibe and simvastatin significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, and non-HDL-C. The effects of ezetimibe and simvastatin on HDL-C were similar to the effects seen with simvastatin. Further analysis showed ezetimibe and simvastatin significantly increased HDL-C compared with placebo. The lipid response to ezetimibe and simvastatin was similar in patients with TG levels greater than or less than 200 mg/dL.

In a multicenter, double-blind, controlled, 23-week trial, 710 patients with known CHD or CHD risk equivalents, as defined by the NCEP ATP III guidelines, and an LDL-C greater than or equal to 130 mg/dL were randomized to one of four treatment groups: coadministered ezetimibe and simvastatin equivalent to ezetimibe and simvastatin (10 mg/10 mg, 10 mg/20 mg, and 10 mg/40 mg) or simvastatin 20 mg. Patients not reaching an LDL-C less than 100 mg/dL had their simvastatin dose titrated at 6-week intervals to a maximal dose of 80 mg.

At week 5, the LDL-C reductions with ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/10 mg, 10 mg/20 mg, or 10 mg/40 mg were significantly larger than with simvastatin 20 mg.

### Long-term effects of ezetimibe-plus-statin therapy on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels as compared with double-dose statin therapy in patients with coronary artery disease [^112Lr3Ck]. Atherosclerosis (2012). Low credibility.

To assess the mechanism of the long-term LDL-C-lowering effect of ezetimibe-plus-statin, coronary artery disease patients whose LDL-C was ≥ 70 mg/dL after treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg/day or rosuvastatin 2.5 mg/day were randomly assigned to receive ezetimibe 10 mg/day plus statin (n = 78) or double-dose statin (n = 72) for 52 weeks.

Greater LDL-C reduction was observed and maintained until 52 weeks in the ezetimibe-plus-statin group, while LDL-C levels re-increased after 12 weeks in the double-dose statin group. Although lathosterol/TC increased, campesterol/TC decreased more in the ezetimibe-plus-statin group. In contrast, lathosterol/TC remained unchanged and campesterol/TC increased, leading to an increased campesterol/lathosterol ratio for 52 weeks in the double-dose statin group. Plasma PCSK9 levels were higher in the double-dose statin group than in the ezetimibe-plus-statin group at 12 weeks, but similar at 52 weeks.

Although the difference in PCSK9 levels between the two groups was transient, the differences in both campesterol and lathosterol levels persisted until 52 weeks. These results demonstrated that the simultaneous inhibition of cholesterol absorption and synthesis provides a stable and greater decrease in LDL-C levels.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^11294Mp8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosage and administration information**: Take ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets orally once daily in the evening, with or without food. The maximum recommended dosage is 10 mg/40 mg once daily. The 10 mg/80 mg daily dosage is restricted to adult patients who have been taking it chronically (e.g. for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. For patients requiring a high-intensity statin or unable to achieve their LDL-C goal with the 10 mg/40 mg daily dosage, prescribe alternative LDL-C-lowering treatment. If a dose is missed, take it as soon as possible. Do not double the next dose. Assess LDL-C when clinically appropriate, as early as four weeks after initiating treatment, and adjust the dosage if necessary.

- **Dosage in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HeFH** and **dosage in patients with renal impairment**: Renal impairment is a risk factor for statin-associated myopathy. Doses exceeding 10 mg/20 mg should be used with caution and close monitoring in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. There are no dosage adjustment recommendations for patients with mild renal impairment.

### Novel therapeutic targets and agents for pediatric dyslipidemia [^114LEBmY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

With a median follow-up of 6 years, the study showed that compared to placebo, ezetimibe resulted in incremental lowering of LDL-C levels and improved cardiovascular outcomes. A 2018 meta-analysis illustrated moderate to high-quality evidence that ezetimibe had modest beneficial effects on lowering the risk of ASCVD endpoints, primarily driven by a reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke, but little or no effect on fatal endpoints.

- **Pediatric data**: Ezetimibe 10 mg/day is approved by the FDA for use in youth 10 years of age and older. Pediatric data on the use of ezetimibe is derived from two small studies. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating ezetimibe in 138 children, most of whom had heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and others with LDL-C persistently > 160 mg/dL, the use of ezetimibe resulted in greater reductions in LDL-C and total cholesterol than placebo. Another multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adolescents with HeFH, followed up to 53 weeks, showed that co-administration of ezetimibe with simvastatin was safe, well tolerated, and provided higher LDL-C reduction compared with simvastatin alone. For children between the ages of 5–9 years, limited data are available.

Ezetimibe is also used in youth with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) as an adjunct to statins and apheresis, in sitosterolemia as an adjunct to dietary therapy, in HeFH and mixed hyperlipidemia as an adjunct to dietary changes and statins, or as monotherapy in the rare event statins are not tolerated.
