## Question

what is the correlation between degenerative cervical myelopathy and spinal cord injury

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the correlation between degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) and spinal cord injury (SCI), including definitions, pathophysiology, clinical trajectories, imaging correlates, and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and epidemiology to anchor the relationship. Then, I should verify the mechanistic links that connect DCM to SCI phenotypes. Next, I will examine the clinical spectrum and natural history to quantify risk and progression. After that, I need to review imaging biomarkers that correlate with severity and outcomes. Then, I should compare DCM with traumatic SCI to clarify similarities and differences. Finally, I will translate this into diagnostic and management implications, including timing of surgery and the role of advanced imaging and biomarkers.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate entities. DCM is the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults, driven by age-related degenerative changes that compress the cervical cord, including spondylosis, disc herniation, and ligamentous hypertrophy/ossification, and it is fundamentally a non-traumatic, chronic process [^1161pkAJ] [^1165Qbni]. By contrast, SCI is an umbrella term that includes traumatic SCI (tSCI) and non-traumatic etiologies, with DCM being the most common non-traumatic cause of SCI in adults, which establishes a direct nosologic relationship between DCM and SCI rather than mere analogy [^117FWjxt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without verifying the pathophysiology. DCM produces SCI through static mechanical compression, dynamic cord strain during flexion–extension, and vascular compromise with ischemia, leading to secondary injury cascades including demyelination, axonal degeneration, neuronal apoptosis, and neuroinflammation, which are well-described in both translational and clinical literature [^1161pkAJ] [^111hyT1W] [^113Bq7YD]. I should confirm that these secondary mechanisms mirror those in tSCI in important ways; indeed, neuroimaging studies show that DCM and tSCI exhibit similar degrees of remote cord pathology rostral and caudal to the lesion, supporting shared degenerative programs despite differing etiologies [^117FWjxt].

> Next, I should review the clinical spectrum to quantify how DCM correlates with SCI phenotypes. Many patients with DCM present with incomplete cervical SCI patterns, particularly central cord syndrome features with disproportionate upper limb weakness and sensory loss, and this is especially common in older adults with preexisting cervical stenosis who sustain hyperextension injuries, underscoring the etiologic bridge between chronic compression and acute SCI syndromes [^117YQtGE] [^113icbMi]. Let me verify progression risk: without surgery, 20–60% of patients with symptomatic DCM deteriorate over 3–6 years, and among individuals with asymptomatic cord compression, about 8% convert to symptomatic DCM at 1 year and roughly 22% over longer follow-up, which quantifies the trajectory from compression to clinically manifest SCI [^112TSoxC] [^1165Qbni].

> I will now examine imaging correlates that track the severity of SCI in DCM. Standard MRI shows a stepwise pattern of injury: no signal change to T2 hyperintensity to T1 hypointensity, with T1 hypointensity indicating more permanent tissue injury and reduced likelihood of recovery. Multilevel T2 hyperintensity correlates with worse baseline severity and poorer recovery, which operationalizes MRI signal as a surrogate of SCI severity in DCM [^112zAvmu]. Wait, let me verify whether advanced imaging refines this beyond conventional sequences. Diffusion tensor imaging and magnetization transfer reveal tract-specific demyelination and axonal injury even in mild disease, and recent machine learning work shows that demyelination metrics above the compression site predict 6‑month neurological deterioration in mild DCM, supporting a causal link between microstructural SCI and clinical decline [^114426pu] [^113WxSRg] [^1179QFbb].

> But wait, what if I'm overstating the similarity between DCM and tSCI? I should double-check distinctions. DCM typically evolves chronically with compensatory plasticity, whereas tSCI is acutely disruptive; nevertheless, both show remote neurodegeneration along the neuraxis, with DCM demonstrating caudal degeneration in the lumbar enlargement and brainstem/thalamic changes detectable by quantitative MRI, indicating that chronic compression initiates widespread SCI beyond the focal compression site [^1122BgCy] [^111CdjWs] [^112o3b5Q]. Let me reconsider the comparative severity: diffusion metrics suggest more pronounced tract-specific degeneration in tSCI than in DCM at similar rostral levels, yet both exhibit substantial remote atrophy and microstructural change, reinforcing a shared degenerative phenotype despite different temporal profiles [^111yUwX9].

> Next, I should review clinical-imaging correlations to ensure diagnostic validity. The presence of cord compression on MRI correlates strongly with myelopathy on examination, and T2 hyperintensity markedly increases the odds of myelopathic signs; however, I need to ensure we don't overinterpret imaging, because symptom severity correlates only modestly with the degree of canal compromise, and advanced qMRI can detect subclinical tissue injury when conventional MRI appears unremarkable, which is crucial for early identification of SCI in DCM [^113DK8jt] [^111vkoEz] [^1179QFbb]. Hold on, I should verify that electrophysiology adds value; somatosensory evoked potentials and EMG evidence of radiculopathy can predict progression from asymptomatic compression to myelopathy, aligning neurophysiologic markers with evolving SCI in DCM [^111wde6Y] [^1157qq8i].

> I need to translate this into management implications, especially timing. Early surgical decompression halts progression and improves outcomes, with observational data suggesting better recovery when surgery occurs within about 6 months of symptom onset. Prolonged duration of symptoms negatively affects prognosis, reinforcing the concept that DCM represents a preventable form of SCI when treated promptly [^116F8ccs] [^112FXvAr]. Let me verify the role of advanced imaging in decision-making: demyelination burden and tract integrity metrics may identify patients with mild DCM at high risk of deterioration who could benefit from earlier surgery, moving care from reactive to preemptive and potentially averting irreversible SCI [^114426pu] [^112crLZ2].

> Finally, I should confirm practical diagnostic and monitoring steps. Diagnosis requires concordance of clinical myelopathic signs with imaging evidence of cord compression, and MRI is mandatory to define canal compromise and exclude mimics; in patients with progression or high-impact symptoms, urgent MRI and referral are warranted to mitigate delay-related harm from ongoing SCI [^111vkoEz] [^115ieCpK]. I should double-check that we also emphasize longitudinal monitoring in conservatively managed patients, since cord atrophy and microstructural decline can progress even without overt clinical change, which is precisely the window where SCI is silently advancing in DCM [^115Taq11] [^1179QFbb].

> In summary, DCM is not merely "like" SCI — it is a leading cause of non-traumatic SCI in adults, producing SCI through chronic mechanical compression and secondary neurodegenerative cascades that mirror, yet differ from, traumatic SCI. Clinically, DCM frequently manifests as incomplete cervical SCI, particularly central cord patterns, and its severity and prognosis correlate with imaging markers of tissue injury, supporting a direct, mechanistic, and prognostically meaningful correlation between DCM and SCI [^1161pkAJ] [^117FWjxt] [^112zAvmu].

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the **most common non-traumatic cause of spinal cord injury (SCI)** in adults, characterized by chronic cervical cord compression from spondylotic changes [^1161pkAJ] [^117FWjxt]. DCM causes a **progressive neurological decline** with gait instability, hand clumsiness, and sphincter dysfunction; if untreated, it can lead to permanent disability [^116F8ccs]. Early diagnosis and timely surgical decompression are critical to halt progression and improve outcomes, as delays increase the risk of irreversible injury [^112FXvAr] [^116F8ccs]. MRI is the **gold standard** for detecting cord compression and signal changes, and advanced imaging (DTI, MT) can reveal microstructural injury even when conventional MRI appears normal [^113CWH5w] [^1179QFbb]. The correlation is strong: DCM is a chronic, compressive SCI with a predictable natural history and clear benefits from early intervention [^1161pkAJ].

---

## Pathophysiological correlation

DCM arises from chronic cervical cord compression due to degenerative changes — disc herniation, osteophytes, ligamentous hypertrophy, and ossification — leading to **static and dynamic cord injury** [^1161pkAJ]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Mechanical compression**: Direct cord deformation causing axonal loss, demyelination, and neuronal apoptosis [^111hyT1W].
- **Ischemia**: Compression of small vessels reduces perfusion, causing ischemic injury [^115iupAG].
- **Secondary injury**: Chronic compression triggers inflammation, oxidative stress, and glutamate excitotoxicity, worsening neural damage [^113Bq7YD].

These mechanisms produce a **progressive neurological decline** that mirrors traumatic SCI, but with a slower, chronic course [^117FWjxt].

---

## Clinical correlation

DCM presents with a characteristic clinical syndrome that reflects chronic cord injury:

| **Clinical feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Gait instability | - Wide-based gait <br/> - Frequent falls <br/> - Difficulty with stairs [^111vkoEz] |
| Hand clumsiness | - Loss of dexterity <br/> - Difficulty with fine motor tasks (e.g. buttoning, writing) [^113VSiEE] |
| Sensory deficits | - Numbness <br/> - Paresthesia <br/> - Loss of proprioception in upper and lower limbs [^113VSiEE] |
| Sphincter dysfunction | Urinary urgency, retention, or incontinence in advanced cases [^113VSiEE] |
| Hyperreflexia | - Clonus <br/> - Babinski sign <br/> - Hoffmann sign [^113VSiEE] |

---

These features correlate with the degree of cord compression and microstructural injury on advanced imaging, supporting a **strong clinical-radiological correlation** [^111GRhsS] [^1179QFbb].

---

## Imaging correlation

MRI is the **gold standard** for diagnosing DCM and assessing cord injury:

- **Conventional MRI**: Shows cord compression, T2 hyperintensity (edema/myelomalacia), and T1 hypointensity (chronic injury) [^112zAvmu].
- **Advanced MRI**: DTI and magnetization transfer reveal microstructural injury (demyelination, axonal loss) even when conventional MRI is normal [^1179QFbb].
- **Quantitative metrics**: Cord cross-sectional area, fractional anisotropy, and magnetization transfer ratio correlate with clinical severity and prognosis [^112yqBsE] [^114UQaV3].

---

## Prognostic correlation

DCM shows a **predictable natural history**: 20–60% of untreated patients deteriorate neurologically over 3–6 years, and symptom duration negatively affects surgical outcomes [^112TSoxC] [^111AKCFs]. Early surgical decompression halts progression and improves function, especially when done within 6 months of symptom onset [^114mGYrE] [^116F8ccs]. Persistent deficits are more likely with advanced cord injury (T1 hypointensity, atrophy), highlighting the importance of timely intervention [^112zAvmu].

---

## Therapeutic correlation

Surgery is the **definitive treatment** for moderate-to-severe DCM, with anterior and posterior approaches selected by pathology and alignment [^1113JsPS]. Early surgery yields better neurological recovery and quality of life than conservative care, which is reserved for mild or asymptomatic cases with close monitoring [^112FXvAr] [^112TSoxC] [^114mGYrE] [^1156XKun] [^113VSiEE]. Rehabilitation complements surgery to maximize functional recovery and quality of life [^112wRSJE].

---

## Summary of correlation

DCM is a **chronic compressive SCI** with a clear pathophysiological, clinical, imaging, prognostic, and therapeutic correlation. Early recognition and surgical decompression are essential to prevent irreversible neurological decline and disability [^1161pkAJ].

Introduction

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a chronic degenerative disorder characterized by spinal cord compression and is the predominant cause of spinal cord injury among individuals over 50 years of age. With advancing age, cervical anatomical structures undergo progressive degeneration, manifesting as intervertebral disc herniation, spinal canal stenosis, and osteophyte formation, which collectively contribute to myelopathy. This compression triggers a cascade of pathological events, including Wallerian degeneration of nerve axons, demyelination, and subsequent neuronal dysfunction, manifesting clinically as gait disturbances, limb coordination difficulties, and sensory abnormalities, which substantially affect patients' quality of life. Recent research has highlighted that DCM is linked to modifications in the sensory and motor cortices, frequently ascribed to damage in the cervical neurons that extend projections to these cerebral regions. Furthermore, cortical neural plasticity may serve a compensatory role, potentially mitigating functional deficits by modifying synaptic connections or developing new neural circuits.

While neural plasticity has been proposed as a compensatory mechanism to maintain function in DCM patients, alterations in and remodeling of the brain following cervical decompression surgery (CDS) have not been extensively investigated. A review of the literature reveals both consensus and contradictions concerning the effects of CDS on the brain. Several studies have concentrated on postoperative neurological recovery, emphasizing sensory and motor improvements at the clinical level, often overlooking the potential role of brain remodeling in this process. These studies predominantly attribute recovery to direct spinal cord decompression, without considering remote brain changes in response to spinal cord injury. However, emerging research highlights the intricate interactions between the brain and spinal cord, suggesting that cervical neuronal damage can induce changes in brain function via ascending and descending pathways along the brain–spinal cord axis. In this context, DCM not only impacts spinal cord integrity but may also trigger upstream brain remodeling through neuronal damage and subsequent neural plasticity. The brain's protective mechanisms, therefore, may aid functional preservation in DCM patients, although the precise contributions of these mechanisms to long-term recovery remain unclear.

Introduction

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive neck region spinal condition first introduced in 2015 and the leading cause of chronic, non-traumatic spinal cord dysfunction worldwide. Despite its prevalence, the diagnosis of DCM remains a significant challenge for practitioners due to its diverse clinical presentations. Consequently, DCM is frequently misdiagnosed, leading to delays in specialist assessment and appropriate management. These diagnostic delays can result in severe consequences, including incomplete post-operative recovery, diminished quality of life, and significant disability, such as the inability to work. Research indicates that 20–62% of DCM patients experience clinical deterioration within 3–6 years if surgical intervention was not performed. While surgical treatment is often recommended, patient outcomes depend on the severity of preoperative functional impairment and the duration of symptoms. A retrospective study reported that the average time from symptom onset to DCM diagnosis was 2.2 ± 2.3 years. Given the potential for disease progression, prompt diagnosis and timely referral to a specialist are essential to optimize patient outcomes. While DCM's firm diagnosis requires a clinical radiological concordance (Fig. 1), the importance of DCM suspicion and a sensitivity to considering it as a differential diagnosis in non-specialist situations is an imperative.

To evaluate the clinical utility of signs and symptoms in diagnosing DCM, it is essential to assess their sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity refers to a clinical sign's ability to correctly identify patients with DCM, calculated as the proportion of true positives among all patients with the condition. Specificity measures a sign's effectiveness in correctly identifying patients without DCM, based on the proportion of true negatives among all patients without the condition. These metrics ensure that healthcare professionals make informed decisions, thereby improving patient outcomes through timely and accurate diagnosis.

While systematic reviews and meta-analysis are an important part of translating research to practice, a lack of stakeholder engagement can be a significant obstacle, potentially hindering the implementation of research findings within clinical settings. This scoping review aims to synthesize current research and clinical findings to identify the clinical signs and symptoms of DCM with high diagnostic accuracy, addressing the need for stakeholder engagement in translating research to practice.

### Mechanism of the spinal cord injury and the cervical spondylotic myelopathy: new approach based on the mechanical features of the spinal cord white and gray matter [^113k7nfi]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Object

The authors have previously investigated the mechanical properties of the white and gray matter in the bovine cervical spinal cord, demonstrating that the gray matter is more rigid, although more fragile, than the white matter. In the present study they conducted additional tensile tests on the bovine cervical spinal cord by changing strain levels and strain rates applied to the white and gray matter.

Methods

Based on their testing, the authors found the following: 1) Stress within the spinal cord relaxes over time. 2) Intracord stress is related to the strain rates or levels. The finite element method was used to compute the stress distribution within the spinal cord under three compressive loading conditions. Results from the computations showed a different stress distribution in the white and gray matter, where the distribution of stress varied with strain rate, compression volume, and the position of compression.

Conclusions

These differences in mechanical properties between the white and gray matter constitute different mechanisms contributing to the development of tissue damage and clinical symptoms.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy-update and future directions [^1161pkAJ]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults worldwide. DCM encompasses various acquired (age-related) and congenital pathologies related to degeneration of the cervical spinal column, including hypertrophy and/or calcification of the ligaments, intervertebral discs and osseous tissues. These pathologies narrow the spinal canal, leading to chronic spinal cord compression and disability. Owing to the ageing population, rates of DCM are increasing. Expeditious diagnosis and treatment of DCM are needed to avoid permanent disability. Over the past 10 years, advances in basic science and in translational and clinical research have improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of DCM and helped delineate evidence-based practices for diagnosis and treatment. Surgical decompression is recommended for moderate and severe DCM; the best strategy for mild myelopathy remains unclear. Next-generation quantitative microstructural MRI and neurophysiological recordings promise to enable quantification of spinal cord tissue damage and help predict clinical outcomes. Here, we provide a comprehensive, evidence-based review of DCM, including its definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and non-operative and operative management. With this Review, we aim to equip physicians across broad disciplines with the knowledge necessary to make a timely diagnosis of DCM, recognize the clinical features that influence management and identify when urgent surgical intervention is warranted.

### Management of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy and asymptomatic spinal cord compression: an international survey [^112aEJ6r]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Cross-sectional survey.

Objective

Currently there is limited evidence and guidance on the management of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) and asymptomatic spinal cord compression (ASCC). Anecdotal evidence suggest variance in clinical practice. The objectives of this study were to assess current practice and to quantify the variability in clinical practice.

Methods

Spinal surgeons and some additional health professionals completed a web-based survey distributed by email to members of AO Spine and the Cervical Spine Research Society (CSRS) North American Society. Questions captured experience with DCM, frequency of DCM patient encounters, and standard of practice in the assessment of DCM. Further questions assessed the definition and management of mild DCM, and the management of ASCC.

Results

A total of 699 respondents, mostly surgeons, completed the survey. Every world region was represented in the responses. Half (50.1%, n = 359) had greater than 10 years of professional experience with DCM. For mild DCM, standardised follow-up for non-operative patients was reported by 488 respondents (69.5%). Follow-up included a heterogeneous mix of investigations, most often at 6-month intervals (32.9%, n = 158). There was some inconsistency regarding which clinical features would cause a surgeon to counsel a patient towards surgery. Practice for ASCC aligned closely with mild DCM. Finally, there were some contradictory definitions of mild DCM provided in the form of free text.

Conclusions

Professionals typically offer outpatient follow up for patients with mild DCM and/or asymptomatic ASCC. However, what this constitutes varies widely. Further research is needed to define best practice and support patient care.

### The relationship between MRI signal intensity changes, clinical presentation, and surgical outcome in degenerative cervical myelopathy: analysis of a global cohort [^112zAvmu]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of prospective data.

Objective

To assess the relationship between MRI signal intensity changes, clinical presentation, and surgical outcome in degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).

Summary Of Background Data

Several studies have sought to assess the extent of spinal cord dysfunction and the potential for postoperative neurological recovery through the evaluation of spinal cord signal change on T2-weighted (T2WI) and T1-weighted images (T1WI). There remains ambiguity if T2WI and T1WI signal changes (1) relate to baseline severity, and (2) predict neurological recovery after surgical treatment.

Methods

Four hundred nineteen MRIs from two prospective multicenter studies were examined. Images were assessed for the presence, levels, and location of spinal cord signal intensity changes and compared with clinical data. Signal changes were also evaluated for the prediction of 2-year postoperative outcome using mJOA parameters.

Results

MRIs were categorized by T1WI and T2WI signal change: no signal change (28.9%), T2WI hyperintensity-only (T2WI-only, 51.8%), and T2WI-hyperintensity and T1WI-hypointensity (T1WI+T2WI, 19.3%). T2WI-hyperintensity was present at multiple levels in 27% of patients overall. Baseline severity increased from no signal change to T2WI-only to T2WI+T1WI (P < 0.0001), and there was an incremental increase in the frequency of signs/symptoms. There were no differences in outcomes between no signal change and T2WI-only groups. The presence of T1WI-hypointensity correlated with reduced recovery ratio (P = 0.03) and likelihood of an optimal surgical outcome (P = 0.005), adjusting for baseline mJOA. A greater number of T2WI-hyperintensity levels was also associated with worse baseline severity (P < 0.0001) and recovery ratio (P = 0.001).

Conclusion

This analysis of a global cohort of DCM patients shows a stepwise trend toward increasing impairment from no signal change to T2WI-hypertensity to T1WI-hypointensity. T1WI signal change indicates more permanent injury, portending decreased functional recovery. T2WI-hyperintensity alone does not predict outcomes. Multiple levels of T2WI-hyperintensity suggest additional tissue injury, correlating with worse clinical impairment and recovery potential.

### Efficacy and safety of surgery for mild degenerative cervical myelopathy: results of the AOSpine north America and international prospective multicenter studies [^114mGYrE]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive degenerative spinal condition, and the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction among adults worldwide. This clinicopathological entity encompasses osteoarthritic degeneration (ie, cervical spondylosis) and ligamentous aberrations (eg, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum [HLF]). Over 70% of individuals over 60 to 65 yr old demonstrate pathological or radiological evidence of cervical degeneration, and approximately one-quarter of these people become clinically symptomatic from mechanical neural compression. The proportion of the United States population 65 yr or older is expected to nearly double from 13% in 2010 to 22% in 2050, making optimal diagnosis and treatment of DCM a key public health priority.

Controversy in the treatment of DCM has stemmed by and large from mixed reports regarding the natural history of this condition. Although there is some variability, a large number of patients, ranging from 20% to 60%, will deteriorate neurologically over time when treated nonoperatively. Traditionally, surgical decompression for DCM was performed to halt progression of neurological dysfunction and prevent further disability. However, more recent evidence indicates that surgical intervention for DCM is actually associated with improvement in function and quality of life. As a result, surgery is now becoming standard of care for patients with clearly symptomatic DCM. Nonetheless, controversy persists regarding the optimal management of patients with only mild symptomology. The latest clinical guidelines recommend surgery for patients with moderate and severe DCM, and nonoperative treatment with serial clinical follow-up for asymptomatic patients with imaging evidence of cervical spinal cord compression. For patients with mild DCM, the guidelines suggest that either surgery or a supervised trial of structured rehabilitation is reasonable initial management strategy; the less definitive nature of this suggestion likely reflects the paucity of clinical evidence surrounding the effectiveness of surgery for patients with mild DCM. These patients present a conundrum to the surgeon. On one hand, if the disease is only causing mild symptoms, the risk-benefit scale may tip in favor of risk, with a lot to be lost, and little to be gained. The contrary view is that these patients stand to gain the most from intervention by halting progression of potentially irreversible neurological deficits early on in the course of the pathological process. Moreover, even "mild" DCM may be associated with a derangement in quality of life that patients consider unacceptable, and can perhaps be helped with operative intervention. To this end, the objectives of the present study were 2-fold: (1) to evaluate quality of life in mild DCM compared to population norms and (2) to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients with mild DCM following surgical intervention. We hypothesized that (1) patients would have significant derangement in quality of life, despite having what is considered only "mild" DCM and (2) surgery in these patients would halt progression of symptoms, and in fact lead to improved functional status and quality of life.

### Acute traumatic myelopathy: rethinking central cord syndrome [^1116w2Ne]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Central cord syndrome (CCS) is an incomplete spinal cord injury that consists of both sensory and motor changes of the upper and lower extremities. CCS most commonly occurs after trauma to the cervical spine leading to acute neurological changes. Despite being the most common incomplete spinal cord injury with the best outcomes, optimal treatment remains controversial. Although clinical practice has shifted from primarily conservative management to early surgical intervention, many questions remain unanswered and treatment remains varied. One of the most limiting aspects of CCS remains the diagnosis itself. CCS, by definition, is a syndrome with a very specific pattern of neurological deficits. In practice and in the literature, CCS has been used to describe a spectrum of neurological conditions and traumatic morphologies. Establishing clarity will allow for more accurate decision making by clinicians involved in the care of these injuries. The authors emphasize that a more precise term for the clinical condition in question is acute traumatic myelopathy: an acute cervical cord injury in the setting of a stable spine with either congenital and/or degenerative stenosis.

### Quantifying neurodegeneration of the cervical cord and brain in degenerative cervical myelopathy: a multicentre study using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging [^111CdjWs]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Focal damage to the spinal cord also remotely perturbs tissue integrity of ascending and descending tracts. Our observations of neurodegenerative changes (decreased R1 as an indirect measure of myelin changes) in the PAG of DCM patients support the hypothesis of ongoing demyelination within the brainstem extending the loss of tissue integrity from the cervical cord towards the brain. Reduced fibre density within tracts passing through the brainstem to sensorimotor areas has been identified in DCM patients. However, atrophy of the sensorimotor cortices was not observed in our cohort. One possible explanation may be that most patients were only mildly affected, and therefore volumetric changes were not as pronounced yet but may already have been initiated. We identified that within the atrophied thalamus, microstructural alterations sensitive to myelin were occurring in this mild–moderately affected DCM cohort. Decreased R1, increased R2*, and concomitant atrophy provide evidence for ongoing neurodegenerative changes indirectly, driven by the presence of myelopathy of the cervical cord. These findings are in line with studies conducted in traumatic spinal cord injury patients. In spinal cord injury, decreased GM volume in the right thalamus was paralleled by increased iron‐sensitive R2* values 2 years after acute traumatic spinal cord injury. It has been suggested that the observed iron accumulation was caused by oxidative stress and chronic inflammation provoking myelin breakdown. Several studies have already investigated the role of the thalamus in the progression of DCM. However, most studies focused on macrostructural changes such as volumetric measures or modified connectivity. Previous studies showed that chronic cervical cord compression results in compromised tissue integrity of spinal GM and WM tracts, which ultimately affect the thalamus. Our findings together with previous reports emphasize the involvement of thalamic sensory nuclei in ongoing degeneration in DCM patients. Interestingly, microstructural changes revealed in the posterior part of the corpus callosum support the hypothesis that progressive compression impacts distantly lying regions of the neuroaxis. Postmortem human and primate studies discovered a topographical organization within the corpus callosum, disclosing that some of the posterior fibres connect the parietal cerebral hemispheres and integrate somatosensory information. Previously abnormal diffusion patterns in the corpus callosum of DCM patients were demonstrated indicating ongoing demyelination and inflammation. Therefore, reduced directional coherence of axonal projections of WM tracts including the corpus callosum are believed to be a consequence of chronic spinal cord compression, which is in line with the correlation of remote neurodegeneration with clinical impairment.

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a brief review of its pathophysiology, clinical course, and diagnosis [^1137nQcF]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Degenerative disease of the cervical spine commonly occurs in the natural process of aging. This can lead to compression of the spinal cord and symptomatic myelopathy. We review the pathophysiological factors that lead to myelopathy and the controversial natural history of untreated myelopathy. Signs and symptoms at presentation, examination findings, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic studies are also discussed.

### Abstract… [^116SANwk]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology of CSM Spondylosis refers to the degenerative changes that occur in the spine, including degeneration of the joints, intervertebral discs, ligaments and connective tissue of the cervical vertebrae. There are three important pathophysiologic factors in the development of CSM: static mechanical; dynamic mechanical; and spinal cord ischemia. Osteophytic overgrowth ventrally and, in some cases, buckling of the ligamentum flavum dorsally can cause direct compression of the spinal cord resulting in myelopathy. Symptoms are believed to develop when the spinal cord has been reduced by at least 30 percent. 4 Dynamic mechanical factors relate to the fact that the normal motion of the cervical spine may aggravate spinal cord damage precipitated by direct mechanical static compression. During flexion, the spinal cord lengthens, thus stretching over ventral osteophytic ridges.

During extension, the ligamentum flavum may buckle into the spinal cord causing a reduction of available space for the spinal cord. Spinal cord ischemia probably plays a role in the development of CSM, particularly in later stages. 5, 6 Histopathologic changes in the spinal cord consistent with ischemia have been observed in patients with CSM. However, the precise mechanism for spinal cord ischemia is not completely understood. Other factors associated with the development of spondylosis include heavy labor, posture and genetic predisposition. 7, 8 Also, 70 percent of patients with Down syndrome have an increased incidence of spondylosis by 50 years of age.
9. **Clinical History Patients with CSM will generally have these symptoms**: neck stiffness; unilateral or bilateral deep, aching neck, arm and shoulder pain; and possibly stiffness or clumsiness while walking.

Imaging and Diagnostic Studies Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine is the procedure of choice during the initial screening process of patients with suspected CSM. 15 MRI is noninvasive and provides images of the spine and spinal cord in several planes. In addition to giving an assessment of the degree of spinal canal stenosis, an MRI can identify intrinsic spinal cord lesions that can also present with myelopathy. High signal changes seen in the spinal cord of patients with CSM may indicate myelomalacia or permanent spinal cord damage.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^115kMZw6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Spondylotic degeneration in the cervical spine may result in static and/or dynamic spinal cord compression that can lead to the associated signs and symptoms of myelopathy. Clinical examination combined with appropriate imaging studies help to confirm the diagnosis. Classic natural history and basic science studies suggest a pernicious course of demyelination and neurologic decline in a large subset of patients. The characterization of disease severity and progression in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy has improved in recent years with imaging and data from prospective and multicenter studies. Additionally, advances in surgical techniques, implants, and imaging modalities have improved the identification of surgical candidates with cervical spondylotic myelopathy and associated treatment strategies. Surgical treatment, via an anterior, posterior, or a combined approach, is primarily intended to arrest neurologic progression, although it can improve function in many patients. Alignment and the characteristics and location of spinal cord compression help determine the ideal surgical approach. Distinct complications associated with each technique may be mitigated by appropriate patient selection and should be discussed preoperatively to ensure informed decision making.

### Extent of cord pathology in the lumbosacral enlargement in non-traumatic versus traumatic spinal cord injury [^1122BgCy]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

This study compares remote neurodegenerative changes caudal to a cervical injury in degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM; i.e., non-traumatic) and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) patients, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based tissue area measurements and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Eighteen mild-to-moderate DCM patients with sensory impairments (modified Japanese Orthopedic score: 16.2 ± 1.9), 14 incomplete tetraplegic tSCI patients (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale C and D), and 20 healthy controls were recruited. All participants received DTI and T2✱-weighted scans in the lumbosacral enlargement (caudal to injury) and at C2/C3 (rostral to injury). MRI readouts included DTI metrics in the white matter (WM) columns and cross-sectional WM and gray matter area. One-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc comparison (p < 0.05) was used to assess group differences. In the lumbosacral enlargement, compared with DCM, tSCI patients exhibited decreased fractional anisotropy in the lateral (tSCI vs. DCM, -11.9%, p = 0.007) and ventral WM column (-8.0%, p = 0.021), and showed a trend toward lower values in the dorsal column (-8.9%, p = 0.068). At C2/C3, compared with controls, fractional anisotropy was lower in both groups in the dorsal (DCM vs. controls, -7.9%, p = 0.024; tSCI vs. controls, -10.0%, p = 0.007) and in the lateral column (DCM: -6.2%, p = 0.039; tSCI: -13.3%, p < 0.001), while tSCI patients had lower fractional anisotropy than DCM patients in the lateral column (-7.6%, p = 0.029). WM areas were not different between patient groups but were lower compared with controls in the lumbosacral enlargement (DCM: -16.9%, p < 0.001; tSCI: -10.5%, p = 0.043) and at C2/C3 (DCM: -16.0%, p < 0.001; tSCI: -18.1%, p < 0.001). In conclusion, mild-to-moderate DCM and incomplete tSCI lead to similar degree of degeneration of the dorsal and lateral columns at C2/C3, but tSCI results in more widespread white matter damage in the lumbosacral enlargement. These remote changes are likely to contribute to the patients' impairment and recovery. DTI is a sensitive tool to assess remote pathological changes in DCM and tSCI patients.

### Pathobiology of cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^114s1p4o]. European Spine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

In this narrative review, we aim to outline what is currently known about the pathophysiology of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction. In particular, we note the unique factors that distinguish it from acute spinal cord injury. Despite its common occurrence, the reasons why some patients develop severe symptomatology while others have few or no symptoms despite radiographic evidence confirming similar degrees of compression is poorly understood. Neither is there a clear understanding of why certain patients have a stable clinical myelopathy and others present with only mild myelopathy. Moreover, the precise molecular mechanisms which contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease are incompletely understood. The current treatment method is decompression of the spinal cord but a lack of clinically relevant models of CSM have hindered the understanding of the full pathophysiology which would aid the development of new therapeutic avenues of investigation. Further elucidation of the role of ischemia, currently a source of debate, as well as the complex cascade of biomolecular events as a result of the unique pathophysiology in this disease will pave the way for further neuroprotective strategies to be developed to attenuate the physiological consequences of surgical decompression and augment its benefits.

### Are subjects with spondylotic cervical cord encroachment at increased risk of cervical spinal cord injury after minor trauma? [^114RsRiq]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to analyse the risk of symptomatic myelopathy after minor trauma in patients with asymptomatic spondylotic cervical spinal cord encroachment (ASCCE). In a cohort of 199 patients with ASCCE, previously followed prospectively in a study investigating progression into symptomatic myelopathy, the authors looked retrospectively for traumatic episodes that may have involved injury to the cervical spine. A questionnaire and data file analysis were employed to highlight whatever hypothetical relationship might emerge with the development of symptomatic myelopathy. Fourteen traumatic episodes in the course of a follow-up of 44 months (median) were recorded in our group (who had been instructed to avoid risky activities), with no significant association with the development of symptomatic myelopathy (found in 45 cases). Only three minor traumatic events without fracture of the cervical spine were found among the symptomatic myelopathy cases, with no chronological relationship between trauma and myelopathy. Furthermore, 56 traumatic spinal cord events were found before the diagnosis of cervical cord encroachment was established, with no correlation to either type of compression (discogenic vs osteophytic). In conclusion, the risk of spinal cord injury after minor trauma of the cervical spine in patients with ASCCE appeared to be low in our cohort provided risky activities in these individuals are restricted. Implementation of preventive surgical decompression surgery into clinical practice in these individuals should be postponed until better-designed studies provide proof enough for it to take precedence over a conservative approach.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^116XuKTf]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders — working definition: Cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders can be defined as pain in a radicular pattern in one or both upper extremities related to compression and/or irritation of one or more cervical nerve roots, with frequent sensory, motor and reflex changes and dysesthesias and paresthesias related to the nerve root(s) without evidence of spinal cord dysfunction (myelopathy).

### Management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy with insights from metabolic imaging of the spinal cord and brain [^112F9sgW]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a potentially debilitating disorder primarily related to spinal cord injury caused by degenerative changes of the spine. As the population continues to age and live longer, it is likely that this disorder will be encountered with increasing frequency.

Recent Findings

Surgical management continues to be a mainstay of treatment of CSM patients, but some studies have indicated that nonoperative treatment may be equivalent to surgical management in some patients. Recent advances in neuroimaging of the spinal cord and brain have provided novel information regarding the pathogenesis of CSM, as well as compensatory mechanisms to preserve neurological function.

Summary

CSM is a complex disorder whose incidence is likely to increase in coming years. Prospective, randomized studies are required to help establish the optimal treatment paradigm. Recent advances such as novel neuroimaging techniques and the continued development of neural repair strategies to treat the secondary biological injury associated with this disorder are likely to play key roles in the future management of CSM.

### Surgical management of degenerative cervical myelopathy: a consensus statement [^1113JsPS]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), including cervical spondylotic myelopathy and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, presents a heterogeneous set of variables reflecting its complex nature. Multiple studies in the past have attempted to elucidate an ideal surgical algorithm that surgeons may use when treating these patients, unfortunately all studies to date, including the rigorous systematic review used in this focus issue, have fallen short in identifying a superior approach when addressing DCM. Likely because of a superior approach being nonexistent because there are multiple pathoanatomical considerations. In addition to the multitude of variables that spine surgeons face when deciding the treatment options for patients with DCM, the previous studies that have been published, unfortunately, lack in consistent outcome and complication reporting. Therefore, synthesizing a treatment algorithm remains difficult, however, the articles in this focus issue use the GRADE system to assess the overall quality (strength) of available evidence and, where appropriate, formulate evidence-based recommendations. Factors that should be included in surgical decision making are the sagittal alignment, anatomical location of the compressive pathology, number of levels of compression, presence of absence or instability or subluxation, the type compressive pathology (e.g., spondylosis vs. ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament), neck anatomy, bone quality, and surgeon experience or preference. Fortunately, as reviewed in the accompanying articles, a number of excellent surgical options exist that can be selected on the basis of the aforementioned pathoanatomical considerations.

### Magnetic resonance imaging assessment of degenerative cervical myelopathy: a review of structural changes and measurement techniques [^112GhXG5]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy encompasses a spectrum of age-related structural changes of the cervical spine that result in static and dynamic injury to the spinal cord and collectively represent the most common cause of myelopathy in adults. Although cervical myelopathy is determined clinically, the diagnosis requires confirmation via imaging, and MRI is the preferred modality. Because of the heterogeneity of the condition and evolution of MRI technology, multiple techniques have been developed over the years in an attempt to quantify the degree of baseline severity and potential for neurological recovery. In this review, these techniques are categorized anatomically into those that focus on bone, ligaments, discs, and the spinal cord. In addition, measurements for the cervical spine canal size and sagittal alignment are also described briefly. These tools have resulted collectively in the identification of numerous useful parameters. However, the development of multiple techniques for assessing the same feature, such as cord compression, has also resulted in a number of challenges, including introducing ambiguity in terms of which methods to use and hindering effective comparisons of analysis in the literature. In addition, newer techniques that use advanced MRI are emerging and providing exciting new tools for assessing the spinal cord in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy.

### Management of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy and asymptomatic spinal cord compression: an international survey [^116GVSes]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations and future work

The survey was principally disseminated by two global spinal organisations; AO Spine and CSRS and it is noted that some groups may have been underrepresented. For example, Asia contributed 29% of responses, and Africa only 3%. Further the survey used a clinician's recollection of practice, making it vulnerable to recall bias. The overall large sample size, and the broad heterogeneity, with absence of trends event amongst subgroups, suggest this has not limited the findings.

The most pressing future work is to generate robust guidelines for non-operative patients.

This would benefit from a more detailed characterisation of DCM natural history, including the identification of any predictors of deterioration. Standardised patient follow-up is necessary to perform this analysis. A combination of clinician education and practical decision support tools may form first steps to ensure that this is conducted, using expect opinion to bridge known evidence gaps.

### Plasma proteomic biomarkers of degenerative cervical myelopathy in the UK biobank [^115finvD]. Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The diagnosis of spinal cord dysfunction in degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is currently based on correlating clinical signs and symptoms with neuroimaging findings. Plasma proteomics represents an opportunity to establish objective, blood-based biomarkers, which predict DCM severity or response to surgical intervention. These methods may also support novel insights into its pathophysiological relationship with other neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), which also can present with myelopathy, or peripheral neuropathy (PN), which has overlapping symptoms with DCM. In this study, we examined the relationships between circulating blood protein levels with DCM, MS, and PN using data from the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project.

Methods

The plasma proteomic profiles of participants with a diagnosis of DCM within 5 years of blood draw, who had not undergone surgical intervention (n = 42) were compared with those without known neural injury or neurodegenerative disease (n = 39519) using case-control matching. To further characterize the difference between central and peripheral nerve injury, case-control analyses were also performed using participants with a diagnosis of MS (n = 125) and PN (n = 101) within 5 years of blood draw.

Results

The top proteins significantly associated with DCM included neuron markers RNA-binding Fox-1 homolog 3 and neurofilament light chain. These proteins were also significantly elevated in the PN group relative to controls, and neurofilament light was elevated in MS.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that neural injury in DCM can be detected using blood protein levels and may hold value in diagnostic, monitoring, and potentially prognostic applications.

### Spinal cord demyelination predicts neurological deterioration in patients with mild degenerative cervical myelopathy [^113LJPvf]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

For patients with mild DCM, there is uncertainty about whether to pursue surgical intervention because symptoms are relatively mild and it has been difficult to reliably predict if neurological deterioration will occur. This study demonstrated that a combination of clinical and qMRI metrics that capture information relevant to the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury offer improved predictive ability with respect to clinical deterioration after a diagnosis of mild DCM. In doing so, this study has demonstrated the utility of semi-automated qMRI-derived metrics and supports the need for advanced imaging in the monitoring and clinical decision-making process for patients with mild DCM.

### Fusion or no fusion after decompression of the spinal… [^115yZ1pH]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Background: Degenerative cervical myelopathy is characterized by neck pain, neck stiffness, weakness, paresthesia, sphincter disturbance and balance disorder. The mean age for symptoms is 64 years and more men than women, 2. 7: 1, are affected. The most common level is C5-C6. Secondary outcomes are the patient derived modified Japanese orthopaedic association score, Neck disability index, European quality of life five dimensions, Numeric rating scale for neck and arm pain, Hospital anxiety and depression scale, development of kyphosis measured as the cervical sagittal vertical axis and, death. Background: Degenerative cervical myelopathy is characterized by neck pain and stiffness, weakness and paresthesia of the extremities, sphincter disturbance and bowel and balance disorder.

DCM is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in the elderly worldwide and the incidence is 41 per million within North America. The mean age for symptoms is 64 years of age, more men than women, 2. 7: 1, are affected and the most common level is C5-C6. Mechanism: DCM is typically the consequence of degenerative disc herniation, osteophyte formation and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum that compress the spinal cord. Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, which is more prevalent in the Asian population, may also cause compression of the spinal cord. Study setting:

- Uppsala University Hospital
- Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm
- Ryhov Hospital, Jönköping
- **Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg Sample size**: Based on data from the national Swedish spine registry on patients with CSM, reoperation was estimated to 3. 4% after standalone laminectomy and
7. 9% after laminectomy and fusion. Five year mortality was estimated to 16.

3% in the same population.
- Age > 18 years
- 1–4 levels of cervical degenerative myelopathy in the subaxial spine, C3-C7, without or with deformity not exceeding exclusion criteria, see below.
- Eligible for both treatments
- Ability to understand and read Swedish language
- Symptomatic myelopathy with at least one clinical sign of myelopathy.

### Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging reveals tract-specific microstructural correlates of electrophysiological impairments in non-myelopathic and myelopathic spinal cord compression [^115VMWK2]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Non-myelopathic degenerative cervical spinal cord compression (NMDC) frequently occurs throughout aging and may progress to potentially irreversible degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). Whereas standard clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electrophysiological measures assess compression severity and neurological dysfunction, respectively, underlying microstructural deficits still have to be established in NMDC and DCM patients. The study aims to establish tract-specific diffusion MRI markers of electrophysiological deficits to predict the progression of asymptomatic NMDC to symptomatic DCM.

Methods

High-resolution 3 T diffusion MRI was acquired for 103 NMDC and 21 DCM patients compared to 60 healthy controls to reveal diffusion alterations and relationships between tract-specific diffusion metrics and corresponding electrophysiological measures and compression severity. Relationship between the degree of DCM disability, assessed by the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale, and tract-specific microstructural changes in DCM patients was also explored.

Results

The study identified diffusion-derived abnormalities in the gray matter, dorsal and lateral tracts congruent with trans-synaptic degeneration and demyelination in chronic degenerative spinal cord compression with more profound alterations in DCM than NMDC. Diffusion metrics were affected in the C3–6 area as well as above the compression level at C3 with more profound rostral deficits in DCM than NMDC. Alterations in lateral motor and dorsal sensory tracts correlated with motor and sensory evoked potentials, respectively, whereas electromyography outcomes corresponded with gray matter microstructure. DCM disability corresponded with microstructure alteration in lateral columns.

Conclusions

Outcomes imply the necessity of high-resolution tract-specific diffusion MRI for monitoring degenerative spinal pathology in longitudinal studies.

### Proposing a framework to understand the role of imaging in degenerative cervical myelopathy: enhancement of MRI protocols needed for accurate diagnosis and evaluation [^112crLZ2]. Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

SPINAL CORD DISTRESS AND TIMELY MANAGEMENT

The translation of these techniques is most likely to benefit patients with mild forms of DCM where there is greater diagnostic uncertainty, for example, with fewer displaying the more objective examination findings (e.g. Hoffman sign), but also given the management uncertainty; are the risks of surgery warranted against the natural history of mild DCM? In keeping with DCM research in general, relatively few imaging studies have investigated mild myelopathy. Martin et al used microstructural MRI, in particular T2✱ gray matter/white matter ratio assessment, to identify subclinical evidence of spinal cord damage in a cohort of patients with cervical stenosis, thus confirming promise. This finding is supported by similar studies using multimodal evoked potentials, suggesting solutions may also lie outside of imaging. Whatever the modality, the development of assessments to unlock this conundrum is crucial: being able to identify who requires surgery, and perform it before there is irreversible damage, would transform outcomes for DCM, moving it from a paradigm of reactive to pre-emptive care.

### A novel MRI biomarker of spinal cord white matter injury: T2✱-weighted white matter to gray matter signal intensity ratio [^112yqBsE]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

T2✱-weighted imaging provides sharp contrast between spinal cord GM and WM, allowing their segmentation and cross-sectional area measurement. Injured WM demonstrates T2✱WI hyperintensity but requires normalization for quantitative use. We introduce T2✱WI WM/GM signal-intensity ratio and compare it against cross-sectional area, the DTI metric fractional anisotropy, and magnetization transfer ratio in degenerative cervical myelopathy.

Materials and Methods

Fifty-eight patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy and 40 healthy subjects underwent 3T MR imaging, covering C1-C7. Metrics were automatically extracted at maximally compressed and uncompressed rostral/caudal levels. Normalized metrics were compared with t tests, area under the curve, and logistic regression. Relationships with clinical measures were analyzed by using Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression.

Results

The maximally compressed level cross-sectional area demonstrated superior differences (P = 1 × 10–13), diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve = 0.890), and univariate correlation with the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score (0.66). T2✱WI WM/GM showed strong differences (rostral: P = 8 × 10–7; maximally compressed level: P = 1 × 10–11; caudal: P = 1 × 10–4), correlations (modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score; rostral: -0.52; maximally compressed level: -0.59; caudal: -0.36), and diagnostic accuracy (rostral: 0.775; maximally compressed level: 0.860; caudal: 0.721), outperforming fractional anisotropy and magnetization transfer ratio in most comparisons and cross-sectional area at rostral/caudal levels. Rostral T2✱WI WM/GM showed the strongest correlations with focal motor (-0.45) and sensory (-0.49) deficits and was the strongest independent predictor of the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score (P = 0.01) and diagnosis (P = 0.02) in multivariate models (R² = 0.59, P = 8 × 10–13; area under the curve = 0.954, respectively).

Conclusions

T2✱WI WM/GM shows promise as a novel biomarker of WM injury. It detects damage in compressed and uncompressed regions and contributes substantially to multivariate models for diagnosis and correlation with impairment. Our multiparametric approach overcomes limitations of individual measures, having the potential to improve diagnostics, monitor progression, and predict outcomes.

### Cervical cord neurodegeneration in traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord injury [^115SHrhS]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) and non-traumatic degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) are conditions that arise from focal cervical damage. The most obvious difference between a traumatic and non-traumatic cervical myelopathy lies in the time profile of neural changes (acute onset in tSCI vs. slowly developing symptoms in DCM). Due to progressive impairment of gait and the increasing risk of falls, DCM patients can develop a central cord syndrome, which per definition is a tSCI. Experimental evidence suggests that tSCI and DCM share several aspects of myelopathy with a combination of alpha-motoneuron damage (lesion of the central gray), demyelination, and axonal damage of long projecting spinal nerve fiber tracts (white matter damage), as well as edema and ischemic changes. Both etiologies present with varying degrees of upper limb impairmentthat can be assessed by comprehensive clinical protocols sensitive to sensorimotor functions (e.g. Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility, and Prehension [GRASSP]). Although such advanced clinical assessment allows quantifying the degree of impairment, it cannot disclose the underlying pathophysiology that occurs at the microstructural level.

Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) shows potential to detect such specific (micro-) structural changes in the spinal cord, both in tSCIand in DCM patients. To compare the magnitude of injury-induced neurodegenerative changes in both etiologies, we applied high-resolution T2✱-weighted MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) above the injury level. We hypothesized that tSCI patients should show a more pronounced pattern of neurodegenerative changes compared with DCM patients, in which the disease slowly develops over time.

### Proposing a framework to understand the role of imaging in degenerative cervical myelopathy: enhancement of MRI protocols needed for accurate diagnosis and evaluation [^112Dxn95]. Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

IMMEDIATE OUTLOOK

While these new modalities remain in development, there are many simpler gains. For example, from discussions within the RECODE DCM working group, it became apparent the imaging framework would support educational initiatives. For example, those living with DCM referenced the common "lay" misconception that a diagnostic test provides certainty. For similar reasons, this could help raise awareness among nonexpert professionals, to identify those with seemingly mild stenosis and symptoms and allow for timely management, while avoiding surgery in patients with asymptomatic stenosis.

Future directions in the neuroimaging evaluation of DCM require a standardized definition of spinal canal narrowing, spinal cord compression and intrinsic cord signal changes. Systematic literature reviews with consensus-based evidence synthesis could set the stage for the development of an objective imaging diagnostic framework for DCM. Creating a simple framework for diagnosis in DCM has the potential to dramatically change care and outcomes. Novel methods for determining spinal cord distress are currently under examination and may reshape our view on DCM, but remain a work in progress. We look forward to the feedback and perspectives of the community and hope more will work with us on this endeavor.

### The relationship between preoperative clinical presentation and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging features in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy [^111GRhsS]. Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Degenerative cervical myelopathy encompasses a group of conditions resulting in progressive spinal cord injury through static and dynamic compression. Although a constellation of changes can present on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the clinical significance of these findings remains a subject of controversy and discussion.

Objective

To investigate the relationship between clinical presentation and quantitative MRI features in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy.

Methods

A secondary analysis of MRI and clinical data from 114 patients enrolled in a prospective, multicenter study was conducted. MRIs were assessed for maximum spinal cord compression (MSCC), maximum canal compromise (MCC), signal changes, and a signal change ratio (SCR). MRI features were compared between patients with and those without myelopathy symptoms with the use of t tests. Correlations between MRI features and duration of symptoms were assessed with the Spearman ρ.

Results

Numb hands and Hoffmann sign were associated with greater MSCC (P < .05); broad-based, unstable gait, impairment of gait, and Hoffmann sign were associated with greater MCC (P < .05); and numb hands, Hoffmann sign, Babinski sign, lower limb spasticity, hyperreflexia, and T1 hypointensity were associated with greater SCR (P < .05). Patients with a T2 signal hyperintensity had greater MSCC and MCC (P < .001).

Conclusion

MSCC was associated with upper limb manifestations, and SCR was associated with upper limb, lower limb, and general neurological deficits. Hoffmann sign occurred more commonly in patients with a greater MSCC, MCC and SCR. The Lhermitte phenomenon presented more commonly in patients with a lower SCR and may be an early indicator of mild spinal cord involvement. Research to validate these findings is required.

### Increasing awareness of degenerative cervical myelopathy: a preventative cause of non-traumatic spinal cord injury [^113icbMi]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Perspective

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) (historically termed "cervical spondylotic myelopathy" [CSM]) is the most common non-traumatic, progressive spinal cord disorder with an estimated 2% prevalence. The disorder is indeed imprecisely and insufficiently characterized by neck and radicular pain, fine motor dysfunction, gait instability, and bladder dysfunction and for most lacks common diagnostic criteria. If not recognized and treated timely, patients may eventually present as incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). This letter aims to raise awareness of these shortcomings in the neurological community and emphasize an ongoing initiative to improve clinical care and foster global research. The neurological field should not be left out in this effort.

Due to a variety of symptoms, patients eventually get referred to different specialists, commonly orthopedics, neurosurgeons, neurologists, or physiotherapists. While surgical decompression of the encroached spinal cord is recommended in patients experiencing already moderate/severe, or progressive symptoms, the goal of enabling earlier and/or preventative treatment has now been defined as a priority research need. In its early stages, DCM is frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome or peripheral neuropathy, until patients develop more severe impairments of upper and lower limb function urging the consideration of incomplete cervical SCI. Given that DCM is a progressive but preventable neurological condition, the delayed diagnosis and late referral for evaluation of surgical decompression, can lead to poorer neurological outcomes. In addition, the pre-operative neurological status significantly influences post-operative recovery. Therefore, an early diagnosis is important to achieve good clinical results. The diagnosis of DCM is currently based on clinical signs and symptoms, eventually complemented by cervical spine MRI. However, there is still no consensus on diagnostic criteria for DCM, leading to ambiguous, descriptive clinical diagnoses, and heterogenous definitions of DCM applied in clinical studies. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the UK, DCM is rarely covered in the medical curriculum. AO Spine RECODE-DCM (REsearch Objectives and Common Data Elements for Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy) (aospine.org/recode) is an international, interdisciplinary, and interprofessional initiative, including patients with DCM, which aims to accelerate knowledge discovery that can change outcomes. This has included the formation of research priorities such as the development of common diagnostic criteria. Alongside its importance for clinical care, a sensitive and specific set of diagnostic criteria is required to foster research, particularly for those studies aiming at investigating neuroprotective strategies. Diagnostic criteria for DCM can help to overcome several shortcomings in patient care and research (Fig. 1). The development of diagnostic criteria for DCM would benefit from the experiences of the neurological community; a UK cohort study identified 45% of cases are initially diagnosed by Neurologists, whilst Neurologists are familiar with their development and implementation. Common criteria will help the dialog between neurologists, general practitioners (primary care providers), and spine specialists, and propagate the knowledge of red flags in DCM that require timely and specific actions, before established SCI. The development of diagnostic criteria involves both comprehensive diagnostic criteria for research and spine specialists, as well as easily applicable algorithms that speed up referral to cervical spine MRI and spine specialists. We have established an initial working group to act upon this opportunity (AO Spine RECODE DCM Diagnostic Criteria Incubator). If you are interested in contributing to this process, please contact us.

### Proposing a framework to understand the role of imaging in degenerative cervical myelopathy: enhancement of MRI protocols needed for accurate diagnosis and evaluation [^112gw8P9]. Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common form of spinal cord impairment in adults. DCM is an important, disabling and unfortunately frequently overlooked condition, which is estimated to affect as many as one in 50 adults.–Despite the prevalence of DCM, awareness of this condition among members of the public and even among physicians is lacking. Thus, many patients do not receive a timely diagnosis, with wait times to the time of diagnosis ranging on average two to five years. Given the frequent delays in diagnosis and treatment, many will be left with lifelong disabilities despite appropriate surgical intervention. AO Spine RECODE DCM (REsearch Objectives and Common Data Elements for Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy) was formed as an international, interdisciplinary, and interprofessional initiative, including patients with DCM. One of the research priorities is the development of comprehensive diagnostic criteria for DCM, to facilitate early diagnosis and timely management. This requires standardized clinical evaluation metrics based on objective and reproducible signs and symptoms coupled with advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches with standardized evaluation approaches. This is pertinent to DCM, as MRI findings, such as cord compression, are often incidental and only weakly correlate with disease severity. To stimulate research and awareness, we discuss a proposed diagnostic framework to advance the role of imaging in the diagnosis of DCM.

This article was reviewed and endorsed by individuals experiencing DCM who were part of a committee at Myelopathy.org. The committee was keen to emphasise the possible prevalence of DCM and its long term effects, even after surgery. More specifically, it was involved in shaping the paragraph "What is DCM?"

Myelopathy.org is the first organisation dedicated to raising awareness, providing information, and supporting research for DCM. It provides a forum for individuals to communicate their experiences of DCM and offers peer to peer support to patients. Reports of delayed and/or misdiagnosis are common, which result from a lack of awareness among frontline medical specialties, particularly primary care. The committee proposed an educational initiative, which included this article.

### Contact heat evoked potentials reveal distinct patterns of spinal cord impairment in degenerative cervical myelopathy beyond MRI lesions [^113CWH5w]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common nontraumatic spinal cord disorder in the elderly. Diagnosis is challenging due to variable clinical presentation with an insidious onset. When left to its natural course, DCM may progress into tetraplegia characterized by severe functional impairments that significantly impact an individual's quality of life. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spinal cord is currently regarded as the gold standard in the initial diagnostic workup, providing indices of spinal canal stenosis and/or cord compression and allowing the exclusion of differential diagnoses (e.g. radiculopathy or malignancies). However, in some instances, there is no clear association between the measures of cord compression or signal alterations observed on MRI scans and the severity of clinical signs and symptoms. Therefore, cases with less apparent cord compression may still present with significant clinical impairments. In addition, spinal cord compression is a frequent finding in the elderly population (up to 66.8%); yet most individuals remain asymptomatic and only a small fraction develop signs and symptoms of DCM. Natural disease progression, particularly in asymptomatic individuals, remains poorly understood. In a prospective study of individuals with asymptomatic cord compression, 8% developed signs and symptoms of DCM after 1 year. MRI findings may be inconspicuous at early stages, and the morphology of increased intramedullary T2‐weighted signal intensity (i.e. T2‐positive DCM) is neither predictive of outcomes after conventional management nor after surgical intervention. Thus, there remains a pressing clinical need for additional predictive and prognostic biomarkers for DCM. Ideally, such biomarkers should capture the presumed pathophysiological cascade of dynamic and static mechanic cord strain, eventually leading to chronic ischemia and inflammatory processes in the spinal cord.

### Pathophysiology and natural history of cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^113Bq7YD]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

This study is a combination of narrative and systematic review.

Objective

Clinicians who deal with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) should be up-to-date with the emerging knowledge related to the cascade of pathobiological secondary events that take place under chronic cervical spinal cord compression. Moreover, by performing a systematic review, we aim to (1) describe the natural history and (2) determine potential risk factors that affect the progression of CSM.

Summary Of Background Data

The pathophysiology, natural history, as well as the factors associated with clinical deterioration have not been fully described in CSM.

Methods

For the first part of the study, a literature review was performed. To answer key questions 1 and 2 of the second goal, a systematic search was conducted in PubMed and the Cochrane Collaboration Library for articles published between January 1, 1956, and November 7, 2012. We included all articles that described the progression and outcomes of CSM for which no surgical intervention was given.

Results

By performing a narrative literature review, we found that the assumption that acute traumatic spinal cord injury and CSM share a similar series of cellular and molecular secondary injury events was made in the past. However, recent advances in basic research have shown that the chronic mechanical compression results in secondary injury mechanisms that have distinct characteristics regarding the nature and the temporal profile compared with those of spinal cord injury. For the purpose of the systematic review, 10 studies yielding 16 publications met inclusion criteria for key questions 2 and 3. Moderate-strength evidence related to the natural history of CSM suggests that 20% to 60% of patients will deteriorate neurologically over time without surgical intervention. Finally, there is low-strength evidence indicating that the area of circumferential compression is associated with deteriorating neurological symptoms.

Conclusion

CSM has unique pathobiological mechanisms that mainly remain unexplored. Although the natural history of CSM can be mixed, surgical intervention eliminates the chances of the neurological deterioration. EVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

Recommendation

Evidence concerning the natural history of CSM suggests that 20% to 60% of patients will deteriorate neurologically over time without surgical intervention. Therefore, we recommend that patients with mild CSM be counseled regarding the natural history of CSM and have the option of surgical decompression explained.

Overall Strength Of Evidence

Moderate.

Strength Of Recommendation

Strong. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: Chronic compression of the spinal cord results in progressive neural cell loss related to secondary mechanisms including apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and vascular disruption.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy: recognition and management [^113VSiEE]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy encompasses a collection of pathologic conditions that result in progressive spinal cord dysfunction secondary to cord compression. Patients are typically male (3: 1 male-to-female ratio), and the average age of presentation is 64 years. The exact incidence is unclear because of differences in terminology and because radiographic findings can be present in asymptomatic individuals. Common examination findings include neck pain or stiffness, a wide-based ataxic gait, ascending paresthesia in the upper or lower extremities, lower extremity weakness, decreased hand dexterity, hyperreflexia, clonus, Babinski sign, and bowel or bladder dysfunction in severe disease. Definitive diagnosis requires correlation of physical examination findings with imaging findings. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine with and without contrast media is the preferred imaging modality. Cervical spine computed tomography, computed tomography myelography, and plain radiography are helpful in certain situations. Treatment depends on the presence and severity of symptoms. Surgery is recommended for patients with moderate to severe symptoms or rapidly progressive disease. Conservative treatments with monitoring for progression may be considered in patients with mild to moderate disease. The evidence for the effectiveness of conservative treatments is scarce and of low quality, and outcomes can vary with individual patients. Primary care physicians play a vital role in recognizing the typical presentation of degenerative cervical myelopathy, coordinating treatment as indicated, and managing comorbidities.

### Postoperative resolution of magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity changes and the associated impact on outcomes in degenerative cervical myelopathy: analysis of a global cohort of patients [^112vJ8Qn]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design

Subanalysis of the prospective AOSpine CSM North America and International studies.

Objective

To describe the postoperative changes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spinal cord signal intensity in degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) patients and to investigate the impact of its postoperative resolution on clinical outcomes.

Summary Of Background Data

When examining the spinal cord, hyperintensity found in MRI T2-weighted images and hypointensity in T1-weighted images are known to correlate with preoperative severity of DCM and to predict postoperative neurological recovery. However, the clinical importance of these signal intensity changes in postoperative images has not been established.

Methods

Among 757 surgical DCM patients enrolled in two prospective multicenter studies, postoperative MRI images obtained between 6 and 24 months after the operation were examined with a focus on T2 hyper- and T1 hypointensity in the spinal cord. The 2-year postoperative Nurick grade, modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score and modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association recovery rate (RR) were analyzed between patients with or without resolution of signal intensity changes.

Results

A total of 167 patients with preoperative T2 hyperintensity were included with complete postoperative MRI images. Of these patients, 11% showed resolution of signal intensity changes, 70% retained T2 hyperintensity only, and 19% showed both T2 hyper- and T1 hypointensity postoperatively. There was a stepwise trend toward worse postoperative outcomes, with the no signal intensity change group showing the best outcome and the T1 hypointensity group showing the worst (mean RR: 72% vs. 51% vs. 36%, P = 0.02). Patients who exhibited resolution of T2 hyperintensity showed better outcomes than those who retained it (RR: 72% vs. 47%, P = 0.04), but the resolution of T1 hypointensity was not associated with improved outcomes (RR: 38% vs. 26%, P = 0.36).

Conclusion

Postoperative resolution of T2 hyperintensity in patients with DCM was associated with the best clinical outcomes, whereas those with T1 hypointensity showed the worst.

### Spinal cord demyelination predicts neurological deterioration in patients with mild degenerative cervical myelopathy [^113tUHyx]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

DCM pathobiology

There are many pathobiological consequences of prolonged and chronic compression of the cervical spinal cord. The chronic pathobiological consequences for patients with mild DCM remain unclear, particularly for patients who may face mild compression over many years and who are more likely to induce compensatory mechanisms within the cord. Recent studies have indicated that chronic intraparenchymal ischaemia may be the cause of neural degeneration within the spinal cord, inducing a unique immune response. Based on the feature importance of our ML model, which is most strongly affected by demyelination surrogates such as MTR and less strongly by axonal markers, we suggest that this immune response may impact cord myelination more than axon integrity within patients with mild DCM, although further investigation is required.

Another study has suggested that neuronal loss and demyelination can be explained through spinal cord tethering which increases intramedullary pressure. Interestingly, the same study found demyelination to begin in the ventral funiculus and progress to the lateral and dorsal funiculus. This contrasts with our finding suggesting a greater emphasis on the dorsal funiculus in patients with mild DCM followed by the ventral and lateral funiculus. It has been suggested that compensatory mechanisms, particularly supraspinal and 'corticospinal reserve capacity' may help to preserve neurological function while degeneration takes place. Similarly, our ML model shows low importance to many gross motor skills, such as tasks in the Berg Balance Scale, as they are likely to remain unchanged in patients with mild DCM. Our model did highlight the lower extremity motor component of the mJOA score as an important metric, even if only mild compromise to stability is seen. We speculate that if compromise to gross motor function such as walking stability is seen in the early stages of DCM progression and is not masked by compensatory mechanisms, spinal tract compromise by way of demyelination may already be occurring.

### Spine injury [^117YQtGE]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Incomplete spinal cord syndromes and central cord syndrome — clinical features and predisposition: Incomplete spinal cord syndromes refer to lesions involving certain structural and anatomic regions of the cord and are usually associated with variable preservation of motor and sensory function below the level of injury, with no involvement of the head and neck; these lesions are often encountered following traumatic injuries, but they also result from other etiologies, e.g., tumors, infections, or systemic diseases, and incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) manifests with a constellation of physical impairments and can be categorized by several descriptive syndromes. Central cord syndrome is the most common incomplete spinal cord injury, typically occurring after a fall with hyperextension injury to the cervical spine, and older adults with degenerative changes and spinal spondylosis are predisposed.

### Proposing a framework to understand the role of imaging in degenerative cervical myelopathy: enhancement of MRI protocols needed for accurate diagnosis and evaluation [^1179QFbb]. Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

ADVANCED NEUROIMAGING: FROM SPINAL STENOSIS TO MEASURES OF SPINAL CORD DISTRESS

To enhance the utility of cervical spine MRI, several advanced neuroimaging methods are in various stages of translation. Their entry into clinical practice may adjust the role of MRI in the diagnosis of DCM, for example, to rule in a diagnosis of DCM. These include phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PCMR) to measure craniocaudal motion of the spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid, microstructural and functional imaging of the spinal cord, and spinal cord perfusion imaging.PCMR in DCM has repeatedly demonstrated that spinal cord motion was increased at the level of stenosis and adjacent to the level of stenosis.–This approach also demonstrated cerebrospinal fluid flow was increased at the level of stenosis. Interestingly, the authors have demonstrated a correlation between deranged cerebrospinal fluid flow and radiological evidence for myelopathy, and normalization of flow following decompressive surgery. Therefore, PCMR holds the potential to detect correlates of effective decompression. Microstructural imaging provides the unique opportunity to quantify spinal cord tissue properties. Diffusion tensor imaging allows for the assessment of axonal and myelin integrity. Among the best studied diffusion tensor imaging metrics, apparent diffusion coefficient, a rate of water motion without reference to the direction, and fractional anisotropy, a measure for water to diffuse in one direction, are best investigated in DCM. It was consistently demonstrated that an increased apparent diffusion coefficient and reduced fractional anisotropy had higher sensitivity and specificity to identify patients with DCM than T2-weighted hyperintensity. Moreover, quantitative MRI allowed for detection of subclinical tissue injury in patients with asymptomatic spinal canal stenosis before the onset of symptoms, and it was shown to be sensitive for myelopathic progression. In addition, it has been demonstrated that tract-specific neurodegeneration can be found remote to the level of compression,–indicating that the mechanisms behind the clinical evolution of DCM are not restricted to focal cervical cord pathology, but involve complex degeneration across the spinal axis. Functional MRI and perfusion imaging are still nascent in the field of DCM but hold potential to increase our understanding of impaired spinal neuronal networks in DCM, respectively, to elucidate the role of chronic hypoperfusion for the clinical evolution of DCM.

### The role of neuronal plasticity in cervical spondylotic myelopathy surgery: functional assessment and prognostic implication [^114MXumf]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a degenerative disease representing the most common spinal cord disorder in the adult population. It is characterized by chronic compression leading to neurological dysfunction due to static and dynamic injury of the spinal cord in cervical spine. These insidious damage mechanisms can result in the reorganization of cortical and subcortical areas. The cerebral cortex can reorganize due to spinal cord injury and may play a role in preserving neurological function. To date, the gold standard treatment of cervical myelopathy is surgery, comprising anterior, posterior, and combined approaches. However, the complex physiologic recovery processes involving cortical and subcortical neural reorganization following surgery are still inadequately understood. It has been demonstrated that diffusion MRI and functional imaging and techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), can provide new insights into the diagnosis and prognosis of CSM. This review aims to shed light on the state-of-the-art regarding the pattern of cortical and subcortical areas reorganization and recovery before and after surgery in CSM patients, underlighting the critical role of neuroplasticity.

### Is neck pain a marker for something serious? Like myelopathy [^115PK1DH]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy (DCM) is a chronic progressive condition of the cervical spine that leads to compression of the spinal cord. It is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults, and it occurs due to age-related changes or genetically associated pathologies. DCM is a clinical and radiological diagnosis and presents with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from neck pain and stiffness to paralysis. While neck pain is prevalent amongst patients attending specialist clinics, its predictive value for DCM is limited. This paper focuses on elucidating the relationship between DCM and chronic neck pain, and we discuss the underlying aetiology and broader neurological implications in the context of the literature. The progression of DCM can be slow and insidious with symptoms worsening gradually over time. Neck pain should not be discounted in the evaluation of DCM.

### Molecular signatures of cervical spinal cord pathology in degenerative compression [^116j5VbS]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Degenerative changes in the spine develop with aging and frequently give rise to degenerative compression of the cervical spinal cord (CSC). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revealed signs of CSC compression in 50% of randomly examined persons > 60 years of age. Prolonged compression often leads to clinically manifest degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). However, in some patients, signs and symptoms of clinical myelopathy remain unexpressed, constituting a highly prevalent condition known as non-myelopathic degenerative compression (NMDC), characterized by a variety of subclinical dysfunctional or microstructural impairments detectable by electrophysiologicalor advanced MRI methods. Unlike conventional MRI, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) quantifies neurometabolite levels and tracks changes in the cellular and biochemical composition of CSC tissue. Thus, H-MRS can provide markers specific to pathophysiological processes, such as gliosis, axonal/neuronal loss, and demyelination, resulting from mechanical compression.

Although only a few MRS studies have reported remote metabolic changes in the primary sensorimotor cortex arising out of CSC compression through Wallerian/Wallerian-like degeneration, others have confirmed metabolic changes in the cranial CSC above the lesion level. Increased levels of total creatine (tCr)/total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), and total choline (tCho)/tNAA, in DCM have also been reported. Higher spinal myo-inositol (myo-Ins)/tNAA and tCho/myo-Ins have been demonstrated in chronic CSC injury in diplegia and quadriplegia. Studies to date have not included more than 35 participants, and often encountered technical challenges that compromised spectral quality. Metabolite changes have yet to be shown in the non-myelopathic stage.

### In vivo evidence of remote neural degeneration in the lumbar enlargement after cervical injury [^115VvaJp]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 5
Secondary degenerative processes occurring remotely, above and below the primary injury site

Sensory and motor tracts affected by the injury undergo anterograde or retrograde (depending on the direction) axonal degeneration and accompanying demyelination. In the lumbar cord, the lower motor neurons located in the ventral horn may undergo transsynaptic degeneration due to the loss of input from the injured corticospinal tracts. Similarly, second-order sensory neurons of the spinothalamic and dorsal column medial lemniscus systems can also be affected by transsynaptic degeneration. MEP = motor evoked potential; SEP = sensory evoked potential.

In the GM of the lumbar enlargement, we found decreased AD, which led to reduction in MD and FA. In the acute and subacute phases, animal SCI models have demonstrated morphologic changes in the GM including decreased number but increased length of the remaining dendrites and enlarged soma size. In humans, however, remote structural changes in the cords' GM after SCI are understudied. The atrophy of ventral horns presumably reflects transsynaptic degeneration of flexor motor neuron pool due to deprivation from supraspinal input (figure 5). In contrast, the extensor motor neuron pool in the lumbar cord continues to receive proprioceptive input to become activated. It has been reported that the extensor neurons are likely to survive after the injury compared to flexor neurons. Similarly, dorsal horn neurons, interneurons, and propriospinal networksare also prone to undergo a partially transsynaptic degeneration (figure 5). Other mechanisms including vascular remodeling and changes in the amount of glial cellscould also play a role in GM pathology; however, their degree of contribution is not clear.

Relation of tissue bridges to cord pathology

Following the initial injury, a post-traumatic cyst develops in the majority of patients within the first month. It has been shown that the magnitude of such neuronal tissue loss (i.e. lesion severity) is associated with reduced cross-sectional GM and WM area above the level of lesion. In this study, we show relationships between lesion severity (i.e. preserved midsaggital tissue bridges) and remote cord pathology below the level of injury. We found associations between the width of the midsagittal tissue bridges and the magnitude of ventral horn atrophy as well as microstructural alterations within the lumbar enlargement. Thus, the relation between the severity of lesion and below-level neurodegeneration indicates that the initial damage to the cervical cord primarily drives (initiates) remote neurodegenerative processes.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common cause of spinal cord disorder in individuals aged older than 50 years leading to significant neurological impairment and reduced quality of life. The complex pathogenesis of DCM, driven by chronic spinal cord compression from multifactorial causes such as disk herniation and osteophyte formation, results in a highly variable clinical presentation. Parameters such as spinal cord shape, morphometrics, and hyperintensity are recognized as key biological markers because they show association with clinical symptoms of DCM.

Despite growing recognition of spinal cord morphometrics such as cross-sectional area (CSA), shape alterations, and microstructural integrity as valuable biomarkers, - the widespread adoption of these measures in clinical practice has been limited. Manual segmentation of spinal cord MRI is labor-intensive, prone to variability, and particularly challenging in regions of compression, creating barriers to clinical translation. To address these challenges, we designed an analysis pipeline based on the Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT), to streamline the extraction of key morphometric data from spinal cords of patients with DCM. This pipeline is a game-changing solution that can provide clinicians with standardized, quantitative metrics that are easy to interpret and clinically actionable, even in complex compression regions of the spinal cord. We incorporate a Batch-processing command that enables reliable and rapid extraction of spinal cord morphometrics across multiple subjects. Evidence from Muhammad et al has demonstrated the efficacy of this automated pipeline in extracting morphometric data from compressed spinal cords in 36 DCM patients, whereas Haynes et al further validated its performance in generating clinically relevant white matter (WM) injury metrics to elucidate the severity of DCM.

Our study leverages this pipeline to demonstrate how morphometric analysis can enhance clinical decision making in DCM, facilitating early diagnosis, improved monitoring, and prognosis of DCM.

### Myelopathy and spinal deformity: relevance of spinal alignment in planning surgical intervention for degenerative cervical myelopathy [^116SUwEJ]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Surgical management of degenerative cervical myelopathy requires careful pathoanatomic consideration to select between various surgical options from both anterior and posterior approach. Hitherto, unexplored is the relevance of cervical deformity to the pathophysiology of such neurological disability, and whether correction of that deformity should be a surgical objective when planning for reconstruction after spinal cord decompression. Such correction could address both the static cord compression and the dynamic repetitive cord injury, while also restoring more normal biomechanics to the cervical spine. The articles in this focus issue's section on cervical spinal deformity reveal that cervical sagittal alignment is geometrically related to thoracolumbar spinal pelvic alignment and to T1 slope, and that it is further clinically correlated to regional disability and general health scores and to myelopathy severity. These conclusions are based on narrative reviews and a selection of primary research data, reflecting the nascency of this field. They further recommend for preoperative assessment of spinal alignment when significant deformity is suspected, and that correction of cervical kyphosis should be an objective when surgery is planned.

### Association of preoperative cervical spine alignment with spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging hyperintensity and myelopathy severity: analysis of a series of 124 cases [^113k343d]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

This is an ambispective analysis of a prospectively followed cohort of patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of sagittal alignment on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in the cervical spinal cord as well as myelopathy severity in a prospective series of surgical patients.

Summary Of Background Data

There is emerging evidence that sagittal alignment of the cervical spine in patients with CSM may be associated with disease severity. The impact on actual spinal cord pathology is unclear, with suspected mechanisms including focal static ventral compression, repeated dynamic injury, and increased cord intramedullary tension. The relationship between sagittal imbalance and disease severity remains undefined.

Methods

An ambispective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed of surgical patients with CSM at a single tertiary-care neurosurgical center. Demographic data and measures of neurological disability were collected and analyzed for dependency on cervical spine alignment parameters including qualitative (kyphotic vs. lordotic) and quantitative (sagittal Cobb angle (C2-C7) and sagittal vertical axis (SVA, C2-C7)). MRI cord signal hyperintensity at the most pathological level was also evaluated for dependency on the same alignment metrics. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used at the 0.05 level of significance with correction for multiple comparisons.

Results

Among 124 patients with CSM, kyphotic alignment was seen in 34% of patients and hyperintense T2 MRI signal was observed in 55% of patients. No difference in MRI signal or myelopathy severity was observed in univariate analysis on global alignment. Among patients with kyphosis, quantitative MRI parameters and myelopathy severity were both correlated with increasing SVA, an observation not seen among patients with lordosis.

Conclusion

Global sagittal alignment and SVA interactively associate with quantitative MRI spinal cord signal abnormalities and worse CSM-related disability. The reciprocal relationships of SVA effect in patients with kyphosis and those with lordosis may reflect an optimal spinal alignment to achieve during surgical management.

### Spinal cord demyelination predicts neurological deterioration in patients with mild degenerative cervical myelopathy [^114426pu]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common form of atraumatic spinal cord injury globally. Clinical guidelines regarding surgery for patients with mild DCM and minimal symptoms remain uncertain. This study aims to identify imaging and clinical predictors of neurological deterioration in mild DCM and explore pathophysiological correlates to guide clinical decision-making.

Methods

Patients with mild DCM underwent advanced MRI scans that included T2-weighted, diffusion tensor imaging and magnetisation transfer (MT) sequences, along with clinical outcome measures at baseline and 6-month intervals after enrolment. Quantitative MRI (qMRI) metrics were derived above and below maximally compressed cervical levels (MCCLs). Various machine learning (ML) models were trained to predict 6 month neurological deterioration, followed by global and local model interpretation to assess feature importance.

Results

A total of 49 patients were followed for a maximum of 2 years, contributing 110 6-month data entries. Neurological deterioration occurred in 38% of cases. The best-performing ML model, combining clinical and qMRI metrics, achieved a balanced accuracy of 83%, and an area under curve-receiver operating characteristic of 0.87. Key predictors included MT ratio (demyelination) above the MCCL in the dorsal and ventral funiculi and moderate tingling in the arm, shoulder or hand. qMRI metrics significantly improved predictive performance compared to models using only clinical (bal. acc = 68.1%) or imaging data (bal. acc = 57.4%).

Conclusions

Reduced myelin content in the dorsal and ventral funiculi above the site of compression, combined with sensory deficits in the hands and gait/balance disturbances, predicts 6-month neurological deterioration in mild DCM and may warrant early surgical intervention.

### Semiautomated pipeline effectively assesses severity and monitor disease progression in compressed spinal cord of degenerative cervical myelopathy patients [^116CXGhV]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive and disabling condition resulting from chronic compression of the spinal cord, leading to functional impairments that can severely affect quality of life. Traditional methods for assessing spinal cord injury and morphometrics rely on subjective visualization of contrast changes and manual segmentation, which are nonstandardized, time-consuming, and inconsistent across patients. This variability limits understanding of DCM pathology and hampers timely clinical intervention.

METHODS:

We introduce a semiautomated pipeline using the Spinal Cord Toolbox, an open-source platform that uses advanced algorithms, including optimization and computational efficiency algorithms, support vector machine, and convolutional neural networks, to streamline the assessment of spinal cord shape, microstructural changes, and gray and white matter integrity. By integrating spinal cord segmentation, anatomical labeling, and registration to a standardized template, the pipeline extracts normalized morphometric measures, providing efficient and reliable analysis of spinal cord pathology in DCM.

RESULTS:

We extracted normalized spinal cord morphometrics, including cross-sectional area (CSA), anterior-posterior diameter, right-left diameter, eccentricity, solidity, gray matter CSA, white matter CSA, and regional and tract-based magnetization transfer ratio measures. Our analysis demonstrates that DCM patients exhibit significant reductions in these morphometrics compared with healthy controls, even in regions without visible compression. Furthermore, CSA reductions across the spinal cord highlight areas of severe compression, including at the intervertebral disks, which may not be apparent on standard imaging.

CONCLUSION:

These quantitative measures give clinicians easily interpretable data on the extent of spinal cord injury, even in regions without obvious compression. This enables a comprehensive understanding of DCM pathophysiology. By eliminating the subjectivity of manual segmentation and accounting for intersubject and intrasubject variability, this approach supports consistent cross-subject comparisons and is poised to reshape how clinicians assess and manage DCM.

How is it diagnosed?

Detecting early DCM can be challenging. A high index of suspicion, alongside a comprehensive neurological examination is advised. Box 2 outlines common symptoms and examination findings in DCM.

Box 2
Commonly reported symptoms and examination findings in DCM

Clinical

Pain is a common reason to seek treatment. Musculoskeletal pain might be present in the neck, while neuropathic pain can affect upper and lower limbs and occasionally the trunk. Patients often report neck stiffness, at times without pain. A textbook case would describe gait dysfunction and bilateral hand impairment. Frequently not all symptoms are present. For example, pain might be absent and symptoms can be unilateral and vary in severity, even on a daily basis. Atypical symptoms such as headaches and muscle cramps are also reported.

The more consistent feature of DCM is the evolution of symptoms. Most patients describe symptoms that have been ongoing for months and getting worse. The rate of progression varies; in some individuals symptoms remain mild over extended periods of time, while in others disease progression accelerates. Functional decline can be insidious, and patients might mistakenly attribute these symptoms to "getting older". Typical features include loss of dexterity (difficulty doing up buttons, using keys, mobile phones, or writing) or mobility (use of walking aids or frequent falls).

Symptoms might precede objective examination findings. As in focal central nervous system disorders, examination features in DCM have a low sensitivity — that is, a normal finding does not exclude the disease — but high specificity — that is, an abnormal finding is highly suggestive of the disease. Features can be mild and difficult to elicit in the initial stages of disease.

Investigations

Request an MRI scan of the cervical spine to detect cord compression (fig 1) in suspected DCM. An urgent MRI is required for patients with progressive disease and/or symptoms that substantially affect quality of life. In patients with mild symptoms, a non-urgent MRI might be requested. Bear in mind that the extent of spinal cord compression and signal changes in the cord on the MRI scan do not correlate well with the severity of symptoms. Even mild compression can account for severe disease.

The pathway to diagnosis varies depending on local services. In the UK, for example, many primary care physicians do not have direct access to MRI imaging and referral to neurology might be warranted.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy: epidemiology, genetics, and pathogenesis [^117WYK59]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Review.

Objective

To formally introduce "degenerative cervical myelopathy" (DCM) as the overarching term to describe the various degenerative conditions of the cervical spine that cause myelopathy. Herein, the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and genetics of conditions falling under this hypernym are carefully described.

Summary Of Background Data

Nontraumatic, degenerative forms of cervical myelopathy represent the commonest cause of spinal cord impairment in adults and include cervical spondylotic myelopathy, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, ossification of the ligamentum flavum, and degenerative disc disease. Unfortunately, there is neither a specific term nor a specific diagnostic International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code to describe this collection of clinical entities. This has resulted in the inconsistent use of diagnostic terms when referring to patients with myelopathy due to degenerative disease of the cervical spine.

Methods

Narrative review.

Results

The incidence and prevalence of myelopathy due to degeneration of the spine are estimated at a minimum of 41 and 605 per million in North America, respectively. Incidence of cervical spondylotic myelopathy-related hospitalizations has been estimated at 4.04/100,000 person-years, and surgical rates seem to be rising. Pathophysiologically, myelopathy results from static compression, spinal malalignment leading to altered cord tension and vascular supply, and dynamic injury mechanisms. Occupational hazards, including transportation of goods by weight bearing on top of the head, and other risk factors may accelerate DCM development. Potential genetic factors include those related to MMP-2 and collagen IX for degenerative disc disease, and collagen VI and XI for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. In addition, congenital anomalies including spinal stenosis, Down syndrome, and Klippel-Feil syndrome may predispose to the development of DCM.

Conclusion

Although DCMs can present as separate diagnostic entities, they are highly interrelated, frequently manifest concomitantly, present similarly from a clinical standpoint, and seem to be in part a response to compensate and improve stability due to progressive age and wear of the cervical spine. The use of the term "degenerative cervical myelopathy" is advocated.

### Does age affect surgical outcomes in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy? Results from the prospective multicenter AOSpine international study on 479 patients [^112FqACS]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Subjects

Between October 2007 and January 2011, 479 patients with symptomatic DCM were prospectively enrolled in the AOSpine CSM-International study at 16 global institutions. Participating sites were either academic centres or high volume private practices and all had the resources necessary to conduct prospective clinical research, adequate subject availability and experienced research personnel. Investigators were orthopaedic surgeons or neurosurgeons who specialised in treating disorders of the spine.

Patients were asked to participate in this study if they were referred for surgical consultation and if they satisfied the following inclusion criteria: (1) aged 18 years or older; (2) presenting with symptomatic DCM with at least one clinical sign of myelopathy; (3) image-evidence of cervical spinal cord compression on MRI or CT; and (4) no previous cervical spine surgery. Patients were included in this study if they had myelopathy due to spondylosis, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, OPLL, disc herniation, subluxation or a combination of these degenerative changes. Patients were excluded if they were asymptomatic or diagnosed with active infection, neoplastic disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or concomitant lumbar stenosis.

Surgical techniques

At their respective sites, all patients underwent surgical decompression of the cervical spinal cord. For each case, the attending surgeon decided what approach to use, the number of levels to decompress and whether or not to use fusion or instrumentation. Anterior surgeries included cervical discectomy and/or corpectomy with or without fusion. Patients treated posteriorly underwent either laminectomy with or without fusion or laminoplasty. A minority of patients was treated with a two-stage circumferential surgery.

Data collection

Extensive data were collected for each participating subject, including demographic information, disease causation, medical history and current comorbidities, symptomatology, surgical summary and level of impairment and disability. Each subject was neurologically examined at baseline and 24 months postoperatively and evaluated using a variety of functional and quality of life outcome measures, including the Neck Disability Index (NDI), SF-36, the Nurick and the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scales. In addition, each attending surgeon was required to record all adverse events throughout the study period. A central panel of investigators classified each event as related to surgery, related to myelopathy or unrelated. Perioperative complications were defined as surgery-related events occurring within 30 days of surgery.

Magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR)

It provides a quantitative measure of WM integrity, providing clinicians critical information about the severity of DCM, and helping to inform prognosis of DCM.MTR has also become a valuable clinical technique for assessing WM integrity in multiple sclerosis. Gray Matter Cross-Sectional Area (CSA): T2✱-based gray matter mapping provides insights into damage to motor and sensory pathways by assessing the morphological changes in the GM horns (Cloney et al). GM atrophy above the stenotic region has been associated with clinical dysfunctions in DCM. Furthermore, changes in WM-GM signal intensity ratio derived from T2✱ imaging have been shown to be a better biomarker for spinal cord WM injury.

Furthermore, MTR measures offer increased sensitivity in detecting microstructural damage beyond the visible site of spinal cord compression (accompany paper, currently under review). This provides a more comprehensive view of the extent of spinal cord injury particularly important for understanding the full impact of DCM that may help optimize patient treatment.

Correlation of Spinal Cord Measures With Clinical Symptoms

We have demonstrated a strong association of these measures with clinical severity of DCM such as CSA significantly associated with dexterity dysfunctions scoresand MTR (tract and region-based measures) associated with DCM severity (modified Japanese Orthopedic Association).

### Proposing a framework to understand the role of imaging in degenerative cervical myelopathy: enhancement of MRI protocols needed for accurate diagnosis and evaluation [^112H5FTc]. Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

APPLICATION OF NEUROIMAGING FRAMEWORK IN DCM

In DCM, cervical spine imaging, and in particular MRI, is essential for the diagnosis and is not optional, as spinal canal narrowing is a prerequisite for spinal cord compression. However, given the high prevalence of patients with asymptomatic spinal canal stenosis, the strong interrelation of degenerative features, and the challenges of correlating clinical and radiological findings, we advocate that spinal canal narrowing alone does not suffice to make the diagnosis of DCM. An accurate diagnostic approach will thus need to define the other characteristics, such as signs and symptoms, that permit a final diagnosis when cervical canal narrowing is present on MRI. In addition, differential diagnoses, for example, multiple sclerosis and tumor, should be ruled out with MRI (Figure 1 E).

### In vivo evidence of remote neural degeneration in the lumbar enlargement after cervical injury [^112o3b5Q]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Besides the primary damage to the lesion site, traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers a cascade of pathologic processes remote from injury. These are reflected by neuronal dysfunction, such as premature exhaustion of motor neurons and impaired sensorimotor function below the level of the lesion. Moreover, remote dynamic neurodegenerative and reorganizational processes of the neural circuits are believed to play a critical role in the patients' long-term recoveryand might determine the success of future regenerative therapies.

To better understand the interaction between degenerative processes at and caudal to a cervical lesion and their relation to electrophysiologic and clinical measures of the lower extremity, 3 questions were investigated: (1) Are the degenerative processes in the lumbar enlargement similar to those demonstrated within the high cervical cord above the injury?(2) Is there a relationship between lesion severity and the magnitude of neurodegeneration in the lumbar enlargement? (3) Is there a relationship between structural changes at and below the level of injury and electrophysiologic and clinical measures?

We applied high-resolution multimodal MRI to the lumbar enlargement, and quantified electrophysiologic and clinical measures of lower limb to investigate tissue-specific cord pathology in chronic cervical SCI patients. We hypothesized that (1) remote tissue-specific neurodegeneration (reflected by macrostructural and microstructural MRI changes) occurs in the lumbar enlargement, (2) preserved midsagittal tissue bridges at the lesion site are related to the magnitude of tissue-specific cord pathology in the lumbar enlargement, and (3) preserved midsagittal tissue bridges and remote tissue-specific neurodegeneration correlate with electrophysiologic and clinical measures of lower limb function.

Imaging predictors in cervical spondylotic myelopathy — there appears to be a consensus that the presence of a low signal on preoperative T1-weighted images, multisegment and focal high signal on T2-weighted images, and the presence of cord atrophy on MR images are indicators of a poor outcome, and these changes occur late in the evolution of CSM with a continuing challenge to find indicators with prognostic power in mild myelopathy or cervical stenosis with minimal clinical symptoms.

### Management of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy and asymptomatic spinal cord compression: an international survey [^115LLUap]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Study design

Cross-sectional survey.

Objective

Currently there is limited evidence and guidance on the management of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) and asymptomatic spinal cord compression (ASCC).

Anecdotal evidence suggest variance in clinical practice. The objectives of this study were to assess current practice and to quantify the variability in clinical practice.

Methods

Spinal surgeons and some additional health professionals completed a web-based survey distributed by email to members of AO Spine and the Cervical Spine Research Society (CSRS) North American Society. Questions captured experience with DCM, frequency of DCM patient encounters, and standard of practice in the assessment of DCM. Further questions assessed the definition and management of mild DCM, and the management of ASCC.

Results

A total of 699 respondents, mostly surgeons, completed the survey. Every world region was represented in the responses. Half (50.1%, n = 359) had greater than 10 years of professional experience with DCM. For mild DCM, standardised follow-up for non-operative patients was reported by 488 respondents (69.5%). Follow-up included a heterogeneous mix of investigations, most often at 6-month intervals (32.9%, n = 158). There was some inconsistency regarding which clinical features would cause a surgeon to counsel a patient towards surgery. Practice for ASCC aligned closely with mild DCM. Finally, there were some contradictory definitions of mild DCM provided in the form of free text.

Conclusions

Professionals typically offer outpatient follow up for patients with mild DCM and/or asymptomatic ASCC. However, what this constitutes varies widely. Further research is needed to define best practice and support patient care.

### Is neck pain a marker for something serious? Like myelopathy [^115iupAG]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Structural changes

The degenerative changes seen in DCM, overlap with osteoarthritis and changes in the intervertebral discs (IVD), uncovertebral, and facet joints. Capsular ligaments in the cervical spine, which are integral to spinal stability, can become lax over time due to repetitive stress, potentially causing cervical instability. Demonstrated evidence of capsular laxity in the context of DCM is lacking in the literature. It is yet to be determined whether it is stiffness of the cervical spine joints with increasing age or the laxity of the cervical spine ligaments that contribute to people becoming myelopathic (Supplementary 2C). The pathogenesis of myelopathy in patients with DCM can be attributed to three main components:
Static factors: processes that lead to cervical canal stenosis and consequent cord compression. Acquired spondylosis of the disc, facet vertebral bodies, and ligaments and subsequent loss of lordotic curvature. Congenital cervical stenosis (< 13 mm in diameter is considered stenotic). Ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament. Ossification of the ligamentum flavum.
Dynamic factors: resulting in cervical cord injury, can be multifactorial. Movements of a severely compressed cord are restricted. Flexion of the spine results in overstretching of the cord. This effect is more severe in the setting of a prominent ventral osteophyte complex and kyphotic deformity. Extension causes posterior cord compression by buckling of the ligamentum flavum and shingling of the laminae.
Ischemia: Spondylotic cord compression causes the pathologic butterfly pattern of cord ischemia which affects the grey and medial white matter. This pattern is also consistent with a vascular hypoperfusion injury. Compression affects the flow in the small pial and intermedullary arterioles, as well as the larger anterior spinal artery. Venous congestion may also play a role, with the potential for venous infarction to occur. Collectively these processes can result in cavitation within the spinal cord, known as syrinx formation.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy: a spectrum of related disorders affecting the aging spine [^111hyT1W]. Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Cervical spinal cord dysfunction can result from either traumatic or nontraumatic causes, including tumors, infections, and degenerative changes. In this article, we review the range of degenerative spinal disorders resulting in progressive cervical spinal cord compression and propose the adoption of a new term, degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). DCM comprises both osteoarthritic changes to the spine, including spondylosis, disk herniation, and facet arthropathy (collectively referred to as cervical spondylotic myelopathy), and ligamentous aberrations such as ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. This review summarizes current knowledge of the pathophysiology of DCM and describes the cascade of events that occur after compression of the spinal cord, including ischemia, destruction of the blood-spinal cord barrier, demyelination, and neuronal apoptosis. Important features of the diagnosis of DCM are discussed in detail, and relevant clinical and imaging findings are highlighted. Furthermore, this review outlines valuable assessment tools for evaluating functional status and quality of life in these patients and summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each. Other topics of this review include epidemiology, the prevalence of degenerative changes in the asymptomatic population, the natural history and rates of progression, risk factors of diagnosis (clinical, imaging and genetic), and management strategies.

### Increasing awareness of degenerative cervical myelopathy: a preventative cause of non-traumatic spinal cord injury [^115fM3h5]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a common non-traumatic spinal cord disorder and characterized by progressive neurological impairment. Generally, it is still underdiagnosed and referral to spine specialists is often late, when patients already present with incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). To improve early diagnosis and accelerate referral, diagnostic criteria for DCM are required. Recently, AO Spine RECODE- DCM (REsearch Objectives and Common Data Elements for Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy) (aospine.org/recode), an international, interdisciplinary and interprofessional initiative, including patients with DCM, was funded with the aim to accelerate knowledge discovery that can change outcomes. In this perspective we advocate for the participation of SCI specialists in this process, where the expertise and perspective on this disorder and requirements for the diagnostic and therapeutic work up is well developed.

### Is neck pain a marker for something serious? Like myelopathy [^113CoFVj]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

The severity of DCM can vary depending on the extent of the damage to the spinal cord and the location of compression. Some individuals may experience only mild symptoms that do not significantly impact their daily lives, while others may experience significant disability and may require surgery. Not all of the clinical manifestations present as pain. Whilst the etiological factors for non-specific neck pain are poorly understood, neck pain correlates with spinal degeneration such as cervical spondylosis, however, in the context of DCM, neck pain is a confounder.

### Traumatic and nontraumatic spinal cord injury: pathological insights from neuroimaging [^117FWjxt]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Pathophysiological changes in the spinal cord white and grey matter resulting from injury can be observed with MRI techniques. These techniques provide sensitive markers of macrostructural and microstructural tissue integrity, which correlate with histological findings. Spinal cord MRI findings in traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) and nontraumatic spinal cord injury - the most common form of which is degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) - have provided important insights into the pathophysiological processes taking place not just at the focal injury site but also rostral and caudal to the spinal injury. Although tSCI and DCM have different aetiologies, they show similar degrees of spinal cord pathology remote from the injury site, suggesting the involvement of similar secondary degenerative mechanisms. Advanced quantitative MRI protocols that are sensitive to spinal cord pathology have the potential to improve diagnosis and, more importantly, predict outcomes in patients with tSCI or nontraumatic spinal cord injury. This Review describes the insights into tSCI and DCM that have been revealed by neuroimaging and outlines current activities and future directions for the field.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy — prognostic testing and imaging indicate there is Class II evidence that somatosensory evoked potentials have prognostic value in patients with CSM; there is Class I evidence to show that electromyographic abnormalities (as well as the presence of radiculopathy) are predictive of the development of myelopathy in minimally symptomatic patients with cervical stenosis and spinal cord compression; and the presence of a low signal on T1-weighted images, high signal on T2-weighted images, and cord atrophy on preoperative MR images are indicators of a poor outcome in CSM.

### The role of comprehensive rehabilitation in the care of degenerative cervical myelopathy [^112wRSJE]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

Persons admitted consecutively to the spinal department of a rehabilitation medical center, between 2011 and 2020, were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Inclusion criteria were non-traumatic complete or incomplete tetraplegia, mild to severe disability, and degenerative changes of the cervical spine. Included were only individuals with spinal surgery for degenerative cervical spine changes conducted before admission because the majority of the individuals with DCM admitted to the spinal department during the study period were referred after a spinal operation. Exclusion criteria were additional medical conditions assessed as influencing the neurological status or the performance, such as additional spinal lesions, brain or limb injury, acute illness, or missing relevant data.

The collected and calculated data

The authors retrospectively collected patient demographic and clinical data and SCL characteristics from the hospital records of the patients. The collected data of the American Spinal Injury Association motor score (AMS, score range 0–100), and the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) third version (SCIM-III, score range 0–100), represented the persons' neurological motor status and performance, respectively (Table 1). The collected AMS and SCIM III data were from the first week after admission to inpatient rehabilitation and the week before discharge.

Data analysis

Analyses distinguished the effect of rehabilitation from that of spinal surgery on patient performance. We used SCIM III and AMS scores to calculate separate variables for the assessment of the contribution of rehabilitation and neurological change to the change in performance (dSCIM-IIIr and dSCIM-IIIn), and the values of the Spinal Cord Injury Ability Realization Measurement Index (SCI-ARMI) (Table 1).

We used paired two-tailed t-tests to compare admission and discharge outcomes, and dSCIM-IIIr and dSCIM-IIIn. We used Spearman's correlation test to assess the relationship between the gain in performance during rehabilitation and the time from spinal surgery to rehabilitation. We compared the persons included in the study with those excluded from it using independent sample two-tailed t-tests for continuous variables, and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical ones. All the statistical tests were chosen after examination of the distribution, variability, or the ordinality of the variables' data. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 27.0, Chicago, IL, USA).

### Advances in MR imaging for cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^117AcMTy]. European Spine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To outline the pathogenesis of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), the correlative abnormalities observed on standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the biological implications and current status of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and MR spectroscopy (MRS) as clinical tools, and future directions of MR technology in the management of CSM patients.

Methods

A systematic review of the pathogenesis and current state-of-the-art in MR imaging technology for CSM was performed.

Results

CSM is caused by progressive, degenerative, vertebral column abnormalities that result in spinal cord damage related to both primary mechanical and secondary biological injuries. The T2 signal change on conventional MRI is most commonly associated with neurological deficits, but tends not to be a sensitive predictor of recovery of function. DTI and MRS show altered microstructure and biochemistry that reflect patient-specific pathogenesis.

Conclusion

Advanced imaging techniques, including DTI and MRS, show higher sensitivity to microstructural and biochemical changes within the cord, and may aid in management of CSM patients.

### Symptom-specific analysis of surgical outcomes and predictors of residual symptoms in patients with mild degenerative cervical myelopathy: an analysis of cases with severe cord compression or progressive symptoms [^111HZ4vg]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective multicenter study.

Objectives

To analyze symptom-specific surgical outcomes in patients with mild degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) and identify predictors of postoperative residual symptoms.

Summary Of Background Data

DCM is the most common cause of spinal cord impairment in adults. While surgical intervention is recommended for moderate to severe DCM, optimal treatment strategies for mild DCM remain unclear. Previous studies have focused on total Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA)/modified JOA (mJOA) score without detailed symptom-specific analyses.

Methods

We reviewed 679 consecutive patients who underwent surgical decompression with or without fusion for DCM across three institutions in Japan. Among them, 104 patients with mild DCM (JOA score 14.5–16.5) were included. We assessed demographic data, radiographic factors, magnetic resonance imaging parameters, and clinical scores. Symptom-specific analyses were conducted using preoperative and 2-year postoperative JOA scores, and the predictors of persistent symptoms were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

The mean maximum canal compromise was 49.7%, and maximum spinal cord compression was 37.2%. The most common factors leading to surgery was symptom deterioration (94.2%). In symptom-specific analysis, 60.9% of patients exhibited persistent upper extremity sensory impairment, significantly higher than other domains. Multivariable analysis identified angular-edged deformity of the spinal cord on axial MRI as an independent predictor of persistent upper extremity sensory impairment (Odds Ratio: 4.264, 95% confidence interval: 1.312–13.854, P = 0.016).

Conclusion

The majority of mild DCM patients who underwent surgery had severe spinal cord compression, with symptom progression serving as the trigger for surgical intervention. While surgical intervention improves overall function, upper extremity sensory impairments frequently persisted postoperatively, even in mild cases. Angular-edged deformity was a significant predictor for postoperative upper extremity sensory deficits, emphasizing the need for careful preoperative evaluation of spinal cord morphology to better inform prognosis and guide treatment decisions in patients with mild DCM.

### Application of the T1w / T2w mapping technique for spinal cord assessment in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy [^117XK3VV]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective case-control study.

Objectives

To investigate signal changes on T1w/T2w signal intensity ratio maps within cervical cord in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).

Setting

Novosibirsk Neurosurgery Center, Russia.

Methods

A total of 261 patients with DCM and 42 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were evaluated using the T1w/T2w mapping method and spinal cord automatic morphometry. The T1w/T2w signal intensity ratio, which reflects white matter integrity, and the spinal cord cross-sectional area (CSA) were calculated and compared between the patients and the controls. In patients with DCM, the correlations between these parameters and neurological scores were also evaluated.

Results

The regional T1w/T2w ratio values from the cervical spinal cord at the level of maximal compression in patients with DCM were significantly lower than those in healthy controls (p < 0.001), as were the regional CSA values (p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the regional values of the T1w/T2w ratio and the values of the CSA at the level of maximal spinal cord compression.

Conclusions

T1w/T2w mapping revealed that spinal cord tissue damage exists at the level of maximal compression in patients with DCM in association with spinal cord atrophy according to automatic morphometry. These changes were correlated with each other.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^116F8ccs]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Why does this matter?

Spinal cord compression results in progressive neurological decline and affects quality of life. Left untreated, it can lead to tetraplegia and wheelchair dependence (data on how many patients with DCM progress in this way are unavailable). Surgical decompression can halt the disease progression, however, the regenerative capacity of the spinal cord is limited and any damage is often permanent. Delayed treatment leads to poorer outcomes and lifelong disability. Findings from the AOSpine series (746 patients with DCM) indicate that treatment within six months of symptoms offers the best chance of recovery, but this time frame is some way from current average diagnosis times.

### Semiautomated pipeline effectively assesses severity and monitor disease progression in compressed spinal cord of degenerative cervical myelopathy patients [^115Taq11]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The SCT pipeline successfully segmented the spinal cord and extraction of several key morphometric and microstructural metrics that are directly relevant to clinical practice were obtained.

Shape Morphometrics from T2-Weighted Image

This includes CSA, a key metric for assessing spinal cord atrophy, which correlates with the severity of DCM (Figure 6). By normalizing CSA to noncompressed levels, clinicians can better assess the impact of compression on spinal cord structural integrity. A reduction in CSA has been shown to elucidate the extent and progression of spinal cord atrophy in conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Many studies show that CSA is a clinically useful measure that provides insights into the spinal cord's overall health. In our study, we show a clear reduction in normalized CSA at all cervical vertebral levels in DCM patients compared with HC (Figure 6 B). The CSA is reduced across all vertebral levels in the DCM group, with more pronounced reductions at the intervertebral disk levels Figure 6 B. In conservatively treated DCM patients, we observed a progressive decrease in CSA at the 6-month follow-up relative to baseline measures Figure 6 C. This finding suggests that spinal cord atrophy can worsen over time without surgical intervention. Furthermore, we have shown a strong association between CSA measurement and clinical symptoms. The Anterior-Posterior and Transverse Diameters provide valuable insights into the degree of spinal cord stenosis. The AP diameter is particularly useful in identifying the severity of spinal cord compression, while the transverse diameter (RL) provides information about the extent of lateral (side-to-side) involvement and potential foraminal narrowing. Together, these metrics offer a quantitative measure of localized compression severity. In our research, we have demonstrated that AP diameter measurements can effectively identify the extent of spinal cord compression, even in patients with asymptomatic spinal cord compression. The Compression metric (maximum spinal cord compression) is a computed normalized morphometrics at the region of maximum compression. In other studies, maximum spinal cord compression has been shown to be a reliable biomarker of spinal cord injury, correlating with the severity of injury and neurological impairments. It has also been used to assess the outcomes of acute traumatic spinal cord injuries.

### Spinal cord tract integrity in degenerative cervical myelopathy [^113WxSRg]. Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common cause of spinal dysfunction globally. Despite surgical intervention, motor dysfunction may persist in many patients. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively examine specific spinal cord tract changes in patients with DCM, to better understand potential substrates for compensatory recovery of function.

Methods

Cervical spinal cord MRI scans with diffusion tensor imaging were performed in patients with DCM and in healthy volunteers. Spinal Cord Toolbox was used to register the PAM50 template, which includes a probabilistic atlas of the white matter tracts of the spinal cord, to the imaging data. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was extracted for each tract at C3 above the level of maximal compression and compared between patients with DCM and healthy volunteers and between patients with mild vs moderate to severe DCM.

Results

We included 25 patients with DCM (13 mild and 12 moderate to severe) and 6 healthy volunteers. FA was significantly reduced in DCM subjects relative to healthy volunteers for the lateral corticospinal tract (mild DCM vs healthy ∆ = -0.13, P = 0.018; moderate to severe DCM vs healthy ∆ = -0.11, P = 0.047), fasciculus gracilis (mild DCM vs healthy ∆ = -0.16, P = 0.010; moderate to severe DCM vs healthy ∆ = -0.13, P = 0.039), and fasciculus cuneatus (mild DCM vs healthy ∆ = -0.16, P = 0.007; moderate to severe DCM vs healthy ∆ = -0.15, P = 0.012). There were no differences in FA for all tracts between mild and moderate-to-severe DCM subjects.

Conclusion

Patients with DCM had altered diffusion tensor imaging signal in their lateral corticospinal tract, fasciculus gracilis, and fasciculus cuneatus in comparison with healthy volunteers. These findings indicate that DCM is characterized by injury to these structures, which suggests that other tracts within the cord could potentially act as substrates for compensatory motor recovery.

### Cervical cord neurodegeneration in traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord injury [^111yUwX9]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2020). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to compare macrostructural and microstructural neurodegenerative changes remote from a cervical spinal cord injury in traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) and degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) patients using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty-nine tSCI patients, 20 mild/moderate DCM patients, and 22 healthy controls underwent a high-resolution MRI protocol at the cervical cord (C2/C3). High-resolution T2✱-weighted and diffusion-weighted scans provided data to calculate tissue-specific cross-sectional areas of the spinal cord and tract-specific diffusion indices of cord white matter, respectively. Regression analysis determined associations between neurodegeneration and clinical impairment. tSCI patients showed more impairment in upper limb strength and manual dexterity when compared with DCM patients. While macrostructural MRI measures revealed a similar extent of remote cord atrophy at cervical level, microstructural measures (diffusion indices) were able to distinguish more pronounced tract-specific neurodegeneration in tSCI patients when compared with DCM patients. Tract-specific neurodegeneration was associated with upper limb impairment. Despite clinical differences between severely impaired tSCI compared with mildly affected DCM patient, extensive cord atrophy is present remotely from the focal spinal cord injury. Diffusion indices revealed greater tract-specific alterations in tSCI patients. Therefore, diffusion indices are more sensitive than macrostructural MRI measures as these are able to distinguish between traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord injury. Neuroimaging biomarkers of cervical cord integrity hold potential as predictors of recovery and might be suitable biomarkers for interventional trials both in traumatic and non-traumatic SCI.

Cervical spinal stenosis has been detected in 26% of older asymptomatic individuals. For the past 4 decades, attempts to correlate clinical symptoms with the degree of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have not yielded a validated methodology; however, measurements of maximum canal compromise, maximum spinal cord compression, and compression ratio were reported as reliable and correlated well with the clinical severity of cervical myelopathy.

### Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging reveals tract-specific microstructural correlates of electrophysiological impairments in non-myelopathic and myelopathic spinal cord compression [^116qmAyR]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and purpose

Non‐myelopathic degenerative cervical spinal cord compression (NMDC) frequently occurs throughout aging and may progress to potentially irreversible degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). Whereas standard clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electrophysiological measures assess compression severity and neurological dysfunction, respectively, underlying microstructural deficits still have to be established in NMDC and DCM patients. The study aims to establish tract‐specific diffusion MRI markers of electrophysiological deficits to predict the progression of asymptomatic NMDC to symptomatic DCM.

Methods

High‐resolution 3 T diffusion MRI was acquired for 103 NMDC and 21 DCM patients compared to 60 healthy controls to reveal diffusion alterations and relationships between tract‐specific diffusion metrics and corresponding electrophysiological measures and compression severity. Relationship between the degree of DCM disability, assessed by the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale, and tract‐specific microstructural changes in DCM patients was also explored.

Results

The study identified diffusion‐derived abnormalities in the gray matter, dorsal and lateral tracts congruent with trans‐synaptic degeneration and demyelination in chronic degenerative spinal cord compression with more profound alterations in DCM than NMDC. Diffusion metrics were affected in the C3‐6 area as well as above the compression level at C3 with more profound rostral deficits in DCM than NMDC. Alterations in lateral motor and dorsal sensory tracts correlated with motor and sensory evoked potentials, respectively, whereas electromyography outcomes corresponded with gray matter microstructure. DCM disability corresponded with microstructure alteration in lateral columns.

Conclusions

Outcomes imply the necessity of high‐resolution tract‐specific diffusion MRI for monitoring degenerative spinal pathology in longitudinal studies.

### Clinical significance of cerebrospinal fluid nitric oxide concentrations in degenerative cervical and lumbar diseases [^115nyZwQ]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

In animal models of degenerative lumbar disease, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is expressed in macrophages and Schwann cells following compression of the cauda equina. We previously reported that NO metabolites (nitrite plus nitrate: [NOx]) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) correlate with postoperative pain relief in patients with degenerative lumbar disease and with neurologic recovery rate postoperatively or after conservative treatment in patients with spinal cord injury. The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between [NOx] and neurologic severity, and recovery in degenerative cervical and lumbar diseases. Two hundred fifty-seven cases, including 85 patients with cervical compression myelopathy (CCM), 25 with cervical disc herniation (CDH), 70 with lumbar canal stenosis (LCS), and 77 with lumbar disc herniation (LDH), were examined. The CSF [NOx] was measured using the Griess method. Severity of neurologic impairment and clinical recovery was assessed using the Japanese Orthopedic Association score and Hirabayashi's method. [NOx] in CCM and LCS, but not CDH and LDH groups, was significantly higher than that in controls, and correlated with postoperative recovery rates, but not with preoperative neurologic severity. [NOx] significantly correlated with neurologic recovery following surgery for CCM and LCS.

INTRODUCTION

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common form of nontraumatic spinal cord injury in adults, with a rising incidence among the global ageing population. DCM‐induced disability can differently manifest in individuals, spanning a spectrum from mild pain and minor hand numbness to severe cases of incomplete tetraplegia. These severe cases can result in long‐lasting impairments of upper extremity function, gait difficulties, and bladder dysfunction. DCM is characterized by chronic spinal cord compression, leading to neural tissue destruction at the site of compression, but also remote changes of the spinal cord, and can even affect the brain. The current standard of care for moderate to severe DCM is surgical decompression. Nevertheless, in the case of mildly affected DCM patients, the ideal timing for surgical intervention remains uncertain. Additionally, it is worth noting that even after anatomically successful surgery, some DCM patients may still experience progressive disability.

Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) techniques have the potential to offer biomarkers that are sensitive to pathophysiological changes with clinical significance. Consequently, these techniques hold promise for enhancing the prediction of recovery in patients with DCM and helping with clinical decision‐making. The robustness and reproducibility of qMRI methods across multiple clinical sites are crucial prerequisites for the development of such biomarkers. Furthermore, there is a growing need to enhance statistical power to improve the efficiency of clinical trials. We here use an established qMRI protocol sensitive to microstructural changes in the brain and cervical cord that has already been applied and validated in a multicentre study in healthy subjects in the scope of a European multicentre/multivendor clinical trial. These studies showed high repeatability and reproducibility of multiparametric mapping (MPM) in the brain and cervical cord across different vendors and sites.

To simultaneously track changes in the brain and cervical cord, we further make use of a probabilistic brain–spinal cord template (SPM‐BSC). This approach has been successfully applied to traumatic spinal cord injury patients and patients with multiple sclerosis. We aim to simultaneously map the regional distribution of neurodegeneration in the brain and cervical cord in patients with mild–moderate DCM by means of qMRI. We further aim to assess the effects of the severity of intramedullary injury (i.e. radiologically established cervical myelopathy) on remote microstructural changes and clinical impairments.

### Management of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy and asymptomatic spinal cord compression: an international survey [^1156XKun]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is an umbrella term for symptomatic spinal cord compression, secondary to degenerative changes of the cervical spine. Symptoms are often debilitating and progressive, typically resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.

Disease severity is often quantified using the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score, an objective physician evaluation of neurological dysfunction. Moderate and severe DCM are defined as cases where mJOA ≤ 14 and surgery has been recommended for such patients, as outlined in the most recent clinical practice guidelines. Prior to surgery, many factors contribute to a delay in diagnosis in moderate/severe DCM. Nonetheless, there is a consensus amongst surgeons in support of operative management.

In contrast, there is weak evidence informing the management of mild DCM, most commonly defined in the literature as mJOA 15–17. Amongst mild DCM patients, there is a subpopulation that deteriorates and another which remains stable. An absence of prognostic biomarkers and symptoms means that there are no strong predictions to support decision making.

Guidelines therefore currently suggest surgical intervention or a trial of structured rehabilitation in mild DCM, with the latter escalating to the former in cases of deterioration. This tentative guidance is reflected in variable practice, as has been anecdotally reported by surgeons. There is no specification on what structured rehabilitation or surveillance should entail.

Similar heterogeneity is believed to exist in the management of ASCC, a precursor to DCM. In this case, the guidelines cite weak evidence supporting non-operative management, involving counselling and education. Likewise, what this should constitute remains undefined.

Whilst widespread underdiagnosis so far limits the number of patients with mild or asymptomatic disease in spinal clinics, this is estimated to be vast (one meta-analysis estimates 1 in 5 adults could have ASCC) and rising with aging. Initiatives to accelerate diagnosis are on-going, and anticipated to increase case ascertainment.

On this background of weak evidence and variable practice, and driven by projected demand, efforts to better inform care for mild DCM and ASCC are a critical priority. The objective of this study was to assess current practices in the assessment and management of mild DCM and ASCC. This work also aligns with two other research priorities of the AO Spine RECODE-DCM initiative: diagnostic criteria and assessment and monitoring. We hypothesise that there is substantial variability in the definition, assessment, and management of mild DCM and ASCC.

### Is neck pain a marker for something serious? Like myelopathy [^116w8tdP]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy (DCM) is one of the most frequent causes of spinal cord dysfunction in the elderly and comprises eleven older nomenclatures of the condition (Supplementary 1). DCM encompasses a variety of age-related and genetically associated pathologies including cervical spondylotic myelopathy, degenerative disc disease, and ligamentous aberrations such as ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligaments. These conditions may exist with or without compression of the spinal cord. As the spinal cord becomes compressed and damaged in DCM, a range of neurological symptoms can develop including chronic pain in the neck or paraesthesia of the upper limbs.

Neck pain is a common clinical presentation with a myriad of aetiologies. Persistent neck pain is believed to be a predictor of DCM. However, the relationship between structural alterations in the cervical spine and symptomatic presentations requires comprehensive understanding, particularly given the implications for diagnosis and treatment. Neck pain can be classified into episodic, inflammatory, referred, psychogenic, and chronic. Chronic neck pain and DCM are two conditions that are putatively related to each other with an unclear temporal relationship.

Neck pain therefore may not simply be a symptom of degenerative change in the structure of the spinal column, but rather a symptom that may herald the future development of DCM. In this perspective article, our objective is to elucidate the correlation between DCM and neck pain, specifically distinguishing between episodic or chronic manifestations.

However, there remains "a paucity of Class I or II data which assesses the role and timing of surgical intervention in patients with CSM", and "rigorous longitudinal data with long-term follow-up are required to define the role of cervical arthroplasty in the management of symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease".

### Tracking white and gray matter degeneration along the spinal cord axis in degenerative cervical myelopathy [^116g7bw6]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

This study aims to determine tissue-specific neurodegeneration across the spinal cord in patients with mild-moderate degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). Twenty-four mild-moderate DCM and 24 healthy subjects were recruited. In patients, a T2-weighted scan was acquired at the compression site, whereas in all participants a T2✱-weighted and diffusion-weighted scan was acquired at the cervical level (C2-C3) and in the lumbar enlargement (i.e., rostral and caudal to the site of compression). We quantified intramedullary signal changes, maximal canal and cord compression, white (WM) and gray matter (GM) atrophy, and microstructural indices from diffusion-weighted scans. All patients underwent clinical (modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association; mJOA) and electrophysiological assessments. Regression analysis assessed associations between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) readouts and electrophysiological and clinical outcomes. Twenty patients were classified with mild and 4 with moderate DCM using the mJOA scale. The most frequent site of compression was at the C5-C6 level, with maximum cord compression of 38.73% ± 11.57%. Ten patients showed imaging evidence of cervical myelopathy. In the cervical cord, WM and GM atrophy and WM microstructural changes were evident, whereas in the lumbar cord only WM showed atrophy and microstructural changes. Remote cervical cord WM microstructural changes were pronounced in patients with radiological myelopathy and associated with impaired electrophysiology. Lumbar cord WM atrophy was associated with lower limb sensory impairments. In conclusion, tissue-specific neurodegeneration revealed by quantitative MRI is already apparent across the spinal cord in mild-moderate DCM before the onset of severe clinical impairments. WM microstructural changes are particularly sensitive to remote pathologically and clinically eloquent changes in DCM.

### Spinal cord demyelination predicts neurological deterioration in patients with mild degenerative cervical myelopathy [^1119pG9w]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common form of atraumatic cervical spinal cord injury.DCM is an umbrella term for several degenerative changes in the spinal column that cause progressive compression of the cervical spinal cord. These underlying changes may include cervical spondylosis, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, ossification of the ligamentum flavum and degenerative disc disease. Typical symptoms include gait imbalance, dexterity impairment in the hands, upper and lower extremity numbness and sphincter dysfunction. Currently, the most widely accepted method of classifying DCM severity is through the clinician-reported modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scale. The mJOA scale assesses upper and lower extremity motor dysfunction, upper extremity sensory dysfunction and sphincter dysfunction. Scores are stratified into mild (mJOA 15–18), moderate (mJOA 12–14) and severe (mJOA < 12) DCM. The minimum clinically important difference, for patients with mild, moderate and severe DCM with a change in mJOA of 1, 2 or 3 points across time, respectively.

### Focal compression of the cervical spinal cord alone does not indicate high risk of neurological deterioration in patients with a diagnosis of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy [^115Uz8Ea]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy (DCM) is the functional derangement of the spinal cord resulting from vertebral column spondylotic degeneration. Typical neurological symptoms of DCM include gait imbalance, hand/arm numbness, and upper extremity dexterity loss. Greater spinal cord compression is believed to lead to a higher rate of neurological deterioration, although clinical experience suggests a more complex mechanism involving spinal canal diameter (SCD). In this study, we utilized machine learning clustering to understand the relationship between SCD and different patterns of cord compression (i.e. compression at one disc level, two disc levels, etc.) to identify patient groups at risk of neurological deterioration. 124 MRI scans from 51 non-operative DCM patients were assessed through manual scoring of cord compression and SCD measurements. Dimensionality reduction techniques and k-means clustering established patient groups that were then defined with their unique risk criteria. We found that the compression pattern is unimportant at SCD extremes (≤ 14.5 mm or > 15.75 mm). Otherwise, severe spinal cord compression at two disc levels increases deterioration likelihood. Notably, if SCD is normal and cord compression is not severe at multiple levels, deterioration likelihood is relatively reduced, even if the spinal cord is experiencing compression. We elucidated five patient groups with their associated risks of deterioration, according to both SCD range and cord compression pattern. Overall, SCD and focal cord compression alone do not reliably predict an increased risk of neurological deterioration. Instead, the specific combination of narrow SCD with multi-level focal cord compression increases the likelihood of neurological deterioration in mild DCM patients.

### Quantifying neurodegeneration of the cervical cord and brain in degenerative cervical myelopathy: a multicentre study using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging [^112W9uo8]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

LIMITATIONS

It is necessary to address several limitations of this study. DCM patients were on average 17 years older than the healthy controls. Hence, we adjusted any linear effect of age by adding it as a covariant of no interest in all statistical analyses. Moreover, statistical parametric maps generated by the SPM model are only indirect markers for microstructural changes in biological tissue. Histological samples have shown links between myelination and the parameters of R1 and MT, as well as between R2* and iron content. Therefore, they can be used to investigate underlying tissue properties. Conducting a single scan covering both the brain and spinal cord may provide suboptimal results in terms of different resolution needs in the spinal cord. Although our approach aimed to investigate simultaneous changes between brain and spinal cord and balance time constraints, we acknowledge the potential implications of this trade‐off. Although the multicentre nature of the study is crucial for advancing towards identifying biomarkers for clinical trials, it is worth noting that the identical Siemens MRI scanner model was employed across both sites. This study was planned as a cross‐sectional design, disclosing information about only one time point. Longitudinal collection of data could enable the investigation of microstructural changes in relation to a temporal dimension and thus allow improved monitoring of disease progression.

In conclusion, this study successfully implemented a simultaneous mapping of spinal cord and brain based on a qMRI protocol within a multicentre study. We found that in mild–moderate DCM, simultaneous qMRI assessments revealed (micro‐)structural changes above the compression site in the brain and cervical cord of DCM patients with radiological evidence of myelopathy (T2‐weighted hyperintensity at the compression site). These findings disclose the consistent involvement of regions along the whole somatosensory processing stream in mild to moderate DCM. Neurodegeneration in supraspinal regions was associated with greater prehension impairment, indicating that these regions are the dominantly disturbed pathways affected by DCM.

### The relationship between the cervical spinal canal diameter and the pathological changes in the cervical spine [^111AbBNB]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

The size of the cervical spinal canal is clinically important in traumatic, degenerative, and inflammatory conditions. It is typically measured on plain radiographs as the developmental segmental sagittal diameter from the posterior surface of the vertebral body to the closest point on the spinolaminar line at the pedicle level. However, variations in magnification and the distance from the X-ray source to the film as well as from the subject to the film can confound these measurements. To avoid magnification variables with plain radiographs, Pavlov et al. and Torg et al. used the ratio of the sagittal diameter of the spinal canal to the sagittal diameter of the vertebral body obtained on plain radiographs. They found this method to be a reliable determinant of cervical spinal canal stenosis.

However, plain radiographs only have the ability to evaluate osseous structures, and soft-tissue abnormalities can also contribute to cervical spondylosis and cervical spinal canal stenosis. Compared with other radiological studies currently available to evaluate the spine, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides the greatest range of information. MRI is routinely used for the evaluation of spinal degenerative disease due to its ability to accurately delineate soft-tissue structures such as intervertebral discs, spinal ligaments, or neural elements, and osseous structures such as vertebral bodies, spinal canals, the facet joints, or uncovertebral joints. The ability of MRI to detect subtle abnormalities in both soft-tissue and bone makes it highly sensitive for the detection of any pathology; therefore, the functional cervical spinal canal or cervical spinal cord can be accurately measured using MRI.

There are numerous studies regarding the relationship between cervical spinal canal size and spinal cord conditions. A congenitally narrow cervical spinal canal has been established as an important risk factor for the development of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). However, to the best of our knowledge, few reports thus far have described the mechanism underlying the increased risk of CSM in patients with a narrow cervical spinal canal. In this study, utilizing data describing cervical kinematics evaluated by positional MRI with dynamic motion of the cervical spine, we investigate the relationship between cervical spinal canal narrowing and pathological changes in the cervical spine.

### Semiautomated pipeline effectively assesses severity and monitor disease progression in compressed spinal cord of degenerative cervical myelopathy patients [^117FxPqG]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive and disabling condition resulting from chronic compression of the spinal cord, leading to functional impairments that can severely affect quality of life. Traditional methods for assessing spinal cord injury and morphometrics rely on subjective visualization of contrast changes and manual segmentation, which are nonstandardized, time-consuming, and inconsistent across patients. This variability limits understanding of DCM pathology and hampers timely clinical intervention.

Methods

We introduce a semiautomated pipeline using the Spinal Cord Toolbox, an open-source platform that uses advanced algorithms, including optimization and computational efficiency algorithms, support vector machine, and convolutional neural networks, to streamline the assessment of spinal cord shape, microstructural changes, and gray and white matter integrity. By integrating spinal cord segmentation, anatomical labeling, and registration to a standardized template, the pipeline extracts normalized morphometric measures, providing efficient and reliable analysis of spinal cord pathology in DCM.

Results

We extracted normalized spinal cord morphometrics, including cross-sectional area (CSA), anterior-posterior diameter, right-left diameter, eccentricity, solidity, gray matter CSA, white matter CSA, and regional and tract-based magnetization transfer ratio measures. Our analysis demonstrates that DCM patients exhibit significant reductions in these morphometrics compared with healthy controls, even in regions without visible compression. Furthermore, CSA reductions across the spinal cord highlight areas of severe compression, including at the intervertebral disks, which may not be apparent on standard imaging.

Conclusion

These quantitative measures give clinicians easily interpretable data on the extent of spinal cord injury, even in regions without obvious compression. This enables a comprehensive understanding of DCM pathophysiology. By eliminating the subjectivity of manual segmentation and accounting for intersubject and intrasubject variability, this approach supports consistent cross-subject comparisons and is poised to reshape how clinicians assess and manage DCM.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^1165Qbni]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What is degenerative cervical myelopathy?

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), earlier referred to as cervical spondylotic myelopathy, involves spinal cord dysfunction from compression in the neck. Patients report neurological symptoms such as pain and numbness in limbs, poor coordination, imbalance, and bladder problems. Owing to its mobility, the vertebral column of the neck is particularly prone to degenerative changes such as disc herniation, ligament hypertrophy or ossification, and osteophyte formation. These changes are more common with age(box 1) and are often collectively termed spondylosis (fig 1).

Box 1
How common is it?

The epidemiology of DCM is poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties in diagnosis.

The prevalence of surgically treated DCM is estimated as 1.6 per 100 000 inhabitants. The actual prevalence is likely to be much higher
The incidence of DCM is expected to rise with an ageing population. Most patients are first diagnosed in their 50s; DCM is uncommon before the age of 40
Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that incidental cervical cord compression is commonly detected on MRI, and becomes more common with age. In a series of randomly selected volunteers aged 40–80, incidental cervical cord compression was detected on MRI in 59% of individuals (108/183, ranging from 31.6% in the fifth decade to 66.8% in the eighth decade). Only two individuals reported related symptoms
A proportion of individuals with asymptomatic cord compression will go on to develop DCM. The exact figure is unknown. The only prospective study to consider this (n = 199) found that 8% of individuals with asymptomatic cord compression will develop DCM after one year and 22% in total over the observation period (median follow-up 44 months, range 2–12 years)
Many patients with DCM remain undiagnosed. A small study in 66 patients with hip fracture found 18% of patients who were previously undiagnosed to have clinical findings suggestive of DCM

### Symptomatic progression of cervical myelopathy and the role of nonsurgical management: a consensus statement [^112TSoxC]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

This section of the cervical spondylotic myelopathy Spine focus issue collates the existing evidence related to natural history and nonoperative management. In the case of patients with symptomatic cervical spondylotic myelopathy treated nonoperatively, while 20% to 62% will deteriorate at 3 to 6 years of follow-up, no specific patient or disease characteristics have been shown to predict this change reliably. For patients without myelopathy with spondylotic cord compression, the rate of myelopathy development is approximately 8% at 1 year and approximately 23% at 4 years of follow-up. Clinical and/or electrophysiological evidence of cervical radiculopathy has been shown to predict such progression and should prompt strong consideration of surgical decompression. With respect to nonoperative care, in the case of mild myelopathy, there is low evidence that such treatment may have a role; for moderate and severe myelopathy, this treatment results in outcomes inferior to those of surgery and is not recommended. Given the unpredictably progressive nature of cervical myelopathy, the indications for nonoperative management are ostensibly limited. Finally, the preclinical rationale and clinical translation of a putative neuroprotective drug, which may one day serve to augment the effects of surgery in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, is presented and discussed.

### Cervical myelopathy: a clinical and radiographic evaluation and correlation to cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^113DK8jt]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients treated between April 2006 and January 2008, and diagnosed with cervical degenerative disease.

Objective

To determine the correlation of the clinical findings associated with cervical myelopathy to the presence of spinal cord compression or cord signal abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Summary Of Background Data

There are numerous reports describing the radiographic features of cervical spondylosis, however, no publication specifically describes the association between the physical signs of cervical myelopathy and the presenting imaging findings.

Methods

Myelopathy was defined as the presence of greater than one long-tract sign localized to the cervical spinal cord (Hoffman or Babinski signs, clonus, hyper-reflexia, crossed abductor sign, and/or gait dysfunction) on physical examination in the absence of other neurologic condition(s). The presence of these signs, MRI imaging features of spinal cord compression and hyperintense T2 intraparenchymal cord signal abnormality, and patient demographics were recorded.

Results

One hundred three patients met inclusion criteria (age > 18, symptomatic cervical degenerative disease and complete neurologic assessment). Of these, 54 had clinical findings of cervical myelopathy. Radiographic features of cord compression were present in 62% of patients, and 84% had myelopathy on examination. No patients without cord compression presented with myelopathy (P < 0.0001). Thirty-five percent of the patients presented with hyperintense signal on T2 MRI within the spinal cord parenchyma. This finding correlated with the presence of myelopathy (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis on the subset with cord compression indicates that the likelihood of myelopathy increased with the presence of cord signal hyperintensity (odds ratio [OR], 11.4), sensory loss (OR, 16.9), and age (OR, 1.10 per year).

Conclusion

The diagnosis of cervical myelopathy is based on presenting symptoms and physical examination. This analysis illustrates that radiographic cervical spinal cord compression and hyperintense T2 intraparen chymal signal abnormalities correlate with the presence of myelopathic findings on physical examination.

Cervical spondylosis — prevalence, age association, and affected levels are described, noting that in most symptomatic cases spondylosis is associated with aging and with compression of the spinal cord in patients older than 55. Degenerative changes of the cervical spine are seen in approximately 10% of individuals by age 25 and in 95% by age 65, and the levels most commonly affected by both disc herniation and chronic spondylosis are C6/C7 followed by C5/C6. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy refers to clinically evident spinal cord dysfunction with the presence of long-track signs due to compression of the spinal cord.
