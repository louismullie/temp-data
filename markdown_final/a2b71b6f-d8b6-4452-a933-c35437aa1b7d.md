## Question

When do you use dual antiplatelet coagulation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to use dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and how to choose its duration across coronary and cerebrovascular indications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining DAPT and its mechanism. Then, I should verify the core indications where DAPT is beneficial. Next, I will examine duration by clinical scenario, including ACS, PCI with stenting, and medically managed CAD. After that, I need to review cerebrovascular indications and timing. I will then consider special populations and risk stratification tools. Finally, I should confirm what to avoid, reconcile conflicting evidence, and synthesize a practical decision framework with monitoring and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and mechanism so I don't gloss over fundamentals. DAPT combines aspirin, which irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and thromboxane A2–mediated platelet aggregation, with a P2Y12 inhibitor such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor, which blocks ADP-mediated platelet activation; together they provide complementary and more potent platelet inhibition than either alone, which is why we use it when arterial thrombosis risk is high and bleeding risk is acceptable.

> Next, I should review the principal indications where DAPT has proven benefit, and I need to ensure I'm aligning with high-quality guidance. DAPT is indicated after acute coronary syndromes regardless of management strategy, after PCI with stenting to prevent stent thrombosis, and as a short, early course after high-risk TIA or minor ischemic stroke; importantly, DAPT is not indicated for primary prevention or for routine long-term secondary stroke prevention beyond 90 days, nor for stable CAD without recent ACS or stenting [^113KTQ32] [^113xQd6n] [^1147yeq5].

> Now, let me consider duration after ACS and PCI, and I should double-check that I'm integrating stent generation and bleeding risk correctly. Historically, guidelines favored 12 months of DAPT after ACS or DES implantation, but contemporary data allow shorter courses in selected patients; with newer-generation DES, 3–6 months can be noninferior to 12 months for stent thrombosis and MACE while reducing bleeding, whereas extending DAPT to 18–48 months reduces MI and stent thrombosis at the cost of more major bleeding and, in some analyses, signals for higher noncardiac mortality, so the net benefit is modest and must be individualized [^111w2CpX] [^111k3qxU] [^116faPhE] [^114mo51q].

> Wait, let me verify the balance for extended therapy after prior MI. In PEGASUS-TIMI 54, ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily on top of aspirin reduced the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke in stable patients 1–3 years after MI at the expense of more TIMI major bleeding; ACC/AHA guidance thus allows consideration of prolonged DAPT up to 3 years in chronic CAD with prior MI and low bleeding risk, which I should frame as a selective, not routine, strategy [^112DSWMm] [^114dH6KP].

> I will now examine medically managed ACS without PCI, and I should confirm that DAPT still applies. Even without stenting, DAPT reduces recurrent events after ACS; however, the default duration is 12 months, with earlier de-escalation or P2Y12 monotherapy considered in high bleeding risk, especially as data evolve toward abbreviated DAPT followed by P2Y12 monotherapy strategies in selected patients [^112xpukr] [^112jf3s9].

> Next, I should review cerebrovascular indications, and I need to be precise about timing and duration. For minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA, initiate DAPT with aspirin plus clopidogrel as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours, and continue for 21–30 days, then transition to single antiplatelet therapy. The benefit accrues early, with most risk reduction in the first 1–3 weeks, and prolonging beyond 90 days increases bleeding without added ischemic benefit, so I should avoid routine long-term DAPT here [^111E6GYi] [^111e7gne] [^112EiP37] [^116DNKSm].

> Hold on, I should verify how prior antiplatelet use modifies this, since some worry it blunts DAPT efficacy. Meta-analyses suggest the relative benefit of early short-course DAPT over aspirin alone is similar in patients with and without prior aspirin exposure, so prior antiplatelet use should not deter early short-course DAPT after minor stroke or TIA when otherwise indicated [^113dg7Xv] [^111FJRdH].

> Let me consider peripheral vascular disease, and I need to check whether DAPT helps after endovascular therapy. The Society for Vascular Surgery suggests DAPT for at least 1 month after endovascular intervention for intermittent claudication to mitigate early thrombotic risk, acknowledging low-quality evidence and the need to individualize by bleeding risk and stent type [^113qo5qZ].

> I should confirm how to operationalize bleeding and ischemic risk stratification at the bedside. The DAPT score helps after PCI: a score ≥ 2 suggests ischemic benefit may outweigh bleeding risk and favors extended DAPT, whereas a score < 2 suggests bleeding risk predominates and favors standard or shorter DAPT; in parallel, PRECISE-DAPT and ARC-HBR help flag high bleeding risk where shorter DAPT or P2Y12 monotherapy may be preferred [^117Ju6FG] [^113pHuq4].

> But wait, what about stent type and procedural complexity? I should double-check that I'm not overgeneralizing. With newer-generation DES, 3–6 months is often sufficient for most patients, while complex anatomy, multiple stents, small-caliber vessels, diabetes, or prior stent thrombosis may tilt toward 12 months or longer if bleeding risk is low; conversely, high bleeding risk, oral anticoagulation needs, or planned surgery can justify 1–3 months or even earlier P2Y12 monotherapy in carefully selected cases [^111k3qxU] [^115nsWQh] [^111bNpuq].

> Next, I should review special populations, and I need to ensure I'm not missing important nuances. In atrial fibrillation with ACS or PCI, minimize triple therapy duration to as short as 1 week when feasible, then continue dual therapy with a DOAC plus a single antiplatelet, typically clopidogrel, for 6–12 months depending on ACS status, before transitioning to anticoagulation monotherapy. This reduces bleeding while preserving ischemic protection [^115QesoQ].

> I will now examine de-escalation strategies, and I should verify the direction of contemporary evidence. Trials support shortening DAPT to 1–3 months followed by P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy to reduce bleeding without excess ischemic events in selected PCI patients, and an individual patient data meta-analysis suggests P2Y12 monotherapy after a short DAPT course is noninferior for death/MI/stroke and safer for bleeding compared with continued DAPT; ticagrelor monotherapy is also a reasonable long-term option after ticagrelor-based DAPT in high ischemic, non-high bleeding risk patients [^117CgoUs] [^112jf3s9] [^111bNpuq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about simply adding more antithrombotics; I should double-check the harm of inappropriate combinations. DAPT is not recommended for primary prevention, for routine long-term secondary stroke prevention beyond 90 days, or for stable CAD without recent stenting or ACS; adding a NOAC to DAPT after ACS increases bleeding and does not clearly improve outcomes, so such strategies should be avoided outside specific indications like AF with PCI [^112EiP37] [^114B7Nqn] [^1138MnKD].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I recall older guidance suggesting a uniform 12 months after DES, but newer trials contradict that blanket approach. I should reconcile this. While 2011 ACC/AHA PCI guidance endorsed 12 months for DES, subsequent randomized trials and guideline updates demonstrate that shorter courses with newer DES are safe for many and that extended therapy trades ischemic gains for bleeding harm, so current practice appropriately emphasizes individualized duration rather than a fixed 12 months for all [^115NuDXu] [^111k3qxU] [^111w2CpX].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and verify alignment with major guidelines. For ACS, use DAPT for 12 months if bleeding risk is not high, with consideration of shorter courses or P2Y12 monotherapy if bleeding risk is high; for stable CAD undergoing PCI with newer DES, 6 months is reasonable, with 3 months acceptable in high bleeding risk and extension beyond 12 months considered only in high ischemic, low bleeding risk patients; for minor stroke or TIA, use 21–30 days of DAPT started within 24 hours, then transition to single antiplatelet therapy; throughout, apply DAPT score after PCI, reassess at 3, 6, and 12 months, and plan interruptions around procedures to mitigate bleeding while minimizing stent thrombosis risk [^113yGVfy] [^111E6GYi] [^117Ju6FG] [^112fmPAR].

> Finally, I need to ensure I've addressed monitoring and safety. I should confirm that patients are counseled on adherence, bleeding precautions, and when to seek urgent care. In perioperative settings, coordinate timing of P2Y12 interruption, consider bridging only in very high thrombotic risk, and resume therapy as soon as hemostasis permits to avoid stent thrombosis, balancing procedural bleeding risk against ischemic risk on a case-by-case basis [^112fmPAR].

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor is indicated for **acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with or without PCI** [^113KTQ32] for 12 months unless bleeding risk is high, in which case 6 months is acceptable [^113yGVfy]. After PCI with a drug-eluting stent (DES), **DAPT is recommended for 12 months** [^111k3qxU]; shorter courses (3–6 months) may be considered in patients at high bleeding risk [^113yGVfy], whereas longer courses (18–48 months) are reserved for those at high ischemic and low bleeding risk [^116qFHRH]. For minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA, **short-term DAPT (21–30 days)** [^111E6GYi] reduces early recurrence without excess bleeding [^116DNKSm], but prolonged DAPT increases bleeding without added benefit [^113pVt5V]. DAPT is not recommended for primary prevention, stable CAD without stenting, or cardioembolic stroke due to AF [^114B7Nqn]. Always individualize duration using the DAPT score [^113pHuq4] and bleeding risk tools [^1117Z6DN].

## Indications for dual antiplatelet therapy

### Coronary artery disease (CAD)

- **Acute coronary syndromes (ACS)**: DAPT is indicated for all ACS patients (STEMI, NSTEMI, unstable angina) [^113KTQ32] for 12 months, regardless of management strategy (medical, PCI, or CABG) [^112jKQVu].

- **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)**: DAPT is indicated after PCI with DES for 12 months [^115NuDXu]; shorter courses (3–6 months) may be considered in patients at high bleeding risk [^notfound], and longer courses (18–48 months) may be considered in patients at high ischemic risk and low bleeding risk [^114dH6KP].

- **Stable CAD without recent ACS or PCI**: DAPT is not recommended for primary prevention or stable CAD without recent stenting [^114B7Nqn].

---

### Cerebrovascular disease

For cerebrovascular disease, **minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA**: short-term DAPT (aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21–30 days) [^111E6GYi] reduces early recurrent ischemic stroke without significant increase in major bleeding [^111e7gne] [^116DNKSm]. For long-term secondary prevention, **prolonged DAPT (> 90 days)** increases bleeding risk without additional benefit and is not recommended [^1147yeq5].

---

### Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)

For peripheral arterial disease (PAD), **endovascular intervention**: DAPT is suggested for at least 1 month after endovascular intervention for intermittent claudication [^113qo5qZ].

---

## Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| ACS (STEMI, NSTEMI, UA) | 12 months | High |
| PCI with DES | 12 months | High |
| High bleeding risk patients | 3–6 months | Moderate |
| High ischemic risk patients | 18–48 months | Moderate |
| Minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA | 21–30 days | High |
| Endovascular intervention for PAD | ≥ 1 month | Moderate |

## Risks and benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy

### Benefits

Benefits include **reduced ischemic events** — DAPT significantly reduces myocardial infarction, stroke, and stent thrombosis in patients with ACS and those undergoing PCI [^116qFHRH] [^114mo51q] — and **early stroke prevention**, as short-term DAPT reduces early recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA [^116DNKSm].

---

### Risks

Risks include **increased bleeding** — DAPT increases major bleeding risk, particularly gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding [^116qFHRH] — and **individualized risk assessment**, as the DAPT score [^113pHuq4] and bleeding risk tools (e.g. PRECISE-DAPT) help balance ischemic and bleeding risks to guide duration [^1117Z6DN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ACC/AHA guidelines**: Recommend DAPT for 12 months after ACS and PCI with DES, with individualized duration based on bleeding and ischemic risk [^115eYUqy].

- **ESC guidelines**: Recommend 6–12 months of DAPT after PCI, with shorter durations (1–3 months) for high bleeding risk patients [^113yGVfy].

- **AHA/ASA guidelines**: Recommend short-term DAPT (21–30 days) for minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA, followed by single antiplatelet therapy [^111E6GYi].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing DAPT use

- **Bleeding risk**: High bleeding risk patients may benefit from shorter DAPT duration (3–6 months) [^113yGVfy].

- **Ischemic risk**: High ischemic risk patients may benefit from extended DAPT duration (18–48 months) [^116qFHRH].

- **Age**: Elderly patients have higher bleeding risk, necessitating careful consideration of DAPT duration [^1179Lx5L].

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, renal impairment, and prior cardiovascular events influence DAPT duration decisions [^113pHuq4].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

DAPT is indicated for ACS, after **PCI with DES**, and for short-term use after minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA [^113KTQ32] [^111E6GYi]. Duration should be individualized based on **ischemic and bleeding risk**, with shorter courses for high bleeding risk and longer courses for high ischemic risk [^113yGVfy]. Prolonged DAPT **increases bleeding risk without additional benefit** in most scenarios [^notfound].

### Refining the role of antiplatelet therapy in medically managed patients with acute coronary syndrome [^116gAKsD]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor is recommended for use as first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) who undergo high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention. However, revascularization may not be a beneficial option for some subgroups of patients with ACS. This includes a broad spectrum of lower risk patients as well as high-risk patients with numerous previous revascularizations and those who are at high risk for complications, such as those with complex coronary anatomy and co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or advanced age and frailty. For such patients, there remains an unmet need for evaluation of alternatives to the currently recommended treatment options. Notably, there is a paucity of prospective data regarding management approaches to medically managed patients with ACS. Thus, this group of medically managed patients with ACS would benefit from inclusion in clinical trials investigating therapeutic options for patients not scheduled to undergo invasive procedures, such as those who are targeted for pharmacologic management only. In conclusion, in this review, the investigators revisit data from clinical studies of dual-antiplatelet therapy in ACS to highlight areas of unmet need in antiplatelet therapy in patients with ACS and to examine the use of newer agents in subgroups, such as medically managed patients with ACS, that would potentially benefit from more potent platelet inhibition after ACS.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy: a systematic review for the 2016 ACC / AHA guideline focused update on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^113jeKRg]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation — DES LATE extension and PRODIGY randomized trials — In DES LATE, patients were "event free after having been treated with 12 to 18 months of DAPT after DES implantation", and in the extension trial the primary endpoint "occurred in 61 patients treated with 24 months of DAPT and in 57 patients treated with 12 months of DAPT (2.6% versus 2.4%; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74 to 1.51; P = 0.75)". The original trials "were planned to have an expected event rate of 5% at 2 years but had actual rates of 2.5%". In PRODIGY, a "2 × 4 factorial design" randomized "2013 patients to either 24 or 6 months of DAPT", with antiplatelet strategy randomization "performed 30 days after implantation", and "at 24 months of follow-up, the investigators found no difference in the primary endpoint of death, MI, stroke, or definite stent thrombosis", although "there was an excess of bleeding in patients assigned to 24 months of DAPT".

### Benefits and risks of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: a systematic review for the 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack [^1147yeq5]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) after high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke — timing and duration — shows that when initiated soon after high-risk TIA or minor stroke and continued for 21 to 90 days, DAPT is more effective than SAPT for reducing recurrent ischemic stroke, and although pooled bleeding with early DAPT was not statistically higher, POINT showed a statistically significant higher risk of major bleeding, so the risk of bleeding should be considered and weighed against the potential benefits when initiated early after onset. When initiated within 1 to 2 months of stroke or TIA and continued for 2 to 3 years, DAPT is not associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke but is associated with more bleeding events and therefore is not recommended in this setting. However, uncertainty surrounding these conclusions must be recognized given that few trials were identified in the systematic review and included in the meta-analyses.

### Indications for dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel: evidence-based recommendations for use [^114B7Nqn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature assessing dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel and subsequently provide evidence-based recommendations for appropriate indications and length of therapy.

Data Sources

An English-language MEDLINE search (1950-December 2007) was conducted using the search terms antiplatelet, aspirin, thienopyridine, and clopidogrel to identify articles assessing dual antiplatelet therapy. Evaluation of references from identified trials for possible inclusion was also conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies that assessed treatment with the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel for any indication were included.

Data Synthesis

Aspirin and clopidogrel have complementary mechanisms of action to inhibit platelet function. Indications that have been studied include coronary artery disease (CAD), atherosclerotic ischemic stroke, and atrial fibrillation. This combination has been beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with or without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and in PCI patients without an acute event. There is a small but significant risk for increased bleeding with dual antiplatelet therapy for these indications. When used in patients with a history of atherosclerotic ischemic stroke or for prevention of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, this combination has been shown to increase bleeding, providing no clinical benefit, and to increase outcomes including stroke, myocardial infarction, and death, respectively.

Conclusions

There is evidence to support use of aspirin in combination with clopidogrel for patients presenting with all ACS types, as well as for patients presenting with PCI for any indication. The treatment duration varies, but patients who have received stenting should receive at least 1 year of combination therapy. There is no evidence to support this combination for primary prevention of CAD or atherosclerotic ischemic events, secondary prevention of stable CAD, or prevention of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. The possible benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy also must be weighed against the risk of bleeding.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy: a systematic review for the 2016 ACC / AHA guideline focused update on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary Artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^115kBR6X]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after implantation of newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) remains uncertain. Similarly, questions remain about the role of DAPT in long-term therapy of stable post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients.

Aim

Our objective was to compare the incidence of death, major hemorrhage, MI, stent thrombosis, and major adverse cardiac events in patients randomized to prolonged or short-course DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES and in secondary prevention after MI.

Methods

We used traditional frequentist statistical and Bayesian approaches to address the following questions: Q1) What is the minimum duration of DAPT required after DES implantation? Q2) What is the clinical benefit of prolonging DAPT up to 18 to 48 months? Q3) What is the clinical effect of DAPT in stable patients who are > 1 year past an MI?

Results

We reviewed evidence from 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled 33051 patients who received predominantly newer-generation DES to answer: A1) Use of DAPT for 12 months, as compared with use for 3 to 6 months, resulted in no significant differences in incidence of death (odds ratio [OR]: 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85 to 1.63), major hemorrhage (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.97 to 2.82), MI (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.18), or stent thrombosis (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.55). Bayesian models confirmed the primary analysis. A2) Use of DAPT for 18 to 48 months, compared with use for 6 to 12 months, was associated with no difference in incidence of all-cause death (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.42) but was associated with increased major hemorrhage (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.09), decreased MI (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.95), and decreased stent thrombosis (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.74). A risk-benefit analysis found 3 fewer stent thromboses (95% CI: 2 to 5) and 6 fewer MIs (95% CI: 2 to 11) but 5 more major bleeds (95% CI: 3 to 9) per 1000 patients treated with prolonged DAPT per year. Post hoc analyses provided weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT. We reviewed evidence from 1 RCT of 21162 patients and a post hoc analysis of 1 RCT of 15603 patients to answer: A3): Use of DAPT > 1 year after MI reduced the composite risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (hazard ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.95) but increased major bleeding (hazard ratio: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.68 to 3.21). A meta-analysis and a post hoc analysis of an RCT in patients with stable cardiovascular disease produced similar findings.

Conclusions

The primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence that prolonged DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES entails a tradeoff between reductions in stent thrombosis and MI and increases in major hemorrhage. Secondary analyses provide weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT after DES implantation. In patients whose coronary thrombotic risk was defined by a prior MI rather than by DES implantation, the primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence of reduced cardiovascular events at the expense of increased bleeding.

### Antithrombotic therapy: triple therapy or triple threat? [^112t4Vfk]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy plays an essential role in the management of some of the most common and morbid medical conditions. Triple oral antithrombotic therapy (TOAT) is defined as the administration of both therapeutic oral anticoagulation (OAC) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) to patients with indications for both treatments. The current societal guidelines regarding TOAT are derived from observational studies and some trials of the use of warfarin in addition to antiplatelet therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention. The general apprehension to administer TOAT is due to the heightened concern for bleeding, rendering warfarin's pharmacokinetic properties concerning. Newer anticoagulant agents may serve as appealing alternatives, and further investigations are warranted. The results of the recent trials that have studied the use of these agents in atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome offer some useful applications to TOAT. Ultimately, selecting the most favorable antithrombotic strategy is going to involve weighing the risks and benefits for each patient.

### Individualizing dual antiplatelet therapy duration: prediction tools, genomics, and clinical judgment [^111P9KN7]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on average reduces the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) but increases major bleeds. Individualizing duration of DAPT based on the DAPT trial's net benefit prediction tool would likely optimize outcome beyond population average recommendations. Individualizing agent selection and duration of therapy based on genomic data may further improve outcomes. Clinical judgment remains the most important tool to tailor DAPT duration based on a large array of additional relevant factors not captured by predition rules or genomics.

### Extended duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: how long is too long? [^115eYUqy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on duration of dual‐antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug‐eluting stents (DESs) give a class I recommendation to continue DAPT for at least 12 months after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and at least 6 months after revascularization in the setting of stable ischemic heart disease. 1 These guidelines also give a class IIb recommendation for continuation of DAPT beyond 6 and 12 months in patients with stable ischemic heart disease and ACS, respectively, if these patients have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding event and are at low risk for bleeding in the future. 1 However, they do not provide any guidance with respect to how long DAPT should be continued and leave it to the clinician to discuss the risks versus benefits with the patient and individualize antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, in clinical practice, we often see patients on DAPT several years after a PCI as they are instructed by their providers to never discontinue them. In fact, given how much the importance of taking DAPT in the early period after PCI is emphasized, patients at times are uncomfortable stopping the second antiplatelet agent at any time. The lack of a clear recommendation is not surprising, despite multiple recent randomized controlled trials 2, 3, 4, 5 evaluating differing durations of extended DAPT given several evolving factors and the overall risk/benefits of DAPT.

Guidelines commenting on DAPT duration have largely included trials using clopidogrel and early‐generation stents. The advent of more potent P2Y₁₂ inhibitors, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, has reduced major adverse cardiovascular events, but at the cost of increased bleeding. 6, 7 On the other hand, the newer‐generation DESs, with their thinner stent struts, a more biocompatible polymer, and favorable drug‐eluting characteristics, have considerably decreased the risk of stent thrombosis, particularly late stent thrombosis. 8 Although extended DAPT duration has been associated with reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death, there are statistically significant increases in major bleeding events. 2, 5 With the increased recognition of bleeding events and advancements in DES technology, it has been hypothesized that shorter durations of DAPT may be more appropriate. The European and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines have already reduced the minimum absolutely required duration of DAPT by incorporating short DAPT into their recommendations. 1, 9 However, the question about the value of extended DAPT duration in selected patients still remains to be answered.

### Benefits and risks of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: a systematic review for the 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack [^117DMN9q]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention — short-duration dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) vs single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with early initiation: In 3 trials with early initiation (< 1 week) and short-term treatment duration (< 90 days), DAPT was superior to SAPT for prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke, any recurrent stroke, and MACE in people with minor stroke or high-risk TIA who were at low risk of bleeding; however, a meta-analysis of 2 trials found a pooled increase in risk of 88% for major bleeding with DAPT compared to SAPT, with a wide confidence interval from a reduction of 7% to an increase of 283%. Trial-specific bleeding results included increased major bleeding with DAPT in POINT (RR, 2.32 [95% CI, 1.10–4.86]) whereas CHANCE did not (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.25–4.00]); CHANCE classified very few bleeding events as severe, 4 in each arm, despite 20 ICH in the DAPT and 16 ICH in the SAPT groups. Thus, use of DAPT in the early setting after high-risk TIA or minor ischemic stroke should take into consideration the potential for an increased risk of bleeding.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy: a systematic review for the 2016 ACC / AHA guideline focused update on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^117W3quE]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Results for DAPT duration after newer-generation DES — the evidence was obtained from 11 RCTs enrolling a total of 33051 patients who underwent implantation of predominantly newer-generation DES, and all 11 RCTs were judged to be of moderate to high quality with at least moderate relevance, fidelity, and freedom from bias.

### Combining antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies [^1153MYZ5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is the cornerstone for both primary and secondary prevention therapies for ischemic events resulting from coronary atherosclerotic disease. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus a thienopyridine, usually clopidogrel) has assumed a central role in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and after coronary stent deployment. In addition to antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulant therapy might be indicated for stroke prevention in a variety of conditions that include atrial fibrillation, profound left ventricular dysfunction, and after mechanical prosthetic heart valve replacement. For this reason, the use of triple antithrombotic therapy (a dual antiplatelet regimen plus warfarin) is expected to become more prominent, given an aging patient population. But although triple therapy can prevent both thromboembolism and stent thrombosis, it is also associated with significant bleeding hazards. Furthermore, when bleeding events do occur, the challenge of balancing the risk of stent thrombosis or stroke and the need for hemostasis requires considerable expertise. It is both prudent and timely to review treatment strategies that employ combinations of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies as well as strategies aimed at reducing bleeding risk in patients treated with these therapies.

### Longer-versus shorter-duration dual-antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent placement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115NTgvJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The appropriate duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after drug-eluting stent (DES) placement remains controversial.

Purpose

To summarize data on clinical outcomes with longer- versus shorter-duration DAPT after DES placement in adults with coronary artery disease.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE, 1996 to 27 March 2015, and manual screening of references.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials comparing longer- versus shorter-duration DAPT after DES placement.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers screened potentially eligible articles; extracted data on populations, interventions, and outcomes; assessed risk of bias; and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines to rate overall confidence in effect estimates.

Data Synthesis

Among 1010 articles identified, 9 trials including 29,531 patients were eligible; data were complete for 28,808 patients. Moderate-quality evidence showed that longer-duration DAPT decreased risk for myocardial infarction (risk ratio [RR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.58 to 0.92]) and increased mortality (RR, 1.19 [CI, 1.04 to 1.36]). High-quality evidence showed that DAPT increased risk for major bleeding (RR, 1.63 [CI, 1.34 to 1.99]).

Limitation

Confidence in estimates were decreased owing to imprecision for most outcomes (particularly myocardial infarction), risk of bias from limited blinding in 7 of 9 studies, indirectness due to variability in use of first- and second-generation stents, and off-protocol use of DAPT in some studies.

Conclusion

Extended DAPT is associated with approximately 8 fewer myocardial infarctions per 1000 treated patients per year but 6 more major bleeding events than shorter-duration DAPT. Because absolute effects are very small and closely balanced, decisions regarding the duration of DAPT therapy must take into account patients' values and preference.

Primary Funding Source

### More, more, more: reducing thrombosis in acute coronary syndromes beyond dual antiplatelet therapy-current data and future directions [^1143yAqV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Common to the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is the formation of arterial thrombus, which results from platelet activation and triggering of the coagulation cascade. 1 To attenuate the risk of future thrombotic events, patients with ACS are treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), namely, the combination of aspirin with a P2Y 12 inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel. Despite DAPT, some ≈10% of ACS patients experience recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events over the subsequent 30 days, 2 driving the quest for more effective inhibition of thrombotic pathways. In this review, we provide an overview of studies to date and those ongoing that aim to deliver more effective combinations of antithrombotic agents to patients with recent ACS. We have chosen to confine the review to ACS patients without atrial fibrillation because those with atrial fibrillation have a clear indication for combination therapy that includes oral anticoagulation and should, we feel, be treated as a separate cohort.

In this article, we discuss the limitations of the currently available clinical trial data and future directions, with suggestions for how practice might change to reduce the risk of coronary thrombosis in those at greatest risk, with minimal impact on bleeding.

### Does prior use of antiplatelet therapy modify the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy in transient ischaemic attack / minor ischaemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117NbBAb]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and purpose

The purpose was to determine whether prior use of antiplatelet therapy modifies the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute minor ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

Methods

A systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed comparing dual antiplatelet therapy to aspirin that reported subgroup analysis by prior antiplatelet use, adhering to the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines. A fixed‐effects meta‐analysis was used to estimate a pooled treatment effect overall in subgroups with prior aspirin therapy and without prior aspirin therapy. Difference in treatment effect was assessed by testing p for interaction. The primary outcome measure was recurrent vascular events.

Results

Three eligible randomized controlled trials were identified, including 4831 participants with pre‐existing antiplatelet use and 16,236 participants without pre‐existing aspirin use. Recurrent vascular events occurred in 7.2% (95% confidence interval [4.3–10) of those without pre‐existing aspirin use versus 7.3% (95%4.1–10) of those receiving prior aspirin therapy. Effect of dual antiplatelet therapy on the primary outcome measure was consistent in participants with no prior aspirin use (odds ratio 0.75, 95%0.66–0.84) compared to those taking aspirin before randomization (odds ratio 0.79, 95%0.63–0.998) (p interaction = 0.66). The number needed to treat in the aspirin‐naïve group was 55 (95% CI 37‐107) compared to 66 (95%32 to –746) in those on prior aspirin therapy.

Conclusions

It was found that the effectiveness of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack does not significantly differ in patients with prior aspirin exposure; therefore there should be no influence on the decision to use dual antiplatelet therapy.

### P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy or dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary revascularisation: individual patient level meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117CgoUs]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis to answer the following PICOS question: in patients who have undergone percutaneous or surgical revascularisation for stable or unstable coronary artery disease, is P2Y₁₂ inhibitor monotherapy at least similarly effective for a composite of fatal and cardiovascular ischaemic endpoints and, if so, safer for bleeding endpoints, compared with DAPT among randomised trials that reported centrally adjudicated outcome data?

We excluded trials including patients with a concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation under the rationale that concomitant oral anticoagulation further increases the risk of bleeding and mitigates the risk of ischaemic recurrences after aspirin withdrawal, and long term DAPT is no longer considered a valid standard of care in this setting. We implemented no further restrictions for study selection, such as the number of participants or duration of follow-up. Methods and reporting follow the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Individual Participant Data (PRISMA-IPD). The study protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (international prospective register of systematic reviews) and is available online (, CRD42020176853).

Search strategy

Two investigators (MV, FG) determined trial eligibility criteria; a third investigator (RM) was involved in case of disagreement. Randomised trials were identified by a search in Ovid Medline, Embase, and three websites. Reference lists of retrieved articles were hand searched. We imposed no language restrictions. The search strategy is provided in the appendix.

Outcome measures

The pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of all cause death, myocardial infarction, and stroke throughout the duration of the randomised comparison of protocol mandated P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy versus DAPT. The key safety endpoint was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 3 or type 5 bleeding. Other secondary endpoints are shown in the appendix. The outcome definitions were largely consistent among the included trials (supplementary methods).

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion — randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration found that 5 RCTs comparing 12 months of DAPT with 3 to 6 months after predominantly newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) showed no significant differences in death, major hemorrhage, MI, stent thrombosis, and the primary study endpoints; 6 RCTs comparing 18 to 48 months of DAPT with 6 to 12 months found reductions in MI and stent thrombosis, no difference in MACE, an increase in major hemorrhage, and no change in death in the primary analyses, with secondary analyses showing weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT in RCTs that successfully achieved enrollment targets, and in patients more than 1 to 3 years after MI there was a significant reduction in MACE but an increase in major hemorrhage.

### Does prior use of antiplatelet therapy modify the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy in transient ischaemic attack / minor ischaemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115SbTu3]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for acute management of non‐cardioembolic minor ischaemic stroke and high risk transient ischaemic attack (TIA) within 24 h and at least within 7 days from symptom onset, on the basis of clinical trials and meta‐analyses that have demonstrated a lower rate of subsequent stroke compared with single antiplatelet therapy. A number of clinical factors have been shown to influence effectiveness, including time from symptom onset to initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy. In clinical practice, 26.9% of patients presenting with TIA and ischaemic stroke are already receiving an antiplatelet agent. It is uncertain whether prior use of antiplatelet therapy modifies the efficacy and safety of dual antiplatelet therapy in these patients and therefore whether it should be engaged in clinical decision‐making.

The aim of this meta‐analysis was to determine whether prior use of antiplatelet therapy modifies the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute minor ischaemic stroke or TIA.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Current perspectives on DAPT after implantation of newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) emphasize shorter durations and individualized decisions, with editorials stating that "Courses of clopidogrel exceeding 12 months do not contribute favorably to patient outcomes and may in fact be detrimental", that "DAPT may not be necessary beyond the initial 6 months, at least in low-risk patients", and that "With newer-generation DES, 6 months DAPT might be sufficient, and 3 months not completely off the wall in low-risk groups". Additional commentaries concluded that "Shorter DAPT duration seems very reasonable to consider", that "The safest and most effective duration of dual antiplatelet therapy therefore remains uncertain and must be individualized", and that "The net clinical benefit of 30 months over 12 months DAPT overall seems marginal". For PEGASUS, a critique reported ticagrelor was associated with an absolute benefit of 1.1 percentage points (90-mg) and 1.27 percentage points (60-mg) in the primary end points, with absolute increases of 1.54 and 1.24 percentage points for clinically significant bleeding and 1.71 and 1.37 percentage points for transfusion; treating 10000 patients for 1 year with the 60-mg dose would prevent approximately 42 primary end points and produce approximately 31 TIMI major bleeding events, noted as "close to an even proposition" and a reminder of "the fragile balance between efficacy and adverse events".

### Critical appraisal of guidelines for coronary artery disease on dual antiplatelet therapy: more consensus than controversies [^113MiXRS]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in the form of aspirin plus a P 2 Y 12 inhibitor, when indicated, is one of the key treatments in coronary artery disease (CAD). Many recommendations on DAPT in patients with CAD based on current guidelines are largely inconsistent. In our current study, we aimed at systematically reviewing DAPT-relevant clinical practice guidelines, and highlighting their commonalities and differences for better informed decision-making.

Methods

Contemporary guidelines in English were searched in MEDLINE, Embase and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies. Guidelines with recommendations on DAPT for CAD patients were included. Guideline quality was appraised with the 6-domain Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. The reporting of conflicts of interest (COI) was assessed individually with supplementary items from the RIGHT (Reporting Item for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare) checklist. Meanwhile, extraction of recommendations was performed.

Results

A total of 18 guidelines fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Most of them were graded with relatively good scores averaging from 42% to 74%. Domains for lower scores were in "stakeholder involvement" and "application". The reporting of COI was satisfactory. For the recommendations on DAPT, most guidelines with high AGREE II scores included consistent recommendations on the timing and P 2 Y 12 inhibitor selection. Nonetheless, conflicts still exist on the duration of DAPT.

Conclusions

Quality of guidelines for DAPT in CAD was relatively high, though defects existed in "Applicability" and "Stakeholder Involvement". As these guidelines developed, DAPT recommendations gradually converged on a consensus. Clinical decision should be made on an individual basis.

Meaning of the study

The evidence summarised in our review has important implications for the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy. The CHANCE trial continued dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 days; the other trials for 90 days. The incidence curves from both CHANCE and POINT are striking in that they show that most stroke events occurred in the first seven days. Furthermore, separation of the incidence curves in the treatment and control groups happened within the first 10 days, with the curves thereafter essentially parallel (fig 3, table 3).

The failure of dual antiplatelet therapy to provide benefit beyond the first three weeks after treatment initiation is generally consistent with results from other studies examining the commencement of dual antiplatelet therapy substantially later than the first three days. These include the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) study, a randomised multicentre trial involving 3020 patients who failed to find a benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy but did show an increase in adverse events.

Conclusion

Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin given within 24 hours after high risk TIA or minor ischaemic stroke reduces the risk of subsequent stroke by about 2%, with few serious adverse consequences. Discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy as early as 10 days, and no later than 21 days, after initiation is likely to maximise its net benefit.

These data provide direct evidence on the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin for patients who have experienced high risk TIA or minor ischaemic stroke. The findings of this research paper raise questions about how the dual antiplatelet therapy should be used in clinical practice. In the linked article readers will find recommendations on the use of dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin for patients with high risk TIA or minor ischaemic stroke based on data from this paper. To do this a guideline panel has considered how direct this evidence is and using GRADE methodology has integrated this with for example the values and preferences of patients and resource implications. To read more about the guidelines please see the guideline article in this package.

### Use of antiplatelet therapy / DAPT for Post-PCI patients undergoing noncardiac surgery [^112fmPAR]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is prescribed to millions of patients worldwide following coronary stenting. DAPT is indicated to lower the risk of ischemic events, such as myocardial infarction, including stent thrombosis, ischemic stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. A significant number of these patients undergo noncardiac surgery and may require DAPT interruption. This poses a significant clinical dilemma because DAPT interruption exposes patients to the potential risk of stent thrombosis, perioperative myocardial infarction, or both. Conversely, continuing DAPT may be associated with excess bleeding complications. Observational data in this area are conflicting, and there are no randomized clinical trials to guide practitioner decision making. On the basis of predominantly consensus recommendations, various strategies for managing DAPT during the perioperative period have been proposed. This review presents 3 commonly encountered clinical scenarios that lead into an evidence-based discussion of practical strategies for managing perioperative antiplatelet therapy in patients following percutaneous coronary intervention.

### Benefits and risks of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: a systematic review for the 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack [^111aFRww]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack may reduce recurrent stroke but also increase severe bleeding compared with single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT). The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association convened an evidence review committee to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and risks of DAPT compared with SAPT for secondary ischemic stroke prevention.

Methods

The Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched on December 5, 2019, to identify phase III or IV randomized controlled trials (n ≥ 100) from December 1999 to December 2019. We calculated unadjusted relative risks (RRs) and performed meta-analyses of studies based on the duration of treatment (short [≤ 90 days] versus long [> 90 days]).

Results

Three short-duration randomized controlled trials were identified that enrolled mostly patients with minor stroke or high risk transient ischemic attack. In these trials, DAPT, compared with SAPT, was associated with a lower 90-day risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.55–0.83], I² = 37.1%). There was no significant increase in major bleeding with DAPT in short-duration trials (pooled RR, 1.88 [95% CI, 0.93–3.83], I² = 8.9%). In 2 long-duration treatment randomized controlled trials (mean treatment duration, 18–40 months), DAPT was not associated with a significant reduction in recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.79–1.02], I² = 1.4%), but was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding (pooled RR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.37–4.30], I² = 75.5%).

Conclusions

DAPT was more effective than SAPT for prevention of secondary ischemic stroke when initiated early after the onset of minor stroke/high-risk transient ischemic attack and treatment duration was < 90 days. However, when the treatment duration was longer and initiated later after stroke or transient ischemic attack onset, DAPT was not more effective than SAPT for ischemic stroke prevention and it increased the risk of bleeding.

### One-year outcomes of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^113ec3SA]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor is the cornerstone of medical therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). DAPT reduces recurrent ischemic events, most notably in‐stent thrombosis, the risks of which are markedly elevated following PCI. With appropriate treatment, the risk of ischemic events generally decreases over the 1−3 months after intervention, whereas the risk of bleeding persists and is proportional to the intensity and duration of treatment. The reductions of these ischemic events like, stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction, must be weighed against the increased bleeding risks associated with these DAPT, as both recurrent ischemia and bleeding are associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Weighing these risks, both US and European guidelines currently recommend 6‐ and 12‐month durations of DAPT following PCI with drug‐eluting stents (DES) for stable coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), respectively, in patients without high bleeding risk, followed by single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) indefinitely.

The risk‐benefit equation of DAPT after PCI has evolved, however, with the development of new medical and interventional therapies, like more potent P2Y12 inhibitors and newer generation DES. Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have brought into question the appropriate duration of DAPT following PCI and suggest it may be shorter than current recommendations. Despite these trials, multiple questions remain unclear, such as the optimal duration of DAPT after PCI, the choice of agent in SAPT, and which specific populations may benefit most from shorter durations of DAPT. To answer these questions, we conducted a meta‐analysis of RCTs examining a shorter duration of DAPT.

### Identifying the "optimal" duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent revascularization [^115R1v34]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Uncertainty regarding the appropriate duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a thienopyridine challenges every clinician involved in the care of patients considered for or treated with drug-eluting stents (DES). Despite guideline recommendations for extended (≥ 12 months) DAPT following percutaneous coronary revascularization with DES, few data are available to guide clinical decision-making beyond consensus opinion. Yet considering the clinical implications of stent thrombosis (ST) and its unpredictability in late occurring events, comprehensive assessment of the relationship between DAPT duration and ST over the long-term is a focus for DES-related clinical trials and an essential public health measure. Despite the potential for prolonged DAPT to reduce late-term cardiovascular events related to the progression of atherosclerosis, few studies have formally examined the safety and efficacy of extended DAPT and its impact on late ST events. The purpose of this paper is to appraise the existing evidence regarding the relationship between long-term DAPT and late cardiovascular events; address outstanding (and unstudied) dilemmas related to DAPT in DES-treated patients; and propose considerations for both trial design and clinical practice.

Dual antiplatelet therapy duration and prevention of stent thrombosis

Key to the prevention of ST is the prescription of an appropriate duration of DAPT after PCI. Randomized clinical trials in the 1990s demonstrated conclusively that DAPT was superior to anti-coagulation for the prevention of complications after bare metal stenting. Early randomized clinical trials with DES implantation included a recommendation for 3–6 months of DAPT after PCI, though concerns soon emerged about a possible increase in late ST after DES implantation. Two important consequences of these were that (i) guideline authorities recommended — on the basis of expert opinion — a more prolonged duration of DAPT of typically at least 12 months and (ii) a number of large-scale clinical trials were initiated to define more precisely the optimal duration of DAPT after DES implantation (see Table 2). Data from all of these studies have now been reported permitting reappraisal of recommendations relating to DAPT duration. –

Background and Purpose

The purpose was to determine whether prior use of antiplatelet therapy modifies the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute minor ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed comparing dual antiplatelet therapy to aspirin that reported subgroup analysis by prior antiplatelet use, adhering to the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate a pooled treatment effect overall in subgroups with prior aspirin therapy and without prior aspirin therapy. Difference in treatment effect was assessed by testing p for interaction. The primary outcome measure was recurrent vascular events.

Results

Three eligible randomized controlled trials were identified, including 4831 participants with pre-existing antiplatelet use and 16,236 participants without pre-existing aspirin use. Recurrent vascular events occurred in 7.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.3–10) of those without pre-existing aspirin use versus 7.3% (95% CI 4.1–10) of those receiving prior aspirin therapy. Effect of dual antiplatelet therapy on the primary outcome measure was consistent in participants with no prior aspirin use (odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.66–0.84) compared to those taking aspirin before randomization (odds ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.63–0.998) (p interaction = 0.66). The number needed to treat in the aspirin-naïve group was 55 (95% CI 37–107) compared to 66 (95% CI 32 to -746) in those on prior aspirin therapy.

Conclusions

It was found that the effectiveness of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack does not significantly differ in patients with prior aspirin exposure; therefore there should be no influence on the decision to use dual antiplatelet therapy.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the analyses — Heterogeneity in bleeding definitions and lack of individual-level data for a common definition (e.g. TIMI major or minor) may limit interpretation; RCTs in DES recipients generally enrolled low-risk patients with 8 of 11 trials reporting lower than expected event rates, resulting in imprecise MI and bleeding estimates with wide confidence intervals; although follow-up rates were 92% to 95%, these must be considered alongside bleeding and mortality rates of 1% to 4% over the trials.

Should I stop antiplatelet therapy when my patients start their anticoagulant?

The full answer depends on the indication for the antiplatelet therapy. If the patient is on antiplatelet treatment for a cardiac indication, then you should consider discussing ongoing antiplatelet therapy with a cardiologist. Around 5–15% of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) will have concurrent indications for anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy (as a result of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Many trials have investigated the best antithrombotic regimens that balance the risk of major bleeding events with that of ischaemic events in these patients. Overall, dual therapy — ideally with a DOAC and clopidogrel — achieves better outcomes than triple therapy. However, there is some evidence to suggest that up to 1 week of initial triple therapy (including aspirin) would benefit some patients with post-ACS/PCI AF, particularly those at increased risk of ischaemic events. However, early cessation of aspirin is recommended if the risk of stent thrombosis is low or lower than the bleeding risk. Regardless of whether patients are initially treated with dual or triple therapy, it is not recommended to discontinue antiplatelet therapy for 6–12 months following ACS. However, antiplatelet therapy may be discontinued in patients with stable coronary disease 12 months postintervention. It is recommended that most patients are transitioned to oral anticoagulation monotherapy after 6 (ACS) or 12 (chronic coronary syndrome) months of dual therapy.

Follow-up

What information is of relevance to first-degree relatives?

First-degree relatives of patients experiencing a PE with no provoking factors should be considered to be at increased risk of VTE, particularly when exposed to VTE risk factors. Physicians may recommend that family members using the combined contraceptive pill consider switching to progesterone-only treatments if the index case PE occurred in a first-degree relative below the age of 45.

### Oral dual antiplatelet therapy: what have we learnt from recent trials? [^111nHAYx]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

International guidelines recommend the use of aspirin treatment immediately and indefinitely in coronary patients. The optimal time to start and the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) have not been clearly established. Recent clinical trials have provided important new information allowing for evidence-based decisions regarding timing of initiation and duration of DAPT. The benefit-to-risk ratio of DAPT pre-treatment appears to depend on the type of acute coronary syndrome, the time until angiography, and the onset of action of the drug. In stable patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with the latest generation drug-eluting stents, patients should be treated for at least ∼6 months. Shorter courses of therapy may be necessary when special conditions occur (e.g. surgery; oral anticoagulation). Longer courses of therapy may be reasonable in patients at low bleeding risk who are tolerating DAPT well. For patients with ACS, prolonged DAPT is beneficial and therefore reasonable as long as the patient is tolerating the therapy. Individualized management of DAPT must be seen as a dynamic prescription with regular re-evaluations of the risk-benefit to the patient according to changes in his/her clinical profile.

### Does prior use of antiplatelet therapy modify the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy in transient ischaemic attack / minor ischaemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111FJRdH]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this systematic review and meta‐analysis, which included three trials with 21,067 participants, no evidence was found of statistically significant differences in the association of dual antiplatelet therapy with recurrent vascular events between patients with and without prior antiplatelet therapy.

Over a quarter of patients who present with an acute stroke or TIA are prescribed one or more antiplatelet agents prior to the event; however, the relative efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy compared to single antiplatelet therapy in this population has not been evaluated in prior meta‐analyses. There is considerable variability in antiplatelet prescribing patterns for those who present with an ischaemic stroke whilst on aspirin therapy. Our findings extend those of Anadani et al. which reported dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with similar risk reduction of ischaemic stroke regardless of premorbid antiplatelet use in a post hoc analysis of the POINT trial. Current evidence supports the use of dual antiplatelet therapy over single antiplatelet therapy in the setting of high risk TIA or mild–moderate ischaemic stroke. Four randomized trials show a reduced risk of subsequent stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events and recurrent ischaemic events with dual antiplatelet therapy compared to aspirin therapy. The results of these trials have supported recommendations for early treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy in the standard care of patients with minor stroke or TIA. Our review supports the use of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with minor stroke or TIA regardless of prior antiplatelet use.

Limitations of our study

Our meta‐analysis has a number of limitations. It included a small number of trials. These studies enrolled patients with minor strokes or high risk TIAs, which may limit generalizability to those with moderate to severe strokes or lower risk TIAs.

There were a number of differences between trials, including variations in follow‐up, categorization of previous aspirin therapy and primary outcome measures, as detailed below. In contrast to POINT and THALES, the subgroup analyses in CHANCE specified 'aspirin taken within 24 h' rather than any previous aspirin therapy which may limit the results of this study. In CHANCE, the primary outcome was new ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke event at 90 days. As the secondary trial outcome of a composite of ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death was more similar to the primary outcomes of the other included trials, this was used for the purpose of our analysis.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for stented patients: an update for the clinician [^111FkS5w]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Determining the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following percutaneous coronary intervention is a complex decision. Randomized controlled trials have shown that while shorter durations of DAPT may lower the risk of bleeding, longer durations of DAPT can reduce the risk of late stent thrombosis and ischemia-related events. In this review article, we will discuss the current guidelines, review contemporary trial data that have evaluated short and extended durations of DAPT, and address common clinical questions. Ultimately, the determination of the optimal duration of DAPT is an individualized decision that requires clinicians to assess each patient's risk for bleeding and recurrent ischemic events.

### Use of the dual-antiplatelet therapy score to guide treatment duration after percutaneous coronary intervention [^117Ju6FG]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Dual Antiplatelet Therapy score (DAPT score)" for coronary artery disease, ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

The Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Score, or DAPT Score, is a clinical calculator used in the management of patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting. This scoring system is used to weigh the risks and benefits of continuing dual antiplatelet therapy beyond 12 months after stent placement.

The DAPT Score takes into account various patient and procedural factors such as age, history of diabetes, prior myocardial infarction, stent diameter, and congestive heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 30%, among others. A higher score indicates a greater potential benefit from extended dual antiplatelet therapy, while a lower score suggests that the risks (such as bleeding complications) may outweigh the benefits.

This calculator is not applicable to patients who have not undergone PCI with stenting, or those who have contraindications to prolonged antiplatelet therapy, such as a high risk of bleeding or a history of hemorrhagic stroke.

The Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) score calculator helps determine whether a patient should continue prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy by assessing various clinical factors. This process involves several steps to collect inputs from the patient and compute the score.

First, gather information about the patient:

- Age (categorized as either 75 years or older, between 65 and 74 years, or under 65 years)
- Presence of diabetes mellitus
- Current smoking status
- History of prior percutaneous coronary intervention or myocardial infarction
- History of congestive heart failure or a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%
- If they experienced an acute myocardial infarction at presentation
- Past procedures involving percutaneous coronary intervention or vein graft stenting
- Implantation of a paclitaxel-eluting stent
- Stent diameter being less than 3 mm

These factors are then scored as follows:

| **Parameter** | **Score** |
|-|-|
| Age, years ≥ 75 | 2 |
| Age, years 65–74 | 1 |
| Age, years < 65 | 0 |
| Diabetes mellitus (Yes) | 1 |
| Diabetes mellitus (No) | 0 |
| Current smoker (Yes) | 1 |
| Current smoker (No) | 0 |
| Prior percutaneous coronary intervention or myocardial infarction (Yes) | 1 |
| Prior percutaneous coronary intervention or myocardial infarction (No) | 0 |
| History of congestive heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction < 30% (Yes) | 2 |
| History of congestive heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction < 30% (No) | 0 |
| Acute myocardial infarction at presentation (Yes) | 1 |
| Acute myocardial infarction at presentation (No) | 0 |
| Percutaneous coronary intervention or vein graft stent (Yes) | 2 |
| Percutaneous coronary intervention or vein graft stent (No) | 0 |
| Implantation of paclitaxel-eluting stent (Yes) | 1 |
| Implantation of paclitaxel-eluting stent (No) | 0 |
| Stent diameter < 3 mm (Yes) | 1 |
| Stent diameter < 3 mm (No) | 0 |

The final DAPT score is calculated by summing the scores corresponding to the patient's characteristics.

Interpretation of the total DAPT score guides the clinical decision regarding therapy duration:

- A score of 0 or 1 suggests the bleeding risks are greater than the ischemic benefits, indicating that extended dual antiplatelet therapy should be avoided.
- A score of 2 or more implies that ischemic benefits outweigh bleeding risks, which may favor consideration for prolonged therapy.

This result, comprising the overall score and its interpretation, aids physicians in crafting a treatment plan tailored to the patient's needs.

### Benefits and risks of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: a systematic review for the 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack [^113pVt5V]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

AHA/ASA systematic review — dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) for secondary ischemic stroke prevention found in short-duration treatment (≤ 90 days) among trials enrolling mostly patients with minor stroke or high risk transient ischemic attack that DAPT, compared with SAPT, was associated with a lower 90-day risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.55–0.83], I2 = 37.0%) without a significant increase in major bleeding (pooled RR, 1.88 [95% CI, 0.93–3.83], I2 = 8.9%). In long-duration trials (> 90 days; mean treatment duration, 18–40 months), DAPT was not associated with a significant reduction in recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.79–1.02], I2 = 1.4%) but was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding (pooled RR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.37–4.30], I2 = 75.5%). The authors conclude that DAPT was more effective than SAPT when initiated early after the onset of minor stroke/high-risk transient ischemic attack with treatment duration < 90 days, whereas when treatment was initiated later and lasted longer DAPT was not more effective than SAPT and increased the risk of bleeding.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111k3qxU]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), with aspirin and a P2Y₁₂ receptor inhibitor, is a basis for the care of patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The recommended duration of DAPT for patients after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation is ≥ 12 months for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and six months for patients with stable coronary artery disease. Despite these recommendations, the optimal timing of switching from DAPT to a single antiplatelet therapy continues to be a matter of debate, owing to refinements in DES technologies and the advent of potent P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors.

The recommendation for ≥ 12 months of DAPT after PCI with DES has received scrutiny by several randomised controlled trials, which proved non-superiority compared with three to six months of DAPT. Furthermore, shorter durations, as opposed to longer durations of DAPT, were associated with lower rates of all cause mortality as a result of lower rates of bleeding-related deaths. Nevertheless, the wide non-inferiority margins of up to six months of DAPT from single randomised controlled trials have prevented researchers from concluding that short term DAPT could replace the conventional standard duration. Additionally, a recent individual patient data meta-analysis of six randomised controlled trials suggested that three months of DAPT was associated with an increased risk of ischemia in patients with ACS.

Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of reduced health globally, as well as in each world region. A cost effectiveness analysis of different durations of DAPT after PCI with DES showed that three to six months of DAPT was better than ≥ 12 months of DAPT. Moreover, DAPT disruption owing to non-compliance or bleeding, which is more frequent with longer durations of DAPT, increases the risk of adverse events. Thus, shortening the recommended duration of DAPT might relieve the global health burden. However, previous studies have focused on comparing two arms representing longer or shorter durations of DAPT when investigating the efficacy and safety of the discontinuation of DAPT after PCI with DES. Without more quantified criteria for various durations, it would be unlikely to make a strong inference regarding rationality of up to six months of DAPT based on the current evidence. Additionally, the limited head-to-head trials might weaken the conclusiveness of pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis results with small sample sizes or unsuitable arms.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation — ARCTIC Interruption and noninferiority randomized trials — ARCTIC Interruption "was designed to show the superiority of 18 months of DAPT over 12 months of DAPT", and "the primary endpoint occurred in 24 (4%) patients in the group treated with 18 months of DAPT and in 27 (4%) patients in the group treated with 12 months of DAPT". "Several trials used a noninferiority design to study DAPT duration, and all met their predefined hypotheses". In OPTIMIZE, events "occurred in 90 patients receiving 12 months of DAPT and 93 patients receiving 3 months of DAPT (5.8% versus 6.0%; risk difference: 0.17; 95% CI: 1.52 to 1.86), a finding that the trial met noninferiority hypothesis (P = 0.002)". In SECURITY, enrollment "was stopped after enrollment of 1399 of 2140 planned patients", with the primary endpoint "3.7% in patients treated with 12 months of DAPT and 4.5% in patients treated with 6 months of DAPT (risk difference: 0.8%; 95% CI: −2.4% to 1.7%)", and "the trial appeared to meet its noninferiority hypothesis". In ITALIC, the study "was stopped early after 2031 of 2475 planned patients were enrolled" and showed "small differences in the primary endpoint between the 2 groups (risk difference: 0.11%; 95% CI: −1.04% to 1.26%)", and "the trial also appeared to meet its noninferiority hypothesis". In ISAR-SAFE, the trial "was stopped early after enrolling 4050 of 6000 planned patients" with "lower event rates than planned in 4000 evaluable patients (observed 1.5% versus expected 10.0%), the trial appeared to meet its noninferiority hypothesis". The DAPT trial "was the largest RCT and randomly assigned 9961 patients to receive 30 months of DAPT or 12 months of DAPT", and "Prolonged DAPT reduced the rate of stent thrombosis".

### Outcomes associated with clopidogrel-aspirin use in minor stroke… [^111e7gne]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

The numbers indicate difference of major ischemic events and major hemorrhage between the group receiving aspirin alone and the group receiving clopidogrel-aspirin. Question What is the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Findings. In this pooled analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials, early and short-term clopidogrel-aspirin treatment was associated with a reduction in the risk of major ischemic events without increasing the risk of major hemorrhage in patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack. The main net clinical benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy occurred within the first 21 days. Meaning This analysis suggests that, in patients with acute minor stroke or transient ischemic attack, dual antiplatelet therapy should be initiated as soon as possible, but preferably within 24 hours after symptom onset, and continued for a duration of 21 days.

Importance Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin is effective for secondary prevention after minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Uncertainties remained about the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for minor stroke or TIA. Objective To obtain precise estimates of efficacy and risk of dual antiplatelet therapy after minor ischemic stroke or TIA. Design, Setting, and Participants. Conclusions and Relevance In this analysis of the POINT and CHANCE trials, the benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy appeared to be confined to the first 21 days after minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA. Disabling Cerebrovascular Events trial. 1 The efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy was further validated in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand in the Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke trial.

2 However, an increase in major hemorrhage observed in the POINT trial led to concerns about bleeding risks in dual antiplatelet therapy. 3 Uncertainties remained about the risks and benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy and the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for minor stroke or TIA. To account for the different duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in the 2 trials, separate analyses for the primary efficacy and safety outcomes were performed for 0 to 21 days and 22 to 90 days. We also calculated the net clinical benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy for the total time frame of the trials and 0 to 21 days and 22 to 90 days.

The number of major hemorrhage events attributable to dual antiplatelet therapy was subtracted from the number of major ischemic events prevented by dual antiplatelet therapy with weights of 0. 5 to

1. **2**: net benefit = − major hemorrhage weight ×. Within the first 21 days after randomization, during which both trials prescribed clopidogrel-aspirin in the dual antiplatelet therapy arm, patients receiving clopidogrel-aspirin treatment had a lower rate of major ischemic events compared with those receiving aspirin alone treatment. The efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention in minor stroke and TIA was observed both in the CHANCE and POINT trials.

Prevention of early recurrent ischaemic stroke remains a priority in people with TIA or ischaemic stroke. A number of trials have recently been completed assessing the efficacy of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus single antiplatelet therapy early after minor or moderate stroke or high-risk TIA. We present an Expedited Recommendation for use of dual antiplatelet therapy early after ischaemic stroke and TIA on behalf of the ESO Guideline Board. We make a strong recommendation based on high quality of evidence for use of 21-days of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel in people with a non-cardioembolic minor ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA in the past 24hours. We make a weak recommendation based on moderate quality evidence for 30-days of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor in people with non-cardioembolic mild to moderate ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA in the past 24hours.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy De-escalation strategies [^111DfXSF]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), the combination of aspirin (ASA), and a P2Y 12 inhibitor, protects against stent thrombosis and new atherothrombotic events after a stent implantation or an acute coronary syndrome, but exposes patients to an increased risk of bleeding. In most current practices, the P2Y 12 inhibitor is stopped at 6 to 12 months and ASA is continued indefinitely. The advent of safer stents, with less risk of stent thrombosis, has challenged this standard of care, however. A number of alternative strategies involving earlier de-escalation of the antiplatelet therapy have therefore been proposed. In these approaches, standard DAPT is switched to a less potent antithrombotic combination at an earlier time-point than recommended by guidelines. Three different de-escalation variations have been tested to date. The first one maintains DAPT but switches from the potent P2Y 12 inhibitors ticagrelor or prasugrel to either a lower dose or to clopidogrel, while maintaining ASA. The 2 other approaches involve changing DAPT to a single antiplatelet at some earlier time-point after the percutaneous coronary intervention procedure, by stopping either the P2Y 12 inhibitor or ASA. These strategies have all demonstrated some benefit in clinical trials so far, but especially the contribution of ASA in secondary prevention is clearly evolving as its role in increasing bleeding complications while not providing increased ischemic benefit is becoming more and more clear. In contemporary practice, the type and duration of DAPT should now be based on an individualized decision, and the de-escalation strategies, if used wisely, can be added to the existing options.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^112jKQVu]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) combining aspirin and a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor has been consistently shown to reduce recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for stable coronary artery disease (CAD) compared with aspirin monotherapy, but at the expense of an increased risk of major bleeding. Nevertheless, the optimal duration of DAPT for secondary prevention of CAD remains uncertain, owing to the conflicting results of several large randomised trials. Among patients with stable CAD undergoing PCI with drug-eluting stents (DES), shorter durations of DAPT (3–6 months) were shown non-inferior to 12 or 24 months duration with respect to MACE, but reduced the rates of major bleeding. Contrariwise, prolonged DAPT durations (18–48 months) reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis, but at a cost of an increased risk of major bleeding and all-cause mortality. Until more evidence becomes available, the choice of optimal DAPT regimen and duration for patients with CAD requires a tailored approach based on the patient clinical presentation, baseline risk profile and management strategy. Future studies are however needed to identify patients who may derive benefit from shortened or extended DAPT courses for secondary prevention of CAD based on their individual ischaemic and bleeding risk. Based on limited evidence, 12 months duration of DAPT is currently recommended in patients with ACS irrespective of their management strategy, but large ongoing randomised trials are currently assessing the efficacy and safety of a short-term DAPT strategy (3–6 months) for patients with ACS undergoing PCI with newer generation DES. Finally, several ongoing, large-scale, randomised trials are challenging the current concept of DAPT by investigating P2Y₁₂ receptor inhibitors as single antiplatelet therapy and may potentially shift the paradigm of antiplatelet therapy after PCI in the near future. This article provides a contemporary state-of-the-art review of the current evidence on DAPT for secondary prevention of patients with CAD and its future perspectives.

### New oral anticoagulants in addition to single or dual antiplatelet therapy after an acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138MnKD]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Single or dual antiplatelet therapy was in this analysis based on treatment at randomization, but antiplatelet therapy was persistent throughout most of the observation periods for these studies including the phase III studies. Another limitation is the lack of separately evaluable results for the small proportions of patients on single antiplatelet treatment, i.e. 2, 5, and 7%, in REDEEM, RUBY-1, and ATLAS ACS 2–TIMI 51studies, respectively.

Conclusions

In patients with a recent ACS, the addition of a new oral anticoagulant to antiplatelet therapy leads to a modest reduction in cardiovascular events but a substantial increase in bleeding. These results are most pronounced when oral anticoagulants are combined with dual anti-platelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. No new oral anticoagulant has been evaluated in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and any of the more efficacious novel P2Y12 inhibitors ticagrelor or prasugrel, a combination which might expose the patients to even larger risks of major bleeding with even lower expectations for further reductions in ischaemic events. Further studies evaluating new oral anticoagulants in combination with effective single antiplatelet therapy or shorter duration of triple antithrombotic therapy are warranted.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Meta-analysis of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) among patients treated with PCI for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or MI found that extended DAPT decreased the risk of MACE (6.4% versus 7.5%; RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.90; P = 0.001) without an effect on all-cause death (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.03; P = 0.13), whereas a complementary analysis suggested weak evidence of increased mortality rate with prolonged DAPT in the cohort of patients without a prior history of ACS.

### An appraisal of dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin for prevention of cardiovascular events [^117QbVX5]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Combination antiplatelet therapy, typically with clopidogrel and aspirin, is commonly used for the prevention of cardiovascular events. When used for appropriate indications and duration, its benefits clearly outweigh its risks. However, it is not uncommon for the combination to be used outside of recommended indications or for longer than recommended durations. In these circumstances data are at best unclear and, at worst, indicative of harm. Furthermore, use for one of its indications-prevention of cardiac events after deployment of a coronary stent-is complicated by the type of stent used. This report reviews the evidence surrounding combination antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin, with an emphasis on identifying appropriate indications for and durations of therapy.

### Challenges of long-term dual antiplatelet therapy use following acute coronary syndromes [^1117Z6DN]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

An acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event is associated with a high risk of recurrent ACS, stroke, and death. To ameliorate the risk of subsequent events, current guidelines for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment elevation ACS recommend long-term management strategies for secondary prevention including risk factor modification and anti-ischemic and antiplatelet therapies. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), comprising aspirin plus a P2Y 12 inhibitor, is a critical component of secondary prevention therapy following ACS. However, despite the importance of DAPT for secondary prevention after ACS, questions remain over the optimal duration of therapy. Clinical evidence is emerging that maintenance DAPT > 12 months lowers the risk of recurrent ACS events; however, this benefit must be considered against any potential risks of prolonged DAPT such as bleeding. Several tools for bleeding risk assessment have shown promise; however, their limited accuracy and discriminative power necessitates further development. Assessment of patient ischemic risk should consider the complexity of the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure, anatomic burden of coronary artery disease, and additional underlying risk factors. Consequently, identifying patients in whom the risk:benefit ratio favors prolonged DAPT may prove invaluable for clinicians in deciding which patients should continue or stop taking DAPT at 12 months after PCI, or consider P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy as an option. This article reviews the most recent information about the risks and benefits of DAPT continued for > 12 months after ACS and provides critical guidance to assist physicians in identifying patients most likely to benefit from a secondary prevention strategy with DAPT.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after stent implantation — guideline recommendations and P2Y12 options: The 2011 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) guideline "recommended a minimum DAPT duration of at least 12 months after drug-eluting stents (DES) implantation, irrespective of clinical presentation". The duration "should generally be as follows": for patients receiving a stent during PCI for acute coronary syndrome, "P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be given for at least 12 months. Options include clopidogrel 75 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, and ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily. (Class I, Level of Evidence: B)". For DES placed for a non–acute coronary syndrome indication, "clopidogrel 75 mg daily should be given for at least 12 months if patients are not at high risk of bleeding. (Class I, Level of Evidence: B)".

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 30 days… [^113VEWp3]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What is the balance of benefits and harms for dual antiplatelet therapy compared with monotherapy for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Bottom Line For patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel for up to 30 days reduces the likelihood of subsequent stroke more than aspirin monotherapy, with a small increase in the risk of major hemorrhage. A longer duration of therapy increases the risk of harm without increasing the likelihood of benefit. Synopsis The authors identified randomized trials that compared dual antiplatelet therapy with monotherapy, started within three days of the index stroke or TIA.

In some cases, the researchers were able to get data for the subset of patients who were randomized within three days from studies in which longer intervals were allowed between stroke and randomization. The search was comprehensive, and the analysis was methodologically sound. The final analysis included 17 studies with a total of 27, 358 patients. The mean age of participants was 65 years, approximately two-thirds were men, and most studies targeted patients with minor ischemic stroke or TIA. The studies were assessed to be at low risk of bias. Monotherapy was aspirin in 15 studies and clopidogrel in two studies. The most common dual antiplatelet therapy regimen was aspirin plus clopidogrel. The largest study compared aspirin alone with aspirin plus ticagrelor; because of the size of the study, the authors performed sensitivity analyses with and without this trial.

Using dual antiplatelet therapy instead of monotherapy for 30 days or less resulted in 20 fewer strokes and two more major hemorrhages per 1, 000 patients. The likelihood of major hemorrhage was the same when the THALES trial was excluded, although there was no longer a significant difference in the risk of hemorrhage between the aspirin and dual antiplatelet therapy groups. The authors stratified the analysis by treatment of more than 30 days or 30 days or less. Although the benefit was similar for a treatment duration of up to 30 days, the risk of hemorrhage was greater with a longer duration of therapy.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA systematic review on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) and after myocardial infarction (MI) summarizes randomized evidence and tradeoffs. Evidence from 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling 33 051 patients found that use of DAPT for 12 months versus 3 to 6 months showed no significant differences in death, major hemorrhage, MI, or stent thrombosis with reported odds ratios and confidence intervals, and Bayesian models confirmed the primary analysis. For extended therapy, use of DAPT for 18 to 48 months versus 6 to 12 months yielded no difference in all-cause death but increased major hemorrhage, decreased MI, and decreased stent thrombosis; a risk-benefit analysis estimated 3 fewer stent thromboses (95% CI: 2 to 5) and 6 fewer MIs (95% CI: 2 to 11) but 5 more major bleeds (95% CI: 3 to 9) per 1000 patients per year. Post hoc analyses provided weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT. In patients with prior MI, use of DAPT > 1 year reduced the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (hazard ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.95) but increased major bleeding (hazard ratio: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.68 to 3.21). Conclusions state that prolonged DAPT after newer-generation DES entails a tradeoff between reductions in stent thrombosis and MI and increases in major hemorrhage, and in prior MI settings reduced cardiovascular events occurred at the expense of increased bleeding.

### Dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: how Short is too short? [^1179Lx5L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Dual‐antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients presenting with chronic coronary syndrome as well as acute coronary syndrome. However, optimal duration of DAPT is a matter of debate. On the one hand, ischemic risk, especially early after PCI, is high and should be reduced by DAPT. On the other hand, DAPT goes in line with an enhanced risk for bleeding events. Especially in patients with further comorbidities or at advanced age, bleeding risk is substantially increased. For a long time, reduction of ischemic events was the main aspect of DAPT. However, this changed substantially as bleeding is recognized as a relevant factor with impact on hard outcome end points, such as death. The relevance of bleeding is underlined by recent randomized controlled trials. In PEGASUS‐TIMI 54, for example, a DAPT regimen with ticagrelor led to no reduction of all‐cause death, although rate of myocardial infarction was reduced. In contrast, the COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies) trial revealed a reduction in death from any cause without a significant decrease of myocardial infarction. Preventing ischemic events, like myocardial infarction, is still the main purpose of DAPT. However, reduction of bleeding events, which also contribute to hard end points, like all‐cause death, is a major challenge for the upcoming years. Recent guidelines recommend DAPT for 12 months after acute coronary syndrome with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarctionand non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction. However, in patients presenting with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction, shorter duration of DAPT may be considered in patients with high or very high bleeding risk. After PCI in patients presenting with chronic coronary syndrome, DAPT duration of 6 months is recommended. However, shortening to at least 1 month or extension up to ≥ 12 months is also supported by the guidelines in dependence of ischemic and bleeding risk.

### Benefits and risks of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: a systematic review for the 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack [^116DNKSm]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Short-duration dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) meta-analysis — across three trials with a 90-day time point — found that compared with single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), DAPT reduced recurrent ischemic stroke by 90 days (pooled RR of 0.68 [95% CI, 0.55–0.83], I2 = 37.1%), reduced total recurrent stroke (pooled RR of 0.69 [95% CI, 0.56–0.85], I2 = 41.5%), and reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; pooled RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.64–0.92], I2 = 45.5%). There was no difference between antiplatelet regimens for intracerebral hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, vascular death, or major bleeding (pooled RR of 1.88 [95% CI, 0.93–3.83], I2 = 8.9%). Results were similar when excluding one high–risk-of-bias trial, and both retained trials enrolled within 12 to 24 hours of symptom onset.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with an acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^111NycSf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The recent American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) recommend DAPT for 1 year in patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome, with a Class IIb recommendation for continuation. We aim to assess the evidence for these recommendations using a meta-analytic approach.

Methods

We searched electronic databases for randomized trials comparing short-term (≤ 6 months) vs 12-month vs extended (> 12 months) DAPT in patients with an acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. We evaluated all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and major bleeding. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results

We included 8 trials comprising 12,917 patients with an acute coronary syndrome; 5 trials compared short-term vs 12-month/extended DAPT, whereas 3 trials compared 12-month vs extended DAPT. There was no significant difference in cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.04; 95% CI, 0.67–1.60), myocardial infarction (RR 1.08; 95% CI, 0.79–1.47), or major bleeding (RR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.49–1.69) between short-term and 12-month/extended DAPT. However, compared with extended DAPT, 12-month DAPT showed significantly higher risk of myocardial infarction (RR 2.00; 95% CI, 1.47–2.73), but reduced risk of major bleeding (RR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34–0.98). All-cause mortality was found to be similar between 12-month and extended DAPT.

Conclusions

In acute coronary syndrome, short-term DAPT may be reasonable for some patients, whereas extended DAPT may be appropriate in select others. An individualized approach is needed, taking into account the competing risks of bleeding and ischemic events.

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation: conceptual evolution based on emerging evidence [^114FS3Ku]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to review the contemporary literature on optimal dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. Relevant studies were searched through MEDLINE, the Cochrane database, and the EMBASE database. Of the 6852 publications retrieved, 23 were considered relevant, including 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 12 meta-analyses. Initially prescribed for 3–6 months after first-generation DES, the recommended duration of DAPT was subsequently prolonged to at least 1 year, a response to reports of late stent thrombosis after DAPT discontinuation. Seven RCTs subsequently suggested that 1-year DAPT may not be necessary after DES implantation, and that a 6-month or even a 3-month course of DAPT may be as effective and safer. In contrast, four RCTs examining the benefit of DAPT beyond 1 year reached conflicting conclusions. In the DAPT trial, 30-month compared with 12-month DAPT after DES resulted in reduced rates of stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiovascular events, but greater rates of major bleeding with increased non-cardiac mortality. Several meta-analyses have subsequently been performed collectively demonstrating increased rates of all-cause mortality with prolonged DAPT compared with shorter DAPT after DES, due to greater non-cardiovascular mortality with prolonged DAPT not offset by a concomitant reduction in cardiac mortality. The benefit-risk ratio of prolonged DAPT appears to be better in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) than in those without prior MI. On the basis of these findings, a personalized approach is advisable when deciding upon the optimal duration of DAPT after DES, wherein the individualized risks of ischaemic vs. bleeding events are carefully considered for each patient.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy duration: a review of current available evidence [^114BB244]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Multiple regimens of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy have been used in the past in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Later trials of PCI stenting demonstrated the efficacy of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in reducing stent- and non-stent-related thrombotic events in this specific population. Nonetheless, the required duration of DAPT has not yet been elucidated. In this article we sought to identify various randomized clinical trials (RCTs), pooled analyses, meta-analyses, and data pertaining to the optimal duration of DAPT and attempt some recommendations based on patients' clinical and procedural profiles.

Methods

We performed an extensive search using MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Internet sources for abstracts, manuscripts, and conference reports without any language or date restrictions. In our review we included all available evidence from RCTs, meta-analyses, observational studies, and abstracts pertaining to our topic. Search results that were deemed irrelevant or that would not serve the goal or topic of our review were excluded.

Results

Our search yielded 10 RCTs directly comparing different durations of DAPT, 3 meta-analyses amassing the evidence resulting from randomized data, and numerous observational studies that served the aim of our review. The observational studies included in the manuscript are directly related to instances in which RCTs could not be performed or introduce important concepts related to the duration of DAPT.

Implications

There is no conclusive evidence that determines the mandatory DAPT duration after PCI. In addition, there are distinct patient populations that need specific treatment regimens, such as diabetic patients or those on long-term oral anticoagulation. Therefore, clinical judgement and meticulous examination of all pertaining risk factors are required for each individual. These factors include those related to a patient's characteristics, treatment procedures, lesion complexity, and stent type. Currently ongoing studies are anticipated to further elucidate and integrate our understanding with regard to DAPT.

### Ticagrelor monotherapy: when is mono-antiplatelet therapy (MAPT) equivalent or better? [^1159imyN]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Ischemic and bleeding events portend equivalently poor prognosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Risk factors for these untoward events largely overlap limiting the "decoupling" of bleeding and ischemic risk. While individual patient risk scores inform the duration of guideline recommended dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) to strike the optimal balance between ischemic and bleeding risk, a promising additional approach is to tailor the regimens themselves. In higher risk patients, 1month of aspirin plus ticagrelor followed by 23months of ticagrelor monotherapy has equivalent bleeding and numerically improved ischemic risk than standard DAPT for 12months followed by aspirin monotherapy in the GLOBAL LEADERS trial. In the TWILIGHT study of high ischemic and bleeding risk patients, 12months of ticagrelor monotherapy had lower bleeding risk with equivalent ischemic risk as DAPT after 3 months of successful DAPT. Individual risk scores should be developed informing both optimal antiplatelet regimen such as ticagrelor monotherapy and treatment duration after PCI.

### Concomitant antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy: indications, controversies and practical advice [^117J83e5]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

The use of combination antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy is commonly encountered in clinical practice and is often a source of clinical controversy in regards to the efficacy versus the safety of this regimen. The benefit of combination therapy relates to the probable additive effect of suppressing both platelet and coagulation factor activities. The risk of dual therapy is the potential for increased hemorrhagic events which may outweigh the clinical benefit. This review will focus on the clinical evidence that has demonstrated greater efficacy with combination therapy over either antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy alone. Clinicians should consider the importance of documentation of combination therapy use in their patients in an effort to target those patients with the greatest benefit, and to avoid unnecessary complications.

### P2Yinhibitor monotherapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^112jf3s9]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

For 20 years, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), consisting of the combination of aspirin and a platelet P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor, has been the gold standard of antithrombotic pharmacology after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In the past 5 years, several investigations have challenged this paradigm by testing the efficacy and safety of P2Y₁₂ inhibitor monotherapy (that is, without aspirin) following a short course of DAPT. Collectively, these studies suggested a reduction in the risk of major bleeding and no significant increase in thrombotic or ischaemic events compared with guideline-recommended DAPT. Current recommendations are evolving to inform clinical practice on the ideal candidates for P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy after PCI. Generalizing the results of studies of P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy requires a thorough understanding of their design, populations, interventions, comparators and results. In this Review, we provide an up-to-date overview on the use of P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy after PCI, including supporting pharmacodynamic and clinical evidence, practical recommendations and future directions.

### Utility of the dual antiplatelet therapy score to guide antiplatelet therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pHuq4]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) score, one of the first prediction tools to attempt to uncouple bleeding and ischemic risk following percutaneous coronary intervention, can help guide antiplatelet duration after coronary intervention. Evaluating the generalizability of the score is important to understand its utility in clinical practice.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that validated the DAPT score. A random effect meta-analysis was performed of ischemic and bleeding risk based on DAPT score. A secondary analysis assessed the risk of longer versus shorter P2Y 12 inhibitor duration on ischemic and bleeding risk in randomized controlled trials of DAPT duration.

Results

We identified 10 patient cohorts involving 88,563 patients. Compared with a low DAPT score, a high DAPT score was associated with increased ischemic risk (RR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.41–1.87) and reduced bleeding risk (RR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70–0.92). In three randomized trials of DAPT duration that contained information on the DAPT score, the relative risk of net adverse clinical events (combined ischemic and bleeding events) with longer duration of DAPT was 1.56 (95% CI: 0.77–3.19) for low DAPT score patients, and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.61–1.21) for high DAPT score patients (p interaction = .14).

Conclusions

In this large meta-analysis, the DAPT score consistently stratified bleeding and ischemic risk in opposing directions across several different study populations. More evaluation is needed to understand if the effect of longer DAPT duration on NACE is modified by the DAPT score in current practice.

Acuity of presentation subgroup — myocardial infarction (MI) at presentation versus no MI indicates differential MACCE effects with prolonged DAPT: In the DAPT trial, the reduction was greater in MI patients "(3.9% versus 6.8%; HR: 0.56; P < 0.001)" than in those without MI undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) "(4.4% versus 5.3%; HR: 0.83; P = 0.08; interaction P = 0.03)", and "the findings can be considered hypothesis generating". A systematic overview of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) subgroups from randomized controlled trials similarly "showed a 22% reduction in ischemic events (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.90) and a 73% increase in major bleeding (RR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.19 to 2.50) with prolonged DAPT", which "should also be considered hypothesis generating".

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stents (BMS) and drug-eluting stents (DES) has historically progressed from ticlopidine for 2 weeks after BMS to clopidogrel for 4 weeks with similar stent thrombosis at 28 days (1.4% versus 1.5%), then to 3 months after sirolimus-eluting stent approval in 2003 and to 6 months after PES approval in 2004; many clinicians later extended clopidogrel to 12 months based on reports of a persistent risk beyond 6 months when DAPT was stopped with older stents, while newer-generation DES were used in 65% of patients in 11 randomized controlled trials and were associated with approximately half the stent thrombosis risk of first-generation DES.

Dual versus single antiplatelet therapy (DAPT vs SAPT) for ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) — systematic review and meta-analysis methods: the clinical question asked "In patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA, what are the benefits and risks of DAPT compared to SAPT within 5 years for prevention of recurrent stroke?" The literature search covered English publications from December 1999 to December 5, 2019. Inclusion criteria were phase III or IV randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of DAPT compared with SAPT that enrolled at least 100 subjects with TIA or ischemic stroke, and antiplatelet agents administered intravenously, not approved in the United States, or with other hypothesized modes of action (e.g., dipyridamole, cilostazol) were excluded. Title/abstract and full-text screening were performed independently by 2 evidence review committee (ERC) members with disagreements resolved by an ERC chair. Risk of bias was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool v2.0, applied independently by 2 ERC members. Data were abstracted independently by 2 ERC members, capturing efficacy and safety outcomes including recurrent ischemic stroke (primary outcome), intracranial hemorrhage, all recurrent strokes, myocardial infarction, major adverse cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, vascular death, and major bleeding. Prespecified subpopulations included randomization within 72 hours of stroke/TIA onset and other clinical strata. Trials were categorized post hoc into short-duration (≤ 90 days) and long-duration (> 90 days) studies, with short-duration trials randomly assigning subjects within 7 days after stroke/TIA. Summary treatment effects were estimated using random-effects meta-analyses.

In summary, prolonged DAPT appears more beneficial in patients with ACS treated with ticagrelor or prasugrel, with risk factors for recurrent ischemia at a cost of increased bleeding. However, any clinician will also recognize that not all bleeding or ACS events carry the same risk. Indeed, a clinician‐patient shared decision making seems apt when discussing the optimal duration of DAPT. On the other hand, the clinician must also remember that trials evaluating DAPT over 5 years are currently lacking. Therefore, although possibly beneficial, any DAPT beyond this time period has no strong clinical evidence. With the continuous medication and stent advances, the optimal DAPT duration will likely be altered, but until then the current guidelines supporting DAPT duration of 12 months in ACS with further tailoring of therapy based on an individual risk of further ischemic or bleeding events provide an excellent framework to begin. Evolving research will help us further understand the risks and benefits of extended‐duration DAPT, especially with the newer‐generation stents.

### Drug toxicity… [^117ERepm]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

An antiplatelet drug, also known as a platelet agglutination inhibitor or platelet aggregation inhibitor, is a member of a class of pharmaceuticals that decrease platelet aggregation and inhibit thrombus formation. They are effective in the arterial circulation where classical Vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants have minimal effect. Antiplatelet drugs are widely used in primary and secondary prevention of thrombotic disease, especially myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Antiplatelet therapy with one or more of these drugs decreases the ability of blood clots to form by interfering with the platelet activation process in primary hemostasis. Antiplatelet drugs can reversibly or irreversibly inhibit the process involved in platelet activation resulting in decreased tendency of platelets to adhere to one another and to damaged blood vessels' endothelium.

Choice Antiplatelet medications are one of the primary recommendations for treatment of both stable and unstable ischemic heart disease. Most commonly, aspirin is used as a single medication in cases of uncomplicated stable angina, and in some cases of unstable angina. If a patient does not tolerate aspirin, ADP/P2Y inhibitors may be used as single-drug therapy instead. More severe and complicated cases are treated with dual antiplatelet therapy, or in some cases triple therapy that includes direct oral anticoagulants. Clinicians must make a choice that balances patient risk with the increased risks of bleeding associated with combination therapy. Dual antiplatelet therapy Often a combination of aspirin plus an ADP/P2Y inhibitor is used to obtain greater effectiveness than with either agent alone. This is known as "dual antiplatelet therapy".

DAPT is used in patients who have, or are at high risk of developing, unstable angina, NSTEMI myocardial infarctions, and other high-risk thrombotic conditions. Dual antiplatelet therapy has been found to significantly reduce rates of heart attacks, strokes, and overall cardiovascular death, but is not used in low-risk patients because it significantly increases the risks of major bleeding. Usage Prevention and treatment of arterial thrombosis Prevention and treatment of arterial thrombosis is essential in patients with certain medical conditions whereby the risk of thrombosis or thromboembolism may result in disastrous consequences such as heart attack, pulmonary embolism or stroke.

Patients who require the use of antiplatelet drugs are: stroke with or without atrial fibrillation, any heart surgery, Coronary Heart Disease such as stable angina, unstable angina and heart attack, patients with coronary stent, Peripheral Vascular Disease/Peripheral Arterial Disease and apical/ventricular/mural thrombus. Treatment of established arterial thrombosis includes the use of antiplatelet drugs and thrombolytic therapy. Antiplatelet drugs alter the platelet activation at the site of vascular damage crucial to the development of arterial thrombosis.
- Aspirin and Triflusal irreversibly inhibits the enzyme COX, resulting in reduced platelet production of TXA₂.
- Clopidogrel affects the ADP-dependent activation of IIb/IIIa complex.

### Timing, selection, modulation, and duration of P2YInhibitors for patients With acute coronary syndromes Undergoing PCI [^1148bUYJ]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and the oral P2Y₁₂ inhibitor clopidogrel as the cornerstone of treatment for patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was firstly established in 2001. Soon thereafter, the newer-generation P2Y 12 inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor became commercially available. The clinical management of ACS patients undergoing PCI has evolved significantly in the last 2 decades, with a shift toward more rapid invasive management, broader use of drug-eluting stents, and the increasing recognition that major bleeding due to antiplatelet therapy is detrimental. In this ever-changing scenario, numerous studies have addressed 4 main questions regarding P2Y 12 inhibition in ACS patients undergoing PCI: timing, selection, modulation, and duration. This paper reviews the latest evidence surrounding these topical questions, with a focus on efficacy and safety data, practice guidelines, and residual areas of uncertainty.

### Role of antiplatelet therapy across the spectrum of patients with coronary artery disease [^111Dbgrz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is an important treatment modality across the spectrum of coronary artery disease manifestations. The role of aspirin in primary prevention continues to be refined. Although monotherapy with either aspirin or clopidogrel has been validated in secondary prevention, for high-risk patients such as those with acute coronary syndromes or requiring percutaneous coronary intervention, dual antiplatelet therapy appears to be most beneficial. Questions remain about the appropriate duration of dual antiplatelet therapy, especially in patients with prior ischemic events or in those receiving first-generation drug-eluting stents, with indirect evidence suggesting longer durations are better.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention and drug-eluting stents: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113yGVfy]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains unsettled. In patients with chronic coronary syndrome, the 2016 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association update recommended DAPT (aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor) for 6 months after PCI with drug-eluting stent (DES), with the potential to extend DAPT for a longer duration in those who remain free of a bleeding complication during this period and do not carry high bleeding risk. Conversely, patients at high bleeding risk may discontinue DAPT at 3 months. Similarly, the 2017 European Society of Cardiology update recommends 6-month DAPT in chronic coronary syndrome irrespective of stent type, with further prolongation of DAPT reserved for patients with low bleeding risk but high thrombotic risk, and 1 to 3 months of DAPT for patients with high bleeding risk. In patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), both the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend at least 12 months of DAPT, with consideration that the duration could be extended beyond 12 months in patients with lower risk of bleeding, and 6 months of DAPT in patients with high risk of bleeding. Both guidelines recommend indefinite continuation of aspirin monotherapy after discontinuation of DAPT.

These recommendations were based on the evidence derived from 15 randomized, controlled trials conducted in patients with predominantly chronic coronary syndrome. More recent clinical trials have been performed, including several conducted in ACS and those studying ≤ 3-month DAPT followed by discontinuation of aspirin rather than the P2Y12 inhibitor. – We therefore performed an updated trial-level network meta-analysis to compare different durations of DAPT and strategies focused on different types of antiplatelet monotherapy (aspirin versus P2Y12 inhibitor) after DAPT discontinuation in patients undergoing PCI with DES either in the acute or chronic setting.

Minor stroke dual antiplatelet therapy — initiation and duration: In patients presenting with minor stroke, treatment for 21 days with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) begun within 24 hours can be beneficial for early secondary stroke prevention for a period of up to 90 days from symptom onset.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — In randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with safer, newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES), patients may be treated with a minimum DAPT duration of 3 to 6 months to prevent early and largely stent-related thrombotic events, but extension beyond 12 months entails a tradeoff; the declining risk of late stent thrombosis and inability to predict life-threatening bleeding limit the appeal of 18 to 48 months versus 6 to 12 months of therapy. In contrast, patients with prior MI at high risk of atherothrombosis experience fewer ischemic events with prolonged DAPT at a cost of increased bleeding events.

Absolute event rates with prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 18 to 48 months versus 6 to 12 months showed similar mortality but more major bleeding and fewer myocardial infarctions (MIs): deaths totaled 415 with a weighted annual mortality of 1.62% (95% CI: 1.31% to 2.00%) vs 1.42%, equating to 16 (95% CI: 13 to 20) vs 14 per 1000 and a nonsignificant number needed to harm of 512 (95% CI: −172 to 892); major bleeding totaled 307 with 1.26% (95% CI: 0.96% to 1.66%) vs 0.80%, or 13.5 (95% CI: 10 to 17) vs 8 per 1000 and number needed to harm 219 (95% CI: 117 to 632); MIs totaled 422 in 5 RCTs with 1.19% (95% CI: 0.83% to 1.67%) vs 1.76%, corresponding to 12 (95% CI: 8 to 17) vs 18 per 1000 during follow-up.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy use by Canadian cardiac surgeons [^113aSrkK]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Dual antiplatelet therapy is the cornerstone treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome. Recent Canadian Guidelines recommend the use of dual antiplatelet therapy for 1 year after coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with acute coronary syndrome, but considerable variability remains.

Methods

We performed a survey of 75 Canadian cardiac surgeons to assess the use of dual antiplatelet therapy.

Results

Whereas 58.6% of respondents indicated that the benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy were seen irrespective of how patients were managed after acute coronary syndrome, 36.2% believed that the benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy were limited to those treated medically or percutaneously. In regard to the timing of dual antiplatelet therapy administration, 57% of respondents indicated that dual antiplatelet therapy should be given upstream in the emergency department, whereas 36.2% responded that dual antiplatelet therapy should be given only once the coronary anatomy has been defined. The majority surveyed (81%) weighed bleeding risk as being more important than ischemic risk reduction. In stable patients after acute coronary syndrome, the majority of surgeons would wait approximately 4 days after the last dose of P2Y12 antagonist before coronary artery bypass grafting. Only 44.6% indicated that they routinely use dual antiplatelet therapy postrevascularization in the setting of acute coronary syndrome. Rather, most surgeons use dual antiplatelet therapy for select patients, such as those with a stented vessel without a bypass graft, endarterectomy, or off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.

Conclusions

Cardiac surgeons exhibit variation in their attitudes and practice patterns toward dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting, and in approximately half of cases, their practice does not adhere to current guideline recommendations. New trials focusing on coronary artery bypass grafting cases in their primary analysis and educational initiatives for surgeons that focus on guideline recommendations may be warranted.

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary stent implantation [^1177Vkax]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet pharmacotherapy reduces ischemic events at the cost of excess bleeding in patients who underwent coronary stenting. The currently recommended treatment period is based on trials held some 20 years ago and not relevant to current clinical practice. In recent years, numerous clinical trials have tried to answer the question of what is the optimal duration of therapy to maximize clinical benefit. These trials showed 2 seemingly conflicting answers-on one hand, shorter treatment duration seems to be safer in reducing bleeding while not increasing ischemic events, and on the other hand, longer duration is superior in terms of preventing ischemic events albeit at the cost of increased bleeding rates. In this review, we summarize the evidence favoring each approach, highlight the limitations of the various pivotal clinical trials in this field, review future directions of research and changes in practice that may influence the duration of antiplatelet therapy, and attempt to propose a personalized approach to achieve maximal benefit for the individual patient.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy: a systematic review for the 2016 ACC / AHA guideline focused update on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^115RCtew]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after implantation of newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) remains uncertain. Similarly, questions remain about the role of DAPT in long-term therapy of stable post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients.

Aim

Our objective was to compare the incidence of death, major hemorrhage, MI, stent thrombosis, and major adverse cardiac events in patients randomized to prolonged or short-course DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES and in secondary prevention after MI.

Methods

We used traditional frequentist statistical and Bayesian approaches to address the following questions: Q1) What is the minimum duration of DAPT required after DES implantation? Q2) What is the clinical benefit of prolonging DAPT up to 18 to 48 months? Q3) What is the clinical effect of DAPT in stable patients who are > 1 year past an MI?

Results

We reviewed evidence from 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled 33051 patients who received predominantly newer-generation DES to answer: A1) Use of DAPT for 12 months, as compared with use for 3 to 6 months, resulted in no significant differences in incidence of death (odds ratio [OR]: 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85 to 1.63), major hemorrhage (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.97 to 2.82), MI (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.18), or stent thrombosis (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.55). Bayesian models confirmed the primary analysis. A2) Use of DAPT for 18 to 48 months, compared with use for 6 to 12 months, was associated with no difference in incidence of all-cause death (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.42) but was associated with increased major hemorrhage (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.09), decreased MI (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.95), and decreased stent thrombosis (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.74). A risk-benefit analysis found 3 fewer stent thromboses (95% CI: 2 to 5) and 6 fewer MIs (95% CI: 2 to 11) but 5 more major bleeds (95% CI: 3 to 9) per 1000 patients treated with prolonged DAPT per year. Post hoc analyses provided weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT. We reviewed evidence from 1 RCT of 21162 patients and a post hoc analysis of 1 RCT of 15603 patients to answer: A3): Use of DAPT > 1 year after MI reduced the composite risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (hazard ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.95) but increased major bleeding (hazard ratio: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.68 to 3.21). A meta-analysis and a post hoc analysis of an RCT in patients with stable cardiovascular disease produced similar findings.

Conclusions

The primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence that prolonged DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES entails a tradeoff between reductions in stent thrombosis and MI and increases in major hemorrhage. Secondary analyses provide weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT after DES implantation. In patients whose coronary thrombotic risk was defined by a prior MI rather than by DES implantation, the primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence of reduced cardiovascular events at the expense of increased bleeding.

### ACC / AHA versus ESC guidelines on dual Antiplatelet therapy: JACC guideline comparison [^114zPFm9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is the cornerstone of pharmacological treatment aimed at preventing the atherothrombotic complications in patients with a variety of coronary artery disease (CAD) manifestations. Prescribers of DAPT are confronted with a number of challenges that include selecting the appropriate P2Y 12 inhibitor and determining the optimal duration of DAPT with the scope of minimizing the risk of ischemic and bleeding complications in light of each patient's clinical characteristic and circumstance. Recently, a guideline writing committee from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and a task force from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) released their respective focused update recommendations on "Duration of DAPT in Patients with CAD" (ACC/AHA) and "DAPT in CAD" (ESC). This paper aims to review the ACC/AHA and ESC updates for DAPT to delineate common domains, consistent messages, and differences in recommended management strategies across the Atlantic.

### Early and sustained dual oral antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention… [^115eohan]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context Following percutaneous coronary intervention, short-term clopidogrel therapy in addition to aspirin leads to greater protection from thrombotic complications than aspirin alone. However, the optimal duration of combination oral antiplatelet therapy is unknown. Also, although current clinical data suggest a benefit for beginning therapy with a clopidogrel loading dose prior. least 6 hours before PCI experienced a relative risk reduction of 38. 6% for this end point compared with no reduction with treatment less than 6 hours before PCI. Risk of major bleeding at 1 year increased, but not significantly leads to even greater protection from thrombotic complications following a percutaneous coronary intervention with a stent. 1–4 However, the optimal timing for the initiation of clopidogrel and aspirin, as well as their duration of treatment following a PCI procedure, remains unknown.

Therefore, among patients in whom. study drug was initiated at least 6 hours prior to PCI, those randomized to clopidogrel experienced a 38. 6% relative reduction in the combined end point that was of borderline statistical significance. To ensure that this finding was not due to some systematic difference in the populations, the background characteristics of these patients were examined and found to be similar regardless of the timing of the pretreatment. This benefit of early pretreatment, and the lack of benefit with less than 6 hours of pretreatment, appeared similar among. of the combined end point. However, a trend toward benefit was suggested in patients who did receive a GpIIb-IIIa antagonist and were randomized to clopidogrel pretreatment, with a 30% relative reduction in events (7. 3% pretreated.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^1134Xgzh]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Antiplatelet therapy represents the mainstay of the pharmacological treatment and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). Compared with placebo, antiplatelet therapy has been shown to reduce recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among patients with stable CAD or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) provides more intense platelet inhibition than single antiplatelet therapy resulting in incremental reductions in the risk of thrombotic events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or ACS, but it has been associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. The choice of optimal DAPT regimen and duration for patients with CAD requires a tailored approach based on the patient clinical presentation, baseline risk profile and management strategy. However, the selection of patients who might derive benefit from shorter or extended DAPT duration remains a matter of debate. This article provides a contemporary state-of-the-art review of the current evidence on DAPT for secondary prevention of patients with CAD and its future perspectives.
