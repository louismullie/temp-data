## Question

CAN A ONE HAVE HEMOPHILIA IF HIS GRADFATHER HAD HEMOPHILIA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a grandson can have hemophilia if his grandfather had hemophilia, and wants to understand the inheritance pattern and risks involved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the genetics of hemophilia and X-linked recessive inheritance. Then, I should verify how the grandfather's status influences the mother's carrier risk. Next, I will calculate the son's risk based on the mother's carrier status. After that, I need to consider de novo mutations and what they mean for a family with no known maternal history. Finally, I will translate this into practical counseling and testing recommendations, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the inheritance pattern. Hemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive disorders caused by mutations in F8 or F9 on the X chromosome, so males are typically affected and females are typically carriers, though females can have bleeding symptoms depending on factor levels and X-inactivation patterns [^115pX1DZ] [^114GJqtY].

> Now, I need to trace the specific pedigree. If the grandfather had hemophilia, he has one mutated X and one Y; he passes his Y to sons and his X to daughters. Therefore, all of his daughters are obligate carriers of the hemophilia mutation on the X they inherit from him, even if they have normal factor levels and no bleeding symptoms, which is common due to lyonization and residual factor activity [^115pX1DZ] [^114GJqtY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the grandson yet; I should verify the mother's status. The mother in this scenario is the daughter of an affected male, so she has a 100% chance of carrying the hemophilia mutation from her father. Wait, let me verify that wording: yes, she is an obligate carrier by pedigree, meaning she definitely carries the mutation even if her factor level is normal and she has no bleeding history [^115pX1DZ] [^113zJzD8].

> Next, I should review the son's risk. For each son of a carrier mother, there is a 50% chance he inherits the maternal X with the mutation and has hemophilia, and a 50% chance he inherits the maternal X without the mutation and is unaffected. I should double-check that probability: yes, it is 1 in 2 for sons of a known carrier, independent of the grandfather's phenotype severity [^115pX1DZ] [^115pX1DZ].

> But wait, what if there is no known maternal family history and the grandson appears to be a sporadic case? I need to ensure I account for de novo mutations. Approximately 30–50% of boys with hemophilia are diagnosed without a known family history, and a meaningful fraction of these represent de novo mutations; however, even in "sporadic" cases, many mothers are found to be carriers upon genetic testing, indicating that the mutation arose in a prior generation or in parental germline mosaicism rather than in the affected boy himself [^113M8TJg] [^115rX1qw] [^113DLoMb].

> Let me consider the practical implications for this family. Given a grandfather with hemophilia, the mother should be offered genetic counseling and carrier testing to confirm the familial mutation, because this clarifies risk for all her children and informs reproductive planning. If she is a confirmed carrier, prenatal or preimplantation genetic testing options can be discussed, and newborn sons should have early factor testing or cord blood assessment where appropriate, ideally coordinated through a hemophilia treatment center [^112qXepk] [^113DLoMb] [^113rodP1].

> I should also confirm that carrier females can have bleeding symptoms and may benefit from individualized care. Even with factor levels above 40 IU/dL, some carriers experience abnormal bleeding, and the newer ISTH nomenclature recognizes categories such as symptomatic carrier and women/girls with mild hemophilia based on factor level and bleeding phenotype, which can guide management during procedures, menstruation, and childbirth [^114GJqtY] [^113cp8D1].

> Putting this together, the bottom line is: yes, a grandson can have hemophilia if his grandfather had hemophilia, because the grandfather's daughters are obligate carriers and each son of a carrier mother has a 50% risk of inheriting hemophilia. If the grandson is affected, the most likely explanation is that his mother is a carrier; however, a de novo mutation remains possible and should be considered if maternal testing is negative, especially given the frequency of apparently sporadic cases and the role of parental mosaicism in some families [^115pX1DZ] [^116x6Ffp] [^113CB69e].

A male can have hemophilia if his grandfather had it only if the **mother is a carrier** [^115pX1DZ]. Because hemophilia is X-linked recessive, a grandfather with hemophilia passes the mutation to all his daughters, who are carriers, and each son of a carrier mother has a **50% risk** of inheriting hemophilia. If the mother is not a carrier, the grandson will not inherit hemophilia from his grandfather. Genetic testing of the mother is the most reliable way to assess risk [^111nTqUH].

---

## Genetic inheritance of hemophilia

Hemophilia A and B are **X-linked recessive disorders** caused by mutations in F8 or F9 [^113zJzD8]. Males have one X chromosome; if it carries the mutation, they are **affected**. Females have two X chromosomes; if one carries the mutation, they are typically carriers with variable factor levels and **bleeding risk** [^114GJqtY].

---

## Inheritance pattern from grandfather to grandson

- **Grandfather (affected male)**: Has one mutated X and one Y; passes the mutated X to all daughters and the Y to sons.
- **Mother (daughter of affected male)**: Receives the mutated X from her father; she is an obligate carrier [^113zJzD8].
- **Grandson (son of carrier mother)**: Has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated X from his mother and having hemophilia [^115pX1DZ].

---

## Scenarios determining grandson's risk

| **Scenario** | **Mother's status** | **Grandson's risk of hemophilia** |
|-|-|-|
| Grandfather has hemophilia | Mother is a carrier (obligate) | 50% chance of hemophilia |
| Grandfather has hemophilia | Mother is not a carrier (rare, e.g. adoption, de novo mutation) | 0% chance of hemophilia |

---

## Role of genetic testing

Genetic testing is the **gold standard** for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis [^111nTqUH]. Testing the mother identifies whether she carries the family mutation, enabling accurate risk assessment for her sons and informed reproductive choices [^113rodP1].

---

## Factors influencing severity

Severity in affected males is determined by the **specific mutation and baseline factor VIII/IX activity** [^115Pyimp]. Grandfathers with severe hemophilia typically transmit the same mutation, so their grandsons may also have severe disease if affected [^115pX1DZ].

---

## Conclusion

A grandson can have hemophilia if his grandfather had it, but only if his mother is a carrier, which occurs in about half of cases. Each son of a carrier mother has a **50% risk** of hemophilia; if the mother is not a carrier, there is no risk from the grandfather. Genetic testing of the mother provides definitive risk assessment and guides family planning [^111siAk7].

### Recessively inherited coagulation disorders [^111TFg53]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Deficiencies of coagulation factors other than factor VIII and factor IX that cause bleeding disorders are inherited as autosomal recessive traits and are rare, with prevalences in the general population varying between 1 in 500 000 and 1 in 2 million for the homozygous forms. As a consequence of the rarity of these deficiencies, the type and severity of bleeding symptoms, the underlying molecular defects, and the actual management of bleeding episodes are not as well established as for hemophilia A and B. We investigated more than 1000 patients with recessively inherited coagulation disorders from Italy and Iran, a country with a high rate of recessive diseases due to the custom of consanguineous marriages. Based upon this experience, this article reviews the genetic basis, prevalent clinical manifestations, and management of these disorders. The steps and actions necessary to improve the condition of these often neglected patients are outlined.

### Evolving complexity in hemophilia management [^1155ZKG6]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Rapid expansion of therapeutic options have increased the complexity of hemophilia care. Previously, on-demand therapy aimed to reduce morbidity and early mortality; however, now aggressive prophylaxis, particularly in children, encourages an active lifestyle. Accurate diagnosis, recognition of early threats to musculoskeletal health, and optimization of therapy are critical for both males and females affected by hemophilia. The diversity of emerging hemophilia therapies, from modified factor protein concentrates, to gene therapy, to nonfactor hemostatic strategies, provide an exciting opportunity to target unmet needs in the bleeding disorder community.

### What is a' serious' genetic condition? The perceptions of people living with genetic conditions [^111MTQyG]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Although not commonly reported, bad or very bad current health/wellbeing was most frequent in participants with VWD (17.1%), SMA4 (16.7%), men with haemophilia (16.1%), and people with FXSTAS/POI (15.4%). Due to their infrequency, these responses were combined with 'fair' for pairwise analyses. Participants with SMA4 had the highest levels of bad/fair (77.8%) and lowest levels of good health/wellbeing (22.2%) (Tables 2 & 4), which is striking as SMA4 is clinically the mildest form of SMA with late onset (usually after 35 years). Helen (45) described the dramatic changes in her life and health brought about by SMA4; " I'll never forget the day I was diagnosed… I was 37, just got all my kids in school and had just started in a new job… It's been downhill from there really, I'm 45 now and I still walk, but… with a frame now. I couldn't keep up with the job and had to chuck it in which was devastating and that hit us… financially. I've just… lost my independence really. Most days I'm so weak I struggle with everything now, it's a terrible illness… So I would say my health is pretty bad now. " Helen incorporated her SMA into her evaluation of her own health, viewing it as an 'illness'. In contrast, Mark drew a conceptual distinction between his disability – which had been a comparatively stable presence since infancy – and his health, which he interpreted as being the absence of illnesses, pain and suffering.

Causes of reduced FIX levels in symptomatic females

Approximately 10–15% of hemophilia carriers experience bleeding symptoms. Skewed X‐chromosome inactivation (Lyonization) is implicated in some cases, but chromosome translocation, compound heterozygosity for two different mutations and Turner syndrome (XO) can also result in bleeding. Orstavik et al. examined 15 hemophilia B carriers; there was no tendency for there to be skewed X‐chromosome inactivation in those with high or low FIX:C levels 44. Di Michele et al. reported on bleeding symptoms and phenotype in US hemophilic females, identified through the UDC database. Of six affected females with hemophilia B (one severe; five moderate), each with a missense mutation, three had skewed X‐chromosome inactivation, and one had a de novo X‐chromosome deletion; the reason for hemophilia B was not characterized in two individuals 45.

### The experiences and attitudes of hemophilia carriers around pregnancy: a qualitative systematic review [^114VdWUV]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

3.2.1 Becoming pregnant

The decision to become pregnant or not to have children was strongly influenced by women's experiences with hemophilia in their families. 15, 39, 40, 44 Women whose family members with hemophilia experienced a satisfactory quality of life more readily accepted hemophilia as being part of their lives and were more likely to wish to have children of their own. 15, 35, 39, 40

… this is not a life limiting condition, in either sense of the word, and you know, my dad, although his health has suffered has, you know, he's rally driving, he's done sea sailing he's, you know, this isn't something that makes you stop living your life, it will be a part of our boy…

Hemophilia carrier from the United Kingdom 35

On the contrary, women who had seen a significant impact of hemophilia on the quality of life of family members were less likely to want to have children themselves, more concerned about passing on hemophilia, and more worried about the consequences of having an affected child. 43, 44 Some women decided not to become pregnant as they did not want to go through the stress of genetic testing. 33, 44 Overall, women wished to be able to make informed reproductive decisions. 43

I am fine with being a carrier, but I don't plan to have children with haemophilia. I sound harsh but it is the severity not the actual condition that worries me.

Australian potential hemophilia carrier 43

Disclosure by the family of the potential to be an HC before pregnancy was valued. 15, 43 Other HCs expressed that they did not feel isolated during reproductive decision‐making because of their exposure to hemophilia in the family. 43 Knowledge of the possibility of having an affected child was experienced as difficult. 40

It is not being a carrier that's difficult, what's difficult is when you find yourself in a situation where it has a consequence.

### Female monozygotic twins discordant for hemophilia A due to nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation [^111HAJks]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

We describe monozygotic female twins discordant for hemophilia A, born to a carrier mother and normal father. Affected twin A presented at age 1 year with excessive bruising and factor VIII procoagulant activity (FVIII:C) of less than 1% of normal. Twin B is an asymptomatic carrier with FVIII:C level of 42%. Peripheral blood DNA was tested for X-chromosome inactivation (methylation) patterns of the X-linked human androgen receptor gene, comparing the twins' patterns to parental. Twin A showed nonrandom inactivation skewed toward the paternal X, whereas twin B showed random X-inactivation. This is the first reported case of discordance for hemophilia A between female monozygotic twins.

### "It was a lot tougher than I thought It would be". A qualitative study on the changing nature of being a hemophilia carrier [^113qzVsw]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2017). Low credibility.

Studies on carriers of genetic disorders mainly focus on the process of genetic testing and reproductive choices, and less on how psychosocial aspects of being a carrier change over time. Our study sought to understand more about the psychosocial aspects of hemophilia carrier status, and thereby improve counseling aiming to advance carriers' quality of life and well-being. We analyzed 16 in-depth interviews from women who were carriers of hemophilia and had a son with hemophilia. Three themes emerged: Guilt and sorrow across generations; the choices and future consequences of genetic testing; and preparing to have a child with hemophilia. Experience with being a hemophilia carrier is a process that changes over time while feelings of guilt and sorrow run across generations. The carrier status may create "mothers-in-waiting" living at risk of having a sick child or not. The women think they are prepared to have a son with hemophilia, but experience more sadness than they expect when a son is diagnosed. Our findings suggest that health professionals, especially clinical geneticists and genetic counselors, carriers, families and patient organizations need to be aware that women's experiences of being a carrier of hemophilia changes during the biographical life course. The women may benefit from several rounds of genetic counseling at different stages of life.

### Genetic analysis of carrier status in female members of Japanese hemophilia families [^113u5jzn]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The present study provided comprehensive genetic information on Japanese hemophilia female carriers. First, we successfully identified the F8 and F9 mutations in all 72 hemophilic families. All the identified mutations in HA patients, except for missense mutations, were null mutations (74%). In addition, two missense mutations (p. Tyr414His and p. Arg2182Cys) resulted in severe HA phenotype. Thus, the genetic tests showed a reasonable proportion of severe HA (83%) in our study. In HB patients, although F9 large mutations were not detected, 73% of the F9 mutations were point mutations. The distribution of point mutations was almost similar to those reported in other countries. 14, 23 Since the early 1980s, when Sanger capillary sequencing made it possible to establish carrier status, DNA direct sequencing has evolved from haplotyping to mutation analysis, 24, 25 offering certainty about the carrier status. 26, 27, 28 Despite the clear advantage of the next generation sequencing in various settings, including exploration of deep intron mutation, Sanger sequencing remains a better option for genetic testing and diagnosis of hemophiliac carriers, because there still can be a variety of unknown mutations of F8 and F9 target genes. In this study, carrier status was determined in 112 FFM based on the presence of patient relevant mutation in each family in the heterozygous form; 53/80 HA FFM (66%) and 21/32 HB FFM (66%) were diagnosed as carriers. All FFM with hemophilic relatives suffering bleeding tendencies were found to be carriers (Table 1). The numbers and proportions of subjects were limited and biased in this study with male patients from 44 mothers among the 112 subjects. In addition, there was no significant association between mutation patterns and genetic transmission.

### Therapeutic consequences for misdiagnosis of type 2N von Willebrand disease [^115oJQ1C]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with a low FVIII:C and with normal VWF levels are usually presumed to have hemophilia (males) or be carriers for hemophilia (females). Some of these patients may instead have VWD:2N. Such patients if misdiagnosed are likely to suffer from insufficiently treated bleeds. We report 2 males and 1 female who presented with a low FVIII:C (1–21%) and minimally reduced/normal VWF and were assumed to have, or be a carrier for, hemophilia A. Eventually all were found to have VWD:2N. Prior to the correct diagnosis the males had been treated with rFVIII with poor responses and ultimately adverse clinical consequences.

### The impact of concurrent X chromosome anomalies on diagnosis and bleeding phenotype in children with hemophilia: a single-institution case series [^112uJgu9]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Hemophilia is an inherited X-linked bleeding disorder characterized by deficiencies of factors VIII or IX. Concomitant X chromosome disorders can impact bleeding phenotype, complicating timely diagnosis and disease management. Herein, we describe three cases of female and male pediatric patients with hemophilia A or B diagnosed between 6 days and 4 years old in the setting of skewed X chromosome inactivation, Turner syndrome, or Klinefelter syndrome. All of these cases had significant bleeding symptoms, and two patients required initiation of factor replacement therapy. One female patient developed a factor VIII inhibitor similar to that described in males with hemophilia A.

### Genetic analysis of carrier status in female members of Japanese hemophilia families [^113UUnNK]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, non‐carriers were diagnosed based on the absence of F8 and F9 mutations in the heterozygous form. However, the affected allele might not have been detected due to technical limitations, although all analyses were validated at least twice. Second, this study mainly included patients with severe HA (83%); as such, the results cannot be extrapolated to mild and moderate HA. Third, because pedigree information plays a critical role in assessing the carrier status for hemophilia, an accurate family history is essential for carrier diagnosis. Although the present study carefully assessed pedigree information from medical interviews, a full access to the official records was not available, resulting in a higher incidence of pedigree‐based sporadic hemophilia than in previous studies. Also, details of bleeding symptoms were obtained from 63 of the 112 (56%) by self‐reports rather than by direct medical interview. Furthermore, we did not employ a bleeding evaluation tool, such as pictorial blood assessment chart for menorrhagia. 33 Fourth, the number of FFM who underwent measurement of coagulation factor activity was limited and the measurement reagents used in the assays were sometimes different.

In conclusion, the present study is the first to present comprehensive genetic information on Japanese hemophilia female carriers and demonstrated the usefulness of genetic analysis in carrier diagnosis by comparing gene testing with pedigree information and measurement of coagulation factor activity levels. Interestingly, our results showed a very low rate of de novo mutations in patients with sporadic hemophilia. Taken together, the significance of gene analysis for carrier diagnosis in hemophilia includes accurate assessment of the carrier status.

### Proactive systematic hemophilia carrier screening: a step toward gender equity in hemophilia care [^114fVGrK]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of carriers

Of 900 females, 454 (50.4%) were found to be obligate and/or genetically proven carriers of hemophilia (329 HA and 125 HB) and 118 could be identified as noncarriers (Figure 3). In 8 of these noncarriers, carriership was ruled out because of genetic testing results confirming noncarrier status in their mothers. Carrier status has been confirmed through genetic testing in 131 obligate carriers, 126 potential carriers, and 7 index cases. Genetic testing is yet to be conducted for 328 potential carriers and 190 obligate carriers.

Figure 3.
Carrier status of female individuals.

Mean age at diagnosis of carriership or noncarriership of female individuals for whom this exact age could be determined was 30.7 years (range, 1–82) in families with HA and 30.1 years (range, 0.5–93) in families with HB (P = 0.809). In families with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia, mean age at diagnosis of females was, respectively, 29.7 (range, 1.0–76.0), 29.6 (range, 0.5–77.0), and 32.1 years (range, 1.0–93.0) (P = 0.535). Mean age at diagnosis of females with a FVIII or FIX deficiency (lowest factor level < 40 IU/dL) was 25.8 years (standard deviation, 18.4; range, 1.0–63.0) compared with 31.8 years (standard deviation, 19.1; range, 0.5–82.0) for those without a factor deficiency (P = 0.034). Given that the exact age at diagnosis could not be determined in the 2 females with severe hemophilia and there were no females with moderate hemophilia, the reported mean age at diagnosis of females with a factor deficiency equals the mean age at diagnosis of females with mild hemophilia in our cohort.

### Sex distribution of clinical trial participants: how often are women excluded? [^111VJxfv]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The search identified 27,218 phase 3 interventional studies. Among these, 23,758 (87.3%) included both men and women. Women exclusively participated in 2559 studies (9.4%) while men were the exclusive focus of 885 studies (3.3%). Among the 653 studies that evaluated male-specific conditions, such as hemophilia, prostate disease, or erectile dysfunction, 91.1% included only men and 8.9% included both sexes. Among the studies of male-predominant conditions that included women, more than half (52%) considered hemophilia and female carriers. Others examined Fabry disease (22%) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (5%). The remainder were descriptive studies that included partners of men with prostate disease or erectile dysfunction.

For the 1906 trials that evaluated female-specific conditions, such as breast cancer or uterine disease, 89.8% included only women and 10.2% included both sexes. Among the 194 studies that included both sexes, 92 (47%) focused on breast cancer, a condition that occasionally affects men. Other conditions in this category included pain, infertility, contraception, and HIV/sexually transmitted diseases. Only one trial concerning a female-specific condition included only male participants. That trial focused on breast cancer. Finally, 95.3% of the 24,659 studies of non–sex-specific conditions included both men and women (Table 1).

### "Everything was blood when it comes to me": understanding the lived experiences of women with inherited bleeding disorders [^112Tsh8A]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the many symptoms that women with inherited bleeding disorders experience, no study has specifically sought to explore and understand the lived experiences of these women, nor the barriers to care that they may encounter. The primary objective of this study was to describe the lived experiences of women with inherited bleeding disorders.

Methods

Inclusion criteria for study enrollment were the following: age ≥ 18 years, English speaking, and confirmed diagnosis of an inherited bleeding disorder. Women were recruited across Canada through identification by treating health-care providers and study members of the Canadian Hemophilia Society. Telephone interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview style, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using descriptive thematic analysis.

Results

A total of 15 participants were interviewed. Median age was 31 years (24–70 years old). Four primary themes emerged: uncertainties surrounding diagnosis, conceptualization of experience through family bleeding, intensity of bleeding symptoms, and impact of bleeding on identity and daily life.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to thoroughly describe the experiences of adult women living with inherited bleeding disorders. We found that these women experience multiple uncertainties around their diagnosis. They conceptualize their bleeding by examining family histories; experience severe symptoms irrespective of their underlying diagnosis; and create identities around their bleeding symptoms, which influence multiple aspects of their life. Next study steps will involve sharing work specifically focused on treatment plans, barriers to care, and factors affecting care access.

### Management of haemophilia and heritable bleeding disorders in the ED [^114hyDes]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

This practice review addresses the management of haemophilia and heritable bleeding disorders in the ED. These disorders are uncommonly encountered by the emergency physician, but prompt and appropriate management is critical to ensure good outcomes. This practice review describes the principles of emergency care for people with bleeding disorders, with an emphasis on a pragmatic clinical approach, and provides examples of challenging emergencies.

### What factors influence the age at diagnosis of hemophilia? Results of the French hemophilia cohort [^116qLuGE]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The diagnosis of hemophilia was reported as delayed in historic studies. We therefore investigated this issue to provide current epidemiologic data in a large series of patients.

Study Design

The French cohort provided the opportunity to investigate the age at diagnosis and the circumstances of diagnosis in 599 individuals with hemophilia born between 1980 and 1994. The type and the severity of hemophilia, the family history, and the period of birth were analyzed as potential modifying factors.

Results

The median age at diagnosis was 7.7 months, with significant differences among subgroups: 5.8 months in severe hemophilia, 9.0 months in moderate forms, 28.6 months in mild forms, 0.4 months in the case of hemophilic brothers, and 10.1 months in de novo hemophilia, which accounted for 55.3% of cases. In severe forms we observed a trend for earlier diagnosis throughout 3 consecutive periods from 1980 to 1994. Of bleeding episode, testing due to family history, or routine testing, bleeding was the main circumstance of diagnosis (59.9%).

Conclusions

Diagnosis was made earlier than in historic series, but it remained somewhat delayed. Early diagnosis will require efforts in the fields of genetic counseling and specific diagnosis of early bleeding, even without family history, because of the high incidence of de novo hemophilia.

### Understanding of genetic inheritance among xhosa-speaking caretakers of children with hemophilia [^114He8RH]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2012). Low credibility.

Hemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive inherited bleeding disorders that have a profound impact on the family of affected individuals. Education is vital to enable women to appreciate the implications of being a carrier and the implications for a prospective child. Prior research has shown that cultural, socio-economic and linguistic issues in South Africa are major barriers to communication for first-language Xhosa-speakers. This exploratory study aimed to investigate the basic knowledge of genetic inheritance among this cultural group in order to promote culturally-sensitive, effective genetic counseling. Ten in-depth interviews were conducted with Xhosa-speaking mothers or caregivers of boys with hemophilia. Results suggest that the participants had a very limited understanding of the clinical management, genetic consequences and cause of hemophilia. While treatment and care by health care service providers was fully accepted, several participants believed that traditional methods would provide them with more satisfactory explanations. These findings suggest that there is a critical need for socio-culturally tailored, language-specific education for families with hemophilia.

### The dilemma of X-linked agammaglobulinemia carriers [^114GvMW7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Genetic counseling influences decision-making and reproductive options by taking advantage of carrier screening programs for genetic disorders targeted at high-risk individuals. The management of high-risk pregnancies has not changed over time, although the technology used to identify the risk of having an affected child has improved.

Decades ago, diagnosis of carrier status in families with XLA was based on evidence of complete X-chromosome inactivation in the B-cell lineage, and an accurate prenatal diagnosis was not possible for most mothers, who were therefore unaware of their reproductive risk unless suspected because of an affected family member.

With the advances in prenatal diagnosis, couples with a fetus affected by a genetic disorder are faced with the dilemma of whether to terminate the pregnancy. In the pioneering study by Conley et alof the 49 mothers of sporadic patients with XLA with proven mutations in the BTK gene, 84% were carriers of the mutation found in their sons. Nowadays, sisters of patients with XLA can be tested for their carrier status by genomic sequencing, which can have an impact on their reproductive outcomes. The detection of carrier status is part of genetic counseling, together with updated information on the natural history of XLA, its associated conditions, medical and therapeutic management options, and clinical outcomes. Recent reports from national and international cohorts have confirmed a reduced incidence of severe infections and mortality in patients with XLA with early diagnosis, possibly following newborn screening programs and early diagnosis in families with XLA.

Our study aimed to analyze the family history of patients with XLA, including the adherence to carrier status screening of sisters of patients with XLA, their interest in preconception and prenatal genetic counseling, and their reproductive choices. It was inspired by a clinical case of a complex adult contemporary affected by XLA and hemophilia A whose carrier sister chose to continue her pregnancy regardless of an XLA prenatal diagnosis.

We included an extensive series of Italian patients with XLA who had reached adulthood. Most of them harbored a sporadic form, in line with the national registry data. As described in 2 extensive Italian studies published 20 years apart, the overall survival of patients with XLA at age 40 years increased from 40% to 60% thanks to the shortening diagnostic delay, the shared use of updated recommendations for monitoring, and therapy.

### How I approach: previously untreated patients with severe congenital hemophilia a… [^1161zDec]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Previously untreated patients with severe hemophilia A are a vulnerable population at risk for severe bleeding which is currently managed with exogenous clotting factor replacement. The primary burden of current treatment is high-titer inhibitor development. Evolving data on current treatment products as well as emerging therapeutics may inform treatment decisions to prevent bleeding and inhibitor formation. Considerations for diagnosis, education, and shared decision-making related to product choice and treatment regimen are discussed.

3.5 Verification of sporadic hemophilia and de novo mutation

Based on the pedigree information, 37 hemophiliac sons (27 HA and 10 HB) from 72 families were diagnosed as sporadic hemophilia (Table 4). In genetic analysis, 24 HA mothers (89%) had the patient relevant mutation in the heterozygote form while 3 HA mothers (11%) did not have the relevant mutation. Therefore, all 27 represent sporadic HA but in only 11% was the sporadic mutation in the affected male while in the other 24 cases of sporadic HA, the sporadic mutation was in the child's mother and potentially in the child's grandmother. In genetic analysis of 10 HB cases, 8 HB mothers (80%) had the patient relevant mutation while 2 HB mothers (20%) did not have the relevant mutation. Therefore, all 10 represent sporadic HB but in only 20% was the sporadic mutation in the affected male while in the other 8 cases of sporadic HB, the sporadic mutation was in the child's mother and potentially in the child's grandmother.

Verification of sporadic hemophilia and de novo mutations

Note

These results suggest that 5 children (3 HA and 2 HB) had de novo mutations (F8 inversion, F8 p. Arg2182Cys, F8 p. Trp791*, F9 c.252+5G > A, F9 c.1258‐1259delAG). In summary, 32 mothers of 37 sporadic cases showed relevant mutations, and consequently, the incidence of de novo mutations in male infants in the present study was 14%, suggesting a low frequency for de novo mutations in male hemophiliacs.

### Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of haemophilia [^116Yipoi]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) aims to increase the number of options available to couples who could have a child affected with haemophilia and reduce the anxiety these couples often associate with reproduction. The female partner must undergo an in vitro fertilization cycle, and the eggs or embryos are then biopsied. Embryos which are unaffected by haemophilia can then be transferred to the uterus. The clear advantage of this technique is that the woman knows from the very beginning that the pregnancy is unaffected by haemophilia, and she can avoid conventional invasive prenatal diagnosis and the difficult decision on whether or not to terminate an affected pregnancy. Several strategies for this single cell genetic diagnosis have been described. These include embryonic sexing using polymerase chain reaction, embryonic sexing using fluorescent in situ hybridization, specific diagnosis using restriction enzymes, sequencing and haplotype analysis. Over the years, PGD has attracted much ethical commentary, both supportive and critical, regarding the fundamental principles of embryo selection and destruction. New scientific advances and their potential applications are considered.

Results

Study population

At the time of the analysis, 287 male PWHs (226 HA and 61 HB) were regularly followed at the HTC and causative genetic variants were known in all of them. In addition, 7 female PWHs were considered as probands (3 HA and 4 HB), meaning they were the first individuals to be diagnosed in their respective families. In total, 236 families (184 HA and 52 HB) were registered at the HTC. Twenty appointments at the bleeding disorders clinic were scheduled after the proactive outreach to unscreened potential and obligate carriers. Through retrospective and prospective data collection, 900 presumably alive female individuals could be identified.

An overview of the study population according to sex and hemophilia type and severity is shown in Figure 2. The mean age of male individuals was 39.9 years (range, 1–97) for HA and 40.2 years (range, 3–80) for HB, with 81.9% (n = 235) aged ≥ 18 years. The mean age of female individuals was 44.1 years (range, 1–99) for families with HA and 44.4 years (range, 5–101) for families with HB, with 90.2% (n = 450) aged ≥ 18 years. Date of birth was not known in 44.6% of female individuals (n = 401). At least 64 females (7.1%) were living abroad.

Figure 2.
Overview of the study cohort, comprising 236 families. In these families, there were ∼3 times as many female individuals who were potential or obligate carriers of hemophilia, based on their position in the family pedigree, compared with male probands. The severities of hemophilia affecting the families are depicted in red (severe), green (moderate), and blue (mild).

Female individuals were categorized into 4 priority groups based on their proximity to the nearest patient with hemophilia in the pedigree (Table 1). Group 1 comprised mothers, sisters, half-sisters (on the mother's side), daughters, and sporadic carriers (ie, carriers with no other known relatives affected by hemophilia); group 2 maternal aunts, nieces, and granddaughters; group 3 maternal grandmothers and cousins; and group 4 maternal grandaunts and grandcousins. Nine females could not be assigned to a specific priority group.

Case presentation

Case one

A boy born in May 2015 was referred to our department because of recurrent bruises of varying sizes and locations, easy oozing and prolonged bleeding. He was circumcised in the first week of life and experienced little oozing. His parents are not consanguineous with no family history of bleeding disorder. Following a coagulation test which showed a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), he was diagnosed at the age of 8 months with severe haemophilia B (FIX assay 0.0029 U/mL). The child's mother was counselled extensively about the disease's nature, its expected course and complications. Additionally, she was educated on keeping a safe home environment to prevent trauma. The medical staff also discussed with her the possibility of starting a prophylactic replacement therapy after 1 year of her child's life, in case he developed any joint bleeds.

Many issues affect hemophilia care providers when managing bleeding episodes in individuals with hemophilia. A diverse group of hemophilia providers from the United States met at two workshops to discuss the issues influencing treatment choices in the current millennium and to learn about current advances in treatment of hemophilia. This paper provides a summary of the discussions at these workshops. Despite the progress made in the management of patients with hemophilia, the workshop highlighted the fact that there were still many unanswered questions.

3.4 Current bleeding phenotype (bleeding symptoms in the year prior to inclusion)

Overall, 153 of 399 (38.3%) men and 215 of 623 (34.5%) women had a bleeding episode requiring hemostatic treatment in the year prior to inclusion in the study (p = 0.213) (Fig. 3 C). In adult patients, there was no difference in bleeding requiring treatment in the year prior to inclusion between men and women, respectively 112 (36.8%) vs 190 (35.1%) (p = 0.616). In children (< 18 years), boys seemed to have more often bleeding requiring treatment in the year prior to inclusion compared to girls, although not statistically significant, respectively 41 boys (43.2%) vs 24 girls (29.6%) (p = 0.064). After adjustment for age and type of disease, boys seemed to have almost a two times higher chance for bleeding requiring treatment in the year prior to inclusion in the study compared to girls: OR = 1.9 (1.0; 3.6).

### Treatment of hemophilia: a qualitative study of mothers' perspectives [^111CBXpA]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In Norway, boys with hemophilia usually begin treatment after their first bleeding episode. Boys with severe hemophilia usually start prophylactic treatment around 18–24 months. Health professionals administer factor concentrate initially, but when boys are around 4 years old most parents start treating their children at home. There is a lack of research on how parents, and especially how carrier mothers, experience the medical treatment for their sons' hemophilia. Our aim was to investigate how carrier mothers experience this treatment in the hospital setting and at home.

Methods

In this qualitative study, we interviewed 16 mothers of boys or men with hemophilia A or B. Data were collected via semistructured interviews and analyzed using an inductive thematic analytical approach.

Results

Mothers experienced both practical and emotional challenges in relation to their sons' treatment, and repeated venipuncture was especially difficult emotionally. Parents preferred home treatment to hospital treatment because it was less time-consuming, less disruptive to family life, and provided a greater sense of control. Encountering healthcare professionals who were unfamiliar with hemophilia was a second major stress factor, especially when parents felt that health professionals lacked competence and were unwilling to seek advice.

Conclusion

While home treatment for hemophilia enables freedom, flexibility, and autonomy for the boys as well as for the family, mothers may experience treatment of hemophilia as a burden. Health professionals should provide tailored practical and emotional support to parents by probing into their experiences with treating their sons' hemophilia.

### The rare inherited coagulation disorders [^1143GTCa]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

The rare inherited coagulation disorders (RICD) are uncommon and thus not well-defined in terms of severity or management. Inheritance is autosomal; in some of these disorders in the heterozygote state affected individuals may be mildly symptomatic. Severe deficiencies are more common in association with consanguinity. Factor X and factor XIII deficiency have the most severe manifestations, while factor XI deficiency is the least severe. Factor VII and factor XI deficiencies show a poor relationship between the factor level and bleeding risk. Unlike hemophilia, women are equally affected by these RICD and can have problems related to menstruation and childbirth.

### Hemophilia B: molecular pathogenesis and mutation analysis [^115LJrKd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Hemophilia phenotype

Phenotype in affected males

Hemophilia B symptoms include prolonged bleeding and easy bruising. Bleeding into joints and sometimes muscles can occur, accompanied by pain and swelling. Bleeding can be from the nose, can result from cuts, tooth extraction, surgery, or trauma, may continue for a prolonged period, and can restart after stopping. Bleeding can affect the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. Spontaneous bleeding generally only affects severely/moderately affected patients, who will often experience their first bleed during their first 2 years, with the first bleed sometimes occurring after circumcision. In contrast, mildly affected males may not be diagnosed until later in life.

Hemophilia B severity

There has been some speculation that the symptoms of hemophilia B may be less severe than those of hemophilia A 13. A recent study of children with severe and moderate hemophilia A (n = 679) and hemophilia B (n = 123) showed that there was no significant difference in bleeding between patients with the two disease types during their first 75 exposure days 14. The factors compared included age at first bleed, age at diagnosis, and age at first exposure to factor concentrate. A study of older individuals examining the rate of joint arthroplasty 15 found that the risk of arthroplasty was higher among patients with severe hemophilia A than among those with severe hemophilia B, with a hazard ratio of 2.65, and a 95% confidence interval of 1.62–4.33 (P < 0.001). Results were adjusted for age, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus and inhibitor status in a Cox regression model. Schulman 16 used a hemophilia severity score combining annual joint bleed incidence, orthopedic joint score and concentrate consumption, and collected data between 1990 and 1999 on 100 adult and adolescent patients with hemophilia of all severities without an inhibitor history to document bleeding. Scores from 0 to 0.94 were higher in patients with severe hemophilia A than in those with severe hemophilia B (medians of 0.50 and 0.24; P = 0.031). The higher prevalence of missense mutations in hemophilia B provides biological evidence for it having lower severity than hemophilia A, although clinical evidence is limited.

### The experiences and attitudes of hemophilia carriers around pregnancy: a qualitative systematic review [^117HZS7a]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

3.2.6 Preimplantation genetic diagnosis

HCs were positive about the possibility of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), except for HCs who rejected PGD based on religious beliefs. Furthermore, HCs were mostly neutral toward embryo selection, but were against the destruction of remaining embryos. 43

3.2.7 Termination of pregnancy

TOP was regarded as an individual decision by HCs. 43 Family experiences with hemophilia influenced this decision: those with positive experiences felt that hemophilia does not justify TOP, that hemophilia is not severe enough and that the disease is manageable 15, 38, 40, 43:

Why do they talk about that [termination]? Is that an issue?

Norwegian hemophilia carrier 40

Some women preferred not to become pregnant again or to leave the outcome to chance rather than choose TOP in the case of an affected child. 15 Women with negative family experiences supported TOP. 41 Yet, these women still experienced TOP as difficult and felt guilty about their decision. 41 Women expressed the need for professional psychological support after TOP. 37 Religious beliefs played an important role in decisions around TOP. 43

3.2.8 Pregnancy

HCs reported pregnancy with a bleeding disorder as difficult and fearful. 37, 40 Furthermore, HCs whose pregnancies with healthy fetuses continued after prenatal diagnosis described their pregnancies as difficult and felt they needed professional emotional support. 37 No further information was available on this topic.

3.2.9 Childbirth and puerperium

No data were available on childbirth. Women were uncertain about the peripartum bleeding risks 15 and feared that doctors would not provide the right treatment. 40

One HC reported feeling desensitized to vaginal blood loss because of her heavy menstrual bleeding. In case of abnormal postpartum bleeding, she stated being more likely to believe the blood loss to be normal in contrast to bleeding from surgical wounds. 36 Another HC reported feelings of grief and guilt during the puerperium when her child was diagnosed with hemophilia, knowing that her son had inherited this from his mother. 43

With this optimistic scenario of hemophilia care and of patients' life-expectancy, particularly in comparison with other monogenic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, thalassemia and muscular dystrophy, in the first decade of the new millennium efforts were mainly addressed to the formidable and still unresolved challenges of the global availability and affordability of replacement therapy and to the more widespread implementation of prophylaxis. – On the other hand, relatively little effort has been made to develop new therapeutic products. In contrast, multiple new therapies designed to address the challenges and the gaps in the standard treatments are now being developed.

### The experiences and attitudes of hemophilia carriers around pregnancy: a qualitative systematic review [^117WiJiM]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Hemophilia carriers (HCs) face specific psychosocial challenges related to pregnancy, caused by their inherited bleeding disorder. Optimal support from healthcare providers can only be realized by exploring medical and psychological healthcare requirements.

Objective

To review all published evidence on the experiences and attitudes of HCs regarding reproductive decision‐making, prenatal diagnosis, pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium to provide an accessible overview of this information for health care providers.

Study selection

Cochrane library, PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched for original qualitative data. Two authors performed study selection, risk‐of‐bias assessment, data extraction, and data analysis through meta‐summary. The extracted themes were discussed within the research team.

Findings

Fifteen studies with an overall moderate quality were included. The following findings were identified: (a) Quality of life of family members with hemophilia influences reproductive decision‐making; (b) Genetic counselling is generally considered useful; (c) The development of a specialized carrier clinic is considered valuable; (d) HCs describe prenatal diagnosis as beneficial yet psychosocially challenging; and (e) noninvasive prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are predominantly considered beneficial. These findings are limited by the overall moderate quality of included studies and the possibly partly outdated results in the current era of hemophilia treatment.

Conclusions

Available qualitative literature on HCs around pregnancy focuses on genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis. Future studies are needed on the experiences and needs of HCs through pregnancy and puerperium as well as in light of emerging hemophilia diagnosis and treatment options.

### How hemophilia is inherited… [^115pX1DZ]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Most cases of hemophilia are inherited from a parent to a child.
- Because hemophilia genes are passed down on the X chromosome, males with hemophilia are much more likely to have serious bleeding symptoms than females.
- Because the genes affected in hemophilia are located on the X chromosome, bleeding symptoms in females with hemophilia are usually milder than those in males with hemophilia. Nonetheless, hemophilia has been found to have measurable impacts on joint mobility in females. X chromosome inheritance Both hemophilia A and hemophilia B are inherited in the same way, because both the genes for factor VIII and factor IX are located on the X chromosome.

A female can also have hemophilia if she inherits hemophilia alleles from both of her parents or if she inherits one hemophilia allele and her other X chromosome is missing or does not work properly. Females with these types of inheritance patterns are as likely as males with hemophilia to have severe bleeding symptoms. If a mother is heterozygous for hemophilia and the father does not have hemophilia, each son has a 1 in 2 chance of getting his mother's hemophilia allele and having hemophilia. Each daughter has a 1 in 2 chance of getting her mother's hemophilia allele and being heterozygous. A father who has hemophilia passes his only X chromosome down to all of his daughters. The daughters will always get his hemophilia allele and be heterozygous. A father passes down his Y chromosome to his sons. Fathers cannot pass down a hemophilia allele to sons. Without the hemophilia allele, the sons will not have hemophilia and can't pass it down to their children.

Overall, there is a 1 in 2 chance that the child of a father who has hemophilia will be a son who does not have hemophilia and a 1 in 2 chance that the child will be a daughter who is heterozygous. This is true if the mother does not have a hemophilia allele herself. That would be very rare.

### P. Tyr365Cys change in factor VIII: haemophilia A, but not as we know it [^1173YuBE]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Haemophilia A is caused by a reduction in clotting factor VIII (FVIII). FVIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C) can be measured by three methods; the one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time-based clotting assay, the two-stage Xa generation-based clotting assay and the chromogenic Xa generation-based assay. The FVIII:C of most patients with haemophilia A are concordant regardless of the assay method employed. Up to a third of patients show assay discrepancy, usually with the two-stage and chromogenic assays being much lower than the one-stage assay. Very rarely, patients have been reported with lower one-stage compared to two-stage and chromogenic assays, but here we report that the mutation p. Tyr365Cys accounts for most of these patients and, at least in the UK, is not rare. We have identified this mutation in 23 different families. Affected male index individuals had a lower mean one-stage FVIII:C of 27iu/dl compared to two-stage FVIII:C mean of 77iu/dl. Affected individuals had minimal or absent bleeding symptoms and when these were present they were usually in patients with another co-inherited bleeding disorder. Affected individuals often had surgery without the need to correct the one-stage FVIII:C.

### Diagnosing hemophilia… [^113DLoMb]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Who should get tested or screened Families with a history of hemophilia Any family history of bleeding, such as following surgery or injury, or unexplained deaths among brothers, sisters, or male relatives such as maternal uncles, grandfathers, or cousins should be discussed with a doctor to see if hemophilia was a cause. A doctor will often get a thorough family history to find out if a bleeding disorder exists in the family. Some babies should be tested for hemophilia soon after birth, including
- Babies born to families with a history of hemophilia
- Babies whose mothers are carriers of hemophilia
- Babies who have bleeding symptoms at birth. Umbilical cord blood testing is better at finding low levels of factor VIII than it is at finding low levels of factor IX.

This is because factor IX levels take more time to develop and are not at a normal level until a baby is at least 6 months of age. Therefore, a mildly low level of factor IX at birth does not necessarily mean that the baby has hemophilia B. A repeat test when the baby is older might be needed in some cases. Learn more about the inheritance pattern for hemophilia. Families with no previous history of hemophilia About 1 in 3 babies who are diagnosed with hemophilia have no other family members with the disorder. A doctor might check for hemophilia in a newborn if. Table notes. The 2001 ISTH classification did not address individuals with clotting factor levels ≥ 40% but < 50%. However, bleeding has been observed in some individuals with clotting factor levels ≥ 40% and researchers are taking steps towards classifying these individuals.

In 2021, ISTH recommended the following terms for women and girls with an abnormal hemophilia gene who have a clotting factor level ≥ 40%: "symptomatic carrier" and "asymptomatic carrier". Women and girls with an abnormal hemophilia gene who have a clotting factor level < 40% are classified as having mild, moderate, or severe hemophilia depending on their exact clotting factor level.

The meaning and purpose of genetic counselling was difficult for HCs to understand. 15, 38 Once understood, there was a vast interest in receiving genetic counselling. 15, 38 A specialized clinic for information on prenatal diagnosis, reproductive decisions, and risks would aid HCs during reproductive phases. 15, 38 Preferences for the structure of the counselling differed, so the extent of information provision, neutral information vs advice, and the provision of peer support should be voluntarily chosen by each HC. 38, 45

### Invisible bleeds: lived experiences and barriers to care for men with hemophilia [^116AxW6L]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Guidelines of the World Federation of Hemophilia support the provision of equitable, optimal care for people with hemophilia (PWH). However, limited research exists examining the lived experiences of PWH or the barriers to care they may encounter. The primary objective of this exploratory study was to describe the experiences of men with hemophilia in Canada.

Methods

We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using a semistructured interview guide and analyzed transcribed interviews using inductive thematic content analysis. Inclusion criteria were: age ≥ 18 years, English-speaking, and confirmed diagnosis of inherited hemophilia A or B.

Results

A total of 11 participants were interviewed. Median age was 39 years old (29–73 years old), and diagnoses included severe hemophilia A (n = 5), mild hemophilia A (n = 2), and severe hemophilia B (n = 4). Three primary themes arose: (1) impact on identity and daily life; (2) dynamic changes in treatment; and (3) barriers to care and identified needs. Major subthemes included chronic pain and activity limitation, psychosocial burden, and symptom normalization. Multidisciplinary care, coordinated surgical care, improved emergency care, and clear care plans were identified as ongoing needs.

Discussion

Men with hemophilia described significant symptom burden and areas of ongoing need. Collaborative efforts between hematologists, emergency room physicians, and surgeons to establish hospital-specific testing, treatment and referral guidelines, and regular hemophilia treatment center audits may help address these care gaps, providing more person-centered, equitable care. Future work is required to implement these strategies and monitor their effects.

### Genetic analysis of carrier status in female members of Japanese hemophilia families [^1161ezPb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Subject characteristics

The study included 69 hemophiliac male patients (48 HA and 21 HB) and 112 FFM (80 HA and 32 HB) from 72 families (50 HA and 22 HB; Table 1). The disease status was classified as severe in 40 of 48 (83%) HA and 11 of 21 (52%) HB patients.

TABLE 1
Subject characteristics

Note

In the 80 HA FFM, 75 (94%) were possible carriers and 5 (6%) were obligate carriers. In the 32 HB FFM, 27 (84%) were possible carriers and 5 (16%) were obligate carriers (Table 1). The family relationships of the HA FFM to the patients were: mothers (40%), sisters (29%), and others (e.g. aunts, cousins, grandmothers; 31%), while for the HB FFM these were: mothers (38%), sisters (25%), and others (38%). Before maternal genetic testing, 32 mothers gave birth to 33 boys with HA; in 27 (82%) there was no family history of hemophilia and as such these cases were considered to be sporadic hemophilia. For HB, 12 mothers gave birth to 12 HB boys, and of those, 10 (83%) had been considered sporadic hemophilia. At the time of consultation, 9 HA and 2 HB FFM were pregnant and preparing for deliveries.

The results of clinical interviews with 112 FFM on bleeding histories at the time of genetic testing included no answer (no appropriate answer or unsuccessful interviews) from 37 (46%) HA and 12 (38%) HB FFM, no bleeding from 29 (36%) HA and 14 (44%) HB FFM, and symptomatic bleeding from 14 (18%) HA and 6 (19%) HB FFM (Table 1).

### Parents' experiences with requesting carrier testing for their unaffected children [^113SqaE7]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

International guidelines generally recommend delaying genetic carrier testing in children until the child reaches the age of majority or is mature enough to be involved in the decision. Several studies have shown that carrier testing of children does occur in some instances, particularly in siblings of a child affected with a genetic condition. However, little research has explored parents' experiences with the testing process, the impact of knowing a child's carrier status, and whether parents communicate carrier information to their children.

Methods

Semistructured interviews were conducted with 33 parents of children who had one of three genetic conditions (cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy). Inductive content analysis was used to analyze the data.

Results

Eight distinct pathways to carrier testing were distinguishable. While some parents had requested testing, others had been offered testing and some had received carrier results incidentally following testing to exclude affected status. Some parents were discouraged from testing, which led to frustration. Overall, 67% of the parents had received carrier results for at least one child, and parents were happy to have results, even if their children were carriers.

Conclusion

Despite recommendations against carrier testing, this study provides evidence of varying practices and highlights a need to review the guidelines. Genet Med 18 12, 1199–1205.

### Familial nonrandom inactivation linked to the X inactivation centre in heterozygotes manifesting haemophilia a… [^114ghtFg]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

A basic tenet of the Lyon hypothesis is that X inactivation occurs randomly with respect to parental origin of the X chromosome. Yet, nonrandom patterns of X inactivation are common - often ascertained in women who manifest recessive X-linked disorders despite being heterozygous for the mutation. Usually, the cause of skewing is cell selection disfavouring one of the cell lineages created by random X inactivation. We have identified a three generation kindred, with three females who have haemophilia A because of extreme skewing of X inactivation. Although they have both normal and mutant factor VIII (FVIII) alleles, only the mutant one is transcribed; and, they share an XIST allele that is never transcribed. The skewing in this case seems to result from an abnormality in the initial choice process, which prevents the chromosome bearing the mutant FVIII allele from being an inactive X.

### Proactive systematic hemophilia carrier screening: a step toward gender equity in hemophilia care [^113rodP1]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition to screening the highest possible number of potential carriers in our cohort, our study's second objective was to compare carriers of HA and HB in various aspects. We observed similarities in the circumstances of diagnosis, with both groups having a similar proportion of carriers having had genetic testing and an average age at diagnosis of around 30 years. Within our cohort, female individuals with mild hemophilia were diagnosed, on average, 7 years later than their male counterparts with mild hemophilia (mean age at diagnosis of 18.2 years), highlighting the diagnostic delays frequently experienced by women with bleeding disorders. Considering the significant implications of carrier status for family planning, there is evidently a need for earlier detection of carriers. The ideal timing of genetic testing is debated and influenced by local legal frameworks, especially regarding testing minors. Authors of the European principles of care for women and girls with inherited bleeding disorders advise to perform genetic testing in adolescence or early adulthood and in certain cases it may be envisaged in children. Ideally, the genetic status should be known before pregnancy to enable informed reproductive choices. Today, hemophilia carriers have various reproductive choices, including preimplantation and prenatal diagnostics. These options empower them to make informed decisions regarding pregnancies, enabling them to prevent or choose to terminate a pregnancy if it is found that the child may have hemophilia or to simply be prepared for precautionary measures that will be taken during delivery and for a life with a child with hemophilia.

### Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of hemophilia by microfluidics digital PCR analysis of maternal plasma DNA [^112Zt5Lr]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder with X-linked inheritance. Current prenatal diagnostic methods for hemophilia are invasive and pose a risk to the fetus. Cell-free fetal DNA analysis in maternal plasma provides a noninvasive mean of assessing fetal sex in such pregnancies. However, the disease status of male fetuses remains unknown if mutation-specific confirmatory analysis is not performed. Here we have developed a noninvasive test to diagnose whether the fetus has inherited a causative mutation for hemophilia from its mother. The strategy is based on a relative mutation dosage approach, which we have previously established for determining the mutational status of fetuses for autosomal disease mutations. In this study, the relative mutation dosage method is used to deduce whether a fetus has inherited a hemophilia mutation on chromosome X by detecting whether the concentration of the mutant or wild-type allele is overrepresented in the plasma of heterozygous women carrying male fetuses. We correctly detected fetal genotypes for hemophilia mutations in all of the 12 studied maternal plasma samples obtained from at-risk pregnancies from as early as the 11th week of gestation. This development would make the decision to undertake prenatal testing less traumatic and safer for at-risk families.

### A new hemophilia carrier nomenclature to define hemophilia in women and girls: communication from the SSC of the ISTH [^114GJqtY]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

Hemophilia A and B predominantly direct clinical attention to males due to X‐linked inheritance. This common knowledge introduces a bias toward female carriers being asymptomatic. Due to lyonization, a random interindividual X‐linked inactivation process, median plasma factor VIII/IX (FVIII/IX) levels of hemophilia carriers (HCs) are 0.60 IU/ml (range 0.05–2.19), and 28% have factor levels < 0.40 IU/ml, which would be defined as hemophilia according to the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH). The common misconception by patients and health‐care providers (HCPs) that all HCs are asymptomatic is shifting, due to an increasing body of evidence that contradicts this assumption. The term HC, and its associated connotations, such as obligate and possible carriers, has hampered diagnosis, management, and research.

For each man with hemophilia, 1.6 female carriers can be identified. In the US surveillance database, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Community Counts, only 0.5% of severe, 1.4% of moderate, and ~20% of mild cases are female. In countries with lower health‐care resources, where not every male patient with hemophilia may be identified, it is likely that many more women with hemophilia remain undiagnosed.

In most instances, as in men, hemophilia in women is due to an inherited variant on a single X chromosome. Variability in factor levels among HCs is poorly understood and more research is needed to find out whether there is a relationship between the type of gene mutation and plasma FVIII/IX level in HCs. Rarely, a woman may inherit an affected X chromosome from both parents, leading to full expression of the hemophilia variant's severity, or exhibit moderate/severe hemophilia due to an extremely skewed X chromosome inactivation pattern. In addition, approximately one in four HCs with normal FVIII/IX levels > 0.50 IU/ml have an increased bleeding tendency. In hemophilia A carriers this may in part be due to an impaired FVIII response to hemostatic stress. The increased bleeding tendency in HCs typically manifests as excessive mucocutaneous bleeding; bleeding after dental work, surgery, or childbirth; as well as joint bleeds with impaired joint health and consequent poor quality of life.

### Determining common variants in patients with haemophilia A in south Vietnam and screening female carriers in their family members [^115B37jW]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Haemophilia A (HA) is known as an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by inherited or spontaneous variants in the F8 gene. Severe HA (concentration of FVIII < 0.01 IU/mL)was characterised by frequent spontaneous haemorrhage or abnormal bleeding after an injury or surgical intervention, and it was possibly life-threatening without timely diagnosis. Typically, this disease, identified by coagulation factor assay and clinical evaluations, causes heavy and prolonged bleeding symptoms for men. In female carriers (FCs), bleeding symptoms can manifest unclearly and occur in cases such as operations, tooth extractions, tonsillectomy and primary postpartum haemorrhage. It is necessary to assess bleeding risk for HA carriers to give early diagnosis and support medical care. However, measurement of coagulation factor activity levels in patients with mild HA and FC are not simple. Mild HA cases have FVIII activity levels between 0.5 and 0.40 IU/mL, and others have nearly normal levels (over 0.40 IU/mL). In women, concentration of FVIII is changed by factors including age, ABO blood type, menstrual cycle, pregnancy and physiological condition.FCs may be asymptomatic but are at risk of transferring the haemophilia mutant gene to their sons. Thus, some studies recommended that genetic analysis should be performed as soon as possible to determine accurate variants in F8 gene for women in haemophilia family and prevent serious complications for patients with HA.

Patient Information

RECOMBINATE

[Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)]

This leaflet summarizes important information about RECOMBINATE. Please read it carefully before using this medicine. This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider, and it does not include all of the important information about RECOMBINATE. If you have any questions after reading this, ask your healthcare provider.

What is the most important information I need to know about RECOMBINATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)]?

Do not attempt to do an infusion to yourself unless you have been taught how by your doctor or hemophilia center.

You must carefully follow your doctor's or other healthcare provider's instructions regarding the dose and schedule for infusing RECOMBINATE so that your treatment will work best for you.

What is RECOMBINATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)]?

RECOMBINATE is a medicine used to replace a clotting factor (Factor VIII or antihemophilic factor) that is missing in people with hemophilia A (also called "classic" hemophilia). Hemophilia A is an inherited bleeding disorder that prevents blood from clotting normally.

RECOMBINATE is used to prevent and control bleeding in people with hemophilia A.

RECOMBINATE is not used to treat von Willebrand's Disease.

Who should not use RECOMBINATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)]?

You should not use RECOMBINATE if you

are allergic to mouse, hamster or bovine proteins.
are allergic to any ingredients in RECOMBINATE.

Tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or breast-feeding because RECOMBINATE may not be right for you.

How should I use RECOMBINATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)]?

RECOMBINATE is given directly into the blood stream.

You may infuse RECOMBINATE at a hemophilia treatment center, at your healthcare provider's office or in your home. You should be trained on how to do infusions by your hemophilia treatment center or healthcare provider. Many people with hemophilia A learn to infuse their RECOMBINATE by themselves or with the help of a family member.

Your healthcare provider will tell you how much RECOMBINATE to use based on your weight, the severity of your hemophilia A, and where you are bleeding.

You may have to have blood tests done after getting RECOMBINATE to be sure that your blood level of Factor VIII is high enough to clot your blood.

Call your healthcare provider right away if your bleeding does not stop after taking RECOMBINATE.

3.2.3 Prenatal diagnosis in general

Choices regarding prenatal diagnosis are again based on experiences with the clinical severity of hemophilia within the family and prenatal diagnosis experiences of family members. 15, 39, 40, 41 Those women who did not choose prenatal diagnosis had often seen satisfactory experiences with hemophilia and readily accepted hemophilia as part of their lives, or opted out of prenatal diagnosis due to religious beliefs. 15, 35, 40, 44

We were offered amniocentesis to check if [the baby had] haemophilia so [I] can make my choice, but [we] said no. We would accept what were given.

South African hemophilia carrier 15

Women tended to be concerned about the consequences of prenatal diagnosis, especially the potential risks of the procedure and the choices to be made when results became known. 32, 35, 41, 43 Prenatal diagnosis was believed to be beneficial for obstetrical care and emotional preparation for having an affected child. 34, 35, 43 Women preferred testing to take place early in pregnancy, when no fetal movements were yet felt and pregnancy was not visible. HCs appreciated prenatal diagnosis as it facilitated subsequent decision‐making. 32, 39, 41

Women who had experience with prenatal diagnosis would opt for it again during subsequent pregnancies. 37 Confirmation of expecting a healthy child was received with happiness and relief. 32, 37, 41 The diagnosis of an affected child resulted in sadness, disappointment, and a burden of subsequent decisions. 37, 40, 41, 43

### Genetic analysis of carrier status in female members of Japanese hemophilia families [^111nTqUH]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Genetic characteristics and genetic carrier diagnosis in Japanese hemophilia female carriers have not been evaluated.

Objectives

To provide genetic information on Japanese hemophilia female carriers and demonstrate the advantages of genetic testing in carrier diagnosis.

Methods

DNA sequencing combined with long polymerase chain reaction for inversion and multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification for large mutations.

Results

Genetic analysis was performed in 69 male hemophiliac patients (48 hemophilia A [HA] and 21 hemophilia B [HB]) and 112 female family members (FFM) (80 from 50 families with HA and 32 from 22 families with HB). In 72 hemophiliac families, the identified F8 mutations were inversion (42%), missense (26%), and other variations (32%), while 74% of F9 mutations were point mutations. Among the 112 FFM, 53/80 (66%) with HA and 21/32 (66%) with HB were diagnosed genetically as carriers based on detection of heterozygous mutations. Low factor VIII activity (FVIII:C) levels (< 50 IU/dL) were detected in only 10% of gene‐confirmed carriers, suggesting that FVIII:C is not suitable for HA carrier prediction. Low FVIII/von Willebrand factor ratio (< 0.9) was observed in 67% of gene‐confirmed carriers. Half of the gene‐confirmed HB carriers had low FIX:C (< 60 IU/dL). Importantly, 32 mothers of 37 sporadic cases (86%) (24/27 [89%] HA and 8/10 [80%] HB) showed the relevant mutations, suggesting low incidence of de novo mutations in males.

Conclusions

This study is the first to provide genetic information on Japanese hemophilia female carriers. Gene analysis is the gold standard for carrier diagnosis as it well identifies undetected female carriers based on pedigree information and hemostatic measurements.

### Genetic analysis of carrier status in female members of Japanese hemophilia families [^113zJzD8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hemophilia A and B are X‐linked recessive bleeding disorders resulting from more than 3000 and 1200 different DNA variants 1 encoding clotting factors VIII (FVIII) and IX (FIX), respectively. Females carrying the hemophilia mutant gene in one of the X chromosomes and a normal allele on the other X chromosome are defined as carriers. Hemophilia carriers are classically categorized as obligate carriers and possible carriers based on the pedigree information. Obligate carriers are women who: (1) have hemophiliac fathers, (2) have more than one hemophiliac son, (3) have a hemophiliac son and another hemophiliac relative in the maternal family. On the other hand, possible carriers are women who have only one hemophiliac son or a relative with known hemophilia or known carrier for hemophilia in the maternal family. The carrier status is usually determined by carrier diagnosis testing.

### A new hemophilia carrier nomenclature to define hemophilia in women and girls: communication from the SSC of the ISTH [^114ZW3GW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hemophilia A and B predominantly attracts clinical attention in males due to X‐linked inheritance, introducing a bias toward female carriers to be asymptomatic. This common misconception is contradicted by an increasing body of evidence with consistent reporting on an increased bleeding tendency in hemophilia carriers (HCs), including those with normal factor VIII/IX (FVIII/IX) levels. The term HC can hamper diagnosis, clinical care, and research. Therefore, a new nomenclature has been defined based on an open iterative process involving hemophilia experts, patients, and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) community. The resulting nomenclature accounts for personal bleeding history and baseline plasma FVIII/IX level. It distinguishes five clinically relevant HC categories: women/girls with mild, moderate, or severe hemophilia (FVIII/IX > 0.05 and < 0.40 IU/ml, 0.01–0.05 IU/ml, and < 0.01 IU/ml, respectively), symptomatic and asymptomatic HC (FVIII/IX ≥ 0.40 IU/ml with and without a bleeding phenotype, respectively). This new nomenclature is aimed at improving diagnosis and management and applying uniform terminologies for clinical research.

### Pitfalls in the diagnosis of hemophilia severity: what to do? [^116E7vmw]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Measurements of factor VIII coagulation activity (FVIII:C) may vary and result in misclassification of hemophilia A with delay in initiation of prophylactic treatment. We describe two young brothers who were diagnosed as moderate hemophilia patients and therefore not prophylactically treated with factor VIII concentrate despite frequent bleeding events. These findings emphasize the importance of (i) multiple measurements of FVIII:C by certified laboratories, (ii) adjustment of treatment when test results do not correspond to clinical symptoms, (iii) relevance of additional DNA mutation analysis in patients with hemophilia A, and (iv) treatment in centers with expertise.

### Genetic testing for children at risk to be hemophilia carriers [^111qYm96]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

Carriers for hemophilia are at risk for bleeding despite normal or mildly reduced factor 8 or factor 9 activity levels. Genetic testing is necessary to determine carrier status in those at risk and early identification of carriers can inform their bleeding risk. The aims of this single-center retrospective study were to determine the uptake of genetic testing in children at risk to be hemophilia carriers and identify barriers to completion of testing. We identified 64 unique at-risk children assigned female sex at birth under 18years old, with at least one caregiver participating in a visit between June 2019 and July 2023 with a genetic counselor with expertise in hemophilia. Of all those at risk, 27% (17/64) had undergone genetic testing prior to having genetic counseling at our center, at a median age of 5years. Of those who had not yet had genetic testing (47/64): insurance prior authorization was initiated for 49% (23/47), testing was completed for 28% (13/47) at a median age of 11years, and factor activity levels were known or drawn after the visit for 36% (17/47). The primary reason (14/24, 58%) for not initiating insurance prior authorization was not having a known family variant. Because carrier testing for X-linked disorders standardly involves targeted family variant testing rather than full gene testing, increasing the accessibility of carrier testing depends on increasing the accessibility and uptake of genetic testing in affected family members, usually individuals assigned male sex at birth, with a diagnosis of hemophilia. The impact of the decision to pursue genetic testing on current or future family members at risk to be carriers could be included in counseling discussions with individuals with hemophilia and their families.

### The experiences and attitudes of hemophilia carriers around pregnancy: a qualitative systematic review [^116L8KvS]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemophilia carriers (HCs) face specific psychosocial challenges related to pregnancy, caused by their inherited bleeding disorder. Optimal support from healthcare providers can only be realized by exploring medical and psychological healthcare requirements.

Objective

To review all published evidence on the experiences and attitudes of HCs regarding reproductive decision-making, prenatal diagnosis, pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium to provide an accessible overview of this information for health care providers.

Study Selection

Cochrane library, PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched for original qualitative data. Two authors performed study selection, risk-of-bias assessment, data extraction, and data analysis through meta-summary. The extracted themes were discussed within the research team.

Findings

Fifteen studies with an overall moderate quality were included. The following findings were identified: (a) Quality of life of family members with hemophilia influences reproductive decision-making; (b) Genetic counselling is generally considered useful; (c) The development of a specialized carrier clinic is considered valuable; (d) HCs describe prenatal diagnosis as beneficial yet psychosocially challenging; and (e) noninvasive prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are predominantly considered beneficial. These findings are limited by the overall moderate quality of included studies and the possibly partly outdated results in the current era of hemophilia treatment.

Conclusions

Available qualitative literature on HCs around pregnancy focuses on genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis. Future studies are needed on the experiences and needs of HCs through pregnancy and puerperium as well as in light of emerging hemophilia diagnosis and treatment options.

### Haemophilia: provision of factors and novel therapies: World Federation of Hemophilia goals and achievements [^117H7wbu]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

For nearly 50 years, the goal of the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) has been to achieve 'Treatment for All' patients with inherited bleeding disorders, regardless of where they live. With proper diagnosis, management and care, people with bleeding disorders can live perfectly healthy lives. Without treatment, the reality is that many will die young or, if they survive, suffer joint damage that leaves them with permanent disabilities. Only about 25% of the estimated 400 000 people with haemophilia worldwide receive adequate treatment. The percentage is far lower for those with von Willebrand Disease (VWD) and the rarer bleeding disorders. The achievements of the WFH to close the gap in care for people with bleeding disorders are measureable over time by using three key indicators; the difference in the estimated and actual number of people known with bleeding disorders, the amount of treatment products needed versus that available, and the number of people born with bleeding disorders and the number who reach adulthood. There are five essential elements to achieve a sustainable national care programme: ensuring accurate laboratory diagnosis, achieving government support, improving the care delivery system, increasing the availability of treatment products, and building a strong national patient organization.

### Proactive systematic hemophilia carrier screening: a step toward gender equity in hemophilia care [^1166DbX5]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

As emphasized by Gregory et al in 2007, ongoing screening efforts regarding hemophilia carriers and WGH are crucial, particularly amidst the diminishing frequency and shortening of patient-health care professional interactions thanks to novel therapeutics for hemophilia. The imperative to continually update pedigrees remains essential, given that even groundbreaking treatments such as gene therapy do not alter the hereditary nature of hemophilia. In addition, the transition of PWHs from pediatric to adult care marks a vulnerable phase during which keeping track of the patient's relatives becomes challenging. Furthermore, girls who underwent coagulation factor level assessments during childhood still require genetic testing later in life and should not be overlooked. Identified carriers, especially those experiencing abnormal bleeding, should benefit from regular follow-up at the HTC.

To conclude, this study, to our knowledge, represents the first reported initiative to systematically identify and screen (potential) hemophilia carriers among families of all PWHs followed at a single HTC. We have gained new insights into practical aspects of carrier diagnostics, while also identifying persistent challenges in providing comprehensive screening to relatives of PWHs. Initiatives similar to our study should be replicated by other HTCs internationally, given that they would represent a crucial step toward ensuring equitable access to hemophilia diagnosis and care for all potentially affected individuals, regardless of sex and gender.

Limitations

The main limitation of our study lies in the mostly retrospective nature of our data. Bleeding and hemostatic treatment data were coded as binary variables and no data on specific bleeding or treatment episodes were collected. Abnormal bleeding data were aggregated from patient-reported bleeding symptoms rather than using bleeding scores such as the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Bleeding Assessment Tool. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, we assume that individuals experiencing abnormal bleeding are more likely to seek specialized medical care, leading to selection bias in the reporting of bleeding symptom frequency in female relatives of PWHs. Only the lowest coagulation factor levels of each individual were considered for the analysis, and no adjustment was made for use of estrogen and/or progesterone treatments for contraceptive or substitutive purposes and for age. Coagulation factor levels measured during pregnancy were not taken into account. Establishing family pedigrees heavily relies on patient reports, and a certain degree of imprecision, particularly in large families, cannot be entirely eliminated.

### Proactive systematic hemophilia carrier screening: a step toward gender equity in hemophilia care [^1147fqYc]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In families with HA, the proportion of female individuals who have had genetic testing was 39.3%, 28.8%, and 35.0% in families with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia, respectively (P = 0.132). In families with HB, female individuals were more likely to be tested in families with moderate hemophilia (59.4%) than those with severe (32.6%) and mild hemophilia (30.9%) (P = 0.01); however, this difference can be attributed to the presence of 1 large family comprising 6 male persons with moderate HB and 22 female individuals, of whom most (n = 18, 82%) have had genetic testing.

The prevalence of genetic testing according to priority group is presented in Table 1.

### The aging patient with hemophilia [^111u6W6F]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

The prospects for many boys born with hemophilia today include a normal life expectancy and minimal to no joint disease. However, despite the availability of safe replacement clotting factor concentrates and effective antiviral treatment, the aging patient with hemophilia today faces many challenges. These include management of their hemophilia as well as the same age-related health issues as experienced in the general population. While increasing, data on the prevalence of comorbidities and their management in the hemophilia population remain limited. This review will focus on issues related to management of hemophilia and complications of cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, hepatic, and renal disease. Available research is summarized and potential approaches to management are discussed.

### Proactive systematic hemophilia carrier screening: a step toward gender equity in hemophilia care [^116bNgnd]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Despite numerous efforts to raise awareness, many hemophilia carriers and female persons with hemophilia (PWHs) remain undiagnosed. Between May 2021 and April 2023, we identified potential and obligate carriers of hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) by updating pedigrees of all PWHs followed at the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels. Retrospective data on previously screened females were collected, including bleeding history, coagulation factor levels, and testing for the proband's pathogenic variant. In addition, a proactive approach involved sending 125 invitation letters to unscreened or incompletely screened individuals, through related PWHs. In pedigrees of 287 male PWHs (226 HA and 61 HB) and 7 female index patients from 236 families (184 HA and 52 HB), a total of 900 female individuals were identified. Of those, 454 were obligate and/or genetically proven carriers, and 118 were noncarriers. Genetic testing was conducted in 133 obligate, 237 potential, and 4 sporadic carriers, with 190 obligate and 328 potential carriers remaining untested. Among carriers with known factor levels (261/454), 42 HA (23.0%) and 23 HB carriers (29.5%) had a factor level < 40 IU/dL. Carriers with a factor deficiency were screened on average 6 years earlier than other females (P = 0.034). This study, to our knowledge, represents the first systematic effort to identify potential carriers among families of all PWHs within a single center, emphasizing the challenges in comprehensive screening for female individuals genetically linked to one or more PWHs. Such initiatives are vital for achieving equitable access to hemophilia care for all potentially affected individuals, irrespective of gender. This trial was registered at www. ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT05217992.

### Challenges associated with access to recently developed hemophilia treatments in routine care: perspectives of healthcare professionals [^116aDQ3H]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hemophilia is a rare inherited bleeding disorder affecting more than 800,000 people, worldwide. The condition can be life-threatening, with joint bleeding being the most common complication, which can result in major disability and mobility issues and, in turn, reduced quality of life. To prevent mortality and morbidity, in many regions, prophylactic treatment is the current standard of care, and discussions on its optimization are ongoing. The landscape of recently developed novel therapeutic products, based on new mechanisms other than the replacement of deficient factor, have progressed rapidly in recent years. There are several hemostatic therapies (e.g. enhanced half-life clotting factor concentrates, non-factor hemostatic therapies, and gene therapy) that are already in place or are about to enter the therapeutic landscape. These treatments, however, are cost intensive and not necessarily universally accessible. Due to high development costs, recently developed treatments are generally more expensive than standard treatments. Despite the significant improvements that have been afforded by the use of factor prophylaxis, many persons with hemophilia do not have access to such therapies (e.g. ~20% to 30% in low- and middle-income countries).

### The factor VIII treatment history of non-severe hemophilia a… [^114mRvzS]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

4.4 Clinical implications

More insight into the natural course of non‐severe hemophilia A may provide us with valuable information to predict the treatment course of severe hemophilia A patients who are treated with prophylactic non‐replacement prophylaxis therapies. Compared with severe hemophilia A patients, who receive their first FVIII treatment at a median age of 10 to 12 months, our results suggest a considerable postponement of the age at first FVIII treatment when severe patients are converted to a non‐severe bleeding phenotype. 9, 23, 24

If the bleed and treatment profile in this non‐severe hemophilia A cohort would be equivalent to severe hemophilia A receiving prophylaxis with non‐replacement therapy, the postponement of the first 20 exposures could have implications for inhibitor surveillance in patients with severe hemophilia A.

Currently, pediatric centers are very methodical in inhibitor surveillance in the first 20 EDs through to 50 EDs, which happens within a relatively short time frame of months or only a couple of years after the first exposure. 25 Our data presented here suggest this time period for inhibitor surveillance will be spread out over years rather than months for the majority in the context of a non‐replacement prophylaxis agent. This would require important attention to detail and change in practice for continuity of care and inhibitor screening after each exposure.

In conclusion, this study on the treatment history of patients with non‐severe hemophilia A demonstrates that the age at first exposure to FVIII treatment increases with baseline FVIII activity and suggests that these patients rarely experience major spontaneous bleeds. Our data may provide insight into the expected effect of non‐replacement therapies in patients with severe hemophilia A, suggesting a considerable postponement of the age at initial FVIII treatment.

### Validation of PROMIS profile-29 in adults with hemophilia in the Netherlands [^115Pyimp]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The congenital bleeding disorder hemophilia causes recurrent bleeds into joints and muscles because of a deficiency in coagulation factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B). The condition predominantly affects males and is classified into mild (0.05–0.40 IU/ml), moderate (0.01–0.05 IU/ml), and severe (< 0.01 IU/ml) hemophilia, depending on the activity of factor VIII or IX. Individuals with severe hemophilia often suffer from spontaneous bleeds into joints and muscles, whereas those with mild hemophilia typically bleed when triggered by trauma or surgery. Treatment consists of coagulation factor replacement by intravenous injection to treat bleeds (episodic treatment) or to prevent bleeds (prophylaxis, defined as regular administration of a hemostatic agent, usually administered intravenously or subcutaneously). Recently, non‐factor replacement products have been marketed and gene therapy is under study.

Early forms of treatment had devastating effects on the hemophilia community: through contaminated plasma‐derived blood products, many patients were infected with HIV in the 1980s and/or hepatitis C virus before the 1990s. The availability of treatment has resulted in a near‐normal life expectancy and improved outcomes, but a potential side effect of factor replacement therapy is the development of neutralizing antibodies ("inhibitors") against the infused coagulation factor. Regular prophylaxis with factor replacement products is not effective in patients with inhibitors, and recently, prophylaxis with non‐factor replacement products has helped reduce the burden of bleeding. In addition, joint damage (hemophilic arthropathy), pain, and disability are still relatively common, especially among older males affected by severe hemophilia because of recurrent joint bleeding. Large differences in joint status and pain exist between individuals. It is important to measure and monitor these outcomes in persons with hemophilia to personalize health care.

### Mode of delivery in hemophilia: vaginal delivery and cesarean section carry similar risks for intracranial hemorrhages and other major bleeds [^113M8TJg]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Knowledge of carrier status in a pregnant woman, or the knowledge of confirmed hemophilia in the fetus following prenatal diagnosis (PND), may impact on obstetric care, especially when planning the mode of delivery. In recent cohorts, around 50% of all cases of hemophilia are sporadic, i.e. newly diagnosed boys without family history of hemophilia or without any knowledge of carrier status in the mother at birth. Many published studies on the delivery of a hemophilia child have not been able to distinguish between sporadic cases and cases with a known family history of hemophilia. Some studies include neonates with mild hemophilia and, furthermore, it is not always possible to distinguish between CS performed as a result of the baby having hemophilia or for other reasons, and this complicates comparisons between studies.

The PedNet Registry is a prospective, multicenter database that includes all children born since 1 st January 2000 diagnosed with hemophilia A (HA) or B (HB) of all severities and treated in the 31 participating hemophilia centers in Europe, Canada and Israel. Baseline data regarding the neonatal period are collected on mode of delivery, neonatal events, family history of hemophilia, and gestational age. This longitudinal prospectively collected cohort study makes it possible to address questions of interest on obstetric and neonatal issues.

The aim of this paper was to study the frequency of ICH and other major bleeds in neonates with hemophilia and the association with mode of delivery to improve counseling of pregnant carriers in the future. Furthermore, the results will be stratified according to the presence or absence of a prior knowledge of hemophilia in the family.

### Hemophilia therapy: the future has begun [^116kTF1e]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Among the more than 6,000 human diseases caused by single gene defects, the plasma deficiencies of coagulation proteins are of great importance to the hematologist, entailing as they do a lifelong bleeding tendency with important morbidity and mortality if not adequately managed. Inherited coagulation deficiencies are rare diseases according to the definitions adopted in the United States (less than 200,000 cases nationwide) and Europe (less than 5 cases per 10,000 persons in the general population). The hemophilias are clinically relevant rare diseases: hemophilia A (HA), which results from the deficiency or dysfunction of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), and hemophilia B (HB) of factor IX (FIX). Both are due to mutations in genes located on chromosome X and thus largely affect males, with bleeding symptoms roughly proportional to the degree of factor deficiency in plasma. The main sites of spontaneous bleeding are joints and muscles, which, if inadequately treated, cause chronic damage to the musculoskeletal system resulting in severe handicaps and disability. Furthermore, trauma and surgical interventions are accompanied by uncontrolled bleeding.

A recent report on the worldwide distributionshows that the hemophilias are more frequent than previously estimated: 17.1 cases per 100,000 males with HA for all degrees of FVIII deficiency, 3.8 cases per 100,000 of HB, with a prevalence of 6 per 100,000 for HA and 1.1 per 100,000 for HB of cases with complete plasma factor deficiency, and thus a more severe clinical phenotype (Table 1). Inherited coagulation disorders are much rarer. These are due to defects in genes encoding other factors, such as fibrinogen, prothrombin, factors V, VII, X, XI and XIII. The defective genes are transmitted with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and thus affect both sexes at similar rates. Prevalence rates in the general population range between 1 case per 500,000 for the more frequent factor VII deficiency and 1 in 2–3 million for the rarest prothrombin and factor XIII deficiencies (Table 1).

Little evidence exists regarding medical abortion for women with inherited bleeding disorders. A 21-year-old primigravid hemophilia A carrier desired a medical abortion. After counseling, she chose medical abortion, which occurred without excess bleeding or surgical intervention.

Haemophilia, pain, and the family

The diagnosis of haemophilia within a family was for some parents a catastrophic disruption to life. A child with haemophilia meant that they were required to blindly navigate imperfect medical care as well as trying to provide the best parental care and protection they could, at a time when knowledge and medical provision were scarce:

… diagnosed at six weeks old – I think, from memory – it came as a complete shock to my parents. They'd never heard of haemophilia or how to cope with it, or how to manage me. I was their son. I was in incredible pain a lot of the time. (Ivan, 73)

Living with haemophilia and the bleeding episodes was disruptive to family life, familial roles, and relationships. The child with haemophilia brought with it responsibilities and need for management that was more than what would be seen normally within most families at the time. Anxiety of having to disclose a bleed to a parent for fear of an angry response, resulted in many hours of no treatment and increasing pain:

And my dad was like really strict, so what I'd do is, if I hurt myself, I'd try and treat myself, like get… like try and… "Oh God, I've got to tell him, I've got to tell him". And then the ambulance would come, like half eleven at night, and I'd make it worse, and I'd have to be in hospital. (Jack, 57)

Pain associated with haemophilia was an ever present and normalised feature within the family unit whilst growing up. How participants experienced, reported, and behaved with pain has evolved into their adult lives, continuing to be a feature in their own families now. Some feel that their pain is a personal experience not to be shared or discussed with their partners or family, whilst others describe teaching vigilance of their pain to their children:

If it's a bad day, I will try and keep my son aware to some degree, so that he can understand if I'm snappy it's not because of something he's done. It's difficult because he's only eight… he knows his dad has issues in certain areas. (Will 52)

### What is a' serious' genetic condition? The perceptions of people living with genetic conditions [^112GoxQd]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

There was a high degree of ambivalence in responses to the statement 'PNS will lead to fewer people with [the condition] coming into the world who could have lived fulfilling lives', with 53% agreement overall, 18% disagreeing, and the remainder (29%) selecting neither or 'don't know'. Responses to whether 'it would be a loss to society to have fewer people with the condition' revealed even greater ambivalence, with significantly fewer people in support than in response to the question regarding fulfilling lives (35%, Chi = 52.74 p < 0.0001). Overall, 26% of all participants agreed with both statements, whereas 48% answered neither/don't know to at least one. Alex (46 years, haemophilia A), endorsed the viewpoint that people with his condition have much to contribute, " People with haemophilia have a lot to offer the world. They come with a unique perspective… They live with something that's not quite the norm… and we need people like that… they have insights and understandings that we need more of… not less".

Participants with SMA2, again, differed from the other groups, being most likely to consider it a loss to society to have fewer people with their condition coming into the world (64.3%) and that screening would prevent people being born who could have lived fulfilling lives (67.9%; 57% agreeing with both statements). Participants with SMA2 (who also perceived the lowest levels of suffering) were also least likely to agree (21.4%) and most likely to disagree (54.5%) with the statement 'PNS can prevent unnecessary suffering'. Claire (30 years, SMA2), commented, "I don't think SMA causes suffering… Perhaps the parents suffer because they were thinking their child would be fine.… Certainly I don't know anyone with type II who would say they're suffering… I think that's perhaps just an idea about disability that people put on us… unnecessarily, you know [laughs] because we're fine!

### About hemophilia… [^112DCgta]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

The most common types of hemophilia are inherited and, therefore, are present from birth. In rare cases, a person can develop hemophilia later in life. This is known as acquired hemophilia. The majority of acquired hemophilia cases occur in middle-aged or elderly people, or young women who have recently given birth or are in the later stages of pregnancy. This condition often resolves with appropriate treatment. Data and Statistics Learn more data-based information about hemophilia diagnosis, treatment, treatment product safety, and diseases affecting people with hemophilia. Data and Statistics on Hemophilia. Causes Inherited hemophilia is caused by a mutation or change, in one of the genes, that provides instructions for making the clotting factors needed to form a blood clot. This change or mutation can prevent the clotting factor from working properly or to be missing altogether. These genes are located on the X chromosome.

Males have one X and one Y chromosome, and females have two X chromosomes. Males inherit the X chromosome from their mothers and the Y chromosome from their fathers. Females inherit one X chromosome from each parent. The X chromosome contains many genes that are not present on the Y chromosome. This means that males only have one copy of most of the genes on the X chromosome, while females have two copies. Therefore, males can have hemophilia if they inherit an affected X chromosome that has a mutation in either the factor VIII or factor IX gene. Females can also have hemophilia, but this is much rarer. In these cases, females can have one X chromosome that is affected and one X chromosome that is not affected, or both of their X chromosomes can be affected. A female with one affected X chromosome is a "carrier" of hemophilia. Sometimes a female who is a carrier can have symptoms of hemophilia.

In addition, she can pass the affected X chromosome with the clotting factor gene mutation on to her children. Keep Reading: How Hemophilia is Inherited. Diagnosis Many people who have or have had family members with hemophilia will ask that their babies get tested soon after birth. About one third of babies who are diagnosed with hemophilia have a new mutation not present in other family members. In these cases where there is no family history of hemophilia, a doctor might check for hemophilia if a baby is showing signs of hemophilia.

### Establishing the prevalence and prevalence at birth of hemophilia in males: a meta-analytic approach using national registries [^1158soMQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The large observed variability in hemophilia prevalence prevents robust estimation of burden of disease.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence and prevalence at birth of hemophilia and the associated life expectancy disadvantage.

Design

Random-effects meta-analysis of registry data.

Setting

Australia, Canada, France, Italy, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Participants

Male patients with hemophilia A or B.

Measurements

Prevalence of hemophilia as a proportion of cases to the male population, prevalence of hemophilia at birth as a proportion of cases to live male births by year of birth, life expectancy disadvantage as a 1 - ratio of prevalence to prevalence at birth, and expected number of patients worldwide based on prevalence in high-income countries and prevalence at birth.

Results

Prevalence (per 100 000 males) is 17.1 cases for all severities of hemophilia A, 6.0 cases for severe hemophilia A, 3.8 cases for all severities of hemophilia B, and 1.1 cases for severe hemophilia B. Prevalence at birth (per 100 000 males) is 24.6 cases for all severities of hemophilia A, 9.5 cases for severe hemophilia A, 5.0 cases for all severities of hemophilia B, and 1.5 cases for severe hemophilia B. The life expectancy disadvantage for high-income countries is 30% for hemophilia A, 37% for severe hemophilia A, 24% for hemophilia B, and 27% for severe hemophilia B. The expected number of patients with hemophilia worldwide is 1 125 000, of whom 418 000 should have severe hemophilia.

Limitation

Details were insufficient to adjust for comorbid conditions and ethnicity.

Conclusion

The prevalence of hemophilia is higher than previously estimated. Patients with hemophilia still have a life expectancy disadvantage. Establishing prevalence at birth is a milestone toward assessing years of life lost, years of life with disability, and burden of disease.

### Hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) [^111siAk7]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Remarkable changes are occurring in the diagnosis and management of individuals with hemophilia A. Genetic testing, including next-generation sequencing, enables family planning, carrier testing, and prenatal diagnosis. Musculoskeletal ultrasound examination facilitates the early detection of acute bleeds and joint disease in clinic, enabling more rapid bleed resolution and treatment planning. Novel therapies offer simpler weekly or monthly administration, some by subcutaneous injection, with better compliance and quality of life, as well as fewer bleeds. Gene therapy provides a 1-time phenotypic "cure" that is cost effective, but may be complicated by waning levels, vector immune responses, and hepatotoxicity.

### Coagulation factor IX (recombinant) (Ixinity) [^1164o3UD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

How should I infuse IXINITY?

IXINITY is given directly into the bloodstream. IXINITY should be administered as ordered by your healthcare provider. You should be trained on how to do infusions by your healthcare provider or hemophilia treatment center. Many people with hemophilia B learn to infuse their IXINITY by themselves or with the help of a family member.

See the step-by-step guide (Instructions for Use) provided at the end of this leaflet.

Your healthcare provider will tell you how much IXINITY to use based on your weight, the severity of you hemophilia B, and where you are bleeding. You may have to have blood tests done after getting IXINITY to be sure that your blood level of factor IX is high enough to stop the bleeding. Call you healthcare provider right away if your bleeding does not stop after taking IXINITY.

What are the possible side effects of IXINITY?

Allergic reactions may occur with IXINITY. Call your healthcare provider or get emergency treatment right away if you get any of the following symptoms: rash, hives, itching, tightness of the throat, chest pain or tightness, difficulty breathing, light-headedness, dizziness, nausea, or fainting.

Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away.

### Proactive systematic hemophilia carrier screening: a step toward gender equity in hemophilia care [^113oMLk4]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study was conducted at the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium, from May 2021 to April 2023 and was approved by the local ethics committee. It was registered at(identifier: NCT05217992). The study consisted of both a retrospective and a prospective arm.

While conducting a retrospective data analysis of electronic medical records, we used data acquired through routine carrier screening of female relatives of PWHs. These data included FVIII and FIX levels, genetic testing results, bleeding history, hemostatic treatment history, and family pedigrees. Only data from female individuals presumed to be alive at the start of the study were included in the analysis.

In addition to this retrospective analysis and to further enhance the screening of female relatives of PWHs, we adopted a proactive and systematic approach to reach out to previously unscreened or incompletely screened individuals. During personal contacts with PWHs regularly followed at the HTC (referred to as "probands" hereafter), either during clinical follow-up visits or telephone interviews, pedigrees of probands were analyzed and unscreened potential and obligate carriers of hemophilia were identified, complementing the pedigree information gathered during the retrospective part of the study. Probands were provided with a total of 125 invitation letters to our study, either in paper or electronic form, and were asked to forward these to the unscreened female individuals in their families.

Respondents to the invitation were seen at the clinic, in which their general medical and bleeding history were taken, individual bleeding risk was determined, and coagulation factor levels (FVIII, von Willebrand factor [VWF] Antigen [Ag] and VWF Ristocetin Cofactor activity [RCo] for HA; FIX for HB) were assessed. Coagulation factor levels were measured using a 1-stage assay, a chromogenic assay, or both. For the statistical analysis, the lowest level recorded for each patient was used, regardless of the assay method used. With the informed consent of the participant, genetic testing for the proband's pathogenic variant was performed. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc (Comité d'éthique hospitalo-facultaire) in Brussels, Belgium.

### First report of inherited protein S deficiency caused by paternalmosaicism [^113CB69e]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 3.
Quantification of variant allele ratios in blood- and saliva-derived DNA using pyrosequencing. (A) Sequences of the primers. The results of variant allele ratios quantified by pyrosequencing of blood-derived DNA (B) and saliva-derived DNA (C) from the proband and family members. The gray area shows the allele ratio of A and C at the variant locus. Since pyrosequencing was performed using reverse primers, the allele ratio of C represents the variant allele ratio.

In recent years, some cases of various diseases that were originally considered to be caused by de novo variants have actually been attributed to parental somatic or gonadal mosaicism. Since the sensitivity of variation detection in Sanger sequencing, considered the standard for evaluating PROS1 variants, is limited to approximately 15–20%, heterozygous variants can be detected but mosaicisms are likely to be undetectable. Thus, another more sensitive method, such as dPCR or pyrosequencing, is needed for the genetic evaluation of parental mosaicism. In this study, we detected a mosaic variant in the father of two heterozygous sisters with PS deficiency. This is the first case of parental mosaicism in an inherited PS-deficient family, suggesting that parental mosaicism may exist among some patients who have been thought to have de novo variants of inherited thrombophilia. It has been reported that approximately 20% of sporadic cases of hemophilia A, as determined by traditional Sanger sequencing methods, have an asymptomatic mosaic mother. The percentage of parental mosaicism present in sporadic cases of inherited PS deficiency needs to be determined by accumulating more cases in the future.

In conclusion, in cases of autosomal-dominant inherited thrombophilia, when the causative variant is detected only in the proband and a de novo variant is suspected, it is necessary to investigate the presence of parental mosaicism. For this purpose, it is very informative to quantify the variant allele ratio using multiple readily accessible specimens, such as blood, saliva, hair follicles, and urine to confirm the parental mosaicism. Furthermore, semen analysis should be performed as genetic screening for germline mosaicism in fathers of patients with de novo variants, and this analysis could be useful for prenatal counseling. In sporadic cases of inherited diseases, even if neither parent has the same variant using traditional sequencing methods, confirming the mosaicism of the parents is very important regarding the recurrence risk for the patient's siblings and is essential information for genetic counseling.

### Genetic analysis of carrier status in female members of Japanese hemophilia families [^116x6Ffp]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Sporadic hemophiliacs are defined as patients with negative family history, and they form about one third of all cases of hemophilia. 7 Kasper and Lin 30 reported that 88% of the mothers of the sporadic cases had the relevant mutation in their leukocytes, but only 19% of the maternal grandmothers carried the same mutation. Thus, the rate of de novo mutation was 12% among male sporadic hemophiliacs in the above study. In other studies, the reported rate of de novo mutation was 18% 31 and 28% 32 in children with sporadic hemophilia. In the present study, no hemophilia‐relevant mutation was found in 5 of 37 mothers of children with sporadic hemophilia. This finding indicates that sporadic hemophilia was due to de novo mutation in 14% (HA: 11%, HB: 20%) of male infants. Actually, in all families with hemophilia, the latter was associated with sporadic mutation at some point, but that could have been many generations ago. The above 14% represents the proportion of male hemophiliacs with de novo mutation and no family history of hemophilia. Therefore, the chance of de novo mutation in a boy with sporadic hemophilia is expected to be lower than that of his mother. Even in the absence of family history of hemophilia, the mother of a child with sporadic hemophilia might be found to have relevant high‐frequency mutation by genetic analysis. None of the maternal grandmothers involved in this study had inversion, although inversion was detected in two mothers of sporadic HA males in two unrelated families. It is possible that the inversion was generated during the process of gametogenesis in either of the maternal grandparents, based on the study of Becker et al. 32 who showed a higher frequency of inversion in males than females.

### Genetic analysis of carrier status in female members of Japanese hemophilia families [^116AZsE7]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Subjects

Genetic analysis was performed in 69 (48 HA and 21 HB) hemophiliac males (patients) and 112 (80 HA and 32 HB) female family members (FFM) among 72 (50 HA and 22 HB) families in 28 hemophilia treatment clinical facilities between 2007 and end of 2019 (see the Acknowledgments section for a list of these facilities). Genetic tests were not applied for prenatal diagnosis or used in any decision process for abortion of hemophiliac children. The hemophiliac mutations in three obligate carriers who were genetically apparent carriers were defined as mutations in each family, because 3 patients died in each family (2 HA and 1 HB).

The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Medical Research of Tokyo Medical University (approval number #2017‐068). All study subjects provided written informed consent to participate in this study and were enrolled after receiving full explanation of the purpose of the study and the methods to be used. Of the 112 FFM, 106 were interviewed directly at Tokyo Medical University Hospital and details of the clinical features, phenotypes, and family pedigrees were recorded. Six FFM (2 HA and 4 HB) were interviewed at Hiroshima University Hospital and the Hospital of Hyogo College of Medicine.

2.2 Blood coagulation tests

FVIII:C and FIX:C levels were measured using one‐stage clotting assay (HemosIL™ APTT‐SP; Instrumentation Laboratory and Coagpia ® APTT‐N; Sekisui Medical Co.) on an ACL 9000 Automated Coagulometer and CP3000™. VWF:Ag levels were measured using latex coagulating nephelometry (STA Listest vWF[FR]; Diagnostica Stago, Inc.) on a JCA‐BM8020 (JEOL).

### Intracranial hemorrhage before start of prophylaxis in children with hemophilia: incidence, timing, and potential for prevention [^116ZuA2V]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

However, only patients diagnosed with hemophilia can be started on prophylaxis, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis for both, boys and girls. As recommended in the WFH hemophilia guidelines, the training and educating of both medical staff and families with hemophilia is of high importance. In families with a known family history of hemophilia, carriers should get diagnosed and when pregnant, prenatal or early postnatal diagnosis can be made. In our study, approximately 40% of patients did not have an established diagnosis of hemophilia at the time of ICH and in this group, ICH occurred earlier and was frequently the reason for the diagnosis of hemophilia. In these cases, unexpected bleeding and/or a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are the most typical indicators of suspected hemophilia and their immediate diagnosis is crucial to offer the best treatment in children with ICH. To improve diagnosis even more in this group and due to advances in genomic sequencing, some countries have projects to implement screening for hemophilia into newborn screening, e.g. "The Generation Study" in the UK (https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/ initiatives/newborns). This possibility for an early diagnosis of hemophilia would most likely have an impact on the timing of prophylaxis initiation and with that on the prevention of early bleeding in the hemophilia population. However, in our study, the majority of 60% of ICH occurred when the diagnosis of hemophilia was already established and could potentially be prevented by an immediate start of prophylaxis. In this study, ICH occurred in 1,466 children after the diagnosis of severe HA was made, resulting in an incidence of 2.2%. If we assume that prophylaxis started immediately in children with severe HA at the time of diagnosis would lower the incidence of ICH to 0%, the number needed to treat with prophylaxis would be 44 patients to prevent one ICH; traumatic ICH is included in this calculation. Prevention of all traumatic ICH in children on prophylaxis with e.g. emicizumab may not be possible and the number needed to treat could be higher.

### The underevaluated impacts of the therapeutic revolution of hemophilia on women and girls [^114Tcsqg]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

The advent of new treatment options over the last decades has markedly improved the lives of male persons with hemophilia (PwH). However, this therapeutic revolution has not benefited women and girls with hemophilia (WGH) and symptomatic carriers of the disease to the same extent as their male counterparts. This inequity is primarily due to the exclusion of WGH from clinical trials and a failure to fully recognize their specific treatment needs. Additionally, the indirect impact of innovative therapies, when used for male PwH, on the lives of mothers, other relatives, and partners of these individuals has been largely overlooked until now. In addition to improving access of WGH and carriers to new hemostatic treatments and comprehensive hemophilia care, it is imperative to strive for alleviating the mental burden imposed on them by this chronic disease. The recently proposed concept of a "hemophilia-free mind", primarily focused on male PwH, should therefore also be applied to WGH, symptomatic carriers, and the predominantly female support network of PwH.

### Hemophilia B: molecular pathogenesis and mutation analysis [^116V3RBv]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

F9 sequence variants

SNVs

The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) investigator coalition collected exome sequencing data from large sequencing projects on 60 706 unrelated individuals, and made the data freely available. These, along with the Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP) and Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) frequency data, provide a useful indication of whether a variant is seen frequently in a population, and is thus more likely to be a neutral than a pathogenic variant 57, 58, 59. The ExAC F9 missense variant frequency is shown in Table S2.

Mutation sex ratio

The origin of different mutation types was investigated by Montandon et al. who identified different ratios of mutations of male or female origin (sex ratio of germline mutation) for different F9 mutation types among the Swedish hemophilia B population; of 77 families, 23 had a single affected male 60. Mothers of 15 males were available, and of these, 13 had parents available. Three patients and 10 mothers had de novo mutations, and extrapolation to the Swedish population of 8.52 × 10⁶ individuals enabled the calculation that eight males and 98 females would harbor de novo F9 mutations (~ 10% of hemophilia B males). The mutation rate was estimated to be as follows: overall, 4.1 × 10⁻⁶; male, 2.1 × 10⁻⁵; and female, 1.9 × 10⁻⁶; the ratio of male/female mutation rates was 11: 1.

In this study, we reinvestigated a 20-year-old woman, the first cousin of two brothers with severe haemophilia A. This patient was previously assumed to be a carrier of haemophilia A due to her FVIII deficiency. We identified a novel FVIII gene mutation in the family and demonstrated that the FVIII deficiency in this female patient did not result from this gene mutation, but was linked to molecular defects in the von Willebrand factor gene.

### A new hemophilia carrier nomenclature to define hemophilia in women and girls: communication from the SSC of the ISTH [^1122Rncz]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

A HC with normal factor levels, as defined by international standards FVIII/IX > 0.40 IU/ml, may still have abnormal bleeding. The new SSC‐approved nomenclature distinguishes five HC clinical categories (Figure 1). Because bleeding tendency may change during the lifetime of women and girls, a bidirectional arrow was added in the figure to allow for changes in clinical phenotype over time. We suggest that the term HC is reserved for use in discussions regarding genetic counseling and "symptomatic carrier" or "hemophilia" when the focus of the interaction is in response to bleeding concerns.

Hemophilia A (deficiency in factor [F] VIII) and hemophilia B (deficiency in FIX) are the most common serious congenital coagulation factor deficiencies. (Based on strong evidence) Hemophilia is a genetic disorder inherited in an Xlinked fashion. Both diseases cause similar bleeding diatheses, with the hallmark being hemarthroses. (Based on strong evidence) The optimal treatment is recombinant factor replacement to prevent bleeding; however, this treatment has many barriers. (Based on strong evidence) The most serious complication of treatment is the development of inhibitors to factor products. (Based on strong evidence) Care for patients with hemophilia is most appropriate in a comprehensive care setting. (Based on strong evidence).

### Proactive systematic hemophilia carrier screening: a step toward gender equity in hemophilia care [^114kEyRn]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Research on hemophilia carriers and WGH has progressed slower than research focusing on male persons with hemophilia (PWHs) and gender inequities persist in the diagnosis, care, and treatment of hemophilia and bleeding disorders in general, (Figure 1). Many female relatives of PWHs remain unaware of their carrier status or experience diagnostic delay and their coagulation factor levels are not systematically measured. In contrast to male PWHs, WGH and carriers often do not benefit from specialized care. Care gaps for carriers and WGH are even bigger in countries with limited resources, but even in high-resource countries systemic barriers and political decisions may limit access to care for WGH. Despite advancements in hemophilia therapies, including gene therapy and nonreplacement therapies, access for WGH has been limited and they have been excluded from most clinical trials for these new therapeutic agents. In addition, the impact of caregiving for affected males on predominantly female caregivers has been largely overlooked.

Figure 1.
Gender inequities in hemophilia care.

At the hemophilia treatment center (HTC) of the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc in Brussels, the screening of female relatives of PWHs and the care for WGH and symptomatic carriers have been integral parts of the clinical routine for the past 2 decades. However, before this study, we lacked precise information about the number of carriers and potential carriers within the families of PWHs followed at the center and the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, despite the increasing interest in hemophilia carriers within the scientific community, concrete strategies for systematic hemophilia carrier screening have been lacking.

In this study, we present the outcomes of a proactive and systematic hemophilia carrier screening study, in which the primary objectives were to screen the highest possible number of potential and obligate hemophilia carriers within a single HTC and to assess the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, we aimed to compare carriers of HA and HB, examining circumstances of diagnosis, coagulation factor levels, bleeding symptoms, and hemostatic treatment requirements.

### Uptake of genetic counseling, knowledge of bleeding risks and psychosocial impact in a South African cohort of female relatives of people with hemophilia [^117F1ShH]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2015). Low credibility.

In excess of 200 people with hemophilia (PWH) and their families have received genetic counseling (GC) at the Hemophilia Comprehensive Care Centre at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital. However, very few of their at-risk female relatives have attended GC to discuss their reproductive risks and options, or their potential bleeding risks. Limited research has been conducted internationally on factors influencing uptake of GC and testing amongst female relatives of PWH. This prospective study aimed to explore the factors that influence the uptake of GC and testing by female relatives of PWH. An open-ended semi-structured interview schedule was developed. Participants included female relatives of PWH who at least had a family member who had received GC. Seventeen participants were interviewed; 7 who had GC previously and 10 who had not. All participants who had previously received GC found the service helpful and were mothers referred because their sons had hemophilia. Of those who had not had GC, possible deterrents included: being unaware of GC service, focus in clinic on PWH and not potential carriers, misunderstood risks related to hemophilia and carrier status, fear of finding out carrier status, and non-disclosure in families. Most participants were unaware of potential bleeding risks for carriers. The information will be used to provide a better service to female relatives of PWH with a goal being to set up a dedicated hemophilia carrier clinic.

### Information on hemophilia for women… [^1162hZQE]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Women with hemophilia and hemophilia carriers Most people who have hemophilia are born with it. It is inherited from a parent to a child. Hemophilia is caused by a mutation problem in one of the genes needed to make clotting factors, which are proteins the body uses to form a blood clot. These genes are located on the X chromosome. Both hemophilia A and hemophilia B are inherited in the same way, because both the genes for factor VIII and factor IX are located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. There are no genes for clotting factors on the Y chromosome. Therefore, if a male inherits a gene with a mutation for hemophilia on his only X chromosome, he will have the disorder.

However, because most females with a gene for hemophilia inherit only one gene with a mutation for hemophilia on one X chromosome and they inherit a normal gene on their other X chromosome, they have some protection against having severe bleeding problems. Some females with this type of inheritance have normal blood clotting and no bleeding symptoms and are referred to as carriers. However, some females who inherit a hemophilia gene have bleeding symptoms. While bleeding symptoms in females are usually milder than those in males with hemophilia, in rare cases, a female with one hemophilia gene can have bleeding symptoms that are as serious as those of a male with hemophilia. Pregnancy and childbirth A woman who inherits one hemophilia gene can have low factor VIII or factor IX levels and have symptoms of hemophilia. However, during pregnancy, the levels of factor VIII will rise.

This can make it difficult to identify women who have hemophilia A during pregnancy if they have not already been diagnosed. This is not a concern for women with hemophilia B, because levels of factor IX do not rise during pregnancy. Prenatal testing for hemophilia If the mother carries the hemophilia gene, there is a chance that the baby will be born with hemophilia. In families with a known history of hemophilia, or in those with a prenatal genetic diagnosis of hemophilia, one can plan special testing for hemophilia before the baby's delivery.

### Deconstructing the ISTH hemophilia guidelines for the clinician [^111HK8P9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Recently, the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Hemophilia Guidelines were published in this journal. The authors of these guidelines should be commended for a herculean task that took years to complete, and while this is no doubt a welcome addition to the literature, it does leave many questions for the clinician. This is primarily because 11 of the 13 recommendations are conditional, essentially meaning "that clinicians and patients need to consider individual preferences as well as the specific circumstances in which the decision is being made for implementation of the recommendation". So, in essence, most of the recommendations allow the clinician to decide whether to use them or not. In our view, most clinicians are seeking more concrete recommendations when they search for a guidelines paper. Unfortunately, numerous conditional recommendations have been developed because hemophilia is a rare disease and the ISTH Guidelines rely upon the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. We endeavored to "deconstruct" the ISTH recommendations and offer clinicians a more concrete path forward based in part on the guidelines but supplemented with more recent literature and our own extensive experience and perspective managing hemophilia patients of all ages from 4 continents.

### The dilemma of X-linked agammaglobulinemia carriers [^116RVAYs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Decades ago, for most mothers who gave birth to children with XLA, accurate prenatal diagnosis was not possible, whereas nowadays molecular genetic analysis constitutes a decisive tool for the definitive diagnosis of XLA in males and allows the diagnosis of carrier status in females and prenatal diagnosis. Because of the proliferation and maturation of B cells expressing the normal BTK allele, female carriers are healthy and immunologically normal. For most mothers who gave birth to children with XLA, accurate prenatal diagnosis was not possible decades ago. However, many of these children with XLA have now reached adulthood, and so have their sisters, who are possible XLA carriers and in their reproductive age.

The idea of this observational study on Italian families with XLA was suggested by a complex clinical case of a patient suffering from 2 X-linked diseases, XLA and hemophilia A, whose sister came to our observation for prenatal counseling. Following the genetic consultation, she decided to carry the pregnancy to term regardless of the results of the genetic test.

To our knowledge, there is a lack of a clear figure on the carrier status of the sisters of patients with XLA, their interest in preconception and prenatal genetic counseling, and their consequent reproductive choices. Here, we report on the adherence to screening for carrier status, the interest in preconception and prenatal genetic counseling, and the reproductive decisions of female relatives of adult patients with XLA belonging to 52 Italian families.

### Hemophilia carrier status and counseling the symptomatic and asymptomatic adolescent [^114CmF1d]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Carriers of hemophilia have a 50% chance of giving birth to a hemophilic son. Approximately 35% may have a lower than normal factor VIII or IX and therefore can be diagnosed without genetic testing. These individuals may present with menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia and dysmenorrhoea. The treatment of menorrhagia is similar to girls without bleeding disorders — tranexamic acid, the oral contraceptive pill and, where acceptable, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device. Genetic diagnosis is possible for potential carriers — 50% families with severe hemophilia carry the intron 22 inversion and databases are available which list most of the causative mutations for hemophilia A and B. Ideally the mutation in the index in a family is known. The testing of adolescents for a recessively inherited condition raises ethical issues and guidance may vary within different countries and cultures.

### Haemophilia A: from mutation analysis to new therapies [^111JQSxJ]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2005). Medium credibility.

Haemophilia is caused by hundreds of different mutations and manifests itself in clinical conditions of varying severity. Despite being inherited in monogenic form, the clinical features of haemophilia can be influenced by other genetic factors, thereby confounding the boundary between monogenic and multifactorial disease. Unlike sufferers of other genetic diseases, haemophiliacs can be treated successfully by intravenous substitution of coagulation factors. Haemophilia is also the most attractive model for developing gene-therapy protocols, as the normal life expectancy of haemophiliacs allows the side effects of gene therapy, as well as its efficiency, to be monitored over long periods.

### Genetic analysis of carrier status in female members of Japanese hemophilia families [^1179fWip]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Although carrier women are generally considered asymptomatic, some reported abnormal bleeding, such as epistaxis, prolonged bleeding after dental procedures, purpura/ecchymoses, or post‐/perioperative bleeding. The reported rate of these abnormal bleeding patterns is about 30% among carrier women. 5, 6, 7 Postpartum hemorrhage is a serious problem, even in non‐hemophilic women. If the pregnant woman and the health‐care provider are aware of the hemophilia carrier status, safe childbirth and proper management of postpartum bleeding, including management of hemostasis in Cesarean section, are possible. 29 Thus, the significance of gene analysis for hemophilia carrier diagnosis includes accurate assessment of the carrier status.

Miesbach et al. 6 compared bleeding symptoms and phenotypes in 46 HA carriers by F8 mutations, and reported strong bleeding tendency in many carriers with inversion and/or deletion. They concluded that the severity of bleeding in HA carriers correlated with the phenotype of the male hemophilic relative and the underlying F8 mutation. In the present study, the carrier status was confirmed in all FFM with history of bleeding symptoms by genetic analysis. Our results also suggest that null mutation correlates with lower coagulation factor activity. However, we could not analyze the relationship between severity of bleeding in the carriers and gene mutation.

### Major differences in clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of men and women with autosomal inherited bleeding disorders [^116KrFDX]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Most studies on hereditary bleeding disorders have historically focused on hemophilia A and B, both X-linked disorders mainly affecting men. The vast majority of other bleeding disorders are autosomal inherited, and therefore sex differences may have an important impact on diagnosis, clinical characteristics and management of patients.

Autosomal inherited bleeding disorders predominantly consist of patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD), followed by patients with a rare hereditary bleeding disorder (RBD) which encompass a heterogeneous group of rare coagulation factor deficiencies and disorders of the fibrinolytic system. Lastly, hereditary platelet disorders (CPDs) are autosomal inherited bleeding disorders of primary hemostasis, affecting both men and women.

VWD, the most common inherited bleeding disorder, is characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding such as heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), epistaxis and gum bleeds. VWD is divided into three types, based on the quantitative or qualitative defect of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Type 1 VWD, which accounts for 70–80% of VWD patients, is characterized by quantitatively reduced VWF levels. Type 2 VWD, which affects about 20% of VWD patients, is characterized by an abnormal function of VWF. Type 3 VWD, the most severe form of VWD, affecting less than 5% of patients, is characterized by the absence of VWF. Type 1 and 2 VWD usually have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, whereas type 3 VWD is an autosomal recessive disorder.

RBDs are most often inherited as autosomal recessive disorders, except for dysfibrinogenemia and some cases of FXI deficiency, which are inherited autosomal dominant. Rare coagulation factor deficiencies refer to deficiencies of fibrinogen, factor (F) II, FV, combined FV&FVIII, FVII, FX, FXI and FXIII. Patients with a rare coagulation factor deficiency have a diverse clinical presentation. In addition, there is a poor correlation between factor activity levels and bleeding phenotype. Disorders of fibrinolysis consist of deficiencies of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 or α2-antiplasmin, or unspecified hyperfibrinolysis. The bleeding phenotype of patients with a disorder of fibrinolysis is characterized by delayed bleeding after trauma and interventions and bleeding in tissues with high fibrinolytic activity, such as HMB and epistaxis.

### A new hemophilia carrier nomenclature to define hemophilia in women and girls: communication from the SSC of the ISTH [^113cp8D1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Hemophilia A and B predominantly attracts clinical attention in males due to X-linked inheritance, introducing a bias toward female carriers to be asymptomatic. This common misconception is contradicted by an increasing body of evidence with consistent reporting on an increased bleeding tendency in hemophilia carriers (HCs), including those with normal factor VIII/IX (FVIII/IX) levels. The term HC can hamper diagnosis, clinical care, and research. Therefore, a new nomenclature has been defined based on an open iterative process involving hemophilia experts, patients, and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) community. The resulting nomenclature accounts for personal bleeding history and baseline plasma FVIII/IX level. It distinguishes five clinically relevant HC categories: women/girls with mild, moderate, or severe hemophilia (FVIII/IX > 0.05 and < 0.40 IU/ml, 0.01–0.05 IU/ml, and < 0.01 IU/ml, respectively), symptomatic and asymptomatic HC (FVIII/IX ≥ 0.40 IU/ml with and without a bleeding phenotype, respectively). This new nomenclature is aimed at improving diagnosis and management and applying uniform terminologies for clinical research.

### Proactive systematic hemophilia carrier screening: a step toward gender equity in hemophilia care [^117GrEvx]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The first explicit report of female carriership of hemophilia dates back to 1803, by John Conrad Otto, who described a family lineage of several decades earlier, wherein only males were affected by an often fatal bleeding disorder, later named "hemophilia" by Hopffand Schoenlein, which we now know is marked by a deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) (hemophilia A [HA]) or FIX (hemophilia B [HB]). The disease was passed down through generations by female ancestors who appeared to show no symptoms themselves. Thomas Hunt Morgan's discovery of X-linked recessive inheritance in 1910 further elucidated the inheritance pattern described by Otto. At the beginning of the 20th century, anecdotal reports of hemophilia carriers experiencing abnormal bleeding surfacedand gradually accumulated, yet research on carriers was mainly focused on the genetic transmission of the disease and not on the potential bleeding consequences. Bleeding symptoms in hemophilia carriers and, thanks to new biomolecular techniques, the diagnosis of carriers gained increasing interest by the end of the 20th century. However, it took until 2021, 218 years after Otto's report, for the term "women and girls with hemophilia" (WGH) to be officially defined by the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Several underlying mechanisms explaining why hemophilia carriers may exhibit low factor levels have been identified, with skewed X-chromosome inactivation being the most commonly described. Importantly, not only carriers with a factor deficiency may experience abnormal bleeding; it has been reported that a quarter of those with factor levels > 50 IU/dL may also experience abnormal bleeding symptoms.

### What is a' serious' genetic condition? The perceptions of people living with genetic conditions [^114dux4H]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Nearly all participants agreed that it is possible to have a good QoL with the condition they lived with; however, in a similar pattern to that observed with health, participants with SMA2 were most likely to agree (92.9%) and participants with adult onset conditions least likely to agree (SMA4 65.2%, FXTAS/POI 67.9%). This difference between early and later onset conditions was also evident within the qualitative dataset. James (46, haemophilia) had received regular treatment with blood products from childhood and through this, contracted Hepatitis C at age 10. The hepatitis was successfully treated, but James's haemophilia led to arthritis, prompting him to resign from his active job. He reflected, " Quality of life… is what you make it really. Yes, I've got my issues to deal with, but so does everyone, just in different ways… although some people will tell you you need your health to have a quality of life, I think I'm living proof that you can have it anyway. As long as you have positive relationships, you know, you have things to look forward to, you have things to do, that's all you really need. " The qualitative data revealed that participants, such as James, who had lived with their condition since birth or childhood – even though his condition had changed over time and had implications for health as well as disability – were more likely to define QoL as a combination of factors external to themselves, such as social relationships, interests and activities, which haemophilia did not preclude. This was in stark contrast to participants with later onset conditions, such as Mary (74), diagnosed with FXTAS in her early 60s who commented on the onset of her condition, "My quality of life deteriorated considerably. Everything you take for granted in life gets pulled out from under you, like driving, shopping, cooking a meal, even basic things like drinking a hot drink without spilling it all over yourself… you shake constantly and feel tired constantly… and when you can't do those things no more – there isn't much quality left is there? ". For Mary, health, QoL and FXTAS were inextricably bound together. Having once enjoyed life, Mary's FXTAS was a restrictive, unwelcome and unexpected burden, prompting a re-evaluation of her lifestyle and identity, akin to what Bury has refereed to 'biographical disruption' and re-integration.

### Minority report: can minor parents refuse treatment for their child? [^112h2hDy]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

In the case above, M was judged capable of making medical decisions for herself during her pregnancy and delivery. She was also assessed to be capable to caring for B, and there is no suggestion than B's illness results from a lack of attention or care.

Biological fathers may also uphold duties to their children, and have a right to make medical decisions. In this case, however, the biological father (F) has not yet played any parental role in the child's life. If this interruption to his parenthood was through his own free choice, he has neglected his duties and obligations and consequently forfeited his moral right to make this medical decision. 6

M became pregnant as a minor while in the care of her own mother. The grandmother, G, has the duties and obligations of a parent towards her daughter M and as a consequence has some rights regarding M. Does this extend to decision making for her grandson?

G might have a moral duty to provide emotional, financial and practical help to her daughter, perhaps extending to assist her daughter in making medical decisions. But it is not clear that this requires her to make medical decisions for B or permits her to overrule M. The duty of G towards B is indirect, whereas the duty of M to B is direct (figure 1). Moreover, G's decision-making rights in relation to M's own medical care are attenuated because of M's maturity.

Figure 1
Diagram of duties.

In many circumstances, minor parents may desire the support of their own parents in decision making. If M were to ask her mother to assist with decision making, the grandmother would be justified in participating in the discussions and helping her daughter to understand the risks and benefits of the LP procedure. Additionally, it might be reasonable for the medical team to appeal to G to assist her daughter in making a decision. However, this does not amount to a right to overrule M's refusal. 7

Taken together, these considerations suggest that it is M, rather than F or G, who is the morally appropriate decision-maker for B. While parental duties can be relinquished, there is no persuasive reason to think that M has forfeited them.
