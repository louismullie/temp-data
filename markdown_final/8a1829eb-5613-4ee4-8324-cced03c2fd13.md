## Question

A 32-year-old woman presents to a psychiatrist to discuss a recent event in her life. At a social function 2 days back, she met a man who introduced himself as having worked with her at another private company 3 years ago. However, she did not recognize him. She also says that she does not remember working at any such company at any time during her life. However, the patient's husband says that she had indeed worked at that company for three months and had quit due to her boss's abusive behavior towards her. The man who met her at the function had actually been her colleague at that job. The woman asks the doctor, "How is it possible? I am really not able to recall any memories of having worked at any such company. What's going on here?". Her husband adds that after she quit the job, her mood frequently has been low. The patient denies any crying episodes, suicidal ideas, not enjoying recreational activities or feelings of worthlessness. Her appetite and sleep patterns are normal. She is otherwise a healthy woman with no significant medical history and lives a normal social and occupational life. The patient reports no history of smoking, alcohol, or substance use. On physical examination, she is alert and well-oriented to time, place and person. During memory testing, she correctly remembers the date of her marriage that took place 5 years back and the food she ate over the last 2 days. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A. Pseudodementia
B. Dissociative amnesia
C. Dissociative identity disorder
D. Transient global amnesia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to determine the most likely diagnosis for a 32-year-old woman with selective amnesia for a 3-month work experience marked by abusive supervision, and to distinguish among pseudodementia, dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder, and transient global amnesia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical features and whether they fit a dissociative amnesia pattern. Then, I should verify the differential diagnoses against DSM-5-TR criteria and the vignette's timeline. Next, I will examine the role of trauma and stress-related dissociation. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and outline next steps in assessment and care, ensuring I cross-check each inference with guideline-level sources where possible.

> Let me first confirm the salient clinical features: the patient has a circumscribed, selective loss of autobiographical memory for a discrete 3-month period of employment, with preserved orientation, recent and remote memory otherwise intact, and no evidence of a generalized cognitive disorder; the amnesia follows a clearly stressful work environment with abusive supervision and subsequent low mood, which raises concern for a trauma-related dissociative process rather than a neurocognitive syndrome or a psychotic disorder, and I should double-check that this pattern aligns with dissociative amnesia phenomenology before proceeding [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine the differential systematically, starting with pseudodementia; wait, let me verify that pseudodementia typically presents with apparent cognitive deficits secondary to depression rather than true neurocognitive decline, but here there is no evidence of pervasive cognitive impairment, no deficits in attention, executive function, or new learning, and the memory loss is selective and retrograde for a specific traumatic interval rather than global, which makes pseudodementia unlikely in this case [^notfound].

> Next, I should review dissociative identity disorder; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — DID requires the presence of two or more distinct personality states with recurrent gaps in recall of everyday events, and there is no mention of alternate identities, switching, or broader dissociative fragmentation in the vignette, so DID is not supported here despite the trauma history, and I need to ensure I don't over-attribute dissociation to DID when the presentation is better explained by dissociative amnesia alone [^116wf9mC].

> I will now examine transient global amnesia; hmm, wait a minute, TGA classically presents with sudden anterograde amnesia lasting hours, often with repetitive questioning and retrograde loss for the hours just before onset, and it resolves within 24 hours — this patient's amnesia is chronic, selective, and tied to a specific traumatic period, which does not match TGA's time course or pattern, so TGA should be excluded here [^notfound].

> Let me consider dissociative amnesia more closely; the selective, retrograde loss of autobiographical memory for a discrete, emotionally charged period, with otherwise preserved cognitive function and orientation, and a clear psychosocial stressor, fits the DSM-5-TR construct of dissociative amnesia, which can be localized and often follows trauma or intense stress; I should confirm that the absence of other dissociative identity features and the presence of a credible external stressor strengthen this diagnosis rather than alternatives [^notfound].

> But wait, what if this is actually PTSD-related amnesia; I should double-check the PTSD criteria — Criterion D includes inability to recall an important aspect of the traumatic event(s), and the abusive supervision could meet Criterion A if the patient experienced actual or threatened serious injury or violence, yet the vignette lacks the full symptom constellation of intrusion, persistent avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions/mood, and arousal/reactivity required for PTSD, so while PTSD-related amnesia remains a consideration, the current data are insufficient to diagnose PTSD and dissociative amnesia remains the more parsimonious fit for now [^117HRW9V] [^111PN5yW].

> Next, I should review the role of trauma and stress-related dissociation; let me think about the linkage between interpersonal trauma exposure and dissociative symptoms — WHO guidance highlights the mental health sequelae of intimate partner and workplace violence, and although the vignette does not specify IPV, the described abusive supervision constitutes a credible psychosocial stressor that can precipitate dissociative symptoms including amnesia, reinforcing the plausibility of dissociative amnesia in this context [^notfound] [^notfound].

> I should confirm that no red flags for neurocognitive disorders are present; there is no insidious onset, no progressive decline, and no deficits beyond the circumscribed autobiographical gap, which argues against dementia syndromes and supports a dissociative mechanism rather than a neurodegenerative process, and I need to ensure I document this negative cognitive review clearly to avoid misclassification [^113SPux6] [^111d4VWD].

> Synthesis: the most likely diagnosis is dissociative amnesia, given the selective, trauma-linked retrograde amnesia for a discrete period, preserved general cognitive function, and absence of features supporting pseudodementia, DID, TGA, or full PTSD; I should double-check that this conclusion aligns with DSM-5-TR and that I have not overlooked any alternative explanation before finalizing [^notfound].

> Next steps: I need to ensure a careful trauma-informed assessment, screen for ongoing safety concerns and psychosocial stressors, and consider collateral history to corroborate the abusive work environment; I should also plan for supportive psychotherapy and, if indicated, trauma-focused interventions such as CBT or EMDR delivered by clinicians experienced in violence-related mental health care, while monitoring for emergence of broader PTSD symptoms over time and reassessing the diagnosis if the clinical picture evolves [^111Z64SH] [^112Bi6Lu] [^114H1G7w].

The most likely diagnosis is **dissociative amnesia** [^notfound], given the selective, trauma-linked memory loss for a specific period and event, with preserved general cognition and no evidence of alternate identities or global amnesia. This presentation is classic for dissociative amnesia triggered by workplace abuse, with intact remote and recent memory outside the traumatic window [^notfound]. Pseudodementia is unlikely because there is no global cognitive impairment or prominent depressive symptoms; dissociative identity disorder is excluded by the absence of alternate identities; and transient global amnesia does not fit the chronic, selective pattern [^116wf9mC].

---

## Differential diagnosis analysis

### Pseudodementia (depression-related cognitive impairment)

Pseudodementia presents with **global cognitive impairment** (memory, attention, executive function) and prominent depressive symptoms (low mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, sleep/appetite changes) [^notfound]. In this case, the patient's memory loss is **selective and localized** to a specific traumatic event, with preserved general cognitive function and minimal depressive symptoms, making pseudodementia unlikely [^117HRW9V].

---

### Dissociative identity disorder (DID)

DID is characterized by **two or more distinct identity states** with recurrent gaps in memory for everyday events, personal information, or traumatic experiences [^116wf9mC]. There is no evidence of alternate identities or ongoing memory gaps beyond the specific traumatic event, so DID is excluded [^116wf9mC].

---

### Transient global amnesia (TGA)

TGA presents with **sudden, temporary loss of anterograde memory** with repetitive questioning and typically resolves within 24 hours [^notfound]. The patient's memory loss is **chronic and selective**, not fitting the brief, global pattern of TGA.

---

### Dissociative amnesia

Dissociative amnesia is characterized by **selective memory loss** for specific traumatic events or periods, with preserved general cognitive function and no alternate identities [^113i6hVw]. The patient's selective amnesia for a traumatic work period, with intact remote and recent memory, aligns with this diagnosis [^113i6hVw].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dissociative amnesia

- **Selective memory loss**: The patient cannot recall working at the specific company or the abusive boss, despite clear collateral history [^notfound].
- **Preserved general memory**: Intact recall of personal milestones (wedding date) and recent events (recent meals) [^notfound].
- **Trauma-linked amnesia**: Memory loss follows documented workplace abuse, a common trigger for dissociative amnesia [^notfound].
- **No alternate identities**: No evidence of distinct identity states or ongoing memory gaps beyond the traumatic period [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely diagnosis is **dissociative amnesia**, given the selective, trauma-linked memory loss with preserved general cognition and no evidence of alternate identities or global amnesia. I recommend trauma-focused psychotherapy (e.g. CBT, EMDR) to address the underlying trauma and support memory recovery, with ongoing monitoring for emerging depressive or anxiety symptoms [^notfound].

### An unusual psychiatric presentation of polycythaemia' difficulties lie in our habits of thought rather than in the nature of things' andre tardieu [^1122inQP]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Psychiatric symptoms are not always best explained in the context of psychological stress. The same mental, emotional and behavioural changes also arise from various medical conditions. For a clinician this dual origin of psychiatric symptoms creates an ongoing diagnostic challenge. Our patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who had been working in a company for around 33 years and always had good appraisals. He presented to mental health services with a 5-year history of persecutory beliefs, convinced that his employers were out to damage his reputation. Apart from a diagnosis of polycythaemia, a few months before the onset of abnormal beliefs, there is no personal or family history of psychiatric disorder or medical illness. His delusions did not respond to conventional treatment with psychotropic medication possibly due to non-adherence because of side effects. However, a series of venesections lead to an improvement in mental state.

Attending to patients with medically unexplained symptoms

Alex Brown and Ellie Plumb

What is the secret to working with patients with medically unexplained symptoms? If the story is the pathology, listening is the intervention.

A 68-year-old woman presented to our family medicine office with a list of problems: cervical radiculopathy, joint pain, colitis, depression and anxiety. She would be seen by a second-year family medicine resident who was working in our morning clinic with the two of us (AB and EJP) jointly attending.

In our pre-visit huddle, the resident was uncertain whether she was treating the patient effectively, as the patient had not responded optimally to trial interventions. Indeed, the resident was not confident that the patient had been accurately diagnosed. We encouraged her to collect more of the story and reminded her that 'sometimes, the story is the pathology'.

By simply listening, the resident learnt that the patient had been routinely abused by her late husband, who she strongly suspected had sexually abused their daughter with whom she now had a fractured relationship. The patient had finally prepared herself to leave her husband later in life, only to find herself bound to his bedside as she cared for him as he slowly advanced toward death. Today, she is burdened by crippling debt and social isolation; her meaningful relationships have withered and disappeared.

This patient's story was painfully similar to the stories of so many patients who experience medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Although the patient's lifetime of accumulated trauma may not have directly caused her physical ailments, it was certainly making her symptoms worse.

MUS is a term that has become synonymous in certain corners of healthcare with psychosomatics, malingering and histrionics. Even as the importance of holistic, biopsychosocial medicine is widely recognised and neuroscience confirms the important link between chronic stress and inflammatory diseases, clinicians commonly meet patients with MUS, directly or indirectly, with frustration and disregard. The most obvious reason for this is that such patients' symptoms fail to fit within the strictly biomedical models of illness. Clinicians routinely feel ill-equipped to treat these patients and have difficulty relying on one important principle: if the story is the pathology, listening is the intervention.

- unexplained genitourinary symptoms, including frequent bladder or kidney infections

- repeated vaginal bleeding and STIs

- chronic unexplained pain

- traumatic injury, particularly if repeated and with vague or implausible explanations

- problems with the CNS, such as headaches, cognitive problems, hearing loss

- repeated health consultations with no clear diagnosis

- intrusive partner or husband in consultations.

### Living on the edge [^111T9XHs]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

This essay describes a remarkable patient with severe medical and psychological problems who died a tragic death when she was only 46 years old. Despite suffering early coronary artery disease, persistent abuse from her spouse, and caring for a daughter with severe physical handicaps, the patient did not complain or seek pity for her condition. Rather, through her belief in God and a focus on the day forward rather than the day behind, she reminds clinicians that the sum of a person's life is more than their medical problems. After the patient's death, her husband's medical problems force him to seek care; this raised ethical issues because the doctor who was treating him also cared for his wife.

### Preventing needless work disability by helping people stay employed [^113XcUHJ]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Adopt a disability prevention model — increase awareness of how rarely disability is medically required emphasizes that only a small fraction of medically excused days off work is medically required, and that the remaining days off work result from nonmedical factors such as administrative delays of treatment and specialty referral, lack of transitional work, ineffective communications, lax management, and logistic problems; it notes that absence from work is "excused" and benefits are generally awarded based on a physician's decision confirming that a medical condition exists, which implies that a diagnosis creates disability; from a strictly medical point of view, people can generally work at something productive as soon as there is no specific medical condition to keep them from working, with examples that an employee with a cast on the right foot cannot drive a forklift but can perform other tasks until the cast is removed, and that a person recovering from surgery may not be able to work a full day in the office but could work half days; the text adds that people often get short term disability benefits because employers do not take advantage of available work capacity.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder [^111QCK9V]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Acute stress disorder (ASD) — DSM-5-TR diagnostic criteria require exposure to a traumatic stressor (Criteria A1–A4) and symptoms that last at least 3 days but less than 1 month after exposure. Individuals must exhibit at least 9 of 14 possible symptoms and symptoms must cause significant distress or functional impairment. Criterion A specifies exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence in one (or more) of the following ways: directly experiencing the traumatic event(s); witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others; learning that the event(s) occurred to a close family member or close friend (in cases of actual or threatened death of a family member or friend, the event[s] must have been violent or accidental); or experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic event(s). This does not apply to exposure through electronic media, television, movies, or pictures unless this exposure is work-related.

### Candesartan cilexetil [^114Ye3Zn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Adult Hypertension

Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil.

Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg candesartan cilexetil in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Candesartan cilexetil may be administered with or without food.

If blood pressure is not controlled by candesartan cilexetil alone, a diuretic may be added. Candesartan cilexetil may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to < 17 Years of Age

Candesartan cilexetil may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate candesartan cilexetil under close medical supervision and consider administration of a lower dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Children 1 to < 6 years of age:

The dose range is 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per day. The recommended starting dose is 0.20 mg/kg (oral suspension).

Children 6 to < 17 years of age:

For those less than 50 kg, the dose range is 2 to 16 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 4 to 8 mg.

For those greater than 50 kg, the dose range is 4 to 32 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 8 to 16 mg.

Doses above 0.4 mg/kg (1 to < 6 year olds) or 32 mg (6 to < 17 year olds) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### A 51-year-old woman with bipolar disorder who wants to quit smoking [^117SQq7G]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Smoking among patients with mental illness is a major and underappreciated public health problem. The case of Ms G, a 51-year-old woman with bipolar disorder who wishes to quit smoking, illustrates the importance and feasibility of smoking cessation in patients with psychiatric disorders. Persons with chronic mental illness and/or substance abuse constitute 22% of the US population yet are estimated to consume 44% of cigarettes. As many as 200,000 of the 435,000 annual deaths related to smoking in the United States are estimated to occur in this population. On average, patients with mental illness die 25 years earlier than the general population, and smoking is a major contributor to these premature deaths. In the past, mental health clinicians have tended not to address smoking cessation with their patients, but increasing evidence suggests that such reticence is unwarranted, as smoking cessation in this population is feasible. The approach to cessation should include standard interventions of counseling and pharmacotherapy, for which substantial evidence of efficacy exists in patients with and without mental illness. If patients with mental illness are to achieve wellness, smoking cessation must be an integral component of their treatment regimen.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^111F2gXS]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

PTSD background — definitions and global burden: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is described in DSM–5, text rev., and in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (11th ed.), which distinguishes between a pared-down PTSD and a complex PTSD diagnosis. PTSD is characterized by exposure to a potentially traumatic event or events with persistence of specific trauma-related symptoms beyond initial reactions (defined as several weeks or one month) and functional impairment. Trauma exposure underlies a worldwide 5.6% lifetime prevalence of PTSD, encompassing over 450 million adults and children.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114ZY1kr]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Occupational asthma and work-exacerbated asthma — asthma acquired in the workplace is frequently missed and may be induced or (more commonly) aggravated by exposure to allergens or other sensitizing agents at work, or sometimes from a single, massive exposure; occupational rhinitis may precede asthma by up to a year and early diagnosis is essential, as persistent exposure is associated with worse outcomes; an estimated 5–20% of new cases of adult-onset asthma can be attributed to occupational exposure; adult-onset asthma requires a systematic inquiry about work history and exposures, including hobbies; asking patients whether their symptoms improve when they are away from work (weekends or vacation) is an essential screening question; it is important to confirm the diagnosis of occupational asthma objectively as it may lead to the patient changing their occupation, and specialist referral is usually necessary, with frequent PEF monitoring at and away from work often used to help confirm the diagnosis.

### Intimate partner violence [^1143ELp6]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a prevalent worldwide health problem, affecting women more commonly than men. IPV is underreported and underrecognized by health care professionals. Even when IPV is recognized, it remains an underaddressed issue. In addition to physical injury and death, IPV causes significant physical and psychiatric health problems commonly treated by family physicians. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening all female patients of childbearing age for IPV. There are several brief screening tools that have been proven effective at detecting IPV and that can be used in the office setting. Identification of IPV allows the physician to provide better care and improves health outcomes for the survivor. Family physician offices should provide patients with local and national resources. Thorough documentation of injuries sustained from abuse is critical. Although caring for patients unready to leave an abusive relationship may be challenging for the physician, continuous, supportive care improves patient outcomes.

2.1 Adult Hypertension

Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of ATACAND is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. ATACAND can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with ATACAND.

Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg ATACAND in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

ATACAND may be administered with or without food.

If blood pressure is not controlled by ATACAND alone, a diuretic may be added. ATACAND may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to < 17 Years of Age

ATACAND may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate ATACAND under close medical supervision and consider administration of a lower dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Children 1 to < 6 years of age:

The dose range is 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per day. The recommended starting dose is 0.20 mg/kg (oral suspension).

Children 6 to < 17 years of age:

For those less than 50 kg, the dose range is 2 to 16 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 4 to 8 mg.

For those greater than 50 kg, the dose range is 4 to 32 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 8 to 16 mg.

Doses above 0.4 mg/kg (1 to < 6 year olds) or 32 mg (6 to < 17 year olds) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

An antihypertensive effect is usually present within 2 weeks, with full effect generally obtained within 4 weeks of treatment with ATACAND.

### The danger model in deciphering autoimmunity [^117JrAGU]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Autoimmunity has been a topic of intensive research for several decades, yet amazingly, no uniform hypothesis exists to explain the basis for the spectrum of autoantibody specificities seen in autoimmune diseases. It therefore seems appropriate to consider whether our current framework for understanding tolerance, and thus the mechanisms controlling the initiation and perpetuation of autoimmunity, may be faulty. Adapting the paradigm of Matzinger-the 'danger model', a case can be made for a perspective that appreciates the fundamental role of the tissues in controlling immune response, favouring a shift of focus in studies on the initiation of autoimmunity. Applying the elements of this model, I set forth a number of scenarios for how autoreactivity could emerge, with emphasis on the likely sources of the involved autoantigens and the functional basis of their appearance. The emerging picture is one in which disruption of tissue homeostasis takes centre stage, with the antigen-presenting cells as the key players.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

NIA-AA probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia — diagnosis can be made when the patient "Meets criteria for dementia syndrome" and has "An insidious onset: symptoms have a gradual onset over months to years, not sudden over hours or days", with "Clear-cut history of worsening of cognition", and initial prominent deficits in an amnestic presentation or specified non-amnestic presentations. The amnestic presentation "is the most common syndromic presentation of AD dementia" with "impairment in learning and recall of recently learned information" plus another domain deficit, while non-amnestic variants include "Language presentation", "Visuospatial presentation", and "Executive dysfunction", each with additional domain deficits. The diagnosis "should not be applied" when there is evidence of substantial concomitant cerebrovascular disease, core features of dementia with Lewy bodies, prominent behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, prominent semantic variant or non-fluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia, or another concurrent active disease/comorbidity/medication affecting cognition. "Biomarker evidence increases the certainty" that AD pathophysiology underlies the syndrome; if both amyloid-beta and neuronal injury biomarkers are present the "likelihood is high that dementia is due to AD", if either are absent it is "highly likely not due to AD", and if conflicting, likelihood is "intermediate".

### A quantitative analysis of statistical power identifies obesity end points for improved in vivo preclinical study design [^112AkMwc]. International Journal of Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

The design of well-powered in vivo preclinical studies is a key element in building the knowledge of disease physiology for the purpose of identifying and effectively testing potential antiobesity drug targets. However, as a result of the complexity of the obese phenotype, there is limited understanding of the variability within and between study animals of macroscopic end points such as food intake and body composition. This, combined with limitations inherent in the measurement of certain end points, presents challenges to study design that can have significant consequences for an antiobesity program. Here, we analyze a large, longitudinal study of mouse food intake and body composition during diet perturbation to quantify the variability and interaction of the key metabolic end points. To demonstrate how conclusions can change as a function of study size, we show that a simulated preclinical study properly powered for one end point may lead to false conclusions based on secondary end points. We then propose the guidelines for end point selection and study size estimation under different conditions to facilitate proper power calculation for a more successful in vivo study design.

### Integrating regional conservation priorities for multiple objectives into national policy [^114KumHY]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Multinational conservation initiatives that prioritize investment across a region invariably navigate trade-offs among multiple objectives. It seems logical to focus where several objectives can be achieved efficiently, but such multi-objective hotspots may be ecologically inappropriate, or politically inequitable. Here we devise a framework to facilitate a regionally cohesive set of marine-protected areas driven by national preferences and supported by quantitative conservation prioritization analyses, and illustrate it using the Coral Triangle Initiative. We identify areas important for achieving six objectives to address ecosystem representation, threatened fauna, connectivity and climate change. We expose trade-offs between areas that contribute substantially to several objectives and those meeting one or two objectives extremely well. Hence there are two strategies to guide countries choosing to implement regional goals nationally: multi-objective hotspots and complementary sets of single-objective priorities. This novel framework is applicable to any multilateral or global initiative seeking to apply quantitative information in decision making.

Many older individuals experience or demonstrate cognitive impairment that is significantly abnormal for their age and education yet beneath the threshold for a diagnosis of dementia. This mild cognitive impairment causes minimal functional impairment and is often overlooked in clinical settings, yet affected individuals are at heightened risk for a range of adverse outcomes including conversion to dementia. The case of Ms E, a 60-year-old woman with mild memory impairment and white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, provides an opportunity to consider the questions that face patient, family, and clinicians when mild cognitive symptoms prompt a search for diagnosis and management options. Discussion of her case reviews mild cognitive impairment with emphasis on an evidence-based approach to evaluation and treatment, including management of comorbid medical conditions, lifestyle changes, and pharmacotherapy.

### Dissociative identity disorder… [^116wf9mC]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

According to the DSM, the disorder is accompanied by memory gaps more severe than could be explained by ordinary forgetfulness, including gaps in consciousness, basic bodily functions, and perception. Research has challenged this premise; McNally found that although patients reported amnesia between alters, objective tests found their memory function was intact. Some clinicians view it as a form of hysteria. Many diverse experiences have been termed dissociative, ranging from normal failures in attention to the breakdowns in memory processes characterized by the dissociative disorders. It is therefore unknown whether there is a commonality among all dissociative experiences, or whether the range of mild to severe symptoms is a result of different etiologies and biological structures. Other terms used in the literature, including personality, personality state, identity, ego state, and amnesia, also lack agreed upon definitions.

Multiple competing models exist that incorporate some non-dissociative symptoms while excluding dissociative ones. Signs and symptoms The full presentation of dissociative identity disorder can occur at any age, but symptoms typically begin by ages 5–10. DID generally develops in childhood. According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, symptoms of DID include "the presence of two or more distinct personality states" accompanied by the inability to recall personal information. Other DSM-5 symptoms include a loss of identity as related to individual distinct personality states, loss of subjective experience of the passage of time, and degradation of a sense of self and consciousness. In each individual, the clinical presentation varies, and the level of functioning can change from severe impairment to minimal impairment.

The symptoms of dissociative amnesia are subsumed under a DID diagnosis; dissociative amnesia should not be diagnosed separately if DID criteria are met. Individuals with DID may experience distress from both the symptoms of DID and the consequences of the accompanying symptoms. The large majority of patients with DID report repeated childhood sexual and/or physical abuse, usually by caregivers, as well as organized abuse. Amnesia may be asymmetrical between identities; one identity may or may not be aware of what is known by another. Individuals with DID may be reluctant to discuss symptoms due to associations with abuse, shame, and fear. Delinking early trauma from the etiology of dissociation has been explicitly rejected by those supporting the early trauma model.

A 2012 review article argues the hypothesis that current or recent trauma may affect an individual's assessment of the more distant past, changing the experience of the past and resulting in dissociative states. Giesbrecht et al. have suggested there is no empirical evidence linking early trauma to dissociation, and instead suggest that problems with neuropsychological functioning, such as increased distractibility in response to certain emotions and contexts, account for dissociative features. A middle position hypothesizes that trauma, in some situations, alters neuronal mechanisms related to memory. Evidence is increasing that dissociative disorders are related both to a trauma history and to "specific neural mechanisms".

### Selective amnesia… [^113MCQVb]. Wikipedia (2007). Low credibility.

Selective amnesia is a type of amnesia in which the sufferer loses only certain parts of their memory. Common elements that may be forgotten are relationships, where they live, and certain special abilities and talents. Factors Emotional connotations People may be more susceptible to hypnotic amnesia if the words they are asked to forget have significant emotional connotations. Clemes was able to identify participants' critical words — words that are linked with inner conflict — and neutral words — words that are not linked with inner conflict. He then placed the participants under hypnosis and listed nine critical words and nine neutral words. Participants were then instructed, under the influence of hypnosis, to forget half of the words they were given. They found that participants are more likely to forget critical words than neutral words.

However, a replication study conducted by Stam and colleagues failed to replicate these results, suggesting that these conclusions may be invalid. Familiarity One's familiarity with a task influences how selective amnesia affects the subject's memories. To study this phenomenon, Lewis and colleagues taught rats a simple passive avoidance task, a fear-aggravated test used to evaluate learning and memory in rodent models. Some rats were allowed to familiarize themselves with the task while others were only allowed to experience the task once. When the lesion-ed rats had to orient themselves in an egocentric egocentric test using proprioceptive proprioceptive cue, there were no detectable memory defects. This finding suggests that the type of memory a subject is trying to remember may influence the subject's susceptibility to selective amnesia. Memory consolidation Some research suggests that selective amnesia may be the result of a deficit in memory consolidation.

Mathis and colleagues investigated the effect of protein kinase C on the memories of rats and found that they could induce a dose-dependent deficit in memory retention. They classified this memory deficit as selective amnesia. Use in treatment It has been suggested that inducing selective amnesia for particular events or stimuli in patients may be an effective tool in psychotherapy. Alexander found that administering electroconvulsive therapy to patients suffering from a traumatic life event induces selective amnesia for the traumatic event without affecting the patient's surrounding memories. This finding, as well as other similar findings, has been used to form a hypothesis concerning the mechanisms underlying ECT. Hypnosis Overview Hypnotic amnesia, or forgetting under hypnosis, appears to be similar to naturally occurring clinical amnesia.

However, hypnotic amnesia is distinct from naturally occurring amnesia because forgotten memories can be restored through a hypnotist's prearranged signal. Also, hypnotic amnesia is usually incomplete, meaning that the participants do not forget everything they were instructed to forget. Due to this trait, hypnosis can be used to research selective amnesia through studies that direct attention to the targets, or erased memories, of hypnotic amnesia. Use in memory research Researchers have used the relationship between hypnosis and selective amnesia to study specific memory processes including memory recall and retrieval cues. Bertrand and Spanos were able to study the process of memory recall by hypnotizing a group of undergraduate students, teaching the students three lists of words, and compelling the students to forget certain parts of these lists.

### Amnesia… [^113i6hVw]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

While a patient with amnesia might have a loss of declarative memory, this loss might vary in severity as well as the declarative information that it affects, depending on many factors. For example, LSJ was a patient who had retrograde declarative memory loss as the result of bilateral medial temporal lobe damage, but she was still able to remember how to perform some declarative skills. She was able to remember how to read music and the techniques used in art. She had preserved skill-related declarative memory for some things even though she had deficits in other declarative memory tasks. She even scored higher on skill-related declarative memory than the control in watercolor techniques, a technique that she used in her professional career before she acquired amnesia. Some patients with amnesia are able to remember skills that they had learned without being able to consciously recall where they had learned that information.

For example, they may learn to do a task and then be able to perform the task later without any recollection of learning the task. According to fMRI studies, the acquisition of procedural memories activates the basal ganglia, the premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area, regions which are not normally associated with the formation of declarative memories. This type of dissociation between declarative and procedural memory can also be found in patients with diencephalic amnesia such as Korsakoff's syndrome. Another example demonstrated by some patients, such as K. C. and H. M, who have medial temporal damage and anterograde amnesia, still have perceptual priming.
- Traumatic events are more subjective. What is traumatic is dependent on what the person finds to be traumatic. Regardless, a traumatic event is an event where something so distressing occurs that the mind chooses to forget rather than deal with the stress.

A common example of amnesia that is caused by traumatic events is dissociative amnesia, which occurs when the person forgets an event that has deeply disturbed them. An example would be a person forgetting a fatal and graphic car accident involving their loved ones. The damage is usually caused by head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, stroke, tumor, hypoxia, encephalitis, or chronic alcoholism. People with retrograde amnesia are more likely to remember general knowledge rather than specifics. Recent memories are less likely to be recovered, but older memories will be easier to recall due to strengthening over time. In the case of LSJ, her case shows that retrograde amnesia can affect many different parts of knowledge. LSJ was not able to remember things from her child or adult life. She was not able to remember things that most people pick up in everyday life such as logos or the names of common songs.
- Posthypnotic amnesia occurs when events during hypnosis are forgotten, or where memories are unable to be recalled. The failure to remember those events is induced by suggestions made during the hypnosis. Some characteristics of posthypnotic amnesia include inability to remember specific events while under hypnotic influence, reversibility, and having no relation between the implicit and explicit memory. Research has shown that there could be selectivity with amnesia when posthypnotic amnesia occurs. Some research states that most adults cannot remember memories as early as two or three years old. Research suggests there are cultural influences that affect memories that are recalled. Researchers have found that implicit memories cannot be recalled or described.

### Retrograde amnesia… [^111nwkcy]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Although she could be re-taught information from her past, these memories were not episodic, but rather, semantic. With focal RA, the details of a patient's life prior to amnesia onset can be reintroduced, but they are unable to recall how they perceived the experience |Isolated RA is usually associated with a visible thalamic lesion. Similar to other forms of RA, the inability to recall past information characterizes the isolated form. In one case study, a middle-aged man, identified as JG, had a thalamic lesion which expanded as he grew older. This lesion growth induced his isolated RA, resulting in both autobiographical memory loss and the inability to recognize information from popular culture. Traumatic events RA can occur without any anatomical damage to the brain, lacking an observable neurobiological basis.

Primarily referred to as psychogenic amnesia or psychogenic fugue, it often occurs due to a traumatic situation that individuals wish to consciously or unconsciously avoid through intrapsychic conflicts or unconscious repressions. The onset of psychogenic amnesia can be either global or situation specific. Patients experiencing psychogenic amnesia have impaired episodic memory, instances of wandering and traveling, and acceptance of a new identity as a result of inaccessible memories pertaining to their previous identity. Studies of specific cases, such as 'AMN', support evidence of traumatic experiences as a plausible cause of RA. AMN escaped a small fire in his house, did not inhale any smoke, and had no brain damage. Nevertheless, he was unable to recall autobiographical knowledge the next day. This case shows that RA can occur in the absence of structural brain damage.

After a traumatic head injury, emotional disturbances can occur at three different levels: neurological, reactionary, and long-term disturbances. Neurological disturbances can change emotional and motivational responses. Reactionary disturbances effect emotional and motivational responses as well, but reflect the failure to cope with environmental demands. Someone with this might withdraw from the environment that they are placed in because they no longer know how to handle the cognitive resources. Diagnosis Since RA affects people's memories to varying degrees, testing is required to fully diagnose RA; these tests, however, are inherently limited if a patient's previous neuropathological medical history is unknown. As a result, some clinicians diagnose RA by testing patients about factual knowledge, such as current public events. This testing is limited, however, because people's knowledge about current events differs.

To avoid these issues, many researchers test for RA using the Autobiographical Memory Interview. The AMI asks patients targeted questions about three different portions of their life: childhood, early adult life, and recent life. For each period of that individual's life, researchers ask questions that require the patient to use either their autobiographical or semantic memory. Each case of RA has led to different symptoms and durations, where some patients have exhibited an inability to describe future plans, whether in the near future or in the distant future because of their inability to consolidate memories. Furthermore, researchers have also found that some patients can identify themselves and loved ones in photographs, but cannot determine the time or place the photo was taken. It has also been found that patients with RA greatly differ from the general population in remembering past events.
