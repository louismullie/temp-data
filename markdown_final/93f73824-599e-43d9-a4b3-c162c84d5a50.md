## Question

Sotalol dosing per creatinine clearance

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about sotalol dosing in relation to creatinine clearance, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic rationale linking renal function to sotalol exposure. Then, I should verify the baseline safety prerequisites and the exact creatinine clearance thresholds that govern dosing. Next, I will map dose initiation and titration by CrCl category, reconcile any conflicting guidance, and address special populations and dialysis scenarios. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary and ensure monitoring requirements and guideline alignment are explicit.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic foundation so I don't jump to conclusions: sotalol is not metabolized, is eliminated unchanged by the kidneys via glomerular filtration with some tubular secretion, and has a mean half-life around 12 hours in normal renal function, which explains why renal impairment prolongs exposure and necessitates dose/interval adjustments. In anuria, the half-life can extend up to about 69 hours, so accumulation risk is substantial and dose must be reduced or avoided in severe renal dysfunction [^111kHyWe] [^115v2RXn] [^1158uFUZ].

> I need to check the baseline safety prerequisites before any dosing decision: baseline QTc must be 450 ms or less (some labels allow up to 500 ms in paced QRS or bundle branch block contexts during inpatient protocols), serum potassium and magnesium should be normalized, and initiation must occur in a monitored setting with continuous ECG and personnel trained in managing serious ventricular arrhythmias. Patients should not be discharged within 12 hours of electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion, and QTc should be checked 2–4 hours after each dose during initiation and titration [^115BXwkp] [^111EwYXQ] [^116rM5KL].

> Now, I should verify the creatinine clearance thresholds that drive dosing: CrCl greater than 60 mL/min supports twice-daily dosing, CrCl 40–60 mL/min warrants once-daily dosing or divided dosing at half the total daily dose, and CrCl less than 40 mL/min is a contraindication. Wait, let me verify the exact lower bound — most authoritative labeling and guidelines converge on less than 40 mL/min as contraindicated, though some European guidance uses less than 30 mL/min, so I should explicitly note that discrepancy and default to the FDA-labeled threshold for U.S. practice [^115BXwkp] [^114QihW3] [^115XKoAd].

> For CrCl greater than 60 mL/min, I will now examine initiation and titration: start 80 mg twice daily with continuous telemetry and QTc checks 2–4 hours after each dose. If QTc remains less than 500 ms after about 3 days, increase to 100–120 mg twice daily, and if still inadequate and tolerated, up to 160 mg twice daily, recognizing that doses above 160 mg twice daily increase torsades risk and are not recommended. Hold on, I should verify the maximum — yes, 160 mg twice daily is the labeled ceiling for AF/AFL prevention and ventricular arrhythmia treatment in this renal stratum [^115BXwkp] [^111bA5Ar] [^111EwYXQ].

> For CrCl 40–60 mL/min, let me think about the safest approach: start 80 mg once daily (or 40 mg twice daily if a divided regimen is preferred), monitor for 5–6 doses to account for prolonged time to steady state, and if QTc remains less than 500 ms, titrate to 100–120 mg once daily (or 60 mg twice daily). I should double-check that both once-daily and divided strategies are acceptable — labels and algorithms allow either, with the key being the same total daily dose and careful QT monitoring [^115BXwkp] [^113iPT13] [^116WfSRg].

> For CrCl less than 40 mL/min, I need to ensure I'm precise: sotalol is contraindicated due to markedly prolonged half-life and proarrhythmic risk. If a patient's renal function later deteriorates into this range, the drug should be discontinued or, if continued off-label in exceptional circumstances, the dose should be reduced by about 75% with extended intervals, but wait — that off-label reduction is extrapolated from IV sotalol guidance and should be framed as expert opinion rather than labeled practice, so I should clearly state that discontinuation is preferred and any off-label use requires specialist oversight and enhanced monitoring [^115BXwkp] [^112JTM4R] [^113cGgCq].

> Next, I should review special populations and dialysis so I don't miss nuances: in elderly patients, age per se does not change sotalol kinetics, but reduced CrCl is common and drives the same renal-based dosing. In pediatrics, dosing is body-surface-area based with age adjustments under 2 years and extended time to steady state in neonates, and renal impairment mandates longer intervals and lower doses with close QT monitoring. For intermittent hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, reduce total dose by about 75% and extend dosing frequency to every 48 hours, with ECG monitoring for QT prolongation. For continuous renal replacement therapy, reduce dose by about 75% and extend to every 36–48 hours, again with vigilant QT surveillance [^115v2RXn] [^113wgRWQ] [^115bNFvp] [^115eNANq] [^114sjFYi].

> I should confirm the monitoring cadence and safety cutoffs so the plan is actionable: during inpatient initiation or dose escalation, obtain a 12-lead ECG, check and replete potassium and magnesium, calculate CrCl, and monitor QTc 2–4 hours after each dose. Reduce the dose or discontinue if QTc reaches 500 ms or more (or 520 ms in some protocols), and if QTc remains 500 ms or more on the lowest maintenance dose, stop therapy. After discharge on a stable dose, reassess ECG, electrolytes, and renal function every 3–6 months, and more frequently if kidney function changes or other QT-prolonging drugs are added [^111EwYXQ] [^111bA5Ar] [^114wSF52].

> Hold on, I should verify the guideline synthesis to ensure consistency: ACC/AHA/HRS AF guidelines align with FDA labeling on CrCl-based dosing and inpatient initiation with telemetry, emphasizing that sotalol is reasonable for rhythm maintenance when QTc, potassium, magnesium, renal function, and bradycardia risk are acceptable. ESC guidance similarly supports sotalol for long-term rhythm control with close monitoring of QT, potassium, and renal function, reinforcing the same thresholds and vigilance for proarrhythmia [^114QihW3] [^114t4KAv] [^113dzNCg].

> Let me reconsider any potential pitfalls: I initially thought some labels might allow use down to CrCl 30 mL/min, but wait, the most current FDA AF labeling consistently uses less than 40 mL/min as contraindicated, so I should anchor to that threshold in U.S. practice. Also, while some European sources discuss once-daily dosing for CrCl 30–60 mL/min, the balance of evidence and labeling supports the 40 mL/min cutoff and the once-daily strategy for 40–60 mL/min, which I will maintain here to avoid confusion [^115BXwkp] [^114QihW3] [^115XKoAd].

> Final synthesis — let me ensure this is crisp and actionable: calculate CrCl before the first dose. If CrCl is greater than 60 mL/min, start 80 mg twice daily and titrate to 120–160 mg twice daily as tolerated with QTc less than 500 ms. If CrCl is 40–60 mL/min, start 80 mg once daily (or 40 mg twice daily) and titrate to 100–120 mg once daily (or 60 mg twice daily) with extended monitoring. If CrCl is less than 40 mL/min, do not initiate sotalol. In dialysis or CRRT, reduce total dose by about 75% and extend intervals to every 36–48 hours with enhanced ECG monitoring. Throughout, correct electrolytes, monitor QTc 2–4 hours post-dose, and reassess renal function and ECGs at regular intervals after discharge [^115BXwkp] [^111bA5Ar] [^111EwYXQ] [^115bNFvp] [^114sjFYi].

---

Sotalol dosing must be individualized by creatinine clearance (CrCl) due to renal elimination and QT-prolongation risk [^111kHyWe] [^112oY2F6]. Use the following regimen:

- **CrCl > 60 mL/min**: 80–160 mg twice daily (max 320 mg/day) [^115BXwkp] [^114QihW3].
- **CrCl 40–60 mL/min**: 80 mg once daily (max 160 mg/day) [^115BXwkp] [^111SjFCZ].
- **CrCl < 40 mL/min**: contraindicated due to torsades risk [^115BXwkp] [^116hExps].

Initiate in-hospital with continuous ECG monitoring, check QTc 2–4 hours after each dose, and adjust dose if QTc ≥ 500 ms or if renal function changes [^111EwYXQ] [^111bA5Ar]. Reassess renal function and QTc regularly during maintenance [^114wSF52].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and clinical implications

Sotalol is **renally eliminated** and not metabolized; its half-life is ~12 hours in normal renal function and can extend to 69 hours in anuria, so renal impairment increases exposure and QT-prolongation risk [^111kHyWe] [^115v2RXn]. Dosing must therefore be **adjusted to CrCl** to avoid accumulation and proarrhythmia [^115kBBJh].

---

## Dosing recommendations by creatinine clearance

| **Creatinine clearance (crcl)** | **Initial dose** | **Maximum dose** | **Dosing frequency** |
|-|-|-|-|
| > 60 mL/min | 80 mg | 160 mg twice daily (max 320 mg/day) | Twice daily (BID) [^115BXwkp] [^114QihW3] |
| 40–60 mL/min | 80 mg | 160 mg/day | Once daily (QD) [^115BXwkp] [^111SjFCZ] |
| < 40 mL/min | Contraindicated | Contraindicated | Contraindicated [^115BXwkp] [^114QihW3] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing recommendations

Clinical trials show that sotalol's **QT-prolongation and proarrhythmic risk are dose-related** and rise with renal impairment; dose adjustment by CrCl reduces torsades risk [^112oY2F6] [^116hExps]. The **AF/AFL program** found torsades incidence was lower with doses ≤ 320 mg/day and higher with > 320 mg/day, supporting the labeled maxima and renal-based dosing [^116hExps].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

- **Baseline assessment**: ECG, serum potassium, magnesium, and creatinine; calculate CrCl before first dose [^111EwYXQ].
- **QT monitoring**: check QTc 2–4 hours after each dose during initiation and titration; reduce dose or discontinue if QTc ≥ 500 ms [^111EwYXQ].
- **Renal function monitoring**: reassess regularly; adjust dose if CrCl changes [^111bA5Ar].
- **Inpatient initiation**: required for at least 3 days with continuous ECG monitoring and resuscitation capability [^111EwYXQ].

---

## Special populations and clinical scenarios

- **Elderly patients**: adjust dose based on CrCl; monitor closely for QT prolongation and bradycardia [^115v2RXn].
- **Pediatric patients**: dosing is BSA-based with renal function considerations; monitor QTc and heart rate closely [^113wgRWQ].
- **Dialysis patients**: sotalol is dialyzable; dose adjustments and close monitoring are required [^115p3aG8].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **CrCl > 60 mL/min**: 80–160 mg BID (max 320 mg/day) [^117UMY8u].
- **CrCl 40–60 mL/min**: 80 mg QD (max 160 mg/day) [^114QihW3].
- **CrCl < 40 mL/min**: contraindicated [^116WfSRg].
- **Monitoring**: inpatient initiation with ECG, QTc, electrolytes, and renal function monitoring [^111EwYXQ].

Sotalol dosing must be **tailored to creatinine clearance** to mitigate QT-prolongation and torsades risk; adhere to labeled renal thresholds, initiate in-hospital with ECG monitoring, and reassess renal function and QTc during maintenance therapy [^114t4KAv].

### Feasibility and safety of intravenous sotalol loading in adult patients with Atrial fibrillation (DASH-AF) [^112vMXaL]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Inpatient initiation of sotalol is recommended owing to its proarrhythmic effects.

Objectives

The DASH-AF (Feasibility and Safety of Intravenous Sotalol Administered as a Loading Dose to Initiate Oral Sotalol Therapy in Adult Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) trial evaluates the safety and feasibility of intravenous (IV) sotalol, achieving a steady state with maximum QTc prolongation within 6 hours instead of the traditional 5-dose inpatient oral (PO) titration.

Methods

DASH-AF is a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, open-label trial consisting of patients who underwent IV sotalol loading dose to initiate rapid oral therapy for atrial arrhythmias. IV dose was calculated based on the target oral dose as indicated by baseline QTc and renal function. Patients' QTc (in sinus) was measured via electrocardiography at 15-minute intervals and after IV loading completion. Patients were discharged 4 hours after first oral dose. All patients were monitored via mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry for 72 hours. The control group was composed of patients admitted for the traditional 5 PO doses. Safety outcomes were assessed in both groups.

Results

A total of 120 patients from 3 centers were enrolled from 2021 to 2022 in the IV loading group (compared with type of AF- and renal function-matched patients in the conventional PO loading cohort). This study demonstrated no significant change in ΔQTc in both groups, with a significantly lower number of patients requiring dose adjustment in the IV arm compared with the PO arm (4.1% vs 16.6%; P = 0.003). This led to potential cost savings of up to $3,500.68 per admission.

Conclusions

The DASH-AF trial shows that rapid IV sotalol loading in atrial fibrillation/flutter patients for rhythm control is feasible and safe compared with conventional oral loading with significant cost reduction.

Atrial fibrillation — Table 25 recommended monitoring for other antiarrhythmic drugs details by agent as follows: Dofetilide baseline testing includes 12-lead ECG*, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during 3-d hospitalization for dofetilide initiation, serum potassium and magnesium concentration, and serum creatinine for estimation of creatinine clearance (CrCl); follow-up testing in 3–6 mo is 12-lead ECG*, serum potassium and magnesium concentration, and serum creatinine for estimation of CrCl; additional follow-up is every 3–6 mo (more frequently for patients concomitantly taking other QT interval-prolonging drugs or with changing kidney function) with 12-lead ECG*, serum potassium and magnesium concentration, and serum creatinine for estimation of CrCl. Dronedarone baseline testing lists 12-lead ECG*, AST†, and ALT† with follow-up within first 6 mo of AST and ALT; the footnote states †To facilitate early detection of potential dronedarone-associated hepatotoxicity. Ibutilide baseline testing includes 12-lead ECG* and determination of serum potassium and magnesium concentrations with correction of hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia before initiation of the infusion; follow-up is continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for assessment of QTc interval duration for at least 4 h after infusion or until the QTc has returned to baseline to minimize the risk of ibutilide-associated torsades de pointes (TdP). Procainamide baseline testing includes 12-lead ECG* and BP, and during infusion electrocardiographic monitoring for rhythm, QRS width and QTc interval is recommended, with BP monitoring to detect clinically relevant hypotension. Sotalol requires baseline 12-lead ECG*, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during 3-d hospitalization for sotalol initiation, serum potassium and magnesium concentration, and serum creatinine for estimation of CrCl; follow-up in 3–6 mo is 12-lead ECG*, serum potassium and magnesium concentration, and serum creatinine for estimation of CrCl; additional follow-up every 3–6 mo (more frequently for patients concomitantly taking other QT interval-prolonging drugs or with changing kidney function) repeats the same tests; the footnote indicates *Assess rhythm and calculate QTc.

### Drug dosing adjustments in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1157QyjE]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects renal drug elimination and other pharmacokinetic processes involved in drug disposition (e.g., absorption, drug distribution, nonrenal clearance [metabolism]). Drug dosing errors are common in patients with renal impairment and can cause adverse effects and poor outcomes. Dosages of drugs cleared renally should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate and should be calculated using online or electronic calculators. Recommended methods for maintenance dosing adjustments are dose reductions, lengthening the dosing interval, or both. Physicians should be familiar with commonly used medications that require dosage adjustments. Resources are available to assist in dosing decisions for patients with chronic kidney disease.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Class III antiarrhythmic agent — sotalol dosing and safety: initial dose is 40–80 mg every 12 h, and patients initiated or reinitiated on sotalol should be in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for a minimum of 3 d; it is contraindicated if the QTc interval is > 450 ms. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) should be calculated before dosing; if CrCl > 60 mL/min, dose twice daily; if CrCl 40–60 mL/min, every 24 h; if CrCl < 40 mL/min, it should not be used. The maintenance dose is 160 mg every 12 h; during initiation and titration the QT interval should be checked 2–4 h after each dose and if QT interval prolongs to ≥ 500 ms, the dose must be reduced or the drug discontinued. Adverse effects include QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, bradycardia, and bronchospasm; precautions list prolonged QT, renal dysfunction, hypokalemia, diuretic therapy, avoiding other QT‑prolonging drugs, sinus or AV nodal dysfunction, decompensated systolic HF, cardiogenic shock, reactive airway disease, and drugs with SA and/or AV–nodal blocking properties.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Sotalol — role in atrial fibrillation — Sotalol is not effective for conversion of AF to sinus rhythm, but it may be used to prevent AF. Placebo-controlled studies found it safe and effective at doses ranging from 80 to 160 mg twice daily. In the CTAF study, sotalol and propafenone were less effective than amiodarone. In an uncontrolled stepped-care study beginning with propafenone and then sotalol after failure, paroxysmal AF occurred in nearly 50% of patients and only 27% with persistent AF converted to sinus rhythm at 6 mo. In recurrent AF after cardioversion, propafenone was as effective as sotalol in maintaining sinus rhythm 1 y after cardioversion. Sotalol should be avoided in patients with asthma, HF, renal insufficiency, or QT interval prolongation.

8 USE IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category B

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Sotalol has been shown to cross the placenta, and is found in amniotic fluid. In animal studies there was no increase in congenital anomalies, but an increase in early resorptions occurred at sotalol doses 18 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD, based on surface area). Animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response.

Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits during organogenesis at 9 and 7 times the MRHD (based on surface area), respectively, did not reveal any teratogenic potential associated with sotalol. In rabbits, a dose of sotalol 6 times the MRHD produced a slight increase in fetal death as well as maternal toxicity. This effect did not occur at sotalol dose 3 times the MRHD. In rats a sotalol dose 18 times the MRHD increased the number of early resorptions, while a dose 2.5 times the MRHD, produced no increase in early resorptions.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

Sotalol is excreted in the milk of laboratory animals and has been reported to be present in human milk. Discontinue nursing on Sotalol Hydrochloride Tablets.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of sotalol in children have not been established. However, the Class III electrophysiologic and beta-blocking effects, the pharmacokinetics, and the relationship between the effects (QTc interval and resting heart rate) and drug concentrations have been evaluated in children aged between 3 days and 12 years old [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Sotalol is mainly eliminated via the kidneys. Dosing intervals should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Sotalol dosing and outcomes among patients undergoing intravenous loading for atrial arrhythmias – A PEAKS registry substudy [^111BJv9C]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sotalol is used for the maintenance of sinus rhythm among patients with atrial fibrillation. However, there is discretion regarding dosing of chronic therapy, and the target oral dose dictates infusion doses for intravenous sotalol loading. To date, use and outcomes by dose are not well-described.

Methods

In the Prospective Evaluation Analysis and Kinetics of IV Sotalol (PEAKS) Registry, we analyzed outcomes among patients undergoing elective IV sotalol load for atrial arrhythmias (AT/AF). Baseline characteristics, changes in ECG parameters, in-hospital adverse events, and arrhythmia outcomes were compared based on target oral dose (80mg vs. 120mg).

Results

Among 163 total patients, 85 (52%) of patients underwent loading anticipating target oral dose of 80mg, compared with 78 (48%) for 120mg. Those targeting 80mg were older (median age 70 vs. 66, p < 0.001), with similar proportion female (24% vs. 21%, p = 0.71), and without significant differences in comorbidities or renal function. Patients targeted for 80mg were less frequently kept in-hospital for 2 oral doses after intravenous infusion (45% vs. 89%, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in rates of sinus rhythm or adverse events during loading.

Conclusions

Selection of target oral sotalol dose (120 vs. 80mg) does not appear to be driven by patient characteristics, and may represent an opportunity for improved treatment. In-hospital adverse events are low overall without differences between dose.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Demographics

A total of 133 AF/AFL patients were admitted for sotalol initiation between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018 and met the study inclusion criteria. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics are reported for the study population in Table 1. The average age was 70.0 ± 12.3 years and 60.2% were male. Noteworthy baseline comorbidities included hypertension (82.7%), hyperlipidemia (72.2%), diabetes (36.1%), CAD (53.4%), cardiomyopathy (32.3%), past or current smoking history (30.1%), and obstructive sleep apnea (40.6%). Mean baseline creatinine was 1.08 ± 0.45 (median: 0.97). Prior ablation occurred in 20.3% of patients and 32.3% had undergone cardioversion before enrollment. A total of 94.0% of patients were admitted with a primary diagnosis of AF and 23.2% with a diagnosis of AFL (with some patients having a prior diagnosis of both arrhythmias). Patients presented with a mean ejection fraction of 59.9 ± 7.8% and a mean QTc of 453.7 ± 37.6 ms before sotalol dosing; a baseline left bundle branch block was present in 4.5% and right bundle branch block in an additional 8.3% (Table 3).

For children aged about 2 years or younger

For children aged about 2 years or younger, the above pediatric dosage should be reduced by a factor that depends heavily upon age, as shown in the following graph, age plotted on a logarithmic scale in months.

For a child aged 20 months, the dosing suggested for children with normal renal function aged 2 years or greater should be multiplied by about 0.97; the initial starting dose would be (30 X 0.97) = 29.1 mg/m 2, administered three times daily. For a child aged 1 month, the starting dose should be multiplied by 0.68; the initial starting dose would be (30 X 0.68) = 20 mg/m 2, administered three times daily. For a child aged about 1 week, the initial starting dose should be multiplied by 0.3; the starting dose would be (30 X 0.3) = 9 mg/m 2. Similar calculations should be made for increased doses as titration proceeds. Since the half-life of sotalol decreases with decreasing age (below about 2 years), time to steady-state will also increase. Thus, in neonates the time to steady-state may be as long as a week or longer.

In all children, individualization of dosage is required. As in adults Sotalol AF (sotalol hydrochloride) should be used with particular caution in children if the QTcis greater than 500 msec on therapy and serious consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing therapy when QTcexceeds 550 msec.

The use of Sotalol AF in children with renal impairment has not been investigated. Sotalol elimination is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form. Use of sotalol in any age group with decreased renal function should be at lower doses or at increased intervals between doses. Monitoring of heart rate and QTcis more important and it will take much longer to reach steady-state with any dose and/or frequency of administration.

Transfer to Sotalol AF from Sotalol

Patients with a history of symptomatic AFIB/AFL who are currently receiving sotalol the maintenance of normal sinus should be transferred to Sotalol AF because of the significant differences in labeling (i.e., patient package insert, dosing administration, and safety information).

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rhythm control, maintenance therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating sotalol for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm, with proper dose selection based on kidney function and close monitoring of the QT interval, HR, serum potassium and magnesium concentrations, and kidney function in patients with AF without significant baseline QT interval prolongation, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or bradycardia.

### Implementation of an intravenous sotalol initiation protocol: implications for feasibility, safety, and length of stay [^115X7Qo3]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

4.1 | Study limitations

Because of the small cohort size, conclusions about changes in the QT/QTc interval during and after infusion are tempered by large intra- and inter-patient variability in the QT/QTc interval. The PEAKS registry is a multicenter registry currently being established of patients receiving IV sotalol initiation that will further refine understanding of QT prolongation during and after infusion, with both clinical and pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic data. This study's cohort also tended to be healthier, with overall preserved kidney function and low normal LVEF, and data may not be as generalizable to those with decreased renal clearance or more significantly depressed ejection fractions for whom sotalol can be more dangerous. There were also significantly more women in the oral sotalol load group, which may bias QT interval comparisons given the known differences in repolarization between genders. Lastly, patients were only followed until discharge and longer-term safety outcomes are not available. These longer-term outcomes are presumed to be similar to patients loaded with oral sotalol.

4.2 | Conclusion

The use of a 1-day IV sotalol loading protocol for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias is safe and well tolerated. It reduces LOS from an average of 3.6 days to 1 day compared with oral sotalol loading, which can translate into significant cost and resource savings. QT prolongation appears to be near its greatest immediately after sotalol infusion, which suggests discharge after infusion may be possible. Studies evaluating accelerated discharge after a single oral dose as well as an expanded multicenter registry of patients undergoing IV sotalol initiation are forthcoming.

If the 80 mg dose level (given BID or QD depending upon the creatinine clearance) does not reduce the frequency of relapses of AFIB/AFL and is tolerated without excessive QT interval prolongation (i.e., ≥ 520 msec), the dose level may be increased to 120 mg (BID or QD depending upon the creatinine clearance). As proarrhythmic events can occur not only at initiation of therapy, but also with each upward dosage adjustment, Steps 2 through 5 used during initiation of Sotalol AF therapy should be followed when increasing the dose level. In the U.S. multicenter dose-response study, the 120 mg dose (BID or QD) was found to be the most effective in prolonging the time to ECG documented symptomatic recurrence of AFIB/AFL. If the 120 mg dose does not reduce the frequency of early relapse of AFIB/AFL and is tolerated without excessive QT interval prolongation (≥ 520 msec), an increase to 160 mg (BID or QD depending upon the creatinine clearance), can be considered. Steps 2 through 5 used during the initiation of therapy should be used again to introduce such an increase.

Maintenance of Sotalol AF Therapy

Renal function and QT should be re-evaluated regularly if medically warranted. If QT is 520 msec or greater (JT 430 msec or greater if QRS is > 100 msec), the dose of Sotalol AF therapy should be reduced and patients should be carefully monitored until QT returns to less than 520 msec. If the QT interval is ≥ 520 msec while on the lowest maintenance dose level (80 mg) the drug should be discontinued. If renal function deteriorates, reduce the daily dose in half by administering the drug once daily as described in Initiation of Sotalol AF Therapy, Step 3.

Special Considerations

The maximum recommended dose in patients with a calculated creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min is 160 mg BID, doses greater than 160 mg BID have been associated with an increased incidence of Torsade de Pointes and are not recommended.

A patient who misses a dose should NOT double the next dose. The next dose should be taken at the usual time.

Only 7 patients that could be assessed for dialyzability grading had normal kidney function, and only two reports were identified for a BAA (sotalol) whose grading may differ depending on kidney function. For these two cases, dialyzability was assessed as " Dialyzable " for one case of hemodialysis and " Moderately dialyzable " for one case of hemoperfusion-hemodialysis in series.

Clinical data

Among case reports and case series, the panel acknowledged variability in methodological quality and lack of reporting of critical information. The evidence for a clinical effect of ECTR in BAA poisoning was available for 37 patients (acebutolol = 4, atenolol = 9, carvedilol = 1, metoprolol = 1, propranolol = 9, sotalol = 9, talinolol = 4), 16 of which had impaired kidney function (Table 4). All included patients were self-poisoned, except 6 dosing errors in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (atenolol = 1, sotalol = 5). Bradycardia and hypotension requiring vasopressors and/or inotropes were ubiquitous features for all BAAs except for propranolol and sotalol (predominant features for sotalol were ventricular dysrhythmias).

### Allopurinol dosing in renal impairment: walking the tightrope between adequate urate lowering and adverse events [^113wEiii]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Allopurinol is the mainstay of urate-lowering therapy for patients with gout and impaired renal function. Although rare, a life-threatening hypersensitivity syndrome may occur with this drug. The risk of this allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is increased in renal impairment. The recognition that AHS may be because of delayed-type hypersensitivity to oxypurinol, the main metabolite of allopurinol, and that oxypurinol concentrations are frequently elevated in patients with renal impairment prescribed standard doses of allopurinol has led to the widespread adoption of allopurinol-dosing guidelines. These guidelines advocate allopurinol dose reduction according to creatinine clearance in patients with renal impairment. However, recent studies have challenged the role of these guidelines, suggesting that AHS may occur even at low doses of allopurinol, and that these guidelines lead to under-treatment of hyperuricemia, a key therapeutic target in gout. Based on current data, we advocate gradual introduction of allopurinol according to current treatment guidelines, with close monitoring of serum uric acid concentrations. In patients with severe disease and persistent hyperuricemia, allopurinol dose escalation above those recommended by the guidelines should be considered, with careful evaluation of the benefits and risks of therapy. Further work is needed to clarify the safety and efficacy of allopurinol dose escalation, particularly in patients with renal impairment.

Specific Populations

Pediatric: The combined analysis of a single-dose and a multiple-dose study with 59 children, aged between 3 days and 12 years, showed the pharmacokinetics of sotalol to be first order. A daily dose of 30 mg/m2of sotalol was administered in the single dose study and daily doses of 30, 90 and 210 mg/m2were administered every 8 hours in the multi-dose study. After rapid absorption with peak levels occurring on average between 2–3 hours following administration, sotalol was eliminated with a mean half-life of 9.5 hours. Steady-state was reached after 1 to 2 days. The average peak to trough concentration ratio was 2. Body surface area was the most important covariate and more relevant than age for the pharmacokinetics of sotalol. The smallest children (BSA < 0.33 m2) exhibited a greater drug exposure (+59%) than the larger children who showed a uniform drug concentration profile. The intersubject variation for oral clearance was 22%.

Geriatric: Age does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of SOTYLIZE, but impaired renal function in geriatric patients can increase the terminal elimination half-life, resulting in increased drug accumulation.

Renal Impairment: Sotalol is mainly eliminated via the kidneys through glomerular filtration and to a small degree by tubular secretion. There is a direct relationship between renal function, as measured by serum creatinine or creatinine clearance, and the elimination rate of sotalol. The half-life of sotalol is prolonged (up to 69 hours) in anuric patients. Adjust doses or dosing intervals based on creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment show no alteration in clearance of sotalol.

Drug-Drug Interactions

Antacids: Administration of oral sotalol within 2 hours of antacids may result in a reduction in Cmax and AUC of 26% and 20%, respectively, and consequently in a 25% reduction in the bradycardic effect at rest. Administration of the antacid two hours after oral sotalol has no effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of sotalol.

No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed with hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin.

2 | METHODS

2.1 | Patient selection and protocol description

Administration of IV sotalol began in August 2021 using the protocol described in the Supporting Information: Appendix. Adult patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 30 ml/min and a primary indication of atrial or ventricular arrhythmias were included. Patients with bradycardia < 60 b.p.m. or corrected QT (QTc) interval > 450ms were excluded, except in select cases with the approval and oversight of an attending cardiac electrophysiologist. Those with a paced QRS or bundle branch block were permitted a QTc interval up to 500ms. Patients with acute decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock were also excluded, although there was no prespecified lower limit for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or blood pressure. Patients had their baseline electrolytes drawn and repleted, and a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained. If they presented in a sustained atrial arrhythmia, cardioversion to sinus rhythm was performed before infusion. IV sotalol was then infused over 60min with one-to-one nursing, frequent vital signs, and continuous cardiac telemetry. If the heart rate dropped below 60 b.p.m. the QT interval was used instead of the QTc interval for decision making. ECGs were obtained every 15min during infusion. The infusion was stopped if the patient developed bradycardia < 50 b.p.m. or had prolongation of the QT/QTc interval to greater than 500 ms (550 ms for those with paced QRS or bundle branch block). After completion of infusion, patients were admitted to the inpatient telemetry unit for the remaining two oral doses, with subsequent ECGs 2–4 h after each oral dose.

Patients undergoing oral sotalol initiation for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias from January 2021 to June 2022 were included for comparison with IV sotalol. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical. Oral doses were given based on standard prescribing regimens using CrCl, with ECGs similarly performed 2–4 h after each dose of sotalol. Patients were monitored for five oral doses before discharge. Patients with sustained atrial arrhythmias were cardioverted after the fifth oral dose of sotalol and monitored for an additional day after cardioversion. Those who experienced bradycardia < 50 b.p.m. or QT/QTc prolongation > 500 ms (550 ms for those with paced QRS or bundle branch block) either had their oral sotalol dose reduced or discontinued.

Dosing and Administration in Adults

Therapy with Sotalol AF must be initiated (and, if necessary, titrated) in a setting that provides continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Patients should continue to be monitored in this way for a minimum of 3 days on the maintenance dose. In addition, patients should not be discharged within 12 hours of electrical or pharmacological conversion to normal sinus rhythm.
The QT interval is used to determine patient eligibility for Sotalol AF treatment and for monitoring safety during treatment. The baseline QT interval must be ≤ 450 msec in order for a patient to be started on Sotalol AF therapy. During initiation and titration, the QT interval should be monitored 2 to 4 hours after each dose. If the QT interval prolongs to 500 msec or greater, the dose must be reduced or the drug discontinued.
The dose of Sotalol AF must be individualized according to calculated creatinine clearance. In patients with a creatinine clearance > 60 mL/min Sotalol AF is administered twice daily (BID) while in those with a creatinine clearance between 40 and 60 mL/min, the dose is administered once daily (QD). In patients with a creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min Sotalol AF is contraindicated. The recommended initial dose of Sotalol AF is 80 mg and is initiated as shown in the dosing algorithm described below. The 80 mg dose can be titrated upward to 120 mg during initial hospitalization or after discharge on 80 mg in the event of recurrence, by rehospitalization and repeating the same steps used during the initiation of therapy (see Upward Titration of Dose).
Patients with atrial fibrillation should be anticoagulated according to usual medical practice. Hypokalemia should be corrected before initiation of Sotalol AF therapy (see WARNINGS, Ventricular Arrhythmia).
Patients to be discharged on Sotalol AF therapy from an in-patient setting should have an adequate supply of Sotalol AF, to allow uninterrupted therapy until the patient can fill a Sotalol AF prescription.

### Sotalol dosing and outcomes among patients undergoing intravenous loading for atrial arrhythmias – A PEAKS registry substudy [^112DF2B6]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Sotalol is used for the maintenance of sinus rhythm among patients with atrial fibrillation. However, there is discretion regarding dosing of chronic therapy, and the target oral dose dictates infusion doses for intravenous sotalol loading. To date, use and outcomes by dose are not well‐described.

Methods

In the Prospective Evaluation Analysis and Kinetics of IV Sotalol (PEAKS) Registry, we analyzed outcomes among patients undergoing elective IV sotalol load for atrial arrhythmias (AT/AF). Baseline characteristics, changes in ECG parameters, in‐hospital adverse events, and arrhythmia outcomes were compared based on target oral dose (80 mg vs. 120 mg).

Results

Among 163 total patients, 85 (52%) of patients underwent loading anticipating target oral dose of 80 mg, compared with 78 (48%) for 120 mg. Those targeting 80 mg were older (median age 70 vs. 66, p < 0.001), with similar proportion female (24% vs. 21%, p = 0.71), and without significant differences in comorbidities or renal function. Patients targeted for 80 mg were less frequently kept in‐hospital for 2 oral doses after intravenous infusion (45% vs. 89%, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in rates of sinus rhythm or adverse events during loading.

Conclusions

Selection of target oral sotalol dose (120 vs. 80 mg) does not appear to be driven by patient characteristics, and may represent an opportunity for improved treatment. In‐hospital adverse events are low overall without differences between dose.

Electrophysiology

Sotalol hydrochloride prolongs the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential in the isolated myocyte, as well as in isolated tissue preparations of ventricular or atrial muscle (Class III activity). In intact animals it slows heart rate, decreases AV nodal conduction and increases the refractory periods of atrial and ventricular muscle and conduction tissue.

In man, the Class II (beta-blockade) electrophysiological effects of Sotalol AF are manifested by increased sinus cycle length (slowed heart rate), decreased AV nodal conduction and increased AV nodal refractoriness. The Class III electrophysiological effects in man include prolongation of the atrial and ventricular monophasic action potentials, and effective refractory period prolongation of atrial muscle, ventricular muscle, and atrio-ventricular accessory pathways (where present) in both the anterograde and retrograde directions. With oral doses of 160 to 640 mg/day, the surface ECG shows dose-related mean increases of 40 to 100 msec in QTcand 10 to 40 msec in QTc. In a study of patients with atrial fibrillation (AFIB)/flutter (AFIB/AFL) receiving three different oral doses of Sotalol AF given q12h (or q24h in patients with a reduced creatinine clearance), mean increases in QT intervals measured from 12-lead ECGs of 25 msec, 40 msec and 54 msec were found in the 80 mg, 120 mg, and 160 mg dose groups, respectively. (See WARNINGS for description of relationship between QTcand Torsade de Pointes type arrhythmias.) No significant alteration in QRS interval is observed.

PRECAUTIONS

Renal Impairment

Sotalol AF is eliminated principally via the kidneys through glomerular filtration and to a small degree by tubular secretion. There is a direct relationship between renal function, as measured by serum creatinine or creatinine clearance, and the elimination rate of Sotalol AF. Guidance for dosing in conditions of renal impairment can be found under DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.

Since 2020, there have been changes in Food and Drug Administration guidance and in recommendations by national organizations with a focus on kidney diseases pertaining to the choice of equations used to estimate creatinine clearance and glomerular filtration rate in patients with renal impairment. This includes a recommendation by the National Kidney Foundation to avoid the use of the Cockcroft-Gault equation for drug dosing in patients with renal impairment. This commentary provides an overview of recent recommendations concerning kidney function assessment that have important implications for drug dosing in patients with renal impairment and provides suggestions for implementing these recommendations.

Body surface area was the most important covariate and more relevant than age for the pharmacokinetics of sotalol. The smallest children (BSA < 0.33 m2) exhibited a greater drug exposure (+59%) than the larger children who showed a uniform drug concentration profile. The intersubject variation for oral clearance was 22%.

Geriatric: Age does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of Betapace/Betapace AF, but impaired renal function in geriatric patients can increase the terminal elimination half-life, resulting in increased drug accumulation.

Renal Impairment: Sotalol is mainly eliminated via the kidneys through glomerular filtration and to a small degree by tubular secretion. There is a direct relationship between renal function, as measured by serum creatinine or creatinine clearance, and the elimination rate of sotalol. The half-life of sotalol is prolonged (up to 69 hours) in anuric patients. Adjust doses or dosing intervals based on creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment show no alteration in clearance of sotalol.

Drug-Drug Interactions

Antacids: Administration of oral sotalol within 2 hours of antacids may result in a reduction in Cmaxand AUC of 26% and 20%, respectively, and consequently in a 25% reduction in the bradycardic effect at rest. Administration of the antacid two hours after oral sotalol has no effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of sotalol.

No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed with hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin.

Initiation of Sotalol Hydrochloride Tablets (AF) Therapy

Step 1. Electrocardiographic assessment: Prior to administration of the first dose, the QT interval must be determined using an average of 5 beats. If the baseline QT is greater than 450 msec (JT ≥ 330 msec if QRS over 100 msec), sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) is contraindicated.

Step 2: Calculation of creatinine clearance: Prior to the administration of the first dose, the patient's creatinine clearance should be calculated using the following formula:

creatinine clearance (male) = (140-age) × body weight in kg

72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)

creatinine clearance (female) = (140-age) × body weight in kg × 0.85

72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)

When serum creatinine is given in µmol/L, divide the value by 88.4 (1 mg/dL = 88.4 µmol/L)

Step 3. Starting Dose: The starting dose of sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) is 80 mg twice daily (BID) if the creatinine clearance is > 60 mL/min, and 80 mg once daily (QD) or 40mg twice daily (BID) if the creatinine clearance is 40 to 60 mL/min. If the creatinine clearance is < 40 mL/min sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) are contraindicated.

Step 4. Administer the appropriate daily dose of sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) and begin continuous ECG monitoring with QT interval measurements 2 to 4 hours after each dose.

Step 5. In patients with a creatinine clearance > 60 mL/min, if the 80 mg dose level is tolerated and the QT interval remains < 500 msec after at least 3 days, the patient can be discharged. Alternatively, during hospitalization, the dose can be increased to 100 mg or 120 mg BID and the patient followed for 3 days on this dose.

In patients with a creatinine clearance of 40 to 60 mL/min, if the 80 mg daily dose (administered as 80 mg QD or 40 mg BID) is tolerated and the QT interval remains < 500 msec after 5 or 6 days, the patient can be discharged. Alternatively, during hospitalization, the dose can be increased from 80 mg QD to 100 mg or 120 mg QD, or from 40 mg BID to 60 mg BID and the patient followed for 5 or 6 days on the dose.

The steps described above are summarized in the following diagram:

Absorption

In healthy subjects, the oral bioavailability of sotalol is 90 to100%. After oral administration, peak plasma concentrations are reached in 2.5 to 4 hours, and steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 2 to3 days (that is, after 5–6 doses when administered twice daily). Over the oral dosage range 160 to640 mg/day, sotalol displays dose proportionality with respect to plasma concentrations. When administered with a standard meal, the absorption of sotalol was reduced by approximately 20% compared to administration in fasting state.

Distribution

Sotalol does not bind to plasma proteins. Distribution occurs to a central (plasma) and to a peripheral compartment. Sotalol crosses the blood brain barrier poorly.

Metabolism

Sotalol is not metabolized and is not expected to inhibit or induce any CYP450 enzymes.

Excretion

Excretion of sotalol is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form, and therefore, lower doses are necessary in conditions of renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. The mean elimination half-life of sotalol is 12 hours. Dosing every 12 hours results in trough plasma concentrations which are approximately one-half of those at peak.

### Implementation of an intravenous sotalol initiation protocol: implications for feasibility, safety, and length of stay [^1129MexK]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 | INTRODUCTION

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common rhythm disturbance, with lifetime risk estimates between 20% and 30% in the United States. The disease is complex and often difficult to treat for clinicians. It represents a considerable cost burden with an estimated incremental cost of $26 billion in 2010. Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) remain a cornerstone of therapy for management of AF. The Class III AAD sotalol has QT-prolonging effects that necessitate multiple days of inpatient hospitalization for observation during oral loading. This has been estimated to cost more than $10 000 per patient for a standard 3-day admission, with the greatest proportion of cost coming from room and board. The use of inpatient beds for these drug loads can also significantly impact hospital capacity to accept and manage other patients, given staffing and bed shortages.

Intravenous (IV) sotalol was first approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a substitute for oral therapy in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and AF/flutter, but with recommendations for infusion over 5 h. InMarch 2020, the IV formulation of the drug received FDA approval for the use in expedited loading of oral sotalol. This approval was based on the Model-Informed Drug Development regulatory path, with simulated data showing that an initial 1 h loading dose of IV sotalol followed by two oral doses in 24 h reflected maximum QT prolongation over a 1-day observation period. The newly approved use case can reduce loading time by 2 days or more, with even greater reductions for those with impaired renal function. Despite the higher drug cost of IV sotalol, the anticipated reduction in hospital length of stay (LOS) with IV sotalol is expected to lead to significant cost savings when compared with oral sotalol initiation.

Thus far, available data supporting the use of 1-day IV sotalol initiation has been limited to model-informed simulation data. A single-center experience with a 1-day sotalol loading protocol for atrial arrhythmias has been briefly described, but there are no studies comparing IV versus oral sotalol load in a clinical context. This study aims to describe implementation of a 1-day IV sotalol initiation protocol for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias at a learning health system and to provide initial feasibility and safety outcomes compared with oral sotalol initiation.

### Sotalol dosing and outcomes among patients undergoing intravenous loading for atrial arrhythmias – A PEAKS registry substudy [^113rwzdV]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Sotalol has also been shown to have dose‐dependent toxicity, namely bradycardia and QTc prolongation. These risks are the primary motivation for inpatient monitoring during loading, and may lead clinicians to modify the dosing. However, in our analysis of those undergoing intravenous loading, we did not find an excess of adverse effects when comparing 120 mg targeted dose with 80 mg (though events were rare), either during infusion or after. There may be a few explanations for this lack of difference, including: (1) variability in QTc measurement; (2) relatively small effect on QTc (see separate pharmacodynamic analysis); and (3) inter‐patient variability may overwhelm dose‐dependent variation.

The package insert for IV sotalol recommends and infusion dose of 60 mg for oral target dose of 80 mg, compared with 90 mg for 120 mg target oral dose (among patients with preserved renal function). This has raised the possibility of increased rate of cardioversion during infusion among patients at the higher dose. However, we did not observe this in our data, likely due to high rates of pre‐infusion cardioversion – a standard practice among patients undergoing sotalol loading. The drug is indicated for maintenance of sinus rhythm among patients with AF, suggesting patients should undergo cardioversion before load initiation.

### Expedited loading with intravenous sotalol is safe and feasible-primary results of the prospective evaluation analysis and kinetics of IV sotalol (PEAKS) registry [^1145hRHb]. Heart Rhythm (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Loading of oral sotalol for atrial fibrillation requires 3 days, frequently in the hospital, to achieve steady state. The Food and Drug Administration approved loading with intravenous (IV) sotalol through model-informed development, without patient data.

Objective

We present results of the first multicenter evaluation of this recent labeling for IV sotalol.

Methods

The Prospective Evaluation Analysis and Kinetics of IV Sotalol (PEAKS) Registry was a multicenter observational registry of patients undergoing elective IV sotalol load for atrial arrhythmias. Outcomes, measured from hospital admission until first outpatient follow-up, included adverse arrhythmia events, efficacy, and length of stay.

Results

Of 167 consecutively enrolled patients, 23% were female; the median age was 68 (interquartile range, 61–74) years, and the median CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 3 (interquartile range, 2–4). Overall, 99% were admitted for sotalol initiation (1% for dose escalation), with a target oral sotalol dose of either 80 mg twice daily (85 [51%]) or 120 mg twice daily (78 [47%]); 62 patients (37%) had an estimated creatinine clearance ≤ 90 mL/min. On presentation, 40% of patients were in sinus rhythm, whereas 26% underwent cardioversion before sotalol infusion. In 2 patients, sotalol infusion was stopped for bradycardia or hypotension. In 6 patients, sotalol was discontinued before discharge because of QTc prolongation (3), bradycardia (1), or recurrent atrial arrhythmia (2). The mean length of stay was 1.1 days, and 95% (n = 159) were discharged within 1 night.

Conclusion

IV sotalol loading is safe and feasible for atrial arrhythmias, with low rates of adverse events, and yields shorter hospitalizations. More data are needed on the minimal duration required for monitoring in the hospital.

### Evaluation of the dofetilide risk-management program [^114CJNQx]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Dose-dependent torsades de pointes has been shown to occur with dofetilide (Tikosyn) and sotalol HCl (Betapace AF); thus, detailed dosing and monitoring recommendations to minimize this risk are included in the product labeling for both drugs. Only dofetilide, however, has a mandated risk-management program that restricts distribution of the drug and requires prescriber education on the drug. We investigated whether this program improved adherence to dosing and monitoring recommendations for dofetilide as compared with sotalol.

Methods

Charts for 47 patients taking dofetilide and 117 patients taking sotalol were reviewed.

Results

The recommended starting dose was prescribed more frequently in the dofetilide group than in the sotalol group (79% vs 35%, P < .001). A higher number of patients in the dofetilide group compared with the sotalol group received the recommended baseline tests for potassium (100% vs 82%, P < .001), magnesium (89% vs 38%, P < .001), serum creatinine (100% vs 82%, P < .001), and electrocardiography (94% vs 67%, P < .001). A significantly greater proportion of patients in the dofetilide group received recommended electrocardiograms obtained after the first dose (94% for dofetilide vs 43% for sotalol, P < .001) and subsequent doses (80% for dofetilide vs 3.5% for sotalol, P < .001).

Conclusion

Better adherence to several dosing and monitoring recommendations in the dofetilide group may be caused by the presence of the risk-management program. However, low usage of dofetilide during the study period may signify an unintended, negative consequence of the risk-management program.

### AIM-AF: a physician survey in the United States and Europe [^111DoQ8z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

A key limitation of the study is that data were dependent on the accurate reporting of information by the respondents, which may have been subject to recall bias. Additionally, the survey sample was taken from physicians who were part of the M3 Global International Market Research Panel, and only from 4 European countries. The survey completion rate was rather low (7% in the United States and 16% in Europe), as is often the case with wide‐reaching surveys such as the one used in this study; as such, the respondents may not be wholly representative of the general population of physicians treating AF. However, it is likely that physicians who did respond to the survey were more representative of high‐quality standards of care, which is particularly noteworthy in this context, given that adherence to guidelines was unsatisfactory. Another study limitation lies in the fact that this survey did not consider AAD dosing, which can condition both safety and efficacy of therapy and, as such, could have influenced physician responses. Furthermore, the threshold values assigned for certain questions were different than thresholds cited in the guidelines; for instance, guidelines recommend against using sotalol in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, while the survey classified renal impairment as estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. Results were not stratified by degree of renal impairment; therefore, it remains difficult to accurately estimate the number of respondents who are noncompliant in this regard. Both the lack of information on dosing and the inclusion of data on potential noncompliant prescribing could have had the effect of overinflating the nonadherence rates calculated for each agent, as each could result in compliant practice being scored as nonadherent. Furthermore, these rates do not include any weighting for the degree of deviation from the guidelines or the potential outcomes of nonadherence; for example, the use of a contraindicated agent in a patient with HF, which could severely compromise patient safety, has the same weight as a guideline‐compliant dose reduction in a patient with renal impairment.

Specific Populations

Pediatric: The combined analysis of a single-dose study and a multiple-dose study with 59 children, aged between 3 days and 12 years, showed the pharmacokinetics of sotalol to be first order. A daily dose of 30 mg/m2of sotalol was administered in the single dose study and daily doses of 30, 90, and 210 mg/m2were administered every 8 hours in the multidose study. After rapid absorption with peak levels occurring on average between 2 to 3 hours following administration, sotalol was eliminated with a mean half-life of 9.5 hours. Steady-state was reached after 1 to 2 days. The average peak to trough concentration ratio was 2. Body surface area was the most important covariate and more relevant than age for the pharmacokinetics of sotalol. The smallest children (BSA < 0.33m2) exhibited a greater drug exposure (+59%) than the larger children who showed a uniform drug concentration profile. The intersubject variation for oral clearance was 22%.

Geriatric: Age does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of sotalol hydrochloride/sotalol hydrochloride AF, but impaired renal function in geriatric patients can increase the terminal elimination half-life, resulting in increased drug accumulation.

Renal Impairment: Sotalol is mainly eliminated via the kidneys through glomerular filtration and to a small degree by tubular secretion. There is a direct relationship between renal function, as measured by serum creatinine or creatinine clearance, and the elimination rate of sotalol. The half-life of sotalol is prolonged (up to 69 hours) in anuric patients. Adjust doses or dosing intervals based on creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment show no alteration in clearance of sotalol.

Drug-Drug Interactions

Antacids: Administration of oral sotalol within 2 hours of antacids may result in a reduction in Cmaxand AUC of 26% and 20%, respectively, and consequently in a 25% reduction in the bradycardic effect at rest.

Administration of the antacid two hours after oral sotalol has no effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of sotalol.

No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed with hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin.

### Sotalol [^1135Tp4K]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

In a small study (n = 25) of patients with implanted defibrillators treated concurrently with sotalol the average defibrillatory threshold was 6 joules (range 2–15 joules) compared to a mean of 16 joules for a non-randomized comparative group primarily receiving amiodarone.

In a dose-response trial comparing three dose levels of sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF), 80 mg, 120 mg, and 160 mg with placebo given q12h (or q24h in patients with a reduced renal creatinine clearance) for the prevention of recurrence of symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AFIB)/flutter (AFL), the mean ventricular rate during recurrence of AFIB/AFL was 125, 107, 110 and 99 beats/min in the placebo, 80 mg, 120 mg and 160 mg dose groups, respectively (p < 0.017 for each sotalol dose group versus placebo). In another placebo controlled trial in which sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) was titrated to a dose between 160 and 320 mg/day in patients with chronic AFIB, the mean ventricular rate during recurrence of AFIB was 107 and 84 beats/min in the placebo and sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) groups, respectively (p < 0.001).

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114t4KAv]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Specific antiarrhythmic drugs for long‑term maintenance of sinus rhythm — For patients with AF without recent decompensated heart failure (HF) or severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, use of dronedarone is reasonable. For patients without significant baseline QT interval prolongation or uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, use of dofetilide is reasonable with proper dose selection based on kidney function and close monitoring of the QT interval, serum potassium and magnesium concentrations, and kidney function. For patients with AF and normal LV function, use of low‑dose amiodarone (100–200 mg/d) is reasonable but, in view of its adverse effect profile, should be reserved for patients in whom other rhythm control strategies are ineffective, not preferred, or contraindicated. For patients without significant baseline QT interval prolongation, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or bradycardia, use of sotalol may be considered with proper dose selection based on kidney function and close monitoring of the QT interval, heart rate, serum potassium and magnesium concentrations, and kidney function. In patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and/or significant structural heart disease, including HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%), flecainide and propafenone should not be administered due to the risk of worsening HF, potential proarrhythmia, and increased mortality. For patients with AF, dronedarone should not be administered for maintenance of sinus rhythm to those with NYHA class III and IV HF or patients who have had an episode of decompensated HF in the past 4 weeks, due to the risk of increased early mortality associated with worsening HF.

### Pediatric dosing of intravenous sotalol based on body surface area in patients with arrhythmia [^114BkrvG]. Pediatric Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

For the purpose of this paper, body surface area was calculated for each child using the Mosteller formula: BSA (m 2) = SQRT ([Height (cm) × Weight (kg)]/3600). Then the administered loading dose and maintenance dose were divided by the BSA to calculate the equivalent dose in mg/m 2 BSA for each child.

The recommended starting dose of oral sotalol is based on body surface area in the US and calculated as 30 mg/m 2 × BSA × Age factor. The age factor applies to children up to 2 years of age and is provided in a nomogram in the product label. The bioavailability of oral sotalol is approximately 95%. To count for the less than 100% bioavailability, the intravenous dose is 95% of the oral dose to deliver the same amount with intravenous administration as with the oral dose. For the purpose of comparison of our body weight-based doses to the recommended BSA-based dosing, we calculated the BSA-based intravenous sotalol dose as 30 mg/m 2 × BSA × Age factor × 0.95.

Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 22 software package (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation along with the range. Each continuous variable was tested for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk tests of normality. The body weight- and BSA-based doses did not show normal distribution. Therefore, a nonparametric test was performed (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) for comparison. The correlation between the two dosing methods was evaluated by linear regression analysis using a Pearson correlation coefficient. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

2.5 Dosage for Patients with Renal Impairment

Adults

In any age group with decreased renal function, sotalol doses should be lowered or the intervals between doses increased. It will take much longer to reach steady-state with any dose and/or frequency of administration. Closely monitor heart rate and QTc.

Dose escalations in renal impairment should be done after administration of at least 5 doses at appropriate intervals (Table 1). Sotalol is partly removed by dialysis; specific advice is unavailable on dosing patients on dialysis.

Administer the initial dose of 80 mg and subsequent doses at the intervals listed in Table 1.

### Chronic kidney disease in gout in a managed care setting [^116UMGDJ]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Our findings do not indicate that initial daily dose of allopurinol is prescribed in a manner that correlates with published guidelines sensitive to renal function. The original guidelines for allopurinol dosing were based on an extensive review of severe adverse reactions to allopurinol and a small de novo study of 40 patients. That study calculated that renal clearance of oxypurinol was directly proportional to the creatinine clearance, which was calculated using the Cockroft-Gault formula. The recommended dosing levels were based on achieving a target serum oxypurinol level of 30–100 mmol/L and not on avoiding any toxicity threshold. In another study based on data from a rheumatology practice, there were modest correlations between allopurinol doses and plasma oxypurinol concentrations, and between creatinine clearance and plasma oxypurinol. However, there was no correlation between plasma oxypurinol and plasma uric acid, and only 50% of patients within the therapeutic range of plasma oxypurinol had a plasma uric acid level < 0.42 mmol/L. Collectively, these findings suggest that there is considerable heterogeneity in drug handling, and future studies need to test the underlying assumption that oxypurinol is the sole active metabolite responsible for therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. Concerns regarding adverse events in particular may influence the aggressiveness of current treatment regimens. Cutaneous adverse reactions to allopurinol occur in approximately 7.7 per 1000 recipients, and the incidence of allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome is about 2–3 times higher among renally impaired patients compared to non-renally impaired patients. However, the relationship between adverse events and allopurinol dosing is still not fully understood. Previous studies have shown that patients receiving doses of allopurinol above the recommended dose (as based on the creatinine clearance rate) did not exhibit increased toxicity. Other studies have indicated that specific genetic markers may influence the risk of experiencing severe cutaneous adverse reactions following allopurinol treatment.

Ventricular Arrhythmia

Sotalol AF can cause serious ventricular arrhythmias, primarily Torsade de Pointes (TdP) type ventricular tachycardia, a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with QT interval prolongation. QT interval prolongation is directly related to the dose of Sotalol AF. Factors such as reduced creatinine clearance, gender (female) and larger doses increase the risk of TdP. The risk of TdP can be reduced by adjustment of the Sotalol AF dose according to creatinine clearance and by monitoring the ECG for excessive increases in the QT interval.

Treatment with Sotalol AF must therefore be started only in patients observed for a minimum of three days on their maintenance dose in a facility that can provide electrocardiographic monitoring and in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Calculation of the creatinine clearance must precede administration of the first dose of Sotalol AF. For detailed instructions regarding dose selection, see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.

Proarrhythmia in Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter Patients

In eight controlled trials of patients with AFIB/AFL and other supraventricular arrhythmias (N = 659) there were four cases of Torsade de Pointes reported (0.6%) during the controlled phase of treatment with Sotalol AF. The incidence of Torsade de Pointes was significantly lower in those patients receiving total daily doses of 320 mg or less (0.3%), as summarized in Table 5 below. Both patients who had Torsade de Pointes in the group receiving > 320 mg/day were receiving 640 mg/day. In the group receiving ≤ 320 mg daily, one case of TdP occurred at a daily dose of 320 mg on day 4 of treatment and one case occurred on a daily dose of 160 mg on day 1 of treatment.

Prolongation of the QT interval is dose related, increasing from baseline an average of 25, 40, and 50 msec in the 80, 120, and 160 mg groups, respectively, in the clinical dose-response study. In this clinical trial Sotalol AF treatment was not initiated if the QT interval was greater than 450 msec and during therapy the dose was reduced or discontinued if the QT interval was ≥ 520 msec.

Experience in patients with ventricular arrhythmias is also pertinent to the risk of Torsade de Pointes in patients with AFIB/AFL (see below).

### Sotalol dosing and outcomes among patients undergoing intravenous loading for atrial arrhythmias – A PEAKS registry substudy [^111LhmNX]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

We present a contemporary analysis of sotalol dosing among patients admitted for elective IV loading for atrial arrhythmias, with several important findings: (1) target oral sotalol dose was evenly split between 80 mg and 120 mg in contrast to other published cohorts; (2) there did not appear to be particular patient characteristics favoring one dose of another; (3) adverse events were rare and electrocardiographic findings were similar between the two dosing groups.

The proportion of 80 mg dosing in our cohort varied substantially from other groups, and in part may be due to the selected nature of our patients being electively treated for only atrial arrhythmias. However, in a similar Intermountain Medical Center cohort of 133 patients, nearly two‐thirds admitted for sotalol loading were receiving 80 mg, with less than 10% receiving higher doses. this may be related to a higher proportion of women in that cohort (40%), or possibly a greater diversity of clinician specialty treating those patients. In our registry, patients were primarily managed by cardiac electrophysiologists, who may be more comfortable using higher doses of sotalol.

Differences in dosing did not necessarily appear to be motivated by safety or minimizing adverse events. While patients in our group receiving lower sotalol dose were older, other markers of risk for bradycardia or QTc prolongation were no different – female sex, renal function, and rates of an implantable cardiac device were all similar. Decision around target oral thus appears driven by other characteristics, possibly clinician preference. However, there may be clinical consequences to these decisions.

Maintenance of sinus rhythm has been previously shown to vary based on sotalol dose. Even at a total daily dose of 320 mg, sotalol did not compare favorably to either amiodarone or propafenone. In another head‐to‐head comparison, sotalol at 80 mg bid was previously found to be as effective as standard beta‐blocker therapy for maintenance of sinus rhythm. Our data would suggest there are opportunities to improve rhythm control outcomes through the use of sotalol at doses consistent with prior studies of efficacy (with appropriate monitoring for toxicity).

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) — amiodarone or sotalol for arrhythmic control or ICD shock reduction: Amiodarone (LOE B-NR) and sotalol (LOE C-LD) may be reasonable in individuals with ACM for control of arrhythmic symptoms or to reduce ICD shocks. Sotalol showed a trend to reduce all-cause ICD shocks at 1 year from 38.5% to 24.3% (HR: 0.61; p = 0.055), and patients treated with sotalol should have a normal or near-normal QT interval at baseline, and normal or near-normal renal function. Compared with beta-blocker therapy alone, amiodarone reduced the number of ICD shocks (HR 0.27; P < .001), but this came at the cost of more adverse effects.

2 Methods

The Prospective Evaluation Analysis and Kinetics of IV Sotalol (PEAKS) Registry was approved by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board, and each participating center obtained approval from their respective IRB, pursuant to local regulations. All patients enrolled prospectively provided written, informed consent. The PEAKS Registry was a multicenter, observational registry of patients undergoing elective loading of sotalol for the treatment of AT/AF, using a new intravenous loading protocol. The details and primary results have been previously described, and demonstrated acceptable feasibility and safety. Overall, 167 patients were followed from 10 sites, and included both retrospective data collection for some patients, as well as prospective enrollment of more than half. Patients admitted only for intravenous sotalol loading, without other active arrhythmias and without standard exclusions for class III antiarrhythmic drugs were included. While the protocol included the package labeling for intravenous sotalol loading, it was not required to be followed. All care was provided at the discretion of the treating physician, and according to local practices and standards. However, patients were generally treated consistent with the package insert in terms of loading logistics: they were observed in‐hospital during infusion of IV sotalol and for two oral doses thereafter and the QTc was monitored with regular 12‐lead ECGs.

Target oral sotalol dose was determined by the treating clinician. According to the package insert, the intravenous loading infusion dose and rate is dictated by the target oral dose and renal function, (Supplemental Data, Table S1) however, this was left to clinician discretion. All baseline demographics, medical history, concomitant medications, laboratory studies, and echocardiographic parameters were collected. Clinically‐recorded ECGs were also collected in the registry, with a subset adjudicated by core lab overread. Clinical outcomes, including adverse events an arrhythmia recurrence, were collected during hospitalization and out to first outpatient follow‐up (timing determined by care team and local practice).

Dosing and Administration in Children

As in adults the following precautionary measures should be considered when initiating sotalol treatment in children: initiation of treatment in the hospital after appropriate clinical assessment; individualized regimen as appropriate; gradual increase of doses if required; careful assessment of therapeutic response and tolerability; and frequent monitoring of the QTcinterval and heart rate.

For children aged about 2 years and greater

For children aged about 2 years and greater, with normal renal function, doses normalized for body surface area are appropriate for both initial and incremental dosing. Since the Class III potency in children (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) is not very different from that in adults, reaching plasma concentrations that occur within the adult dose range is an appropriate guide. From pediatric pharmacokinetic data the following is recommended.

For initiation of treatment, 30 mg/m2three times a day (90 mg/m2total daily dose) is approximately equivalent to the initial 160 mg total daily dose for adults. Subsequent titration to a maximum of 60 mg/m2(approximately equivalent to the 360 mg total daily dose for adults) can then occur. Titration should be guided by clinical response, heart rate and QTc, with increased dosing being preferably carried out in-hospital. At least 36 hours should be allowed between dose increments to attain steady-state plasma concentrations of sotalol in patients with age-adjusted normal renal function.

In a small study (n = 25) of patients with implanted defibrillators treated concurrently with sotalol, the average defibrillatory threshold was 6 joules (range 2 to 15 joules) compared to a mean of 16 joules for a non-randomized comparative group primarily receiving amiodarone.

In a dose-response trial comparing three dose levels of Sotalol AF, 80 mg, 120 mg, and 160 mg with placebo given q12h (or q24h in patients with a reduced renal creatinine clearance) for the prevention of recurrence of symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AFIB)/flutter (AFL), the mean ventricular rate during recurrence of AFIB/AFL was 125, 107, 110 and 99 beats/min in the placebo, 80 mg, 120 mg and 160 mg dose groups, respectively (p < 0.017 for each sotalol dose group versus placebo). In another placebo controlled trial in which Sotalol AF was titrated to a dose between 160 and 320 mg/day in patients with chronic AFIB, the mean ventricular rate during recurrence of AFIB was 107 and 84 beats/min in the placebo and Sotalol AF groups, respectively (p < 0.001).

Twenty-five children in an unblinded, multicenter trial with supraventricular (SVT) and/or ventricular (VT) tachyarrhythmias, aged between 3 days and 12 years (mostly neonates and infants), received an ascending titration regimen with daily doses of 30, 90 and 210 mg/m2with dosing every 8 hours for a total of 9 doses. During steady-state, the respective average increases above baseline of the QTcinterval, in msec (%), were 2(+1%), 14(+4%) and 29(+7%) msec at the 3 dose levels. The respective mean maximum increases above baseline of the QTcinterval, in msec (%), were 23(+6%), 36(+9%) and 55(+14%) msec at the 3 dose levels. The steady-state percent increases in the RR interval were 3, 9 and 12%. The smallest children (BSA < 0.33m2) showed a tendency for larger Class III effects (ΔQTc) and an increased frequency of prolongations of the QTcinterval as compared with the larger children (BSA ≥ .0.33m2). The beta-blocking effects also tended to be greater in the smaller children (BSA < 0.33m2). Both the Class III and beta-blocking effects of sotalol were linearly related with the plasma concentrations.

For children aged about 2 years or younger the above pediatric dosage should be reduced by a factor that depends heavily upon age, as shown in the following graph, age plotted on a logarithmic scale in months.

For a child aged 20 months, the dosing suggested for children with normal renal function aged 2 years or greater should be multiplied by about 0.97; the initial starting dose would be (30 × 0.97) = 29.1 mg/m2, administered three times daily. For a child aged 1 month, the starting dose should be multiplied by 0.68; the initial starting dose would be (30 × 0.68) = 20 mg/m2, administered three times daily. For a child aged about 1 week, the initial starting dose should be multiplied by 0.3; the starting dose would be (30 × 0.3) = 9 mg/m2. Similar calculations should be made for increased doses as titration proceeds. Since the half-life of sotalol decreases with decreasing age (below about 2 years), time to steady-state will also increase. Thus, in neonates the time to steady-state may be as long as a week or longer.

In all children, individualization of dosage is required. As in adults sotalol hydrochloride should be used with particular caution in children if the QTcis greater than 500 msec on therapy and serious consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing therapy when QTc, exceeds 550 msec.

The use of sotalol hydrochloride AF in children with renal impairment has not been investigated. Sotalol elimination is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form. Use of sotalol in any age group with decreased renal function should be at lower doses or at increased intervals between doses. Monitoring of heart rate and QTcis more important and it will take much longer to reach steady-state with any dose and/or frequency of administration.

Patients with a history of symptomatic AFIB/AFL who are currently receiving sotalol hydrochloride for the maintenance of normal sinus should be transferred to sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) because of the significant differences in labeling (i.e., patient package insert, dosing administration, and safety information).

### Sotalol [^117UMY8u]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Maintenance of Sotalol Hydrochloride Tablets (AF) Therapy

Renal function and QT should be reevaluated regularly if medically warranted. If QT is 520 msec or greater (JT 430 msec or greater if QRS is > 100 msec), the dose of sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) therapy should be reduced and patients should be carefully monitored until QT returns to less than 520 msec. If the QT interval is ≥ 520 msec while on the lowest maintenance dose level (80 mg BID in patients with Clcr > 60 mL/min, 80 mg QD or 40 mg BID in patients with Clcr 40–60 mL/min) the drug should be discontinued. If renal function deteriorates, reduce the daily dose in half by administering the drug once daily at the same dose level or twice daily at half the dose as described in Initiation of Sotalol Hydrochloride Tablets (AF) Therapy, Step 3. If the creatinine clearance decreases to < 40 mL/min, treatment with sotalol hydrochloride (AF) should be discontinued.

Special Considerations

The maximum recommended dose in patients with a calculated creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min is 160 mg BID, doses greater than 160 mg BID have been associated with an increased incidence of torsade de pointes and are not recommended.

A patient who misses a dose should NOT double the next dose. The next dose should be taken at the usual time.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113Yr3vD]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — safety considerations and monitoring for ibutilide, procainamide, and sotalol are described as follows: Most reported cases of ibutilide-associated nonsustained VT and torsades de pointes have occurred within 30 minutes after the last dose, with torsades de pointes rarely as late as 2.5 hours after an ibutilide infusion; QTc intervals generally return to baseline within 2 to 3 hours after a dose. The risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes is higher in patients with hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia, with hypokalemia present in 17% to 70% of patients who developed drug-induced torsades de pointes; hypomagnesemia has been reported to be a contributing factor, and maintaining normal potassium and magnesium before ibutilide with magnesium supplementation may mitigate risk. Intravenous procainamide is associated with hypotension in 5% to 12% of patients when used for management of AF and is also associated with widening of the QRS complex and prolongation of the QT interval, potentially provoking monomorphic VT and torsades de pointes. Sotalol is associated with torsades de pointes, with an incidence ranging from 0.4% to 2.3%; initiation or dose escalation is often managed with at least 3 days of inpatient capability for CrCl calculations, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, and cardiac resuscitation, and after discharge on a stable dose, a 12-lead ECG and serum magnesium, potassium, and creatinine are recommended every 3 to 6 months, more frequently if taking other QT interval-prolonging drugs or with changing kidney function.

3 Results

From February 04, 2022, to February 28, 2023, 167 patients from 10 sites were enrolled in the PEAKS Registry. A small minority (n = 4, 2.4%) were loaded with IV sotalol with a targeted oral dose that was not 80 or 120 mg; given the small number, these patients were excluded from the current analysis. The remaining 163patients had a target oral dose of 80 mg bid (n = 85, 52%) or 120 mg bid (n = 78, 48%); their baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Patients with target dose of 80 mg were older (median age 70 years vs. 66, p < 0.001), with higher mean CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc scores (mean of 3.0 vs. 2.6, p < 0.023); however, there were no significant differences in sex (24% female vs. 21%, p = 0.71), baseline renal function (p = 0.2 across estimated Creatinine clearance), or baseline heart rate (p = 0.3).

Table 1
Baseline characteristics among patients admitted electively for intravenous sotalol loading for atrial arrhythmias, stratified by target oral dose.

Sotalol dosing in‐hospital is shown in Table 2. Consistent with the package insert, patients targeting lower oral sotalol dose received lower IV sotalol dosing. Additionally, patients receiving 80 mg were more likely to leave the hospital before receiving the 2nd oral dose (55% vs. 6.4%, p < 0.001). There were no differences in rates of cardioversion before loading or before discharge.

Table 2
In‐hospital dosing of sotalol, according to target oral dose.

Proportion of patients with sinus rhythm on ECG at various time points is shown in Figure 1, with no significant difference at any time point (p = NS for each). Trends in heart rate and QTc during the infusion are shown in Figure 2, demonstrating rise in QTc and reduction in heart rate in both dosing groups. Detailed electrocardiographic findings throughout hospitalization are summarized in Table 3. These include baseline heart rate and QTs, as well as minimum and percent change in heart rate and QTc during hospitalization. There were no statistically significant differences in these parameters between sotalol dosing groups.

### Pediatric dosing of intravenous sotalol based on body surface area in patients with arrhythmia [^115wtV9f]. Pediatric Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Results

The loading doses of intravenous sotalol for each of the five age groups are shown in Table 1. These are the doses that we employed in our previously published study. The loading doses were calculated as 1 mg/kg body weight "rounded up" to the nearest 0.5 mg. The equivalent doses expressed as mg/m 2 BSA are also shown in the table under the column heading of "Loading Dose/BSA". The recommended starting dose in the US is 30 mg/m 2 BSA above 2 years of age. As shown in Table 1, the body weight-based doses approximate the BSA doses in children and adolescents. In newborn babies and infants, the doses were less than 30 mg/m 2 since an age factor is used in the calculation of the BSA-based dose, and the result is a lower dose than 30 mg/m 2.

Specific Populations

Pediatric: The combined analysis of a single-dose study and a multiple-dose study with 59 children, aged between 3 days and 12 years, showed the pharmacokinetics of sotalol to be first order. A daily dose of 30 mg/m2of sotalol was administered in the single dose study and daily doses of 30, 90 and 210 mg/m2were administered every 8 hours in the multi-dose study. After rapid absorption with peak levels occurring on average between 2–3 hours following administration, sotalol was eliminated with a mean half-life of 9.5 hours.

Steady-state was reached after 1–2 days. The average peak to trough concentration ratio was 2. BSA was the most important covariate and more relevant than age for the pharmacokinetics of sotalol. The smallest children (BSA < 0.33m2) exhibited a greater drug exposure (+59%) than the larger children who showed a uniform drug concentration profile. The intersubject variation for oral clearance was 22%.

Geriatric: Age does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of Sotalol Hydrochloride Tablets, but impaired renal function in geriatric patients can increase the terminal elimination half-life, resulting in increased drug accumulation.

Renal Impairment: Sotalol is mainly eliminated via the kidneys through glomerular filtration and to a small degree by tubular secretion. There is a direct relationship between renal function, as measured by serum creatinine or creatinine clearance, and the elimination rate of sotalol. The half-life of sotalol is prolonged (up to 69 hours) in anuric patients. Doses or dosing intervals should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment show no alteration in clearance of sotalol.

Drug-Drug Interactions:

Antacids: Administration of oral sotalol within 2 hours of antacids may result in a reduction in Cmaxand AUC of 26% and 20%, respectively, and consequently in a 25% reduction in the bradycardic effect at rest.

Administration of the antacid two hours after oral sotalol has no effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of sotalol.

No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed with hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin.

Trained personnel abstracted clinical, demographic, laboratory, and treatment characteristics of these participants from the electronic medical record system. This included participants' age, sex, ward of origin (internal medicine ward includes cardiology, respiratory, geriatric, neurology, rehabilitation, and traditional chinese medicine wards), comorbidities (such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and prior stroke), treatment variables (i.e. complete medication list), and laboratory values including serum creatinine and hemoglobin. Traditional Chinese medicine wards refers to hospital departments where patients receive treatment based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) principles, including herbal therapy, acupuncture, and other non-Western medical approaches. Smoking refers specifically to current smoking status at the time of hospital admission. Drinking refers to current alcohol consumption as reported in the medical records at the time of hospital admission. History of bleeding (major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding), as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis criteria, was also ascertained. Multimorbidity was defined as the number of comorbidities reported at baseline, when a patient presented at least 2 conditions. CrCl (creatinine clearance) was estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Polypharmacy was defined according to the number of drugs prescribed at baseline, as the presence of ≥ 7 different drugs taken by a patient. Antiplatelet drugs include aspirin, clopidogrel, and ticagrelor. Rhythm control drugs include propafenone, sotalol, and amiodarone. Rate control drugs include beta-receptor blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, and digoxin.

Determining appropriateness of DOAC dose

Underdosing and overdosing were, respectively, defined as the administration of a lower or higher DOACs dose than recommended in the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) consensus and package inserts. Inappropriate DOACs was defined as either underdosed or overdosed DOACs. For detailed recommended dosages, see Table S1.

### Comparison of the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration, the modification of diet in renal disease study and the Cockcroft-Gault equation in patients with heart failure [^113ecBeQ]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the last decades, several new renal function estimation equations based on creatinine level and demographic variables have been introduced. The most commonly used are the Cockcroft-Gault formula (CG), the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD)and the most recent Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)equation. The ready availability of these renal function estimations, either estimated directly in the laboratory report or easily obtained through free online renal function estimation calculators, demands an in-depth knowledge about the differences between them, and which formula to use for which purpose. The renal function estimation equations have three main uses: for diagnosing and classifying chronic kidney disease, to adjust medication doses and for predicting adverse prognosis. For the first purpose, in diagnosing renal dysfunction, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes recommends the CKD-EPI equation as it gives the most accurate renal function estimate compared with the measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, for guiding dose adjustments and for predicting prognosis, the choice of formula is less clear.

Renal function estimation is important when treating patients with drugs with a major renal elimination. Potentially serious adverse drug reactions could be expected if the therapeutic range is exceeded. Several of the commonly used medications in patients with heart failure require dose adjustment according to renal function, for example, ACE inhibitors, sotalol and the four novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC). Also other drugs, such as antidiabetics (sitagliptin), anticonvulsive (levetiracetam), antibiotics (levofloxacin) and antivirals (sofosbuvir) need a dose adjustment to renal function.

The presence of renal dysfunction in patients with heart failure signifies a worse prognosis, regardless of the underlying kidney disease. A low GFR is present in up to 50% of patients with heart failure. Whether one formula should be preferred over another in predicting outcomes, could depend on the underlying population, but most studies in heart failure populations support the use of the CG equation. 12–14 Also, few of these studies used standardised creatinine.

The aim of this study was to assess how the three most commonly used renal function estimation equations applied to a creatinine measured by a standardised method affects (1) thresholds for dose adjustments in one illustrative clinical scenario of those patients with heart failure who have a concomitant atrial fibrillation and (2) prediction of 1-year mortality.

Atrial fibrillation rhythm control — sotalol dosing and safety constraints: Sotalol (β1-racemic mixture) is dosed 80–160 mg b.i.d. and should not be used in patients with systolic HF, significant LVH, prolonged QT, asthma, hypokalaemia, CrCl < 30 mL/min. It should be discontinued in case of excessive QT prolongation (> 500 ms). In patients with CrCl 30–60 mL/min should be dosed once daily. The potassium channel blocking effect increases with increasing dose and, consequently, the risk of ventricular proarrhythmia (TdP) increases.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sotalol in a pediatric population with supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmia [^115k4ugn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study was designed to define the steady-state relationship between pharmacologic response and dose or concentration of sotalol in children with cardiac arrhythmias, with an emphasis on neonates and infants.

Methods

The treatment consisted of an upward titration with unit doses of 10, 30, and 70 mg of sotalol per square meter of body surface area. The patients received 3 doses at each dose level. The dosing interval was 8 hours. The Class III and beta-blocking activities of sotalol were derived from the QT and R-R intervals, respectively, of the surface electrocardiogram, which was recorded at 6 scheduled times before and after the third, sixth, and ninth doses. During these three dose intervals, 4 scheduled blood samples were also collected. Drug concentrations were measured with a validated nonstereoselective liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric detection assay. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were obtained with standard methods.

Results

Twenty-one centers enrolled 25 patients in the study: 7 were neonates, 9 were infants, and 11 were children between the ages of 2 years and 12 years. The area under the drug concentration-time curve increased proportionately with dose. The apparent oral clearance of sotalol was linearly correlated with body surface area and creatinine clearance. The smallest children (body surface area < 0.33 m2) displayed greater drug exposure than the larger children. The increase of QTc and R-R intervals was dose dependent. At the 70-mg/m(2) dose level, the mean (± standard deviation) maximum increase for the QTc interval was 14% ± 7% and the average Class III effect during a dose interval was 7% ± 5%. At the same dose level, the mean maximum increase of the R-R interval was 25% ± 15% and the average beta-blocking effect during a dose interval was 12% ± 13%. The effects tended to be larger in the smallest children. The Class III response and the plasma concentrations of sotalol were linearly related. The treatment was well tolerated.

Conclusions

The steady-state pharmacokinetics of sotalol were dose proportionate. Pharmacologically important beta-blocking effects were observed at the 30-mg/m2 and 70-mg/m2 dose levels. Important Class III effects were seen at the 70-mg/m2 dose level. The Class III effect was linearly related to the drug concentration.

Discussion

Recommendations

As per EXTRIP methods, the workgroup only voted on BAAs for which the number of patient clinical reports were sufficient. Although there were 4 reports for acebutolol and talinolol, they were not considered to be of sufficient quality to permit elaborations of recommendations.

General statements and indications for ECTR

Propranolol
In patients severely poisoned with propranolol, we recommend against performing ECTR in addition to standard care rather than standard care alone (strong recommendation, very low quality evidence).

Atenolol
In patients severely poisoned with atenolol and kidney impairment*, we suggest performing ECTR in addition to standard care rather than standard care alone when refractory bradycardia and hypotension is present (weak recommendation, very low quality evidence)
In patients severely poisoned with atenolol and normal kidney function, we make no recommendation for or against performing ECTR in addition to standard care rather than standard care alone (no recommendation, very low quality evidence)

Sotalol
In patients severely poisoned with sotalol and kidney impairment*, we suggest performing ECTR in addition to standard care rather than standard care alone when refractory bradycardia and hypotension and/or recurrent torsade de pointes is present (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence)
In patients severely poisoned with sotalol with normal kidney function, we make no recommendation for or against performing ECTR in addition to standard care rather than standard care alone (no recommendation, very low quality evidence).
In patients severely poisoned with sotalol, we suggest against performing ECTR solely based on the QT interval (weak recommendation, very low quality evidence).

" Kidney impairment" was defined as stage 3B, 4, or 5 CKD (i.e. eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73m 2) or AKI as KDIGO stage 2 or 3 AKI. In the absence of a baseline serum creatinine concentration, kidney impairment was defined as an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73m 2 in adults; and in children with no baseline creatinine, the use of KDIGO criteria of AKI stage 2 and 3 after imputing a baseline serum creatinine using the Schwartz 2009 formula assuming 120 mL/min/1.73m 2 of "normal" eGFR. The presence of oligo/anuria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation should be considered as impaired kidney function, regardless of serum creatinine concentration (See supplemental section)

2.1 General Safety Measures of Oral Sotalol Therapy

Withdraw other antiarrhythmic therapy before starting SOTYLIZE and monitor for a minimum of 2 to 3 plasma half-lives prior to initiating SOTYLIZE therapy if the patient's clinical condition permits [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Hospitalize patients being initiated or re-initiated on sotalol for at least 3 days or until steady-state drug levels are achieved in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Initiate oral sotalol therapy in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious arrhythmias. Perform a baseline ECG to determine the QT interval and measure and normalize serum potassium and magnesium levels before initiating therapy. Measure serum creatinine and calculate an estimated creatinine clearance in order to establish the appropriate dosing interval. Monitor QTc 2 to 4 hours after each uptitration in dose.

Discharge patients on sotalol therapy from an in-patient setting with an adequate supply of sotalol to allow uninterrupted therapy until the patient can fill a sotalol prescription.

Advise patients who miss a dose to take the next dose at the usual time. Do not double the dose or shorten the dosing interval.

2.2 Adult Dose for Ventricular Arrhythmia

The recommended initial dose is 80 mg twice daily. This dose may be increased in increments of 80 mg per day every 3 days provided the QTc < 500 msec [see Warning and Precautions (5.1)]. Continually monitor patients until steady state blood levels are achieved. In most patients, a therapeutic response is obtained at a total daily dose of 160 to 320 mg/day, given in two or three divided doses. Oral doses as high as 480 to 640 mg once or twice a day have been utilized in patients with refractory life-threatening arrhythmias.

2.3 Adult Dose for Prevention of Recurrence of AFIB/AFL

The recommended initial dose is 80 mg twice daily. This dose may be increased in increments of 80 mg per day every 3 days provided the QTc ˂500 msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Continually monitor patients until steady state blood levels are achieved. Most patients will have a satisfactory response with 120 mg twice daily. Initiation of sotalol in patients with QTc ˃450 msec is contraindicated [see Contraindication (4)].

### PACES / HRS expert consensus statement on the recognition and management of arrhythmias in adult congenital heart disease: developed in partnership between the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES) and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS). Endorsed by the governing bodies of PACES, HRS, the American college of cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), the Canadian Heart Rhythm Society (CHRS), and the international society for adult congenital heart disease (ISACHD) [^116Ngjrv]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Medium credibility.

PACES/HRS consensus — sotalol in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) is addressed with eligibility thresholds and risk signals: General atrial fibrillation guidance supports sotalol use when the uncorrected baseline QT interval is < 460 ms and creatinine clearance is ≥ 40 mL/min, but a meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials with 3002 patients found all-cause mortality significantly higher with sotalol (odds ratio 2.47, 95% confidence interval (1.21, 5.05), P = 0.011), and this excess was more pronounced when studies randomizing < 100 subjects were excluded; therefore, the committee relegated sotalol to a Class IIb indication as a first-line antiarrhythmic agent for maintaining sinus rhythm in adults with CHD, IART or atrial fibrillation, and preserved ventricular function.

### Sotalol hydrochloride (Betapace) [^113tDNzN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of the d- and l-enantiomers of sotalol are essentially identical.

Absorption

In healthy subjects, the oral bioavailability of sotalol is 90 to 100%. After oral administration, peak plasma concentrations are reached in 2.5 to 4 hours, and steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 2 to 3 days (that is, after 5 to 6 doses when administered twice daily). Over the dosage range 160 to 640 mg/day, sotalol displays dose proportionality with respect to plasma concentrations. When administered with a standard meal, the absorption of sotalol was reduced by approximately 20% compared to administration in fasting state.

Distribution

Sotalol does not bind to plasma proteins. Distribution occurs to a central (plasma) and to a peripheral compartment. Sotalol crosses the blood brain barrier poorly.

Metabolism

Sotalol is not metabolized and is not expected to inhibit or induce any CYP450 enzymes.

Excretion

Excretion of sotalol is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form, and therefore, lower doses are necessary in conditions of renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. The mean elimination half-life of sotalol is 12 hours. Dosing every 12 hours results in trough plasma concentrations which are approximately one-half of those at peak.

### A rational approach for selection of optimal covariate-based dosing strategies [^117X9WkR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

At present, there is no rational approach for choosing a dosing strategy for individualization based on a covariate. An approach to use in establishment of an a priori dosing strategy for individualization is presented. Factors influencing the choice of such a dosing strategy are identified.

Methods

The approach requires definition of the following: target variable, seriousness of deviations from the target (ie, risk function), population model, covariate distributions, and constraints. Minimizing the total risk yields an optimal dosing strategy, estimated as dose sizes for different subpopulations and covariate cutoff values at which doses are increased or decreased. The method was illustrated with the use of simulated and real drug examples for the situation in which clearance is related to creatinine clearance.

Results

The estimated optimal cutoff(s) paralleled the median creatinine clearance in the population. The extent of variability in clearance explained by creatinine clearance was the main factor influencing the optimal ratios between adjacent dose sizes. An optimal dosing strategy was possible to estimate for the real drug.

Conclusions

The method is simple to perform, although one difficulty lies in defining the target variable and risk function. Our results imply that commonly used constraints in dosing strategies based on renal function (ie, dose ratio of 2 and predetermined cutoffs) are nonoptimal in the sense we propose. Because an optimal dosing strategy may not be practical to use, the therapeutic cost that would result with any constraint can be assessed by comparison of the outcome after the desired and the optimal strategy.

### Sotalol dosing and outcomes among patients undergoing intravenous loading for atrial arrhythmias – A PEAKS registry substudy [^112b6mZk]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) continue to play a key role in the safe and effective treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Yet each class of AADs carries a risk of pro‐arrhythmia, in the case of sotalol related to QT‐prolongation that is dose‐dependent. Selection of dose is generally clinician‐dependent with now clear parameters beyond estimated renal function. Despite evidence of superior risk‐benefit profile for 120 mg dosing, other doses of sotalol are routinely used in clinical treatment of atrial arrhythmias (AT/AF). For routine loading of oral sotalol among these patients, the loading dose is the target dose. Recently, an intravenous infusion formulation was approved for sotalol loading, with the IV dose based on, but numerically different from, the target oral dose. This overall approach was recently shown to have acceptable feasibility and safety in the multicenter, observational Prospective Evaluation Analysis and Kinetics of IV Sotalol (PEAKS) Registry.

The present analysis aims to understand the use and outcomes of different sotalol loading doses in the setting of recently‐approved intravenous load labeling. Specifically, we aimed to: (1) describe patients selected for lower versus higher target oral sotalol doses for the chronic treatment of AT/AF; (2) describe electrocardiographic features, as well as safety and effectiveness outcomes by dose, among patients undergoing elective IV sotalol loading for the treatment of AT/AF.

### 2016 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^112k8TCs]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation quality measure QM-13 — inappropriate prescription of dofetilide or sotalol in end-stage kidney disease or on dialysis — defines the measure as the "Percentage of patients, age ≥ 18 y, with AF who also have end-stage kidney disease (CrCl < 15 mL/min) or are on dialysis and who were prescribed dofetilide or sotalol". Numerator is "Patients with a diagnosis of AF who do not have normal kidney function and were prescribed dofetilide or sotalol", with denominator "All patients with AF who also have end-stage kidney disease (CrCl < 15 mL/min) or are on dialysis", denominator exclusions "Patients age < 18 y", denominator exceptions "None", measurement period "Reporting year", sources "Medical record or other database (eg, administrative, clinical, registry)", attribution "Measure reportable at the facility or provider level", and care setting "Outpatient". Rationale notes that "Sotalol and dofetilide are predominantly renally cleared and should be used with caution or avoided in patients with end-stage kidney disease or on dialysis", and that "Manufacturer/FDA recommendations suggest that both drugs are contraindicated because of increased risk for toxicity (including potentially life-threatening proarrhythmic effects) in patients with severely reduced renal function". Clinical recommendations state: "The following antiarrhythmic drugs are recommended in patients with AF to maintain sinus rhythm, depending on underlying heart disease and comorbidities (Class I, Level of Evidence: A): a. Amiodarone b. Dofetilide c. Dronedarone d. Flecainide e. Propafenone f. Sotalol", and "The risks of the antiarrhythmic drug, including proarrhythmia, should be considered before initiating therapy with each drug. (Class I, Level of Evidence: C)".

### Dose adjustment of allopurinol according to creatinine clearance does not provide adequate control of hyperuricemia in patients with gout [^114TvqDj]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Published guidelines state that allopurinol doses should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance. We investigated whether such dosing provides adequate control of hyperuricemia.

Methods

We studied 250 patients with gout attending rheumatology clinics in South Auckland from 2001 to 2004. Allopurinol dose, creatinine clearance, and serum uric acid (SUA) level were recorded. We analyzed the relationship between recommended allopurinol dose and SUA lowering to ≤ 0.36 mmol/l.

Results

For patients taking allopurinol, 70.9% were taking recommended doses, based on published allopurinol dosing guidelines. There were 4 (1.6%) patients with cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol, but none of these patients were taking higher than recommended allopurinol doses. The proportion of patients achieving SUA ≤ 0.36 mmol/l was lower in those taking recommended doses, compared with those taking higher than recommended doses (19% vs 38.1%; p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Adherence to published allopurinol dosing guidelines led to suboptimal control of hyperuricemia in this population of patients with gout. Further work is required to clarify the safety and efficacy of allopurinol dose escalation, particularly in patients with renal impairment.

### Pharmacotherapy for atrial fibrillation in patients with chronic kidney disease: insights from ORBIT-AF [^1148PEhv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

CKD is common in patients with AF, affecting as many as 4 in 10 patients. Despite the frequency of CKD in patients with AF, randomized studies comparing rhythm and rate control strategies have provided little insight into the proportion of patients with CKD that were enrolled as well as the clinical outcomes for each treatment strategy in patients with CKD. 6, 7 The lack of outcomes data combined with the labeled dose modifications/contraindications for several commonly used AADs based on the degree of renal impairment make clinical decisions challenging for these patients.

In this nationwide, observational cohort, patients with CKD were less likely to be managed with a rhythm control strategy when compared with patients without CKD. This difference in management is likely multifactorial and due, at least in part, to the higher proportion of patients with permanent/long‐standing persistent AF among patients with CKD as compared with those without CKD. When a rhythm control strategy was selected for a patient with CKD, significant differences were noted in the rates of individual AAD use. These differences in prescribing patterns can be partially attributed to labeled recommendations for dose adjustment of agents such as flecainide in patients with CKD and contraindications to the use of sotalol in patients with a eCrCl < 40 mL/min and dofetilide when eCrCl < 20 mL/min. Notably, we did observe sotalol use in 15 patients with Stage IV or V CKD, highlighting the opportunity for prescriber education with this agent in CKD patients with AF. In spite of significant differences in the rates of use of individual agents in CKD patients versus those without CKD, no interaction was observed between AAD use and CKD status with respect to individual cardiovascular outcomes. The absence of an interaction suggests that similar outcomes can be expected with appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with CKD. We did observe an association with AAD therapy and lower risk for the composite outcome of cardiovascular hospitalization or death as well as a trend towards increased cardiovascular hospitalization with AAD therapy in patients with CKD. These hypothesis generating observations require further investigation. However, as previously published data have shown, AAD use has been observed more frequently in patients who have a greater burden of AF symptoms. 10 While these data do not establish different treatment effects of AAD therapy in AF patients with CKD, they do provide some initial evidence for decisions on AAD use in this high‐risk population.

2.1 General Safety Measures for Initiation of Oral Sotalol Therapy

Withdraw other antiarrhythmic therapy before starting Sotalol Hydrochloride Tablets and monitor carefully for a minimum of 2 to 3 plasma half-lives if the patient's clinical condition permits [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Hospitalize patients initiated or re-initiated on sotalol for at least 3 days or until steady-state drug levels are achieved, in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Initiate oral sotalol therapy in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious arrhythmias. Perform a baseline ECG to determine the QT interval and measure and normalize serum potassium and magnesium levels before initiating therapy. Measure serum creatinine and calculate an estimated creatinine clearance in order to establish the appropriate dosing interval (insert cross ref to renal dosing). Continually monitor patients with each uptitration in dose, until they reach steady state. Determine QTc2 to 4 hours after every dose.

Discharge patients on sotalol therapy from an in-patient setting with an adequate supply of sotalol to allow uninterrupted therapy until the patient can fill a sotalol prescription.

Advise patients who miss a dose to take the next dose at the usual time. Do not double the dose or shorten the dosing interval.

2.2 Adult Dose for Ventricular Arrhythmias

The recommended initial dose is 80 mg twice daily. This dose may be increased in increments of 80 mg per day every 3 days provided the QTc < 500 msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Continually monitor patients until steady state blood levels are achieved. In most patients, a therapeutic response is obtained at a total daily dose of 160 to 320 mg/day, given in two or three divided doses (because of the long terminal elimination half- life of sotalol, dosing more than a two times a day is usually not necessary). Oral doses as high as 480–640 mg/day have been utilized in patients with refractory life-threatening arrhythmias.

Initiation of Sotalol AF Therapy

Step 1. Electrocardiographic assessment: Prior to administration of the first dose, the QT interval must be determined using an average of 5 beats. If the baseline QT is greater than 450 msec (JT ≥ 330 msec if QRS over 100 msec), Sotalol AF is contraindicated.

Step 2. Calculation of creatinine clearance: Prior to the administration of the first dose, the patient's creatinine clearance should be calculated using the following formula:

When serum creatinine is given in μmol/L, divide the value by 88.4 (1 mg/dL = 88.4 μmol/L).

Step 3. Starting Dose: The starting dose of Sotalol AF is 80 mg twice daily (BID) if the creatinine clearance is > 60 mL/min, and 80 mg once daily (QD) if the creatinine clearance is 40 to 60 mL/min. If the creatinine clearance is < 40 mL/min Sotalol AF is contraindicated.

Step 4. Administer the appropriate daily dose of Sotalol AF and begin continuous ECG monitoring with QT interval measurements 2 to 4 hours after each dose.

Step 5. If the 80 mg dose level is tolerated and the QT interval remains < 500 msec after at least 3 days (after 5 or 6 doses if patient receiving QD dosing), the patient can be discharged. Alternatively, during hospitalization, the dose can be increased to 120 mg bid and the patient followed for 3 days on this dose (followed for 5 or 6 doses if patient receiving QD doses).

The steps described above are summarized in the following diagram:

Place Patient on Telemetry

Check Baseline QT

If QT > 450 msec Sotalol AF is CONTRAINDICATED

If QT ≤ 450 msec, proceed

Calculate Creatine Clearance (Clcr)

If Clcr is < 40 mL/min Sotalol AF is CONTRAINDICATED

If Clcr is 40 to 60 mL/min start Sotalol AF 80 mg QD

If Clcr is > 60 mL/min start Sotalol AF 80 mg BID

Monitor QT 2 to 4 hours after each dose.

If QT ≥ 500 msec discontinue Sotalol AF

If QT < 500 msec after 3 days (after 5th or 6th dose if patient receiving QD dosing)

discharge patient on current treatment. Alternatively, during hospitalization, the dose can be increased to 120 mg BID and the patient followed for 3 days on this dose (followed for 5 or 6 doses if patient receiving QD doses).

### Sotalol [^112i1Rh9]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Dosing and Administration in Adults

Therapy with sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) must be initiated (and, if necessary, titrated) in a setting that provides continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Patients should continue to be monitored in this way for a minimum of 3 days on the maintenance dose. In addition, patients should not be discharged within 12 hours of electrical or pharmacological conversion to normal sinus rhythm.
The QT interval is used to determine patient eligibility for sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) treatment and for monitoring safety during treatment. The baseline QT interval must be ≤ 450 msec in order for a patient to be started on sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) therapy. During initiation and titration, the QT interval should be monitored 2 to 4 hours after each dose. If the QT interval prolongs to 500 msec or greater, the dose must be reduced or the drug discontinued.
The dose of sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) must be individualized according to creatinine clearance. In patients with a creatinine clearance > 60 mL/min sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) is administered twice daily (QD) while in those with a creatinine clearance between 40 and 60 mL/min, the dose is administered once daily (QD) or half the dose is administered twice daily (BID). In patients with a creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) is contraindicated. The recommended initial dose of sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) is 80 mg and is initiated as shown in the dosing algorithm described below. The 80 mg dose can be titrated upward to 100mg or 120 mg during initial hospitalization or after discharge on 80 mg in the event of recurrence, by rehospitalization and repeating the same steps used during the initiation of therapy (see Upward Titration of Dose).
Patients with atrial fibrillation should be anticoagulated according to usual medical practice. Hypokalemia should be corrected before initiation of sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) therapy (see WARNINGS, Ventricular Arrhythmia).
In patients with a creatinine clearance between 40 and 60 mL/min the initial daily dose is 80mg. The initial daily dose of 80 mg can be administered once daily (QD) and can be titrated up to 100 or 120 mg once daily (QD) or can be administered as 40 mg twice daily (BID) and can be titrated up to 60 mg BID.
Patients to be discharged on sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) therapy from an in-patient setting should have an adequate supply of sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) to allow uninterrupted therapy until the patient can fill a sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) prescription.

### Development of a safe and effective pediatric dosing regimen for sotalol based on population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in children with supraventricular tachycardia [^114w3Q5f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to develop age-specific dosage guidelines for sotalol in children with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) based on a population pharmacokinetic covariate analysis, clinical trial simulations, and pharmacodynamics.

Background

A rapid onset of an effective and safe antiarrhythmic sotalol therapy, especially for infants and neonates, is frequently delayed because of age-dependent interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

Methods

Pediatric patients with SVT (mean age 3.51 years [range 0.03 to 17 years]) were analyzed after oral sotalol doses of 1.0 to 9.9 mg/kg/day using population pharmacokinetic analysis and clinical trial simulation (n = 76), pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling for QT interval prolongation (n = 32), and for the concentration-antiarrhythmic-response relationship (n = 15).

Results

Inter-individual differences in oral clearance and volume of distribution could largely be attributed to size and weight differences, with an additional age effect on clearance in children younger than one year. Neonates showed a higher sensitivity toward QTc interval prolongation compared with older patients. In a subgroup of 15 patients, one-half of the patients converted into sinus rhythm at sotalol trough levels of 0.4 mug/ml and more than 95% at 1.0 mug/ml. Dosing recommendations derived for different age groups based on these findings were starting dose and target dose of 2 and 4 mg/kg/day for neonates, 3 and 6 mg/kg/day for infants and children < 6 years, and 2 and 4 mg/kg/day for children > 6 years.

Conclusions

This study provides an example for rational drug dosage in children that copes with interpatient variability and can be easily switched to an individually guided therapy based on effective sotalol trough levels.

Atrial fibrillation with HFrEF — antiarrhythmic selection and dofetilide initiation: In subanalyses of randomized trials, dofetilide and amiodarone were effective for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF who have heart failure, and most antiarrhythmic agents other than amiodarone and dofetilide are contraindicated in HFrEF. Sotalol is stated to be "best avoided" in most patients with HFrEF. For dofetilide initiation or reloading, patients should be admitted for at least 3 days to a facility capable of creatinine clearance calculations, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, and cardiac resuscitation.

### Sotalol [^1158uFUZ]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetics

In healthy subjects, the oral bioavailability of sotalol is 90 to 100%. After oral administration, peak plasma concentrations are reached in 2.5 to 4 hours, and steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 2 to 3 days (i.e., after 5 to 6 doses when administered twice daily). Over the dosage range 160 to 640 mg/day sotalol displays dose proportionality with respect to plasma concentrations. Distribution occurs to a central (plasma) and to a peripheral compartment, with a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours. Dosing every 12 hours results in trough plasma concentrations which are approximately one-half of those at peak.

Sotalol does not bind to plasma proteins and is not metabolized. Sotalol shows very little intersubject variability in plasma levels. The pharmacokinetics of the d and l enantiomers of sotalol are essentially identical. Sotalol crosses the blood brain barrier poorly. Excretion is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form, and therefore lower doses are necessary in conditions of renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Age per se does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of sotalol, but impaired renal function in geriatric patients can increase the terminal elimination half-life, resulting in increased drug accumulation. The absorption of sotalol was reduced by approximately 20% compared to fasting when it was administered with a standard meal. Since sotalol is not subject to first-pass metabolism, patients with hepatic impairment show no alteration in clearance of sotalol.

2.4 Pediatric Dose for Ventricular Arrhythmias

Use the same precautionary measures for children as you would use for adults when initiating and re-initiating sotalol treatment.

For children aged about 2 years and older

For children aged about 2 years and older, with normal renal function, doses normalized for body surface area are appropriate for both initial and incremental dosing. Since the Class III potency in children is not very different from that in adults, reaching plasma concentrations that occur within the adult dose range is an appropriate guide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1, 12.3)].

From pediatric pharmacokinetic data the following is recommended:

For initiation of treatment, 30 mg/m2three times a day (90 mg/m2 total daily dose) is approximately equivalent to the initial 160 mg total daily dose for adults. Subsequent titration to a maximum of 60 mg/m2(approximately equivalent to the 360 mg total daily dose for adults) can then occur. Titration should be guided by clinical response, heart rate and QTc, with increased dosing being preferably carried out in-hospital. At least 36 hours should be allowed between dose increments to attain steady-state plasma concentrations of sotalol in patients with age-adjusted normal renal function.

For children aged about 2 years or younger

For children aged about 2 years or younger, the above pediatric dosage should be reduced by a factor that depends heavily upon age, as shown in the following graph, age plotted on a logarithmic scale in months.

For a child aged 20 months, the dosing suggested for children with normal renal function aged 2 years or greater should be multiplied by about 0.97; the initial starting dose would be (30 X 0.97) = 29.1 mg/m2, administered three times daily. For a child aged 1 month, the starting dose should be multiplied by 0.68; the initial starting dose would be (30 X 0.68) = 20 mg/m2, administered three times daily. For a child aged about 1 week, the initial starting dose should be multiplied by 0.3; the starting dose would be (30 X 0.3) = 9 mg/m2. Use similar calculations for dose titration.

Since the half-life of sotalol decreases with decreasing age (below about 2 years), time to steady-state will also increase. Thus, in neonates the time to steady-state may be as long as a week or longer.

The maintenance dose of intravenous sotalol in each of the five age groups is shown in Table 3. The intravenous sotalol dose was calculated as 4.5 mg/kg/day. The doses were "rounded up" to the nearest 0.5 mg and administered as a continuous infusion. The equivalent doses have been expressed for BSA and are shown under the column heading of "Maintenance Dose/BSA" in mg/m 2. The US recommendation for initial maintenance dose is to administer the starting dose three times a day. Thus, in patients above 2 years of age the recommended daily oral dose is 90 mg/m 2. Body weight-based dosing exceeds the BSA-based dosing in certain age groups (younger children, older children, and adolescents).

Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in renal impairment and dialysis — procainamide and sotalol should be avoided in patients treated with haemodialysis; the dose of flecainide should be at least 50% of the usual recommended dose, and dialysis has little impact on amiodarone clearance with no dosage adjustment necessary. Renal function should be assessed in all patients treated with AAD. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) need to be estimated through the Cockcroft–Gault formula, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, or the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, and AAD dosage adapted to specific AAD pharmacokinetics.
