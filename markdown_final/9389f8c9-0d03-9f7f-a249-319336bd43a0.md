## Question

What is the differential diagnosis for beta-d-glucan?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for a positive beta-D-glucan test. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what beta-D-glucan actually detects and which organisms it does not detect. Then, I should verify the clinical contexts where BDG is most informative versus where it is misleading. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential by pathogen and by noninfectious causes, and finally, I should integrate pretest probability, assay-specific cutoffs, and guideline-based principles to guide interpretation and next steps, including when to combine with other biomarkers or imaging.

> Let me first confirm the test principle and scope. Beta-D-glucan is a fungal cell wall component detected by limulus amebocyte lysate–based assays; it is broadly reactive across many fungi but is notably absent in Mucorales and typically absent or low in Cryptococcus, which helps anchor the differential when positive or negative results are discordant with the clinical picture [^9c96403c] [^f0772f55] [^1415e739].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the clinical contexts where BDG performs best. High-risk hematology and stem cell transplant patients, ICU patients with sepsis and risk factors for invasive candidiasis, and patients with suspected Pneumocystis pneumonia are the principal scenarios where BDG meaningfully shifts post-test probabilities, whereas low-risk or non-ICU populations have more false positives and lower positive predictive value [^9eee9110] [^9c96403c] [^ddae5d59].

> I will now examine the infectious differential when BDG is positive. Invasive candidiasis, including candidemia and deep-seated disease, is a leading consideration, with pooled sensitivity around 75–80% and specificity around 80% in meta-analyses, and even higher negative predictive value in ICU cohorts, which supports using BDG to help rule out disease when pretest probability is not very high [^f68e104f] [^9c96403c] [^eedba556].

> Next, I should review invasive aspergillosis. BDG is sensitive for Aspergillus but not specific; it is best interpreted alongside galactomannan and imaging in high-risk hosts, and serial GM is preferred for treatment monitoring rather than BDG, which has not shown consistent prognostic utility in aspergillosis [^9eee9110] [^86bd37d2] [^9c10ba0b].

> Let me consider Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. BDG has high sensitivity and moderate specificity for PCP, and a negative result substantially lowers the likelihood of PCP in the right clinical context; however, specificity is limited by other fungal diseases and nonfungal confounders, so I should confirm with PCR when feasible and interpret results in light of pretest probability and imaging [^ddae5d59] [^71c81b4e] [^f0772f55].

> But wait, what if the patient has a bacterial infection or is on dialysis. I should double-check for nonfungal causes of elevation. Hemodialysis with cellulose membranes, intravenous immunoglobulin or albumin, beta-lactam antibiotics, and certain surgical materials can cause false-positive BDG, and Nocardia has been reported to elevate BDG, so I need to check exposures and consider alternative diagnoses before labeling a result as fungal disease [^9c96403c] [^d8e49f95] [^7634da90].

> I need to ensure I account for organisms that BDG misses. Mucormycosis will typically have a negative BDG, and Cryptococcus usually does not raise BDG, so a negative BDG does not exclude these entities when clinical suspicion is high, prompting targeted testing with cryptococcal antigen or tissue-based diagnostics and imaging rather than reliance on BDG alone [^9c96403c] [^f0772f55] [^1415e739].

> Let me think about specimen source and thresholds. Serum BDG is most validated, with commonly used cutoffs around 80–100 pg/mL, but performance varies by population; in PCP, a categorical approach using less than 80 pg/mL to rule out and greater than 400 pg/mL to rule in improves clinical utility, and in CSF, BDG can be highly sensitive for certain fungal meningitides, though organism-specific testing should accompany it [^71c81b4e] [^34a77ea4] [^3c56ed76].

> Next, I should review how to integrate BDG with other tests. Combining BDG with procalcitonin can help differentiate candidemia from bacteremia in ICU patients, with concordant BDG high and PCT low favoring candidemia and concordant BDG low and PCT high favoring bacteremia; similarly, in suspected PCP, pairing BDG with PCR and CT improves diagnostic confidence and reduces misclassification [^43f49f9d] [^41ed15c9] [^f0772f55].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline positions to avoid overcalling results. Major guidelines advise against relying on BDG alone to diagnose or start antifungal therapy; instead, use BDG as an adjunct within a diagnostic framework that includes cultures, imaging, and clinical risk, and avoid routine BDG testing outside high-risk populations to minimize false positives and unnecessary treatment [^62fecad0] [^0a0495ca] [^1c71ccba].

> Let me reconsider pediatric and special populations. Children can have slightly higher baseline BDG, and BDG is not recommended to guide pediatric decisions; in lung transplant recipients, BDG has poor specificity and frequent positives, limiting its utility for surveillance; in chronic kidney disease and dialysis, elevated BDG is common and often reflects nonfungal factors, so I should interpret any positive result with extreme caution in these groups [^c8121fa3] [^64b901ca] [^6899ca9e].

> I should confirm practical next steps when BDG is positive. Repeat BDG to assess kinetics, review exposures and medications, obtain targeted cultures and organism-specific antigens such as galactomannan or cryptococcal antigen, and use imaging to look for radiologic patterns consistent with invasive candidiasis, aspergillosis, PCP, or Nocardia; if PCP is suspected, pursue induced sputum or BAL with PCR rather than assuming disease from BDG alone [^f0772f55] [^9c96403c] [^62fecad0].

> In summary, a positive BDG should trigger a tiered differential: prioritize invasive candidiasis, invasive aspergillosis, and Pneumocystis pneumonia in the right host, actively search for nonfungal causes of elevation, and remember that Mucorales and Cryptococcus are not detected by BDG. Interpretation must be anchored to pretest probability, assay performance in the specific population, and integration with other diagnostics to avoid misdiagnosis and overtreatment [^9c96403c] [^62fecad0] [^71c81b4e].

A positive β-D-glucan test is **nonspecific** and indicates invasive fungal infection but does not identify the pathogen [^f68e104f]. The differential includes **Candida spp**. (most common), **Aspergillus spp**. [^9eee9110], **Pneumocystis jirovecii** [^ddae5d59], and other fungi such as Histoplasma, Coccidioides, and Fusarium [^notfound]. False positives can occur with **bacterial sepsis**, **hemodialysis**, **immunoglobulin therapy**, **beta-lactam antibiotics**, and **contaminated specimens** [^9c96403c] [^d8e49f95]. β-D-glucan is not produced by Mucorales or Cryptococcus spp., so a positive result does not implicate these pathogens [^9c96403c] [^f0772f55]. Clinical correlation and additional tests (cultures, imaging, galactomannan, PCR) are essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy [^62fecad0].

## Infectious etiologies

### Fungal infections

- **Candida species**: Most common cause of elevated β-D-glucan; includes candidemia and deep-seated infections (e.g. intra-abdominal, hepatosplenic) [^f68e104f] [^9c96403c].

- **Aspergillus species**: Invasive aspergillosis, particularly in immunocompromised hosts, can elevate β-D-glucan [^9eee9110] [^84ff0e76].

- **Pneumocystis jirovecii**: Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) frequently causes elevated β-D-glucan [^ddae5d59] [^71c81b4e].

- **Other fungi**: Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Fusarium, and Trichosporon can also elevate β-D-glucan [^notfound].

---

### Bacterial infections

Bacterial sepsis can cause **false-positive β-D-glucan results**, likely due to endotoxin cross-reactivity or immune complex interference [^9c96403c] [^6899ca9e].

---

## Non-infectious causes of elevated β-D-glucan

- **Hemodialysis**: Cellulose-containing dialysis membranes can cause false-positive results [^9c96403c] [^6899ca9e].

- **Immunoglobulin therapy**: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and some therapeutic antibodies can cause false positives [^d8e49f95] [^c8121fa3].

- **Beta-lactam antibiotics**: Certain antibiotics (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam) may cause false positives [^9c96403c] [^c8121fa3].

- **Contaminated specimens**: Improper collection or handling can lead to false positives [^9c96403c] [^b6cd21fe].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Specificity**: β-D-glucan is not specific for a particular fungal pathogen, necessitating correlation with clinical and laboratory findings [^f68e104f] [^5a9138da].

- **False negatives**: Occur with low fungal burden, localized infections, or early disease [^notfound].

- **Assay variability**: Different assays and cutoffs can yield varying results; clinical context is crucial [^5e81dd9e] [^71c81b4e].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

- **Clinical correlation**: Integrate patient history, risk factors, and clinical presentation [^62fecad0].

- **Additional testing**: Use cultures, imaging, galactomannan, and PCR to identify the specific pathogen [^62fecad0].

- **Serial testing**: Repeat β-D-glucan levels to assess treatment response and disease progression [^0b5da8f3].

---

A positive β-D-glucan test suggests invasive fungal infection but is **not pathogen-specific**; the differential includes Candida, Aspergillus, Pneumocystis, and other fungi, with false positives from bacterial sepsis, hemodialysis, immunoglobulin therapy, and contaminated specimens. Confirm with additional tests and clinical correlation [^f68e104f].

### Elevated serum β glucan levels in cavitary pulmonary nocardiosis [^7634da90]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Patient’s perspective

At the start of her disease course, my mother lost hope and was heartbroken because of her advanced colorectal cancer. She prepared herself for potential pain from the cancer and her eventual death. Therefore, we were surprised to receive the diagnosis of remediable pneumonia. While it was painful to place her under quarantine for a week to avoid mycobacterial infection, we were subsequently able to spend another 3 months with her until she passed away.

Learning points

The differential diagnoses of radiological cavitary lesions should consider various infections or non-infectious diseases (eg, pulmonary tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, or fungi, vasculitis syndrome and primary and metastatic malignancies).
To recognise the risk of infectious disease development (eg, Candida spp, Fusarium spp, Aspergillus spp and Pneumocystis spp), β - d - glucan levels should be carefully observed.
Nocardia infections may elevate β - d - glucan levels.
Most false-positive reactions of β - d - glucan assays are attributed to the use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, antifungal agents or immunoglobulin/albumin preparations haemodialysis.

### Combined use of serum (1, 3)-β-D-glucan and procalcitonin for the early differential diagnosis between candidaemia and bacteraemia in intensive care units [^9081a6e5]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Differentiating candidaemia from bacteraemia is a tough diagnostic challenge for clinicians worldwide, mainly because of their very similar clinical presentation. Although blood cultures remain the mainstay for a definite aetiological diagnosis, their low sensitivity and slow turn-around time have prompted the development of rapid antigen-based diagnostic methods, such as the (1,3)-β--glucan (BDG) assay, as useful tools for anticipating the diagnosis of candidaemia and especially for excluding it, strengthening the diagnosis of bacteraemia and favouring the safe discontinuation of useless antifungal treatments.

In addition to serum fungal antigens, other less specific markers might help clinicians in the differential diagnosis between candidaemia and bacteraemia. For example, serum procalcitonin (PCT), a well-recognized marker of bacteraemia, has been suggested to be normal or only slightly increased in candidaemia. However, a still unanswered question is how to interpret and balance the results of PCT and BDG when used in combination for the differential diagnosis between the two diseases.

The primary objective of this study was to assess the combined performance of PCT and BDG for the differential diagnosis between candidaemia and bacteraemia in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

### Diagnostic performance of the (1 – > 3)-β-D-glucan assay for invasive fungal disease [^4fca2016]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of invasive fungal disease (IFD) is challenging, and it remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan (BG) assay may be a useful adjunct, but its diagnostic performance is not well characterized.

Methods

We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic indices of the BG assay in patients at risk of IFD who had a compatible clinical syndrome for the diagnosis of IFD a week after initial BG testing and at the end of the hospitalization associated with the first BG value. Patients with IFD were classified according to current European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Mycoses Study Group criteria, independent of BG results.

Results

A total of 1308 BG assays were performed for 871 patients. One hundred twelve proven or probable IFD cases were diagnosed within 1 week after initial testing, and 116 cases were diagnosed by the end of hospitalization. Sensitivity of an initial BG level 80 pg/mL for IFD at 1 week was 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.73), specificity was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.81-0.86), the positive likelihood ratio was 3.93 (95% CI, 2.94-5.26), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.31-0.59). Albumin, intravenous immunoglobulin, and hemodialysis were associated with elevated BG levels in patients without IFD (odds ratio, 4.78; 95% CI, 2.59-8.80). After excluding patients with these factors, specificity and the positive likelihood ratio of an initial BG level 80 pg/mL increased slightly. Empirical systemic antifungal treatment did not reduce overall BG sensitivity. Sensitivity was slightly lower among patients with hematologic malignancy or stem cell transplantation. Consideration of BG results would have increased the diagnostic certainty to probable in 54% of possible IFD cases.

Conclusions

BG level appears to be a fair diagnostic adjunct for IFD in patients with appropriate pretest probability and a suggestive clinical syndrome, especially when checked serially in patients not receiving factors associated with an elevated BG level in the absence of IFD.

### Elevated serum β glucan levels in cavitary pulmonary nocardiosis [^053b7103]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Background

Pulmonary nocardiosis is an unusual and severe opportunistic infection of the lungs caused by Nocardia spp.

It presents in immunocompromised patients with cavitary consolidation, including nodules, infiltration and reticular shadows.Due to its uncharacteristic clinical manifestation and varied radiologic findings, its clinical diagnosis is complicated. As a fungal marker, β - d - glucan represents a non-invasive surveillance and diagnostic tool for invasive fungal infections. Limited reports have described the association between Nocardia infection and β - d - glucan.

### Elevated serum β glucan levels in cavitary pulmonary nocardiosis [^da868a59]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

The β - d - glucan levels decreased after the treatment, without antimycotic agents. We therefore believe that the increased β - d - glucan levels can be attributed to Nocardia. Unfortunately, the patient died from cancerous peritonitis 3 months after treatment initiation.

### Combined use of serum (1, 3)-β-D-glucan and procalcitonin for the early differential diagnosis between candidaemia and bacteraemia in intensive care units [^fa5a5dc5]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

The main drawback of our study is its retrospective nature. Among limitations of the retrospective design is that blood samples for BDG and PCT testing were not collected at standardised points in time. Consequently, some measured values might be different from those present at the time of the index culture, although this bias is reduced by the fact that we mainly included patients who underwent BDG and PCT testing very close to the positive blood draw. Our aim was indeed to include only patients at risk of candidaemia who underwent BDG testing in the presence of signs and symptoms of the disease and pending cultures results, therefore reflecting the diagnostic use of the marker in real life. However, it should also be considered that we could not always retrospectively explore why clinicians suspected the disease. Consequently, we cannot be sure that the high pre-test probability of candidaemia observed in our cohort (44%) reflected only an appropriate use of BDG or was also dependent on a selection bias, and thus unrepresentative of the true prevalence of candidaemia in patients at risk. Furthermore, although it is overall reasonable to approximate the pre-test probability of a certain disease to its local prevalence in selected populations, the former is inherently individual and might increase or decrease because of individual conditions and factors. Sensitivity and specificity of a marker (and thus the LR of a certain disease) might also not always be fixed irrespective of prevalence, a fact that should be considered when extrapolating our results to other prevalences of candidaemia on Fagan’s nomograms. Another limitation is that we did not include mixed infections (candidaemia plus bacteraemia). Although their occurrence was uncommon in our cohort, and thus unlikely to influence the overall diagnostic performance of the combination, this might not be the rule in other hospitals and settings. The low rate of mixed infections we detected might also reflect the short window of time we used for defining an infection as concomitant for diagnostic purposes. Finally, an important aspect should be taken into account when interpreting our results, that is they apply only to critically ill patients at risk of candidaemia, and cannot be extrapolated to critically ill patients without risk factors for fungal infections. However, in our opinion restricting the analysis to patients at risk should be ultimately viewed more as a strength than a limitation.

Discussion

In this retrospective study in a cohort of critically ill patients with candidaemia or bacteraemia, the combined use of BDG and PCT performed better than the two markers used separately for identifying true cases of candidaemia, in the case of concordant results indicating the disease. Conversely, when both markers indicated bacteraemia, their performance was similar to that of BDG used alone, highlighting the high NPV for candidaemia of the BDG test.

Recently, Martínez-Jiménez and colleagues reported on the performance of BDG for the diagnosis of candidaemia in a cohort of 81 patients with either candidaemia or bacteraemia, showing that the performance of the standard BDG cut-off of ≥80 pg/ml for diagnosing candidaemia over bacteraemia (84% sensitivity, 92% specificity, 87% PPV, 90% NPV) was consistent with that reported in the literature for the diagnosis of candidaemia per se [–,–]. Our results are in line with these findings, since the overall performance of the optimal BDG cut-off for the diagnosis of candidaemia in our population (≥113 pg/ml) was very similar to that of the standard cut-off. In contrast, while a recent meta-analysis showed a PCT threshold of 0.5 ng/ml to be optimal for the diagnosis of bacteraemia, the same threshold was inadequate for differentiating bacteraemia from candidaemia in our study, and a higher value (1.93 ng/ml) performed far better for this purpose. This result is not surprising since patients with candidaemia might have slightly increased PCT values. In this regard, the median PCT concentration of 0.73 ng/ml we found in patients with candidaemia is in line with values suggested by other authors for possibly indicating candidaemia. However, it should be noted that in our population the discriminatory performance of PCT was overall inferior to that of BDG (sensitivity 84% and specificity 67% for PCT <2 ng/ml vs. sensitivity 92% and specificity 81% for BDG ≥80 pg/ml). For this reason, in our opinion, PCT should be used cautiously as a single biomarker for diagnosing or ruling out candidaemia when and where BDG is not available.

### Combined use of serum (1, 3)-β-D-glucan and procalcitonin for the early differential diagnosis between candidaemia and bacteraemia in intensive care units [^70f106fb]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Our following step was to assess the performance of BDG and PCT used in combination for differentiating between the two diseases. In this regard, we think three possibly useful observations stemming from our study are: 1) in comparison with a positive BDG value considered alone, the presence of both BDG and PCT indicative of candidaemia might strengthen the clinician’s confidence in having identified a true episode of the disease, by increasing specificity and PPV from 81% and 79% to 98% and 96%, respectively; 2) the presence of both BDG and PCT indicative of bacteraemia does not particularly add to the already good ability of BDG alone in ruling out candidaemia, since sensitivity and NPV increased only from 92% and 93% to 96% and 95%, respectively; and 3) in case of discordant BDG and PCT values, the probabilities of candidaemia and bacteraemia might be not particularly altered by the results of the two tests. Given that, in our opinion, the choice on whether discontinuing antifungals in presence of a negative BDG plus low PCT values should be taken very cautiously, at least pending cultures results. Indeed, from a speculative standpoint, we might hypothesise that low PCT values could help unmask some of the rare false-negative BDG results, thus preventing from unsafely discontinuing antifungals. For example, negative BDG results could be found in some cases of C. parapsilosis candidaemia, as we observed in a previous single-centre experience also including non-ICU patients and a higher number of C. parapsilosis isolates, albeit this data has to be confirmed in further, prospective studies. However, it remains clear that no definite therapeutic conclusions can be drawn from the present preliminary two-centre retrospective experience, and validation is warranted.

Invasive candidiasis (IC)—beta-D-glucan (BDG) testing should not be used alone for decisions in critical illness. In critically ill patients in whom there is clinical concern for IC, we suggest not relying solely on results of serum BDG testing alone for diagnostic decision-making (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America's clinical practice guidelines for healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis [^393c40da]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Confirmatory tests on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)—an elevated CSF lactate or an elevated CSF procalcitonin, or the combination of both, may be useful in the diagnosis of healthcare-associated bacterial ventriculitis and meningitis (weak, moderate). An elevated serum procalcitonin may be useful to differentiate CSF abnormalities due to surgery or intracranial hemorrhage from those due to bacterial infection (weak, low). Nucleic acid amplification tests, such as polymerase chain reaction, on CSF may increase pathogen identification and decrease time to a specific diagnosis (weak, low). Detection of β-D-glucan and galactomannan in CSF may be useful in diagnosing fungal ventriculitis and meningitis (strong, moderate).

### Combined use of serum (1, 3)-β-D-glucan and procalcitonin for the early differential diagnosis between candidaemia and bacteraemia in intensive care units [^ab03cb13]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

This multicentre retrospective study was conducted in three adult ICU wards of two large Italian tertiary care centres; two in Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, a 1200-bed teaching hospital in Genoa, and one in Policlinico Agostino Gemelli, a 1400-bed teaching hospital in Rome. In both hospitals, BDG testing is routinely used for diagnostic purposes in patients with signs and symptoms of infection and considered at risk of candidaemia according to clinical judgement.

From June 2014 to December 2015, all critically ill patients with candidaemia or bacteraemia fulfilling the following criteria were included in the study: 1) 18 years of age or older; 2) BDG testing performed within 48 h before or after the time of the index culture; and 3) serum PCT measured within 24 h before or after the time of the index culture. The different window of time for BDG and PCT was arbitrarily selected in view of the different kinetics in the blood of the two markers with respect to the infectious syndrome. The time of the index culture was defined as the day on which the first blood culture, which later resulted positive for Candida spp. or bacteria, was drawn. Patients with mixed infections (defined as presence of positive cultures for Candida spp. and bacteria less than 48 h apart) were excluded from the study.

Definitions of candidaemia and bacteraemia

Candidaemia and bacteraemia were defined as the presence of at least one blood culture positive for Candida or bacteria, respectively, in presence of signs and symptoms of infection. For coagulase-negative staphylococci and other common skin contaminants, at least two consecutive blood cultures positive for the same pathogen were deemed necessary to define bacteraemia.

Data collected for the analysis

The following demographic and clinical characteristics were retrieved from medical records and laboratory databases at the time of candidaemia or bacteraemia: age, gender, type of patient (surgical vs. medical), previous abdominal surgery (within 30 days), chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, Charlson comorbidity score, presence of a central venous catheter (CVC) from more than 48 h, haemodialysis, receipt of corticosteroids, receipt of albumin, receipt of immunoglobulins, previous antibiotic therapy (within 30 days), previous antifungal therapy (within 30 days), Candida colonization (defined as one or more Candida -positive cultures from non-sterile sites), and length of hospital stay prior to the onset of candidaemia or bacteraemia.

BDG (1,3)-β--glucan, LR+ positive likelihood ratio, LR– negative likelihood ratio, NPV negative predictive value, PCT procalcitonin, PPV positive predictive value, TN true negatives, TP true positives

We then assessed the diagnostic performance of BDG and PCT used in combination for the diagnosis of candidaemia over bacteraemia in our cohort. For practical purposes, we tested the combination of the widely used standard BDG cut-off of ≥80 pg/ml (since its performance was very similar to that of the optimal cut-off of ≥113 pg/ml) and the optimal PCT cut-off of <1.93 ng/ml rounded to the nearest ng/ml unit (i.e. <2 ng/ml). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR+, and LR– of BDG and PCT used in combination for diagnosing candidaemia over bacteraemia are summarized in Table 3. As reported in Table 3, and graphically in Fig. 4, when both markers were indicative of candidaemia (BDG ≥80 pg/ml and PCT <2 ng/ml) they showed a higher PPV for candidaemia (96%) compared to 79% and 66% when BDG and PCT were used separately, respectively. In contrast, when both markers suggested the absence of candidaemia (i.e. when they were both indicative of bacteraemia, BDG <80 pg/ml and PCT ≥2 ng/ml), their NPV for candidaemia was very similar to that of BDG used alone (95% vs. 93%, respectively).

### Laboratory diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis [^f7746aa9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2005). Medium credibility.

Invasive aspergillosis occurs in a wide range of clinical scenarios, is protean in its manifestations, and is still associated with an unacceptably high mortality rate. Early diagnosis is critical to a favourable outcome, but is difficult to achieve with current methods. Deep tissue diagnostic specimens are often difficult to obtain from critically ill patients. Newer antifungal agents exhibit differential mould activity, thus increasing the importance of establishing a specific diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. For these reasons, a range of alternate diagnostic strategies have been investigated. Most investigative efforts have focused on molecular and serological diagnostic techniques. The detection of metabolites produced by Aspergillus spp and a range of aspergillus-specific antibodies represent additional, but relatively underused, diagnostic avenues. The detection of galactomannan has been incorporated into diagnostic criteria for invasive aspergillosis, reflecting an increased understanding of the performance, utility, and limitations of this technique. Measurement of (1,3)-beta-D glucan in blood may be useful as a preliminary screening tool for invasive aspergillosis, despite the fact that this antigen can be detected in a number of other fungi. There have been extensive efforts directed toward the detection of Aspergillus spp DNA, but a lack of technical standardisation and relatively poor understanding of DNA release and kinetics continues to hamper the broad applicability of this technique. This review considers the application, utility, and limitations of the currently available and investigational diagnostic modalities for invasive aspergillosis.

Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for candidaemia of (1,3)-β--glucan (BDG) and procalcitonin (PCT) considered both separately and in combination. Cut-offs for candidaemia used for the comparisons in the graph are ≥80 pg/ml for BDG and <2 ng/ml for PCT. For the combination (BDG + PCT), the reported PPV for candidaemia (also readable as NPV for bacteraemia) was obtained when both markers were concordant in indicating candidaemia (BDG ≥80 pg/ml and PCT <2 ng/ml), while the reported NPV for candidaemia (also readable as PPV for bacteraemia) was obtained when both markers when concordant in indicating bacteraemia (BDG <80 pg/ml and PCT ≥2 ng/ml)

To further characterize the diagnostic performance of BDG and PCT in combination, including the effect of discordant results (i.e. when one marker indicated candidaemia and the other bacteraemia), we used Fagan’s nomograms (Additional file 1 : Figure S1). Specifically, Additional file 1 (Figure S1) shows the pre-test and post-test probabilities of candidaemia according to different BDG and PCT results (considered both separately and in combination), at the prevalence of the disease registered in our study (44%). The pre-test and post-test probability of bacteraemia can be calculated as 1 minus the pre-test or post-test probability of candidaemia, respectively. Post-test probabilities of candidaemia and bacteraemia at prevalences different from that registered in our study can be inferred manually on Fagan’s nomograms by intersecting the likelihood ratio (LR) of candidaemia with a straight line starting from the selected pre-test probability of the disease (some examples are provided in Additional file 2, which also propose a possible therapeutic algorithm to be validated in confirmatory studies).

CVC central venous catheter, IQR interquartile range

The distribution of BDG and PCT values in patients with bacteraemia and candidaemia is shown in Fig. 2. Most patients were tested for BDG (139/166, 84%) and PCT (143/166, 86%) within 12 h before and 24 h after the positive blood draw. Patients with candidaemia had higher BDG values (median >500 vs. <80 pg/ml, p < 0.001) and lower PCT values (median 0.76 vs. 4.32 ng/ml, p < 0.001) than those with bacteraemia. The optimal discriminatory cut-offs of BDG and PCT for diagnosing candidaemia over bacteraemia in our population were BDG ≥113 pg/ml and PCT <1.93 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 3). As shown in Table 2, the performance of the optimal BDG cut-off of ≥113 pg/ml (89% sensitivity, 84% specificity, 81% PPV, 91% NPV) was very similar to that of the standard BDG cut-off of ≥80 pg/ml (92% sensitivity, 81% specificity, 79% PPV, 93% NPV), whereas the optimal PCT cut-off of <1.93 ng/ml (84% sensitivity, 69% specificity, 68% PPV, 84% NPV) performed better in terms of sensitivity and specificity for differentiating between the two diseases than a PCT cut-off of <0.5 ng/ml (41% sensitivity, 86% specificity, 70% PPV, 65% NPV). Although with the limits of subgroup analyses and without detecting a statistically significant difference, it is of note that BDG specificity was apparently lower in patients with Candida colonization than in those without (78% vs. 86%, p = 0.514), whereas its sensitivity was similar in those who received antifungals previously and in those who did not (92%% vs 89%%, p = 1). In the multivariable analysis of factors associated with the diagnosis of candidaemia over bacteraemia, BDG ≥113 pg/ml (odds ratio (OR) 31.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.0–87.7; p < 0.001) and PCT <1.93 ng/ml (OR 9.5, 95% CI 3.3–27.1; p < 0.001) were the only two variables independently associated with the diagnosis.

### Combined use of serum (1, 3)-β-D-glucan and procalcitonin for the early differential diagnosis between candidaemia and bacteraemia in intensive care units [^43f49f9d]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This study aimed to assess the combined performance of serum (1,3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) and procalcitonin (PCT) for the differential diagnosis between candidaemia and bacteraemia in three intensive care units (ICUs) in two large teaching hospitals in Italy.

Methods

From June 2014 to December 2015, all adult patients admitted to the ICU who had a culture-proven candidaemia or bacteraemia, as well as BDG and PCT measured closely to the time of the index culture, were included in the study. The diagnostic performance of BDG and PCT, used either separately or in combination, was assessed by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-). Changes from pre-test probabilities to post-test probabilities of candidaemia and bacteraemia were inferred from Fagan's nomograms.

Results

One hundred and sixty-six patients were included, 73 with candidaemia (44%) and 93 with bacteraemia (56%). When both markers indicated candidaemia (BDG ≥80 pg/ml and PCT <2 ng/ml) they showed higher PPV (96%) compared to 79% and 66% for BDG or PCT alone, respectively. When both markers indicated bacteraemia (BDG <80 pg/ml and PCT ≥2 ng/ml), their NPV for candidaemia was similar to that of BDG used alone (95% vs. 93%). Discordant BDG and PCT results (i.e. one indicating candidaemia and the other bacteraemia) only slightly altered the pre-test probabilities of the two diseases.

Conclusions

The combined use of PCT and BDG could be helpful in the diagnostic workflow for critically ill patients with suspected candidaemia.

### Procalcitonin levels in candidemia versus bacteremia: a systematic review [^41ed15c9]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker used to assess systemic inflammation, infection, and sepsis and to optimize antimicrobial therapies. Its role in the in the differential diagnosis between candidemia and bacteremia is unclear. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current evidence about PCT values for differentiating candidemia from bacteremia.

Methods

PubMed and EMBASE were searched for studies reporting data on the diagnostic performance of serum PCT levels in intensive care unit (ICU) or non-ICU adult patients with candidemia, in comparison to patients with bacteremia.

Results

We included 16 studies for a total of 45.079 patients and 785 cases of candidemia. Most studies claimed to report data relating to the use of PCT values for differentiating between candidemia and bacteremia in septic patients in the intensive care unit. However, the studies identified were all retrospective, except for one secondary analysis of a prospective dataset, and clinically very heterogeneous and involved different assessment methods. Most studies did show lower PCT values in patients with candidemia compared to bacteremia. However, the evidence supporting this observation is of low quality and the difference seems insufficiently discriminative to guide therapeutic decisions. None of the studies retrieved actually studied guidance of antifungal treatment by PCT. PCT may improve diagnostic performance regarding candidemia when combined with other biomarkers of infection (e.g., beta-D-glucan) but more data is needed.

Conclusions

PCT should not be used as a standalone tool for the differential diagnosis between candidemia and bacteremia due to limited supporting evidence.

### Elevated serum β glucan levels in cavitary pulmonary nocardiosis [^b0e5e5b2]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Reported radiographic patterns for Nocardia infection include lobar or multilobar, infiltrative shadows, tumour shadows, cavities and bronchodilatational changes.In our case, radiological abnormalities presented large tumour-like shadows and large cavitary lesions. For the cavitary lesions, we need to differentiate infectious or non-infectious diseases. First, we consider non-infectious diseases. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is an autoimmune disease that causes vasculitis in the small vessels. GPA presents central cavitation in up to 50% of cases and is more common in nodules larger than 2 cm.Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative in the present case. Cavitary pulmonary cancer is most commonly (70%) caused by squamous cell carcinoma.In our case, the pathological examination revealed no malignant findings. Second, we think about infectious diseases. Differential diagnoses from fungal infection and acid-fast bacteria are often the most important point, based on patient’s immunologically deficient status. Nocardiosis is also often complicated by M. avium complex infection or chronic necrotising pulmonary aspergillosis.In the present case, the high level of β - - glucan hampered differentiation from pulmonary aspergillosis. Our patient was infected with Nocardia, M. avium and S. aureus, but not with Aspergillus.

For reporting, provide common reasons for false-positive results (eg, intravenous immunoglobulin), inform regarding which relevant fungal infections are not expected to produce a positive result (eg, mucormycosis and β-D-glucan), and add comment regarding possible colonization and the need to correlate with clinical findings.

Detection of 1,3-β-d-glucan (BDG) in serum has been evaluated for its inclusion as a mycological criterion of invasive fungal infections (IFI) according to EORTC and Mycoses Study Group (MSG) definitions. BDG testing may be useful for the diagnosis of both invasive aspergillosis and invasive candidiasis, when interpreted in conjunction with other clinical/radiological signs and microbiological markers of IFI. However, its performance and utility vary according to patient population (hematologic cancer patients, solid-organ transplant recipients, intensive care unit patients) and pretest likelihood of IFI. The objectives of this article are to provide a systematic review of the performance of BDG testing and to assess recommendations for its use and interpretation in different clinical settings.

### Β-D-glucan testing in patients with fungal endophthalmitis [^f914507f]. Retina (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the literature on beta-D-glucan (BDG) testing in fungal endophthalmitis.

Methods

Review of primary literature using PubMed through April 2017 and presentation of an illustrative case report. A total of 231 articles were identified and 43 were ultimately chosen for review based on relevance and presence of ophthalmologic examination and objective data.

Results

Beta-D-glucan is a major component of fungal cell walls. It is quantified using a calorimetry-based Fungitell assay based on modification of the limulus amebocyte lysate. Serum BDG levels are commonly used clinically in conjunction with other tests for early surveillance and diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. In the ophthalmic literature, elevated levels of BDG have been detected in vitreous fluid of patients undergoing vitrectomy for fungal endophthalmitis, tear fluid of patients with mycotic keratitis, and serum of a patient with bilateral endogenous subretinal abscesses. Elevated serum BDG levels appear to be highly associated with fungal endophthalmitis. Potential uses and considerations with regards to test limitations are discussed.

Conclusion

Beta-D-glucan testing may be used as an adjunct to support a diagnosis, initiate pharmacologic therapy or surgical intervention, and optimize overall clinical management in patients diagnosed with or under clinical suspicion for invasive fungal infections, including endophthalmitis. Additional clinical studies are necessary to fully characterize the utility of BDG testing in patients with fungal endophthalmitis.

### Diagnostic accuracy of β-D-glucan (fungitell) testing among patients with hematologic malignancies or solid organ tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9639a3ef]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the accuracy of Fungitell, a β-d-glucan (BDG) test, for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection (IFI) among cancer patients.

Methods

For this meta-analysis, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for references related to BDG testing. Study quality was evaluated using QUADAS-2. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata 14.

Results

We screened 12,426 references and identified 189 studies for full-text review. Nineteen studies were included in the final meta-analysis. There was moderate heterogeneity between studies. Nine studies had a high risk of bias, which significantly elevated the overall specificity estimate. Restricting to only low-bias studies, the sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 63%, respectively.

Conclusions

The overall sensitivity and specificity of Fungitell as a diagnostic test for IFI is moderate, and there is substantial heterogeneity between studies. Limiting studies to only low-bias risk reduced heterogeneity but also lowered the overall specificity estimate.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^f0772f55]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in people with HIV—Because clinical presentation, blood tests, and chest radiographs are not pathognomonic for PCP, histopathologic or cytopathologic demonstration of organisms in tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, or induced sputum samples is required for a definitive diagnosis of PCP; spontaneously expectorated sputum has low sensitivity for the diagnosis of PCP and should not be submitted to the laboratory to diagnose PCP, with relative diagnostic sensitivities: <50% to >90% for induced sputum, 90% to 99% for bronchoscopy with BAL, 95% to 100% for transbronchial biopsy, and 95% to 100% for open lung biopsy. Thin-section computed tomography (CT) without contrast is a useful adjunctive study, since even in patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms and a normal chest radiograph, a CT scan will be abnormal, demonstrating “ground-glass” attenuation that may be patchy; a normal CT has a high negative predictive value, and alternate diagnoses should be excluded. Spontaneous pneumothorax in a person with HIV should raise the suspicion of PCP. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is highly sensitive and specific for detecting Pneumocystis, and while PCR cannot reliably distinguish colonization from active disease, quantitative PCR (qPCR) is favored over qualitative assays; however, the broad range of organism loads and the lack of commercially available U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved qPCR kits for diagnosis make establishment of cutoffs for colonization versus disease difficult to standardize. The fungal cell wall marker 1,3 β-D-glucan (β-glucan) is often elevated in people with HIV who also have PCP; the sensitivity of the β-glucan assay for diagnosis of PCP appears to be high, thus PCP is less likely with a low level (e.g., <80 pg/mL using the Fungitell assay), although the specificity of β-glucan testing for establishing a PCP diagnosis is low because many other fungal diseases, cellulose membranes used for hemodialysis, and some drugs can elevate β-glucan levels. Because the clinical manifestations of several disease processes are similar, it is important to seek a definitive diagnosis of PCP disease rather than rely on a presumptive diagnosis, especially in patients with moderate-to-severe disease; however, PCP treatment should be initiated before a definitive diagnosis is established.

### Incidence of endogenous fungal endophthalmitis in screening dilated exams in patients with elevated beta-D-glucan levels versus positive fungal blood cultures [^aa53d2a7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Endogenous endophthalmitis is a severe intraocular infectious condition requiring rapid diagnosis and treatment. This study examines the incidence of fungal endophthalmitis in patients with elevated beta-D-glucan (BG) levels and those with positive blood culture and the utility of ophthalmology consultation in these patients.

Methods

Single center retrospective consecutive cohort study was conducted on patients at Beaumont Health from 2016–2021 who either had positive fungal blood cultures or an elevated BG level.

Results

A total of 147 patients were examined by the ophthalmology department where 30 patients had an elevated BG level and 100 patients had a positive fungal blood culture. Incidence of fungal endophthalmitis was 0% in the elevated BG group and 1.5% in the positive fungal culture group, corresponding to a relative risk ratio of 0.0 (p = 0.31).

Conclusion

BG testing may be useful in diagnosing isolated cases outside the standard screening paradigm, however the data within this study support the conclusion that there is no compelling evidence at this time to add or use BG as a surrogate for endophthalmitis screening. Further studies are required to further elucidate the role of BG in the care of critically ill patients.

### Incidence of endogenous fungal endophthalmitis in screening dilated exams in patients with elevated beta-D-glucan levels versus positive fungal blood cultures [^d5a97db0]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, BG levels may still have a role in assisting with the diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis. Chen et al described a short case series where 5 patients with clinically diagnosed fungal endophthalmitis had elevated intraocular BG levels and some of these cases had no systemic culture data.Out of the 5 patients, 2 had either negative or no fungal blood culture data and these patients had improvement on appropriate intravitreal anti-fungal therapy. Ammar et al describes the use of BG testing in conjunction with patients who already have a clinical diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis or positive blood cultures, stating that it may serve as a useful adjunctive test or if there is a high clinical suspicion of fungal endophthalmitis.Kolomeyer et al discussed an interesting case where there was a clinical suspicion for fungal endophthalmitis and the elevated BG level helped guide the clinical management.Despite this, few data exist on using BG as an initial screening tool to involve ophthalmology to rule out fungal endophthalmitis.

It is important to draw knowledge from current recommendations regarding screening ophthalmic exams regarding fungal endophthalmitis. In a study in 2019, Breazzano et al published a paper discussing that screening all patients with positive fungal blood cultures regardless of symptoms does not necessarily improve outcomes for patients.This led to a recent change in the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommendations that only symptomatic patients should be screened if they present with positive fungal blood cultures.Although BG testing is an emerging test and there are no official recommendations regarding the utility of ophthalmology consultation together with elevated BG testing, preliminary results in our study show a statistically non-significant difference in incidence of fungal endophthalmitis between patients with initially elevated BG levels and positive fungal blood cultures. Likely future recommendations regarding BG testing may mimic official AAO recommendations regarding screening of patients with positive fungal blood cultures, however further studies with larger sample sizes will need to be conducted.

Biomarker monitoring in IA—serial monitoring of serum galactomannan (GM) can be used in appropriate patient subpopulations (hematologic malignancy, allogeneic HSCT) who have an elevated GM at baseline to monitor disease progression and therapeutic response, and predict outcome (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence), whereas (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan has not been extensively studied in IA to predict outcome (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). Multiple studies have evaluated serial serum GM and found excellent correlations between GMI and outcomes, including a review of 27 published studies with excellent correlation between GMI and survival, and a prospective study of 70 patients with prolonged neutropenia showing good correlation with clinical outcome at 6 weeks and excellent correlation at 12 weeks, with significantly better survival in patients who became GM negative by 12 weeks; another prospective study found significantly better survival in patients whose GMI normalized compared to those with persistently positive GM, regardless of resolution of neutropenia.

### Experience of using β-D-glucan assays in the intensive care unit [^26bd5d63]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

We read with interest the article by Giacobbe et al. assessing the combined performance of serum (1,3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) and procalcitonin (PCT) for the differential diagnosis of candidaemia and bacteraemia in the intensive care setting.

It is our experience that some intensivists lack familiarity with the role of BDG assays and that it is often not a readily available test. To understand how BDG assays were being used in our department we undertook a retrospective observational study. Ours is a central London teaching hospital with a 13-bed mixed medical/surgical ICU. All BDG assays sent from the ICU to a national reference laboratory over a 3-year period (September 2014 to March 2017) were extracted, and clinical and laboratory parameters collated to assess the impact on patient outcomes.

Thirty assays were identified among 704 patients, with a mean patient age of 58 (range 21–86). Most (11/30) of these patients had been admitted to ICU for respiratory disease. A clinical candida score was calculated for each patient (mean 3, mode 4), suggesting a high pre-test probability for invasive fungal disease (IFD).

The average turnaround time was 5 days (range 3–10 days), with 6/30 positive. Twenty-six patients had been started on antifungal medication empirically whilst awaiting assay results. On return of negative assay results five patients had their antifungals stopped within 24 h of the result; 120 patient-days of antifungal treatment were given whilst awaiting negative assay results.

Serological BDG assays are a potentially useful tool in the diagnosis of IFD and can facilitate antifungal stewardship. However, complicating factors limit their use, particularly where outsourcing to an external laboratory prolongs turnaround times. Antifungal agents are expensive. Based upon NHS list prices for our formulary echinocandin, this study identified £49,920 spent unnecessarily on antifungal agents.

Mortality was high in our cohort (50%), perhaps reflecting the fact that IFD is often only considered in patients who are not improving in ICU. It was noticeable how few assays were sent during the 3-year period, possibly reflecting a lack of awareness of BDG amongst intensivists.

Galactomannan index (GMI) and β-D-glucan—prognostic associations in invasive aspergillosis are as follows: respiratory or all-cause mortality increased from 2.25 with a serum GMI ≥ 0.5 to a HR of 4.9 with a serum GMI ≥ 2.0; the adjusted HR for initial GM for time to mortality was 1.25 per unit increase in GMI, and 0.78 per unit decrease for survival; a GMI reduction of >35% between baseline and week 1 predicted a satisfactory clinical response, whereas every 0.1-unit increase in GMI between baseline and week 2 increased the likelihood of a poor response by 21.6%; in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), a BAL GMI ≥ 2.0 was associated with higher 60-day mortality compared with a BAL GMI < 0.5; and initial β-D-glucan values/early kinetics were not predictive of 6- or 12-week outcome or mortality in IA.

### Serum indicators for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia [^95cbd643]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is difficult because it requires microscopic examination to identify pneumocystis from induced sputum or BAL fluid.

Study Objective

To evaluate the usefulness of four serum markers-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), (1-->3) beta-D-glucan (beta-D-glucan), KL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP)-in the diagnosis of PCP.

Design

Case-control retrospective study.

Patients and Measurements

We reviewed the medical records of 295 consecutive patients who underwent BAL for the diagnosis of PCP. Differential cell counts in BAL fluid and serum levels of LDH, beta-D-glucan, KL-6, and CRP were examined. Oxygenation index was determined using arterial oxygen tension and inspiratory oxygen concentration.

Results

Based on the microscopic examination of BAL fluid, 57 patients were PCP positive and 238 patients were PCP negative. There were no significant differences in cell count or differentials in BAL fluid between the positive and negative cases. Serum levels of LDH, beta-D-glucan, and KL-6 were significantly higher in PCP-positive patients (p < 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic curves suggest that beta-D-glucan was the most reliable indicator. The cut-off level of beta-D-glucan was estimated to be 31.1 pg/mL, with which the positive and negative predictive values were 0.610 and 0.980, respectively. In PCP-positive patients, the oxygenation index was decreased and correlated with LDH. Both LDH and beta-D-glucan levels were correlated with the proportion of neutrophils in BAL fluid.

Conclusions

Serum beta-D-glucan is a reliable marker for the diagnosis of PCP. Since BAL procedure is invasive, measuring beta-D-glucan should be considered as a primary modality for a diagnosis of PCP, especially for patients with severe respiratory failure.

### Incidence of endogenous fungal endophthalmitis in screening dilated exams in patients with elevated beta-D-glucan levels versus positive fungal blood cultures [^f3768a82]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

As part of a general overview of fungal chorioretinitis and fungal endophthalmitis, this is an entity that can be difficult to diagnose, especially within critically ill patients. Rodríguez-Adrián et al describe that funduscopic findings such as cotton wool spots, retinal hemorrhages, or Roth spots can be visualized in critically ill patients as they often have systemic conditions that can explain these findings compared with classically 3 dimensional lesions more indicative of an infectious process.With these patients it becomes critically important to perform serial examinations to ensure stability of findings.Therefore it becomes important to examine the importance of ancillary testing such as blood culture results and BG testing in guiding management and elevating clinical suspicion for endogenous intraocular infections.

Prior studies have commented on the importance of patient selection prior to performing a BG test, otherwise interpretation of the test can be difficult due to the factors that can cause false positive results.For example, the BG test can be falsely elevated for the following reasons: hemodialysis with cellulose membranes,,administration of human blood products,use of β-lactam antibiotics,bacterial infections,and even surgical gauze containing glucan.Due to these confounding variables, having an elevated BG level may not necessarily correlate to an invasive fungal infection that would put a patient at risk for fungal endophthalmitis. Regarding this, it is likely then that our patient in the elevated BG level group had an elevated BG level due to systemic bacteremia.

Since the development of the BG assay, many studies have evaluated the diagnostic utility of this test. Multiple studies have commented on the statistical accuracy of the BG assay in detecting an invasive fungal infection. Pickering et al asserted that their study, among others, showed a very high negative predictive value (NPV) upwards of 95%, while having a lower positive predictive value (PPV) ranging from 51.9% with a specificity of 77.2% when patients had concomitant bacteremia and BG testing.Of note, PPV and NPV range widely depending on the particular study, patient selection, and concurrent disease. A review by Theel et al describes PPV ranging from 30–89% and NPV ranging from 73–97%, hence further emphasizing patient selection prior to ordering a BG test due to the high number of false positives.It is interesting to note that although fungal cultures are considered the gold standard for diagnosing invasive fungal infections, the sensitivity varies significantly based on the media used and is estimated to be 50%.

Biomarker‑driven preemptive therapy—use of serum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fungal biomarkers such as GM or (1 -> 3)-β-D-glucan to guide antifungal therapy in asymptomatic or febrile high‑risk patients can reduce unnecessary antifungal therapy; the preemptive approach can result in more documented cases of IA without compromise in survival and can be used as an alternative to empiric antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; moderate‑quality evidence).

### Asymptomatic pulmonary cryptococcosis presenting with mixed lesions of infiltrative and nodular shadow in an immunocompromised patient [^1415e739]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Finally, we initiated two loading doses of intravenous fosfluconazole 800 mg daily in the present case. The recent guidelines for the treatment of PC in immunocompromised hosts with mild to moderate symptoms recommend oral fluconazole 400 mg daily for 6–12 months.Fluconazole takes approximately 10 days for serum concentration to stabilise due to its long elimination half-time. Two loading doses of intravenous fosfluconazole can shorten the time to achieve stable plasma concentration from 10 to 3 days.Rapid achievement of target steady plasma concentration seemed to be beneficial for the patient because the patient had multiple pulmonary lesions, which could be severe.

The report had one limitation. The serum sample at the first visit indicated a higher level of (1,3)-β-D-glucan than the upper limit of the normal. In cryptococcosis, serum (1,3)-β-D-glucan remains at normal levels, despite mycosis. Other serological tests for other mycoses were negative in this case; therefore, we thought that the elevation of (1,3)-β-D-glucan might be false-positive or meaningless data in actual clinical case.

We report a case of asymptomatic PC presenting with mixed infiltrative and nodular shadows in an immunocompromised patient. When an immunocompromised patient presents with abnormal chest shadows, respiratory infections, including PC, should be among the identified diagnoses, even if imaging findings are atypical.

Learning points

Pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC) can present with a variety of radiographic findings and is sometimes difficult to distinguish from lung cancer, tuberculosis or interstitial lung diseases.
Bronchoscopy is a less invasive, generalised, and useful procedure for obtaining both tissue and culture specimens.
When an immunocompromised patient presents with abnormal chest shadows, respiratory infections, including PC, should be among the differential diagnoses, even if the imaging findings are atypical.

### Incidence of endogenous fungal endophthalmitis in screening dilated exams in patients with elevated beta-D-glucan levels versus positive fungal blood cultures [^d8d5d93d]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations to this study included a relatively small sample size of patients with elevated BG levels. Having more patients to evaluate in this group would help increase the power of our study. In some cases, systemic micafungin may have been started as soon as an elevated BG level is seen and may have been done before an ophthalmologist, however we believe that this does not affect the results of our study as a Muños et al showed that intraocular fungal infections were not found to be more common between patients treated with echinocandins compared with candins or other antifungal regimens.In addition, prior studies have shown that with intravenous therapy, micafungin has poor aqueous humor and vitreous penetration.Lastly, our diagnosis of presumed fungal endophthalmitis was made on clinical features only and all patients had negative vitreous biopsy. However all patients had classic clinical features of endophthalmitis diagnosed by a vitreoretinal specialist, and we believe that due to significant vitreous inflammation, acquiring an adequate enough vitreous sample at the bedside to make a microbiological diagnosis of infectious endophthalmitis was why the cultures were negative.

The beta-D-glucan quantitative assay is a relatively new test that is gaining significant utility in critically ill patients. BG testing may be useful in diagnosing isolated cases outside the standard screening paradigm, however the data within this study support the conclusion that there is no compelling evidence at this time to add or use BG as a surrogate for endophthalmitis screening. Clinical correlation is crucial as there are multiple causes of a falsely elevated BG and these may lead to unnecessary examinations and overuse of invasive procedures which can be a significant cost to the patient. Continued study is needed to further elucidate the role of BG in guiding its use as ancillary testing and in ophthalmic screening exams for critically ill patients.

### Comparison of blood (1-> 3)-β-D-glucan levels in AIDS-related Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and AIDS-related progressive disseminated histoplasmosis [^9921319d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In this retrospective study, (1->3)-β-d-glucan (B-glucan) was an unreliable marker for AIDS-related Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) because a high percentage of participants with progressive disseminated histoplasmosis and respiratory symptoms had a positive B-glucan result. Where histoplasmosis is common, attributing B-glucan positivity to PCP without further testing risks misdiagnosis.

### Β-D-glucan assay for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections: a meta-analysis [^6523fc11]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

We aimed to assess the accuracy of measuring serum or plasma (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) by means of a meta-analysis of relevant studies. We searched in bibliographic databases for relevant cohort or case-control studies. We primarily compared BDG between patients with proven or probable IFIs (excluding Pneumocystis jirovecii infections), according to the criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group or similar criteria, and patients without IFIs (excluding healthy individuals as controls). A total of 2979 patients (594 with proven or probable IFIs), included in 16 studies, were analyzed. The pooled sensitivity of BDG was 76.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67.1%-84.3%), and the specificity was 85.3% (95% CI, 79.6%-89.7%). The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.89. Marked statistical heterogeneity was noted. BDG has good diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing proven or probable IFIs from no IFIs. It can be useful in clinical practice, if implemented in the proper setting and interpreted after consideration of its limitations.

### Serum (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan and galactomannan levels in patients with cystic fibrosis: a retrospective cohort study [^c6c611a3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnostic performance of BDG and GM to distinguish between Aspergillus -positive and Aspergillus -negative patients was, despite the optimized cut-offs, rather low. The sensitivity and specificity were around 50% or 80%, respectively, for both biomarkers. This means that half the patients with respiratory cultures positive for Aspergillus did not have elevated biomarker levels. However, it also means that 80% of patients with elevated biomarker levels were Aspergillus -positive. This constellation of low sensitivity and high specificity could be explained by the existence of two subgroups within the Aspergillus -positive patients. One subgroup consists of patients that are merely colonized with A. fumigatus (exhibiting normal biomarker levels) and the other of patients with true A. fumigatus infection (exhibiting elevated biomarker levels). If this is the case, BDG and GM could potentially differentiate between these two subgroups. If one further assumes that only infected but not colonized patients will develop an Aspergillus -associated impairment of their lung function, it would imply that biomarkers are superior to culture in predicting the FEV1 evolution.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^84ff0e76]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Galactomannan and (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan for diagnosis—Serum and BAL galactomannan (GM) is recommended as an accurate marker for the diagnosis of IA in adult and pediatric patients when used in certain patient subpopulations (hematologic malignancy, HSCT) (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). GM is not recommended for routine blood screening in patients receiving mold-active antifungal therapy or prophylaxis, but can be applied to bronchoscopy specimens from those patients (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence), and GM is not recommended for screening in SOT recipients or patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Serum assays for (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan are recommended for diagnosing IA in high-risk patients (hematologic malignancy, allogeneic HSCT), but are not specific for Aspergillus (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

### Utility of measuring (1, 3)-β-D-glucan in cerebrospinal fluid for diagnosis of fungal central nervous system infection [^cd45b447]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

(1-3)-β-d-Glucan (BDG) from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a promising marker for diagnostic and prognostic aid of central nervous system (CNS) fungal infection, but its relationship to serum values has not been studied. Herein, we detected BDG from CSF at levels 2-fold lower than those in serum in patients without evidence of fungal disease but 25-fold higher than those in in serum in noncryptococcal CNS fungal infections. CSF BDG may be a useful biomarker in the evaluation of fungal CNS disease.

### Serum (1-> 3)-β-D-glucan measurement in coccidioidomycosis [^4d05e0ed]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

The serum (1→3)-β-d-glucan assay has emerged as an important diagnostic test for invasive fungal disease. The utility of this assay in coccidioidomycosis has not been previously studied. Using a cutoff value of ≥80 pg/ml, we found the sensitivity (43.9%), specificity (91.1%), positive predictive value (81.8%), and negative predictive value (64.1%) to be similar to those of the assay in diagnosing other invasive mycoses.

### Utility of (1-3)-β-D-glucan testing for diagnostics and monitoring response to treatment during the multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections [^3c56ed76]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The 2012 outbreak of fungal meningitis associated with contaminated methylprednisolone produced by a compounding pharmacy has resulted in >750 infections. An important question facing patients and clinicians is the duration of antifungal therapy. We evaluated (1-3)-β-d-glucan (BDG) as a marker for monitoring response to treatment.

Methods

We determined sensitivity and specificity of BDG testing using the Fungitell assay, by testing 41 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from confirmed cases of fungal meningitis and 66 negative control CSF specimens. We also assessed whether BDG levels correlate with clinical status by using incident samples from 108 case patients with meningitis and 20 patients with serially collected CSF.

Results

A cutoff value of 138 pg/mL provided 100% sensitivity and 98% specificity for diagnosis of fungal meningitis in this outbreak. Patients with serially collected CSF were divided into 2 groups: those in whom BDG levels declined with treatment and those in whom BDG remained elevated. Whereas most patients with a decline in CSF BDG had clinical improvement, all 3 patients with continually elevated BDG had poor clinical outcomes (stroke, meningitis relapse, or development of new disease).

Conclusions

Our data suggest that measuring BDG in CSF is a highly sensitive test for diagnosis of fungal meningitis in this outbreak. Analysis of BDG levels in serially collected CSF demonstrated that BDG may correlate with clinical response. Routine measurement of BDG in CSF may provide useful adjunctive data for the clinical management of patients with outbreak-associated meningitis.

### An overview of the laboratory diagnosis ofpneumonia [^173e1686]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Antigen, antibody testing, and other host biomarkers

The beta-D-glucan (BDG) assay is a valuable tool to support PCP diagnosis, especially in immunocompromised patients. BDG is a polysaccharide component of the fungal cell wall, including PCP, and its presence in serum can indicate invasive fungal infections, including PCP. The test is particularly useful when invasive procedures like bronchoalveolar lavage are not feasible. The FDA-cleared and CE-marked Fungitell assay (Associates of Cape Cod) is a commercially available assay that measures BDG in serum samples. This assay utilizes a modified Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) derived from the Atlantic horseshoe crab, which specifically reacts with (1→3)-β-D-glucan, resulting in a color change that serves as the readout.

The performance characteristics of BDG testing for PCP diagnosis have been evaluated in several studies. A meta-analysis reported an average sensitivity of 94.8% and a specificity of 86.3%, indicating high accuracy in detecting PCP. Using a BDG cutoff level of ≥200 pg/mL in patients with a positive PCR and compatible clinical syndrome, the test achieved a sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 85%.

Although elevated levels of BDG can indicate fungal infections, including PCP, it is important to note that false-positive results may occur due to nonfungal factors like surgical gauze, hemodialysis with cellulose membranes, intravenous immune globulin, and specific antibiotics. The serum-based assay is particularly useful as an adjunct to clinical judgment, especially when rapid diagnosis is critical or when traditional diagnostic methods that depend on sputum collection, bronchoscopy, or surgical procedures are not possible. A notable advantage of the BDG assays is their quantitative nature, allowing for correlation with organism burden, disease progression, and therapeutic response. The performance of BDG testing has been evaluated for specimens like BAL, with a pooled sensitivity of 100% for PCP but with poor reproducibility as reported in one meta-analysis and for specimens like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), although not specifically examining P. jirovecii. Thus, the clinical utility of BDG in samples other than serum for PCP diagnosis remains an area of investigation.

Methods

Study Design

This study was a retrospective, consecutive cohort study of patients at Beaumont Health, Royal Oak, Michigan. This study was performed with the approval of the Institutional Review Board and with the standards delineated in the Declaration of Helsinki. Using ICD-10 and ICD-9 codes, patients were identified who were admitted to William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, diagnosed with positive fungal blood cultures or elevated BG levels, and had an inpatient ophthalmology consultation over a 63-month period from 2016–2021. Patient charts were then manually reviewed and patients were separated based on whether they had positive blood cultures or an elevated BG level. A BG level of at least 80 pg/mL was considered a positive test based on review of the literature.Patients who received an initial ophthalmology consultation for an elevated BG result were included. The patient was examined within 24 hours of a positive fungal blood culture or elevated BG result. Exclusion criteria were history of previous severe intraocular inflammation or history of ophthalmic surgery within 1 month prior to consultation. At the admitting provider’s discretion, micafungin was started within 24 hours prior to ophthalmic evaluation of the patient and within 24 hours of initial blood culture growth.

Adult diagnosis—(1 → 3) β-D-glucan (BDG) testing for IA in CT recipients detects a fungal cell wall component released during IFD but is not specific for IA, as BDG is detectable with other fungi and Pneumocystis. Meta-analyses including 15 to 31 studies reported sensitivity of 76% to 80% and specificity of 82% to 85%, with similar diagnostic accuracy for IA and IC in subgroup analyses. In post-CT recipients, serial BDG monitoring through day 180 using a 60 pg/ml cutoff (Fungitell) had sensitivity 71% and specificity 59%; results were positive in 4 of 7 IA cases (including 2 tracheobronchial), while 3 probable pulmonary IA cases were not detected, and hemodialysis was associated with falsely elevated BDG.

### Β-D-glucan testing is important for diagnosis of invasive fungal infections [^5512e630]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

Invasive fungal infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who receive immunosuppressive therapy, such as solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Many of the fungi associated with these infections are angioinvasive and are best diagnosed by visualizing the organism in or culturing the organism from deep tissue. However, obtaining such tissue often requires an invasive procedure. Many HSCT recipients are thrombocytopenic, making such procedure too risky because of potential bleeding complications. Additionally, positive blood cultures are rare for patients with angioinvasive fungal infections, making this diagnostic strategy of little value. Undiagnosed fungal infections in these patient populations are a significant cause of mortality. Prophylactic use of antifungal agents, such as the echinocandins, during periods of neutropenia or graft-versus-host disease may prevent some fungal infections but increase the risk for others. Detection of fungal antigens in body fluids, including cryptococcus capsular polysaccharide, histoplasma antigen, galactomannan, and β-d-glucan, is viewed as being clinically useful for at least the presumptive diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. β-d-Glucan is an attractive antigen in that it is found in a broad range of fungal agents, including the commonly encountered agents Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., and Pneumocystis jirovecii. Cross-reactions with certain hemodialysis filters, beta-lactam antimicrobials, and immunoglobulins, which raise concerns about false-positive tests, have also been described. As a result, the use of this testing must be closely monitored. In this point-counterpoint, we have asked Elitza Theel, who directs the Infectious Disease Serology Laboratory at the Mayo Clinic, to address why she believes that this test has value in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. We have asked Christopher Doern, Director of Clinical Microbiology at Children's Medical Center of Dallas, why he questions the clinical value of β-d-glucan testing.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) diagnosis—definitive testing and test performance—requires histopathologic or cytopathologic demonstration of organisms in tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, or induced sputum samples, and spontaneously expectorated sputum has low sensitivity and should not be submitted. Reported relative diagnostic sensitivities are <50% to >90% for induced sputum, 90% to 99% for bronchoscopy with BAL, 95% to 100% for transbronchial biopsy, and 95% to 100% for open lung biopsy. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is highly sensitive and specific but cannot reliably distinguish colonization from active disease; β-D-glucan (β-glucan) sensitivity appears high with PCP less likely at a low level (e.g., <80 pg/mL using the Fungitell assay), although the specificity of β-glucan testing is low. Treatment can be initiated before confirmation because P. jirovecii persist in clinical specimens for days or weeks after effective therapy is initiated.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^66ba5498]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

ICU diagnostics and surrogate markers for invasive candidiasis are summarized as follows: Surrogate markers that have been evaluated in the ICU setting include β-D-glucan, mannan-antimannan antibodies, and PCR testing. β-D-glucan appears to be more sensitive than Candida colonization scores or indices but has low positive predictive value. In a recent prophylaxis trial of high-risk ICU patients, β-D-glucan testing performed twice weekly identified 87% of patients with proven candidiasis. Combined mannan-antimannan testing has variable sensitivity and specificity. Real-time PCR appears to have similar sensitivity to β-D-glucan for the diagnosis of candidemia, but may be more sensitive for the diagnosis of other forms of invasive candidiasis.

### (1 – > 3)-β-D glucan is a diagnostic and negative prognostic marker for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with connective tissue disease [^52a57482]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess risk factors for P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) and compare the outcome of survivors and nonsurvivors in patients with various connective tissue diseases (CTD).

Methods

A retrospective study according to medical records recent 5 years was done to recruit patients with a definite diagnosis of PCP with CTD.

Results

Fifteen PCP patients were recruited, 10 women and 5 men (mean age: 54.4 +/- 4.69 years). Positive cases of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan (beta-glucan) were 13 cases out of 15 (86.7%). There was a significant difference between survivors and nonsurvivors in hypoalbuminemia (p = 0.02), and high levels of beta-glucan (p = 0.04).

Conclusion

These results suggested beta-glucan could be a diagnostic and negative prognostic marker of PCP.

### An overview of the laboratory diagnosis ofpneumonia [^21d597c7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The Wako β-glucan assay (Wako-BDG; Fujifilm Wako Chemicals) is another test that has received CE marking. This assay also employs the LAL system but measures changes in turbidity, making it compatible with hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric specimens—unlike the Fungitell assay. The results from these assays are analyzed against a calibrated amount of analyte to determine the concentration of BDG, typically reported in picograms per milliliter. Specific cutoff values classify the reactions as positive, negative, or indeterminate. Studies indicate that the Wako β-glucan assay offers sensitivity comparable with that of the Fungitell assay while exhibiting higher specificity.

In addition to fungal-derived biomarkers, various host response biomarkers have been explored for diagnosing PCP. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is commonly elevated in patients with PCP and serves as a marker of lung tissue damage. Although LDH is non-specific and can be elevated in several lung conditions, it is often used as a supportive indicator alongside other diagnostic methods. Surfactant proteins, particularly SP-A and SP-D, have also been investigated as non-specific potential biomarkers for fungal respiratory infection. These proteins play a role in lung homeostasis and surfactant production, and their levels may increase during P. jirovecii infection, reflecting alveolar epithelial injury. Additionally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) targeting the P. jirovecii major surface glycoprotein, conducted 3–4 weeks after hospital admission, demonstrated a sensitivity of 63.4%, specificity of 100%, and PPV of 100% for IgG. For IgM, the sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 74.6%, 73.7%, and 89.8%, respectively. However, the clinical utility of serology testing may be limited due to high seroprevalence.

### Application of the 1, 3-β-D-glucan (fungitell) assay in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections [^f227dd01]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

With the high mortality rate associated with invasive fungal infections, methods for timely detection and diagnosis are necessary for appropriate and effective treatment. Testing for 1,3-β-D-glucan, a cell wall component of many medically important fungi, can be a useful adjunct in diagnosing such infections. The Fungitell assay (Associates of Cape Cod, East Falmouth, Massachusetts) is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved laboratory test that quantitatively measures 1,3-β-D-glucan levels and is widely available for clinical use as a relatively noninvasive method to aid in detecting the presence of invasive fungal infections. Numerous studies have evaluated its performance in clinical settings, and results have, overall, been favorable. It is not without its drawbacks, however, and the test must be interpreted and applied with care. Ordering practices are also widely variable among clinicians, and official guidelines have not been readily available. We present the details of this test and aim to propose evidence-based guidance for its use.

1. Introduction This guidance document was developed as a special controls guidance to support the classification of beta-glucan serological assays into class II. Beta-glucan serological assays are devices consisting of antigens or proteases that aid in the presumptive. diagnosis of fungal infection. The devices are intended for the qualitative detection of beta- glucan in the serum of patients with symptoms of, or medical conditions predisposing the patient to, invasive fungal infection. The detection in serum of specified concentrations of beta-glucan, a major cell-wall component of various medically important fungi, can be used as an aid in the. diagnosis of deep-seated mycoses and fungemias. The assays should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic procedures, such as microbiological culture, histological examination of biopsy samples, and radiological examination.

This guidance is issued in conjunction with a Federal Register notice announcing the classification of beta-glucan serological assays. 1 Any firm submitting a premarket notification. serological assays.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^b6cd21fe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Aspergillosis biomarkers—Galactomannan (GM) and (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) performance and caveats are summarized as follows: The detection of GM in BAL fluid has been shown to have a sensitivity that exceeds 70% in most studies and provides additional sensitivity compared with culture even with mold-active antifungal therapy. The Fungitell assay for detection of (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan is cleared by the FDA for the diagnosis of invasive mycoses, including aspergillosis, but BDG is not specific for Aspergillus species; other invasive mycoses can yield positive results. Comparative studies have reported that Fungitell may be slightly more sensitive than GM for invasive aspergillosis (IA) but with poor specificity, and others have found it is not as helpful; in a large cancer center study comparing GM and BDG prospectively over a 3-year period in 82 patients, each for 12 weeks, the (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan assay was more sensitive than GM for IA and other mold infections in patients with hematological malignancy. False-positive BDG results can occur from glucan-contaminated collection materials and certain drugs, including some antibiotics and chemotherapeutics.

Invasive candidiasis (IC) in critically ill adults—serum β-D-glucan (BDG) diagnostic performance and guidance: IC carries a crude mortality rate exceeding 50% in some ICU settings, and BDG detects a cell wall product expressed by most fungal pathogens except the Mucoromycetes and Cryptococcus spp., with multiple causes of false positivity including particular antibiotics, blood transfusions, and intravenous immunoglobulin. A focused review pooled 10 ICU-based studies encompassing 1,510 subjects; eight used the manufacturer’s 80 pg/ml threshold with a separate pooled analysis totaling 1,218 patients. Across all ICU studies, pooled per-patient sensitivity was 81% (95% CI, 74–86%) and specificity 60% (95% CI, 49–71%), with positive likelihood ratio 2.0 (95% CI, 1.5–2.8), negative likelihood ratio 0.32 (95% CI, 0.21–0.49), and diagnostic odds ratio 6.00 (95% CI, 3–13); restricting to the 80 pg/ml threshold yielded sensitivity 81% (95% CI, 73–87%), specificity 61% (95% CI, 46–75%), positive likelihood ratio 2.10 (95% CI, 1.4–3.10), negative likelihood ratio 0.32 (95% CI, 0.19–0.51), and diagnostic odds ratio 7.00 (95% CI, 3.00–16.0). Consistent with this performance, the recommendation states “we suggest against reliance solely on results of serum BDG testing alone” in critically ill patients in whom there is clinical concern for IC.

### Point-counterpoint: should serum β-D-glucan testing Be used for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia? [^91d86ed3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTIONDespite the widespread use of prophylactic antibiotics in high-risk individuals, Pneumocystis jirovecii remains an important cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. During the peak of the AIDS epidemic, many hospitals and outpatient clinics were very proficient at collecting induced sputum specimens for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). With the dramatic reduction in the occurrence PJP in the current era of highly effective antiretroviral therapy, many centers no longer collect induced sputum samples. Thus, the diagnosis of PJP requires bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens or a decision to treat the patient empirically without a definitive diagnosis. Sputum or BAL specimens are tested for P. jirovecii using special stains or molecular assays, which require highly trained staff that may not be available with a rapid turnaround time. Given the invasive nature of collecting BAL specimens and the expertise needed for interpreting PJP test results, there is interest in using serum 1,3-β-d-glucan (BDG) testing for the diagnosis of PJP. In this point-counterpoint, Luis Ostrosky-Zeichner and Gabriela Corsi-Vasquez discuss the pro view of using BDG testing for the diagnosis of PJP, while Paul E. Sax and Edward F. Pilkington III present the con view of using BDG testing for the diagnosis of PJP.

### Efficacy of cerebrospinal fluid beta-D-glucan diagnostic testing for fungal meningitis: a systematic review [^34a77ea4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Several case reports and cohort studies have examined the use of (1,3)-beta-d-glucan measurement with cerebrospinal fluid to diagnose fungal meningitis. This systematic review aims to characterize the evidence regarding cerebrospinal fluid (1,3)-beta-d-glucan measurement to detect fungal meningitis. We searched PubMed for (1,3)-beta-d-glucan and each of several distinct fungi, cerebrospinal fluid, and meningitis. Summary data including diagnostic performance (where applicable) were recorded. A total of 939 records were examined via a PubMed search. One hundred eighteen records remained after duplicates were removed, and 104 records were excluded, as they did not examine cerebrospinal fluid, included animals, or focused on nonfungal infections. Fourteen studies were included in this systematic review. A variety of fungi, including species of Candida , Aspergillus , Exserohilum , Cryptococcus , Histoplasma , and Coccidioides , were studied, although most were case reports. Diagnostic accuracy was examined in 5 studies. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (1,3)-beta-d-glucan measurement showed>95% sensitivity in the corticosteroid injection-related outbreak of Exserohilum rostratum One study in Histoplasma meningitis found 53% (53/87) sensitivity and 87% (133/153) specificity, while another study of Cryptococcus meningitis found 89% (69/78) sensitivity and 85% (33/39) specificity. CSF (1,3)-beta-d-glucan testing may be useful, primarily as a nonspecific marker of fungal meningitis. Although the FDA black box warning states that Cryptococcus spp. do not make (1,3)-beta-d-glucan, the current evidence shows that (1,3)-beta-d-glucan is detectable in cryptococcal meningitis. Organism-specific testing should be used in conjunction with (1,3)-beta-d-glucan measurement.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in classic Hodgkin's lymphoma, complicated by anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy [^b200b399]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Investigations and clinical examinations found the differential diagnoses to be cerebritis, encephalitis or PRES. CNS vasculitis could have been considered, although MRI findings are generally diffuse and irreversible.Metabolic encephalopathies can have similar presentations—but serum glucose, urea and electrolytes were normal. An EEG was not performed. If she had experienced persistent seizures or encephalopathy, then an EEG would have been indicated to exclude mimics or complications.

Cerebritis

In most cases, cerebritis progresses to a cerebral abscess by the time diagnosis is made, due to cerebral tissue necrosis.This is not in keeping with a radiological resolution of findings after 11 days. Autoimmune cerebritis is unlikely without encephalopathy and autoimmune diagnoses (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus).

CNS infection

The patient had been neutropenic (secondary to myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy) and febrile with elevated CRP 133 at the time of the seizures occurring. The following laboratory investigations to locate a source of infection were normal and negative for pathogens; CSF culture and cytology, blood, urine and stool cultures, CSF viral PCR and serum beta-D-glucan. CTPA showed no evidence of respiratory tract infection and there were no skin lesions or rashes.

The CSF sample was obtained 2 days after the onset of seizures, showing normal cell counts and protein. In herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), 10% of CSF cell counts and 50% of CSF protein are normal within a week of illness.CSF PCR has high specificity (99%) and sensitivity (96%) in HSE when sampled at 48 hours and 10 days after symptom onset.The LP was not repeated at 10 days due to neurology and pathology having resolved and results would not change management. Furthermore, the patient and her family were keen to avoid unessential invasive procedures.

It is worth noting that intravenous antibiotics and antivirals were started 2 days prior to the LP and continued until after the symptoms and radiological findings had resolved. We cannot completely rule out CNS infection, but it would be less typical to see quick radiographic and clinical resolution.

### Prognostic value of serial (1, 3)-β-D-glucan measurements in ICU patients with invasive candidiasis [^93252710]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Microbiologic methodology and definitions

We considered the first episode of proven IC in each patient when at least two BDG determinations were available. Proven IC was defined by: i) histological evidence of yeast cells or hyphae or pseudo-hyphae from normally sterile site, ii) positive culture for Candida species of a sample obtained by a sterile procedure from a normally sterile site, along with clinical manifestations and/or radiological abnormalities consistent with an infectious disease process; iii) candidemia, defined as the isolation of Candida species from at least one blood culture from peripheral vein in a patient with consistent clinical manifestations. Both primary and intravenous catheter related bloodstream infections were considered. Catheter related candidemia was defined by a positive catheter tip culture along with isolation of the same Candida specie from at least one peripheral vein blood sample culture or by a positive differential time to positivity namely if the blood drawn through the catheter hub yielded positive results at least 120 min earlier than cultures of blood sample drawn from the peripheral vein. Deep-seated infections with secondary candidemia were classified as i) or ii) only. As in our clinical practice, in presence of clinical suspicion of sepsis, at least two blood culture sets consisting of an aerobic and anaerobic bottle (with a blood volume of 16 ml for each set, 8 ml per bottle) were collected and processed using a Bactec (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) or BacT/Alert (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) system. Yeast organisms were isolated after growth on Candida bromcresol green agar plates (Vacutest Kima S.r.l. Arzergrande, Italy) and identified to the species level by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. All positive samples were reviewed by experienced intensivists and an infectious disease specialist.

### Diagnostic test accuracy of the fungitell serum (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan assay for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^71c81b4e]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) can be challenging because of diagnostic tests that are imperfect and/or invasive. The Fungitell serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) assay is a noninvasive blood test studied for PCP; however, the manufacturer-recommended cut-off of 80 pg/mL is not well validated for this disease.

Objectives

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the diagnostic test accuracy of the Fungitell BDG assay for the diagnosis of PCP.

Methods

.

Data Sources

A search strategy of MEDLINE and Embase from a previous meta-analysis on BDG was updated to 31 January 2024.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Observational studies.

Participants

Patients with risk factors for PCP. TEST: Fungitell BDG assay.

Reference Standard

One or more of lung biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage, induced sputum, or nasopharyngeal swab specimens tested for PCP by histopathology, microscopy using immunofluorescence or staining, or PCR.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Diagnostic test accuracy data of the Fungitell serum BDG assay across all reported cut-offs were pooled by meta-analysis. We then evaluated a categorical approach using <80 pg/mL as a rule-out threshold and ≥400 pg/mL as a rule-in threshold.

Results

A total of 26 articles were included comprising 5111 patients and 1150 PCP cases. At the conventional cut-off of 80 pg/mL, the overall pooled sensitivity and specificity were 83.5% (95% 95% CI, 72.8-90.6) and 75.5% (95% CI, 66.0-83.0), respectively. At a pretest probability of <20% and a BDG <80 pg/mL, the post-test probability would be <5% (negative predictive value > 95%). At 400 pg/mL, sensitivity was reduced to 63.5% (95% CI, 45.8-78.1) with specificity increased to 93.6% (95% CI, 88.6-96.5). At a pretest probability of 47.5%, a BDG >400 pg/mL would have a post-test probability of >90%.

Discussion

A categorical approach using <80 pg/mL to rule-out and >400 pg/mL to rule-in PCP may allow for a more nuanced interpretation based on pretest probability. More accurate estimates of pretest probability and further external validation are required.

### Clinical performance of (1, 3) beta-D glucan for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in cancer patients tested with PCP polymerase chain reaction [^c25899d2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum (1,3)-beta-D glucan (BDG) is increasingly used to guide the management of suspected Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). BDG lacks specificity for PCP, and its clinical performance in high-risk cancer patients has not been fully assessed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for PCP detection is highly sensitive, but cannot differentiate between colonization and infection. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of serum BDG in conjunction with PCP PCR on respiratory samples in patients with cancer and unexplained lung infiltrates.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of adult patients evaluated for PCP at our institution from 2012 to 2015, using serum BDG and PCP PCR. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the serum BDG at different thresholds were evaluated using PCP PCR alone or in conjunction with clinical presentation in PCP PCR-positive patients.

Results

With PCP PCR alone as the reference method, BDG (≥80 pg/mL) had a sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 81.2%, PPV of 34.6%, and NPV of 95.2% for PCP. At ≥200 pg/mL in patients with a positive PCR and a compatible PCP clinical syndrome, BDG had a sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 100%, PPV of 100%, and NPV of 52.0% for PCP.

Conclusions

Patients negative by both BDG and PCR were unlikely to have PCP. In patients with a compatible clinical syndrome for PCP, higher BDG values (>200 pg/mL) were consistently associated with clinically-significant PCP infections among PCP PCR-positive oncology patients.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^33a4e5a6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to patients with febrile neutropenia (persistent/recurrent episodes), IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend to obtain blood cultures and cultures of skin lesions by culture aspiration, biopsy, or surgical excision in these patients, as their infection may be caused by resistant microbes, yeast, or molds. Recognize that the sensitivity of a single-serum fungal antigen test (1, 3-β-D-glucan or galactomannan tests) is low in patients receiving antifungal agents, and benefits from laboratory tests for fungal antigen or DNA detection remain inconsistent.

Nonculture diagnostic testing for blood culture–negative invasive candidiasis—deep-seated disease findings: In a single-center prospective study, β-D-glucan (BDG) versus real-time quantitative PCR had sensitivities/specificities of 56%/73% and 80%/70%, respectively; among contemporaneously collected samples in deep-seated candidiasis, sensitivities for blood cultures, BDG, and PCR were 21%, 67%, and 89%, respectively; combining either a positive blood culture or positive BDG had 79% sensitivity, while a positive blood culture or positive PCR was 98% sensitive; using 2 consecutive positive BDG tests yielded sensitivity/specificity of 65%/78%, whereas blood cultures were only 7% sensitive; BDG became positive a median of 5 and 6 days prior to positive intra-abdominal cultures and initiation of antifungal therapy, respectively; Candida scores and colonization indices had comparable sensitivities to BDG but poorer specificities (≤43%).

### Accuracy of β-D-glucan for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia: a meta-analysis [^87429391]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) can affect various types of immunocompromised patients. We sought to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) for the diagnosis of PCP. We carried out a meta-analysis of relevant studies, identified through PubMed and Scopus. Eligible studies were those that reported BDG diagnostic data in cases with documented PCP and controls with other conditions. Cases of invasive fungal infections and healthy controls were excluded. We performed a bivariate meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity and constructed a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (HSROC) curve. Fourteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. BDG data were analysed for 357 PCP cases and 1723 controls. The average (95% confidence interval) sensitivity and specificity of BDG were 94.8% (90.8-97.1%) and 86.3% (81.7-89.9%), respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.9 (5.1-9.3) and 0.06 (0.03-0.11), respectively. The area under the HSROC curve was 0.965 (0.945-0.978). Serum BDG shows excellent sensitivity and very good specificity in the diagnosis of PCP. Still, in clinical practice the test results should be interpreted in the context of the underlying clinical characteristics of the individual patient.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^245e104c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Fungal infections are of increasing incidence and importance in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Timely diagnosis relies on appropriate use of laboratory testing in susceptible patients. Methods: The relevant literature related to diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, invasive candidiasis, and the common endemic mycoses was systematically reviewed. Meta-analysis was performed when appropriate. Recommendations were developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results: This guideline includes specific recommendations on the use of galactomannan testing in serum and BAL and for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, the role of PCR in the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, the role of β-d-glucan assays in the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis, and the application of serology and antigen testing in the diagnosis of the endemic mycoses. Conclusions: Rapid, accurate diagnosis of fungal infections relies on appropriate application of laboratory testing, including antigen testing, serological testing, and PCR-based assays.

### Prognostic value of serial (1, 3)-β-D-glucan measurements in ICU patients with invasive candidiasis [^0b5da8f3]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Invasive candidiasis (IC) remains the most common serious fungal infection in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and it is still associated with high mortality rates. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate therapy are of upmost importance in this setting; however, in almost half cases blood/tissue cultures could result negative and the identification of pathogens as well as their antifungal susceptibility definition could take some days. As a result, reproducible nonculture-based biomarkers of infection have been widely investigated and approved in clinical practice : among them, (1,3)-β--glucan (BDG), a fungal cell wall component of Candida spp and other pathogenic fungi can be dosed on patients’ blood sample with reproducible and validated techniques. Its high negative predictive value makes BDG a suitable surrogate marker to support the early diagnosis of several invasive fungal infections, to shorten the time to proper treatment as well as the duration of empirical antifungals therapies, particularly in the ICU setting. Recently, raising interest has been moved towards the prognostic role of BDG and higher baseline values have been associated with worse clinical outcomes. Even though some data in selected population suggested that a decreasing BDG serum level could be related with response to therapies, the prognostic role of repeated measurements over time has not been defined yet. We sought to evaluate whether a decreasing trend of serum BDG was associated with lower mortality and to investigate the goodness of BDG downslope cutoff values in predicting clinical outcome, in critically ill patients affected by proven invasive candidiasis.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^2bc8c8ad]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Biomarker-driven (preemptive) antifungal strategies in leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplant populations are described as an alternative to fever-driven empiric therapy, using surrogate markers such as “abnormal CT findings or a positive result for GM antigen, (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan, or Aspergillus PCR,” and have “been evaluated in 2 ways: serial screening of asymptomatic high-risk patients” and “guiding targeted antifungal therapy for a subset of persistently febrile patients.” Randomized trials compared serum GM and “Aspergillus PCR, or both” to empiric therapy, and “in general, these studies suggest that biomarker-driven strategies are associated with less unnecessary antifungal use without a compromise on overall survival”; while “more IFIs were generally seen,” this occurred “without an increase in fungal-related mortality.” For screening with PCR, concerns include “the lack of commercial assays and technical challenges,” and “the committee does not recommend routine use of PCR assays outside the context of clinical trials or clinical research at this time.” Overall, “biomarker-driven screening strategies are currently an alternative to fever-driven monitoring and can be an efficacious alternative to empiric antifungal therapy for selected patients,” pediatric evidence is limited, and in persistently febrile neutropenic patients on anti-Aspergillus prophylaxis “the causes of persistent fever are less likely to be of a fungal origin” and “routine initiation of empiric antifungal therapy in this context merits reevaluation”; for breakthrough disease on mold-active azoles, “Management … is not defined by clinical trial data” and “The approach to such patients should be individualized,” including drug dosing and monitoring with possible “a switch to intravenous therapy, and/or a switch to another drug class.”

### Beta-D-glucan for diagnosingPneumonia: a direct comparison between the wako β-glucan assay and the fungitell assay [^5e81dd9e]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Measuring serum beta-d-glucan (BDG) is a useful tool for supporting a quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based diagnosis of suspected Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Since the 2000s, the Fungitell assay was the only BDG assay which was FDA cleared and Conformité Européenne (CE) marked. However, the Wako β-glucan test was also recently CE marked and commercialized. We analyzed archived sera from 116 PCP cases (who were considered to have PCP based on compatible clinical and radiological findings plus a BAL fluid qPCR threshold cycle value of ≤28) and 114 controls (those with a BAL fluid qPCR threshold cycle value of >45 and no invasive fungal infection) using the Fungitell and Wako assays in parallel and assessed their diagnostic performance using the manufacturer's proposed cutoffs of 80pg/ml and 11pg/ml, respectively. We found the Wako assay to be more specific (0.98 versus 0.87, P <0.001) and the Fungitell assay to be more sensitive (0.78 versus 0.85, P =0.039) at the proposed cutoffs. Overall performance, as determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was similar for both assays. We determined a new Wako assay cutoff (3.616pg/ml) to match the sensitivity of the Fungitell assay (0.88 at a cutoff of ≥60pg/ml). Using this newly proposed cutoff, the specificity of the Wako assay was significantly better than that of the Fungitell assay (0.89 versus 0.82, P =0.011). In conclusion, the Wako assay performed excellently compared to the Fungitell assay for the diagnosis of presumed PCP based on qPCR. In addition, contrary to the Fungitell assay, the Wako assay allows for single-sample testing with lower inter- and intrarun variability. Finally, we propose an optimized cutoff for the Wako assay to reliably exclude PCP.

### Elevated serum β-D-glucan level and depressed neutrophil phagocytosis in a heatstroke patient [^684f07bb]. Resuscitation (2005). Low credibility.

Endotoxemia has been reported as a mechanism for the fatal sequela after heatstroke. Subsequent disseminated fungal infection in a heatstroke patient has been also described. Beta-D-glucan, a constituent of the fungal cell wall, is an early diagnostic measure for fungal infection. In a heatstroke case, we examined for the first time levels of serum beta-d-glucan and endotoxin. A 34-year-old man with a body temperature of 43.5 degrees C was admitted in a state of shock. Prior to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), a remarkable elevation of serum beta-D-glucan level to 116 pg/mL (normal level<6.0 pg/mL) was revealed on the first day of admission. However, serum endotoxin was not detected when using a method that excluded beta-D-glucan contamination from endotoxin measurement (normal level<1.0 pg/mL). This change of beta-D-glucan level was accompanied by a depressed neutrophil function, especially in phagocytosis of 34% (normal range 70-90%) but not in bacterocidal function (81% versus a normal range of 70-100%). After intensive care including continuous hemodiafiltration, the patient regained consciousness but remained ataxic due to cerebellar infarction, which might have resulted from DIC, and subsequent bilateral fungal oculitis were revealed 45 days after admission. This case report demonstrates the elevation of serum beta-D-glucan but normal endotoxin levels after heatstroke, which may prompt further study to re-examine the serum levels of endotoxin in such catastrophic insults.

### Diagnostic accuracy of serum (1-3)-β-D-glucan for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ddae5d59]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) can be a life-threatening opportunistic infection in immunocompromised hosts. The diagnosis can be challenging, often requiring semi-invasive respiratory sampling. The serum 1,3-β-D-glucan (BDG) assay has been proposed as a minimally invasive test for the presumptive diagnosis of PJP.

Method

We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis using articles in the English language published between January 1960 and September 2019. We estimated the pooled sensitivity and specificity of BDG testing using a bivariate random effects approach and compared test performance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and non-HIV subgroups with meta-regression. Data from the pooled sensitivity and specificity were transformed to generate pre- and post-test probability curves.

Results

Twenty-three studies were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of serum BDG testing for PJP were 91% (95%CI 87-94%) and 79% (95%CI 72-84%) respectively. The sensitivity in patients with HIV was better than in patients without (94%, 95%CI 91-96%) versus 86% (95%CI 78-91%) (p 0.02), with comparable specificity (83%, 95%CI 69-92% versus 83%, 95%CI 72-90%) (p 0.10). A negative BDG was only associated with a low post-test probability of PJP (≤5%) when the pre-test probability was low to intermediate (≤20% in non-HIV and ≤50% in HIV).

Conclusions

Among patients with a higher likelihood of PJP, the pooled sensitivity of BDG is insufficient to exclude infection. Similarly, for most cases, the pooled specificity is inadequate to diagnose PJP. Understanding the performance of BDG in the population being investigated is therefore essential to optimal clinical decision-making.

### Reappraisal of the serum (1 – > 3)-β-D-glucan assay for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections – a study based on autopsy cases from 6 years [^22c20771]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of invasive fungal infection is increasing. An effective diagnostic test is required to identify and treat them successfully.

Methods

All autopsy records at our hospital for the period from January 2000 through December 2005 [corrected] were reviewed for cases of invasive fungal infection. The diagnostic efficacy of a serum (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan (beta-glucan) assay was examined using only those cases in which patients had been tested for fungal infection within 2 weeks before death.

Results

Of 456 autopsies, 54 (11.8%) involved cases of invasive fungal infection. Leukemias were the most frequent underlying disease (in 52% of cases of invasive fungal infection), and Aspergillus species was the most frequent pathogen detected (in 70%). Of the 54 patients with invasive fungal infection, 41 had beta-glucan testing performed within 2 weeks before death, as did 63 patients without invasive fungal infection; 48 of 54 patients with invasive fungal infection had a blood culture performed. The sensitivity and specificity of the beta-glucan test for the detection of invasive fungal infection were 95.1% and 85.7%, respectively, with a cutoff value of 30 pg/mL; 85.4% and 95.2%, respectively, with a cutoff value of 60 pg/mL; and 78.0% and 98.4%, respectively, with a cutoff value of 80 pg/mL. The sensitivity of blood culture testing was 8.3%. With a prevalence of 11.8%, the positive and negative predictive values for the beta-glucan test were 47.1% and 99.2%, respectively, with a cutoff of 30 pg/mL; 70.4% and 98.0%, respectively, with a cutoff of 60 pg/mL; and 86.7% and 97.1%, respectively, with a cutoff of 80 pg/mL. During the 6-year period studied, of 21 patients with fungus-positive blood cultures that were preceded or followed by a beta-glucan test within 2 weeks, 4 had negative beta-glucan test results (beta-glucan level, <30 pg/mL), and 17 had positive results (beta-glucan level, >60 pg/mL); the concordance between culture results and beta-glucan test results was 81.0%. Contrary to the general belief, 5 of 6 cases of cryptococcemia were associated with high serum beta-glucan levels.

Conclusion

The beta-glucan test is an effective diagnostic tool for invasive fungal infection.

### Cerebrospinal fluid (1, 3)-beta-D-glucan testing is useful in diagnosis of coccidioidal meningitis [^621610fe]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnosing coccidioidal meningitis (CM) can be problematic owing to its infrequency and/or a delay in the positivity of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture or CSF antibody, particularly if the primary coccidioidal infection is unrecognized. We tested 37 CSF specimens, 26 from patients with confirmed CM and 11 from patients with suspected microbial meningitis without fungal diagnosis, for (1,3)-beta-glucan (BG). BG in CM CSF specimens ranged from 18 to 3,300 pg/ml and in controls ranged from <3.9 to 103 pg/ml. Diagnostic performance was determined using a 31-pg/ml cutoff (the bottom of the serum range according to the directions for the commercial kit, although further serial dilutions of the standard indicated linearity to 3.9). Sensitivity was 96%, specificity was 82%, positive and negative predictive values were 93% and 90%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.937. Fifteen of 15 samples of >103 pg/ml were CM. The one false-negative specimen was from a patient with a pseudosyrinx, without inflammatory evidence of meningitis activity. Serial samples from some patients were positive at ≤8 years, indicating no loss of positivity with chronicity. Samples stored frozen since 2000 included those with 2 of the 3 highest values, indicating that fresh samples not required. A previous study indicated serum sensitivities of 53% in acute, 50% in resolved, and 83% in disseminated and meningeal coccidioidomycosis. Three studies of other fungal meningitides ranged from 86 to 1,524 pg/ml CSF, with 37 controls of <4 to 115 pg/ml CSF. CSF BG analysis had good diagnostic performance in CM. CSF BG testing can be useful in CM, and a commercial kit is available. It will be of interest to correlate this with course, treatment, outcome, inflammation, and antigen. The only mycoses with common central nervous system (CNS) involvement are cryptococcal and coccidioidal, so CSF BG screening can be useful in meningitis diagnosis.

### Beta-glucans in advanced CKD: role in endotoxaemia and inflammation [^6899ca9e]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/aims

(1–3)-β-D glucans (BG) are cellular components of yeasts and fungi. Elevated blood levels may be an adjunct in diagnosing invasive fungal infection, though can be high in dialysis patients without fungaemia. BG can also induce false positive signals in endotoxin detection assays (Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate [LAL] assay). We explored the relationship between BG levels, renal impairment, endotoxaemia and inflammation.

Methods

We measured serum BG levels, markers of inflammation and blood endotoxin levels in 20 controls, 20 with stages 1–3 chronic kidney disease (CKD), 20 with stages 4–5 CKD, 15 on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 60 on haemodialysis (HD). Another 30 patients were studied before and after HD initiation.

Results

BG levels increased with advancing CKD, being highest in HD patients, 22% of whom had elevated levels (> 80 pg/ml). Levels increased significantly following HD initiation. Levels also correlated positively with CRP, TNFα, IL-6 levels, independently of CKD stage. Blood endotoxin was detectable by LAL assays in 10–53% of the CKD cohort, being most prevalent in the HD group, and correlating positively with BG levels. Adding BG blocking agent to the assay reduced endotoxin detection confining it to only 5% of HD patients. Levels of inflammatory markers were higher in those with detectable endotoxin - whether false- or true positives.

Conclusion

BG levels increased with decreasing renal function, being highest in dialysis patients. High BG levels were associated with false positive blood endotoxin signals, and with markers of inflammation, independently of CKD stage. The cause for high BG levels is unknown but could reflect increased gut permeability and altered mononuclear phagocytic system function.

### High false-positive rate of (1, 3)-β-D-glucan in onco-hematological patients receiving immunoglobulins and therapeutic antibodies [^d8e49f95]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Immunoglobulins and/or therapeutic antibody preparations are associated with a high rate of false-positive (1,3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) tests in onco-hematological patients routinely screened for fungal infections. The benefit of BDG monitoring shall be balanced against the risk of false-positive tests leading to unnecessary investigations and costs in this population.

### (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan in cerebrospinal fluid as a biomarker for Candida and aspergillus infections of the central nervous system in pediatric patients [^88ce8e6f]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infections of the central nervous system (FICNS) are important causes of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised pediatric patients. Standard diagnostic modalities lack the sensitivity for detecting and therapeutically monitoring these life-threatening diseases. Current molecular methods remain investigational. (1→3)-β-d-glucan (BDG) is a cell wall component found in several fungal pathogens, including Candida and Aspergillus spp. Detecting BDG in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be an important approach for detecting and therapeutically monitoring FICNS. To date, there has been no study that has investigated the effectiveness of CSF BDG as a diagnostic and therapeutic marker of FICNS in children.

Methods

Serial BDG levels were measured in serum and CSF samples obtained from pediatric patients (aged 0-18 years) with a diagnosis of probable or proven Candida or Aspergillus CNS infection.

Results

Nine cases of FICNS were identified in patients aged 1 month to 18 years. Two patients were infected with an Aspergillus species, and 7 patients were infected with a Candida species. All the patients at baseline had detectable BDG in their CSF. Among 7 patients who completed therapy for an FICNS, all elevated CSF BDG levels decreased to <31 pg/mL. At the time of this writing, 1 patient was still receiving therapy and continued to have elevated BDG levels. One patient died from overwhelming disseminated candidiasis. The lengths of therapy for these 9 children ranged from 2 weeks to 28 months.

Conclusion

The BDG assay is useful in diagnosing and therapeutically monitoring Candida and Aspergillus CNS infections in pediatric patients.

### Combination of serum and peritoneal 1.3-β-D-glucan can rule out intra-abdominal candidiasis in surgical critically ill patients: a multicenter prospective study [^36b141c2]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, all these studies employed the Fungitell ® beta--glucan assay (FA, Associate of Cape Cod, East Falmouth, Inc. United States of America) for pBDG measurement. The Wako ® beta-glucan test (WT, Fujifilm Wako Chemicals Europe, Neuss, Germany) has not been assessed in this context before. The WT has been validated for both serum and plasma matrices. This BDG test is technically less complex to operate than the FA (Fungitell assay) and is simpler to execute and interpret. Therefore, it is plausible that the WT would be more suitable for the medium represented by peritoneal fluid.

The present study sought to identify a high risk of IAC in critically ill patients and to evaluate pBDG measurements using the beta-glucan test from Wako ® for the diagnosis of IAC. This study aimed to address some of the limitations of prior research, such as patient population heterogeneity and insufficient confirmed IAC cases, which can introduce bias and ambiguity into the results.

### Beta-glucans in advanced CKD: role in endotoxaemia and inflammation [^9e7cc3a9]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta glucans [(1–3)-β-D glucans] (BG) are major carbohydrate constituents of the cell walls of yeast and fungi. Recently, they have attracted significant scientific attention because of their reported biological activities, which include anticancer, anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects. However, BGs are also key pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules that trigger a number of host immune responses and can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines mediated by interaction with dectin-1 and toll-like receptors. Elevated blood BG levels have been used as a diagnostic adjunct for invasive fungal infections and an assay has been developed and cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration for this purpose.

In haemodialysis (HD) patients, high blood levels of BG can activate blood endotoxin detection assays such as the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay leading to apparently increased blood endotoxin levels. False positive signals for endotoxemia occurred in 50% of HD patients which were extinguished on remeasurement incorporating a BG-blocking agent with the LAL assay. BG levels have been found to be elevated both in patients on HD and in those on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Dialysis membranes can increase BG levels but the effect appears to be confined to now obsolete cellulose membranes and this phenomenon is not seen with modern biocompatible devices. BG is cleared via the reticuloendothelial system and clearance is thought to be independent of renal function. Hence the cause for elevated BG levels is not clear.

The purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence and clinical consequences of elevated BG levels in non-infected subjects with CKD. We aimed to study BG levels in patients across the spectrum of CKD to investigate their associations with detectable blood endotoxin levels and markers of inflammation.

### Rapid diagnosis of invasive candidiasis: ready for prime-time? [^f2f4ef03]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review the performance of culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs), including β-D-glucan (BDG), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and T2Candida, in diagnosing invasive candidiasis, their potential roles in patient management, and unintended consequences of testing.

Recent Findings

In a recent multicenter trial, T2Candida was 90% sensitive and 98% specific for diagnosing candidemia. A new study provided the first data for T2Candida in diagnosing deep-seated candidiasis, demonstrating sensitivity/specificity of 45%/96%. Two studies showed that ongoing T2Candida-positivity is associated with poor prognosis. In several studies, serum BDG and T2Candida, targeted to patients at-risk for invasive candidiasis, were useful in guiding treatment decisions and antifungal stewardship. A randomized, multicenter trial of BDG-guided empiric antifungal treatment is underway among critically ill patients. PCR performance was highly variable for candidemia and deep-seated candidiasis in recent studies. CIDT results may overstate bloodstream infections, according to current National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definitions.

Summary

BDG and T2Candida are nearing prime-time status in the clinic. To be useful, testing must be directed to carefully chosen patients and specific clinical questions. Candida PCR is limited by a need for standardized methodologies and commercial assays. NHSN definitions of bloodstream infections must be revised in the era of CIDTs.
