## Question

is esrd with cancer and baseline hgb of 7ish a contraindication to dapt

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ESRD with cancer and a baseline hemoglobin around 7 g/dL constitutes an absolute contraindication to dual antiplatelet therapy, along with a practical decision framework grounded in the available evidence.

> Bottom line up front: this triad is not an absolute contraindication to DAPT, but it is a major relative contraindication with prohibitive bleeding risk in most scenarios, warranting an individualized, multidisciplinary decision with a strong default toward avoiding DAPT unless the ischemic indication is compelling and immediate, such as very recent PCI with high-risk stent anatomy or acute coronary syndrome with no feasible alternatives [^115ee2t1] [^112QLWmt] [^116EG7JK].

> ESRD substantially increases bleeding risk through uremic platelet dysfunction, anemia, and heparin exposure during dialysis, and CKD populations on antiplatelet therapy demonstrate higher bleeding rates and a narrower net clinical benefit compared with non-CKD cohorts, supporting minimized DAPT intensity and duration when DAPT is unavoidable [^1111FAvT] [^116EG7JK].

> Severe anemia around 7 g/dL is itself a potent bleeding risk amplifier and is far below typical CKD anemia management thresholds; kidney guidelines emphasize avoiding hemoglobin nadirs below approximately 9 g/dL due to transfusion needs and adverse outcomes, underscoring the need to correct life-threatening anemia before contemplating DAPT exposure whenever possible [^117WjGeS] [^116zSyq8].

> Active or recent cancer often elevates hemorrhagic risk depending on tumor type, site, and treatment; furthermore, ESA use in patients with cancer is restricted to chemotherapy-induced anemia and should be minimized given risks of tumor progression and thromboembolic events, complicating anemia correction and further tilting the balance away from routine DAPT in this setting [^1119hYfN] [^116JRSua] [^115Qds9R].

> If DAPT is absolutely necessary after PCI in an HBR patient with CKD/ESRD, contemporary evidence supports the shortest feasible course, with 1 month of DAPT showing similar ischemic outcomes and numerically lower bleeding than 3 months in high-bleeding-risk cohorts that included CKD, coupled with selection of lower-bleeding-risk components such as low-dose aspirin plus clopidogrel and consideration of stent strategies designed for abbreviated DAPT courses [^112QLWmt] [^115ee2t1] [^1129Zh21].

> Practical mitigation includes urgent correction of critical anemia primarily via transfusion to safer thresholds, gastroprotection, minimizing intradialytic anticoagulation where feasible, close CBC surveillance, and early conversion to single antiplatelet therapy if bleeding risk remains extreme or bleeding occurs, recognizing that ESA intensification is generally inappropriate in active malignancy and that all decisions should be documented with Heart Team input [^117WjGeS] [^1119hYfN] [^115ee2t1].

> Recommendation: classify this scenario as a major relative contraindication to DAPT; avoid DAPT if clinically acceptable alternatives exist, and if DAPT is unavoidable, use the lowest-intensity regimen for the shortest duration with aggressive bleeding risk mitigation and multidisciplinary agreement, as the composite risk of ESRD, active or recent cancer, and hemoglobin near 7 g/dL will outweigh DAPT's benefits in most real-world contexts [^112QLWmt] [^116EG7JK] [^115ee2t1].

---

No, ESRD with cancer and baseline hemoglobin around 7 g/dL is **not an absolute contraindication** to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) [^1111FAvT] [^112Dd6y1]. However, these patients are at **high bleeding risk** and require individualized risk–benefit assessment [^117T96dE], close monitoring, and multidisciplinary management [^115ee2t1]. DAPT should be used only when the ischemic benefit clearly outweighs the bleeding risk, with the shortest effective duration [^112QLWmt] and careful anemia management [^116zSyq8].

---

## Clinical considerations for DAPT in ESRD patients with cancer and severe anemia

### Bleeding risk

- ESRD patients have **increased bleeding risk** due to uremic platelet dysfunction [^114aoceA], anticoagulation during dialysis, and frequent invasive procedures.
- Cancer further **increases bleeding risk** through tumor-related bleeding, chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, and mucosal involvement [^117J57FC].
- Severe anemia (Hb ~7 g/dL) **exacerbates bleeding risk** and may necessitate transfusions, increasing complications [^117WjGeS].

---

### Ischemic risk

Ischemic risk is **heightened** in ESRD due to a substantial cardiovascular burden, including coronary artery disease and stent thrombosis, often necessitating DAPT after PCI [^115ee2t1]. Cancer further elevates thrombotic risk through tumor-related hypercoagulability and chemotherapy effects. Therefore, balancing ischemic and bleeding risks is critical in this population [^117T96dE].

---

## Evidence and guidelines regarding DAPT in ESRD patients with cancer and severe anemia

- There are **no absolute contraindications** to DAPT in ESRD patients with cancer and severe anemia; decisions should be individualized based on clinical judgment and patient-specific factors [^112Dd6y1].
- The Cochrane review on antiplatelet agents in CKD emphasizes **individualized risk–benefit assessment** [^114aoceA] due to increased bleeding risk in CKD patients.
- The European Dialysis Working Group recommends **individualized decisions** to minimize bleeding while reducing thrombotic risk [^1111FAvT].
- **Shorter DAPT durations** (e.g. 1 month) [^112QLWmt] may be considered in high bleeding risk patients, including those with CKD, without significantly increasing ischemic events.

---

## Clinical management strategies

### Anemia management

Optimize anemia management with **erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron supplementation** to maintain hemoglobin within recommended targets (typically 10–12 g/dL) [^116zSyq8], and monitor hemoglobin regularly, adjusting ESA therapy as needed [^11529EC7].

---

### DAPT management

DAPT management should prioritize the **shortest effective duration** based on individualized ischemic and bleeding risk [^117T96dE]. Patients require regular surveillance for bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and intracranial hemorrhage. If the bleeding risk outweighs the ischemic benefit, alternative antiplatelet strategies or monotherapy should be considered [^115ee2t1].

---

### Multidisciplinary approach

A **multidisciplinary approach** engages cardiology, nephrology, oncology, and hematology specialists in decision-making, with regular reassessment of patient status and therapy adjustments as needed [^115ee2t1].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

- ESRD patients on DAPT have **increased bleeding complications**, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and bleeding requiring transfusion [^114aoceA].
- Cancer patients on DAPT have **increased bleeding risk** due to tumor-related bleeding and chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia [^117J57FC].
- Severe anemia **increases transfusion requirements** and associated complications [^117WjGeS].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ESRD with cancer and severe anemia (Hb ~7 g/dL) | - Not an absolute contraindication to DAPT [^112Dd6y1] <br/> - Individualized risk–benefit assessment required [^1111FAvT] |
| Bleeding risk | - High [^114aoceA] <br/> - Requires close monitoring and anemia management [^11529EC7] |
| Ischemic risk | - High [^115ee2t1] <br/> - DAPT may be necessary after PCI [^117T96dE] |
| DAPT duration | Shortest effective duration recommended [^112QLWmt] |
| Anemia management | Optimize with ESAs and iron supplementation [^116zSyq8] |
| Multidisciplinary approach | Essential for individualized care [^115ee2t1] |

### One-month versus three-month dual-antiplatelet therapy in high bleeding risk patients with chronic kidney disease [^112QLWmt]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Shortening the duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was shown to be effective and safe in patients at high bleeding risk (HBR). We aimed to investigate the effect of 1 versus 3-month DAPT on outcomes after drug-eluting stent in HBR patients with or without chronic kidney disease (CKD). Data from three prospective single-arm studies (XIENCE Short DAPT Program) enrolling HBR patients after successful coronary implantation of cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents (XIENCE, Abbott) were analyzed. Subjects were eligible for DAPT discontinuation at 1 or 3 months if free from ischemic events.

The primary endpoint was all-cause death or any myocardial infarction. The key secondary endpoint was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium Type 2 to 5 bleeding. Outcomes were assessed from 1 to 12 months after PCI. CKD was defined as baseline creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min. Of 3,286 patients, 1,432 (43.6%) had CKD.
- **Outcomes**:
	- One-month versus 3-month DAPT was associated with a similar 12-month risk of the primary outcome irrespective of CKD status:
		- **CKD**: 9.5% vs 10.9%, adjusted hazard ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 1.22
		- **No-CKD**: 6.6% vs 5.6%, adjusted hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.73
		- p interaction 0.299
	- Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 2 to 5 bleeding rates were numerically but not significantly lower with 1-month versus 3-month DAPT in both:
		- CKD (9.9% vs 12%)
		- No-CKD (6.4% vs 9.0%)

In conclusion, in HBR patients, 1-month versus 3-month DAPT was associated with a similar risk of ischemic complications.

### Pros and cons of antithrombotic therapy in end-stage kidney disease: A 2019 update [^1111FAvT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Dialysis patients exhibit both an increased thrombotic risk and a hemorrhagic tendency. A significant number of patients with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis have cardiovascular comorbidities, such as coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, or venous thromboembolism, and therefore have various indications for treatment with antithrombotics, whether for primary or secondary prevention. Unfortunately, few randomized controlled trials focus on antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy in dialysis, which results in cardiology and nephrology guidelines offering ambiguous recommendations and often excluding or ignoring these patients.

An expert consensus is needed to provide physicians with useful information for making correct decisions in different situations requiring antithrombotics. The European Dialysis Working Group presents up-to-date evidence on this topic, encouraging practitioners to choose among alternatives to limit bleeding and minimize atherothrombotic and cardioembolic risks. In the absence of clear evidence, these clinical settings and consequent therapeutic strategies will be discussed by highlighting data from observational studies both supporting and opposing the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs alone or in combination. Until new studies clarify these unclear clinical situations, it is important to keep in mind that the objective of treatment is to minimize thrombotic risk while reducing bleeding events.

### Procrit [^1119hYfN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Chronic kidney disease**: In controlled trials, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Use the lowest Procrit dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Cancer**: ESAs shortened overall survival and/or increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in clinical studies of patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical cancers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. To decrease these risks, as well as the risk of serious cardiovascular and thromboembolic reactions, use the lowest dose needed to avoid RBC transfusions [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Use ESAs only for anemia from myelosuppressive chemotherapy [see Indications and Usage (1.3)]. ESAs are not indicated for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy when the anticipated outcome is cure [see Indications and Usage (1.5)]. Discontinue following the completion of a chemotherapy course [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Perisurgery**: Due to increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), DVT prophylaxis is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### UK Kidney Association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^114AwHr4]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically in relation to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend targeting hemoglobin levels between 95 and 115 g/L in children aged less than 2 years with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease or those receiving dialysis while on ESA therapy, as this reflects the lower normal range in that age group.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using Monte Carlo simulation [^115a1DRL]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Home hemodialysis (HHD) offers a more flexible and convenient dialysis schedule for patients to treat their end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), compared to in-center hemodialysis with its rigid thrice-weekly schedule. HHD also allows individualized dialysis delivery with more frequent and/or longer sessions to meet patients' solute and fluid control needs. Studies report that HHD is associated with improved survival, cardiovascular outcomes, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Despite increasing perception of these clinical and lifestyle benefits, HHD is underutilized in the United States. Between 2009 and 2019, the percentage of patients receiving home dialysis (peritoneal dialysis and HHD) only increased from 1.2% to 1.9%. In 2019, only 0.3% of patients who initiated dialysis started with HHD.

### Cancer risk among elderly persons with end-stage renal disease: a population-based case-control study [^111BnQvH]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

In contrast, the strong increase in multiple myeloma risk in the first 1–2 years after ESRD diagnosis, and declining risk over longer time intervals, could be attributed to reverse causality, such that multiple myeloma leads to renal failure. This situation could arise if multiple myeloma was undiagnosed at initiation of dialysis, or if the diagnosis date is in error in the cancer registry due to delayed reporting. Maisonneuve et al. also noted the excess of multiple myeloma cases and likewise attributed this observation to prevalent cases. Finally, treatment of glomerulonephritis with azathioprine or cyclophosphamide may predispose to certain types of cancers such as kidney cancer, bladder cancer, and multiple myeloma.

Our findings of markedly low risk of prostate cancer deserve comment. A biologically protective effect of ESRD seems unlikely, because the inverse association was present only for localized cancer and not for distant/metastatic cancer. We believe that the inverse association instead may be a manifestation of screening. Recommendations for prostate cancer screening using PSA testing and digital rectal examination are presently in flux, but screening has typically been considered only for men who have an extended life expectancy. One possibility is that, due to their lower life expectancy, men with ESRD do not receive screening with the PSA test as frequently as other men, which could lead to an apparent deficit of prostate cancer. Indeed, it is estimated that 40% of prostate cancer cases in the U.S. are detected through PSA testing. Among controls, we found

### We give aminoglycoside antibiotics at the end of hemodialysis [^1129Ypgd]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

We often administer dialyzable medications after dialysis to ensure that adequate concentrations are maintained in the body until the next session. In the case of aminoglycosides, we may have the opportunity to dose more aggressively predialysis and then use the clearance of the drug by dialysis to limit toxicities. Predialysis aminoglycoside dosing is intriguing, although studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of this approach are necessary before it can be used routinely.

### Daptomycin pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous hemodialysis [^113zQip7]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this prospective, open-label pharmacokinetic study was to investigate daptomycin pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous hemodialysis to develop dosing recommendations. The study was conducted in intensive care units within a teaching medical center.

Eight adults with known or suspected Gram-positive infections, receiving continuous venovenous hemodialysis and daptomycin, participated in the study. Daptomycin, at a dose of 8 mg/kg, was administered intravenously over 30 minutes. Serial blood and effluent samples were collected over the subsequent 48 hours. Daptomycin protein binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis. Daptomycin continuous venovenous hemodialysis transmembrane clearance was calculated by dividing daptomycin effluent concentration by serum concentrations and multiplying by the mean effluent production rate for each subject. Equations describing a two-compartment, open-pharmacokinetic model were fitted to each subject's daptomycin concentration-time data, and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by standard methods. Serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for two daptomycin regimens: 8 mg/kg every 48 hours and 4 mg/kg every 24 hours.
- **Measurements and main results**: A total of 7.7 ± 0.6 mg/kg (mean ± SD) of daptomycin was administered, resulting in an observed peak concentration of 81.2 ± 19.0 μg/mL. The daptomycin steady-state volume of distribution (0.23 ± 0.14 L/kg) and free fraction (17.5% ± 5.0%) were increased in critically ill subjects receiving continuous venovenous hemodialysis compared with previous values reported in healthy volunteers.

### SPL drug information for daptomycin [^111iN4vx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of daptomycin IV (also known as Cubicin, Cubicin RF, Dapzura TR):

- **C. difficile infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea is reported with the use of daptomycin and may present as mild diarrhea to more severe colitis.
- **Dress syndrome**: Use caution in patients with risk factors for skin rash, fever, peripheral eosinophilia, and systemic organ (e.g. hepatic, renal, pulmonary) impairment.
- **Myopathy**: Use extreme caution in patients who received recent prior or concomitant therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and with renal impairment. Monitor for the development of muscle pain or weakness, particularly of the distal extremities.
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Use caution in patients with risk factors for peripheral neuropathy.
- **Reactivation of eosinophilic pneumonia**: Use caution in patients with a history of eosinophilic pneumonia.
- **Respiratory illness**: Use caution in patients with infections of the lung (e.g. pneumonia).
- **Tubulointerstitial nephritis**: Use caution in patients with renal impairment.

### Aminoglycosides in hemodialysis patients: Is the current practice of post dialysis dosing appropriate [^117RU842]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Aminoglycosides have been widely used in end-stage renal failure patients for the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus. Traditionally, these agents are administered post dialysis to avoid premature dialytic clearance, although no studies have been performed to confirm that this dosing strategy represents the optimal treatment regimen.

In recent years, a more complete understanding of the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of aminoglycosides has led to a global change in clinical practice from multiple to once-daily dosing in patients with normal renal function. This approach aims to provide intermittent pulses to maximize the peak concentration relative to overall drug exposure. These same considerations strongly support the administration of aminoglycosides before, rather than after, hemodialysis.

This study reviews key pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerations in aminoglycoside dosing, the relationship between serum aminoglycoside concentrations and efficacy/toxicity, the influence of renal function and hemodialysis on aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and the mounting population pharmacokinetic and clinical study evidence supporting a paradigm shift in aminoglycoside dosing from post dialysis to predialysis.

### C.E.R. A. once every 4 weeks corrects anaemia and maintains haemoglobin in patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis [^1163fAPf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Hb increase over time was noted in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. A stable response, defined as having ≥ 75% of the scheduled hemoglobin (Hb) values within the range of 10–12 g/dL and ≥ 1 g/dL from baseline for any 8-week period, was observed in 105 patients (68.6%) treated with C.E.R. A., compared to 112 patients (72.7%) treated with darbepoetin alfa, which was not statistically significant. The number of patients requiring dose changes to achieve a stable Hb response was similar between the C.E.R. A. and darbepoetin alfa groups, with 65 patients (61.9%) versus 64 patients (57.1%), respectively, again not statistically significant.

The mean number of dose changes per patient for a stable response was comparable in both groups, with 1.12 for C.E.R. A. and 1.10 for darbepoetin alfa. Fewer patients undergoing treatment with C.E.R. A. required multiple dose adjustments (≥ 5 adjustments) compared to those treated with darbepoetin alfa, with percentages of 10.7% and 21.3%, respectively. The change in median dose from baseline to evaluation was modest for C.E.R. A. compared to a more substantial change seen with darbepoetin alfa, at 6.6% versus 35.6%, respectively.

Additionally, transfusion requirements were evaluated. Ten patients (6.5%) in the darbepoetin alfa group required one or more transfusions, in contrast to five patients (3.3%) in the C.E.R. A. group. The reasons for transfusions were comparable between the two treatment cohorts, indicating similar clinical considerations.

Regarding the use of daptomycin IV (also known as Cubicin, Cubicin RF, Dapzura TR) in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement, the following recommendations are suggested:

- **Dosage recommendations**: Start at a dose of 4 mg with a maximal dose of 6 mg. The maximum frequency should be every 48 hours (q48h).
- **Monitoring guidelines**: Monitor serum creatinine and watch for signs of myopathy.

### Sutent [^1119aruN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Dosage modification for end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis**: No starting dose adjustment is required in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. However, given the decreased exposure compared to patients with normal renal function, subsequent doses may be increased gradually up to 2-fold based on safety and tolerability [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Daptomycin [^115EydfX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Appropriate specimens for microbiological examination should be obtained to isolate and identify the causative pathogens and determine their susceptibility to daptomycin. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of daptomycin for injection and other antibacterial drugs, daptomycin for injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

When culture and susceptibility information is available, it should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Empiric therapy may be initiated while awaiting test results.

### Clinical practice guidelines for anemia in chronic kidney disease: Problems and solutions. A position statement from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) [^116P9nkG]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The development of clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease has been instrumental in identifying and reducing variations in the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron replacement. Challenges to the effectiveness and safety of recommendations made in these guidelines were magnified when recent clinical trials showed no benefit or harm with respect to cardiovascular outcomes in subjects randomized to higher target hemoglobin levels.

To address these concerns, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) convened an international conference to examine the problems and shortcomings of existing anemia guidelines. These guidelines are a prime example of the duplication of efforts to derive recommendations from a limited evidence base. The meeting was attended by representatives of the major guideline-developing organizations, who agreed to avoid future duplicative efforts and to save resources by generating a common evidence report. This report's recommendations could then be prioritized and implemented locally.

This is a report to the international nephrology community of the recommendations for and timeline of the next anemia guidelines. It has been reviewed by the conference participants and approved as a position statement by the KDIGO Board of Directors.

### Treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in chronic kidney disease patients with cancer [^111p9hYC]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of anemia remains an important component in the care of patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) remain a key anemia treatment strategy in this patient population. However, anemia management in this group can become more complicated by a prior or history of malignancy. There has been a great deal of work both scientifically and in clinical trials in oncology that have revealed certain concerns and risks of ESA use in patients with cancer. In this review, we bring together knowledge from nephrology and oncology literature to help nephrologists understand the implications for ESA treatment when CKD/ESRD is complicated by cancer. We also suggest an approach to the management of anemia in this patient group with active or previous malignancy.

Regarding the use of daptomycin IV (also known as Cubicin, Cubicin RF, Dapzura TR) in patients with peritoneal dialysis:

- **Dose**: As in eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Start at a dose of 4 mg with a maximal dose of 6 mg. Maximal frequency of administration is every 48 hours.

- **Monitoring**: Monitor serum creatinine levels and watch for signs of myopathy.

### Daptomycin [^112TU2NH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In the event of overdosage, supportive care is advised with maintenance of glomerular filtration. Daptomycin is cleared slowly from the body by hemodialysis, with approximately 15% of the administered dose removed over 4 hours, and by peritoneal dialysis, with approximately 11% of the administered dose removed over 48 hours. The use of high-flux dialysis membranes during 4 hours of hemodialysis may increase the percentage of dose removed compared with that removed by low-flux membranes.

### Change in hemoglobin trajectory and darbepoetin dose approaching end-stage renal disease: Data from the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy trial [^112yg1RN]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease-associated anemia is multifactorial and includes decreased production of erythropoietin (EPO), iron deficiency, inflammation, and EPO resistance. To better understand the trajectory of these parameters, we described temporal trends in hemoglobin (Hb), ferritin, transferrin saturation, C-reactive protein (CRP), and darbepoetin dosing in the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy (TREAT).
- **Methods**: We performed a post hoc analysis of 4,038 participants in TREAT. Mixed effects linear regression models were used to determine the trajectory of parameters of interest prior to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Likelihood ratio tests were used to determine the overall differences in biomarker values and differences in trajectories between those who did and did not develop ESRD.
- **Results**: Hb declined precipitously in the year prior to the development of ESRD (irrespective of treatment assignment), and was on average 1.15 g/dL (95% CI -1.26 to -1.04) lower in those who developed ESRD versus those who did not, at the time of ESRD/end of follow-up. Simultaneously, the mean darbepoetin dose and CRP concentration increased, while serum ferritin and transferrin saturations were > 140 μg/L and 20%, respectively.
- **Conclusions**: Our analyses provide descriptive insights regarding the temporal changes of Hb, darbepoetin dose, and related parameters as ESRD approaches in participants of TREAT. Hb declined as much as 1–2 years prior to the development of ESRD, without biochemical evidence of iron deficiency.

### Benefit and risk of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation in patients with chronic kidney disease: A nationwide cohort study [^117T96dE]. Atherosclerosis (2022). High credibility.

The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not clearly established. This study aimed to compare clinical outcomes of patients with 6–12 months (standard) versus 12–24 months (prolonged) DAPT, according to CKD.
- **Methods**: Using a nationwide, claim-based database, we retrospectively evaluated the association between DAPT duration and clinical outcomes, including death, composite ischemic events, and composite bleeding events between 1 and 3 years after PCI. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Of 73,941 eligible patients, 13,425 (18.2%) had CKD, and 49,019 (66%) were prescribed prolonged DAPT. Prolonged DAPT had no significant impact on the risk of clinical outcomes in patients with normal renal function.
- **Results**: In patients with CKD, prolonged DAPT was associated with a lower risk of all-cause death (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76–0.95) and composite ischemic events (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78–0.96) but a higher risk of composite bleeding events (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02–1.37). The benefit of prolonged DAPT in reducing composite ischemic events increased significantly in patients with worsened renal dysfunction (p for interaction = 0.02), while there was no significant interaction between its bleeding risk and renal dysfunction (p for interaction = 0.22).
- **Conclusions**: While standard DAPT is recommended for patients with normal renal function, a tailored decision regarding DAPT duration should be considered for those with CKD to balance the risks and benefits.

### The efficacy of daptomycin versus vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection in patients with impaired renal function [^115r6gMk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Concerns regarding the efficacy of daptomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections in patients with impaired renal function are reflected in a recent package insert change by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, this decision was based on a small subgroup analysis, and it is unclear if this is a true association.
- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with MRSA bacteremia treated at a tertiary hospital from 2001 to 2011 and who received either vancomycin or daptomycin. We used propensity score and multivariable logistic regression to assess the outcome of treatment failure via blinded adjudication, in daptomycin- vs. vancomycin-treated subjects and the interaction with renal function.
- **Results**: One hundred fifty patients were analyzed, 100 in the vancomycin arm and 50 in the daptomycin arm. The average age was 61 years, and 60% were men. Of patients treated with daptomycin or vancomycin, 29 (58%) and 51 (51%), respectively, had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 50 mL/minute/1.73 m² (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.11–1.79), nor in patients with a GFR of < 50 mL/minute/1.73 m² (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.11–1.94). There was no significant interaction between them (P = 0.54).
- **Conclusions**: In patients with MRSA bacteremia, daptomycin efficacy was not affected by GFR level and was similar to vancomycin.

### Exjade [^1118ZVkj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warning: renal failure, hepatic failure, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage**:

- **Renal failure**: Exjade can cause acute renal failure and death, particularly in patients with comorbidities and those who are in the advanced stages of their hematologic disorders. Evaluate baseline renal function prior to starting or increasing Exjade dosing in all patients. Exjade is contraindicated in adult and pediatric patients with an eGFR less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m². Measure serum creatinine in duplicate prior to initiation of therapy. Monitor renal function at least monthly. For patients with baseline renal impairment or increased risk of acute renal failure, monitor renal function weekly for the first month, then at least monthly. Reduce the starting dose in patients with preexisting renal disease. During therapy, increase the frequency of monitoring and modify the dose for patients with an increased risk of renal impairment, including use of concomitant nephrotoxic drugs and pediatric patients with volume depletion or overchelation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4, 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].
- **Hepatic failure**: Exjade can cause hepatic injury, including hepatic failure and death. Measure serum transaminases and bilirubin in all patients prior to initiating treatment, every 2 weeks during the first month, and at least monthly thereafter. Avoid use of Exjade in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment and reduce the dose in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Antiplatelet agents for chronic kidney disease [^116EG7JK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet agents are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. The risks and benefits of antiplatelet treatment may be different in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), for whom occlusive atherosclerotic events are less prevalent, and bleeding hazards might be increased.
- **Objectives**: To summarize the effects of antiplatelet treatment (antiplatelet agent versus control or other antiplatelet agent) for the prevention of cardiovascular and adverse kidney outcomes in individuals with CKD.
- **Search methods**: In January 2011 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register without language restriction.
- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized controlled trials of any antiplatelet treatment versus placebo or no treatment, or direct head-to-head antiplatelet agent studies in people with CKD. Studies were included if they enrolled participants with CKD or included people in broader at-risk populations in which data for subgroups with CKD could be disaggregated.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data from primary study reports and any available supplementary information for study population, interventions, outcomes, and risks of bias. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from numbers of events and numbers of participants at risk, which were extracted from each included study. The reported RRs were extracted where crude event rates were not provided. Data were pooled using the random-effects model.

### Recent changes in vancomycin use in renal failure [^116Edsz1]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a key tool in the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections. A progressive increase in vancomycin resistance with consequent treatment failure has been observed in staphylococci. Therefore, new dosing guidelines advocating much higher vancomycin doses have been issued. Target trough levels of 15–20 microg/ml are proposed. Whether and how these targets can be achieved in patients with chronic kidney disease or those on dialysis are still under evaluation.

The higher vancomycin doses to achieve these treatment targets carry a substantial risk for nephrotoxicity. This risk is incremental with higher trough levels and longer duration of vancomycin use. Critically ill patients, patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic agents, and patients with already compromised renal function are particularly at risk for vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity.

### Optimizing renal replacement therapy in older adults: a framework for making individualized decisions [^114aEjGL]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

It is often difficult to synthesize information about the risks and benefits of recommended management strategies in older patients with end-stage renal disease, since they may have more comorbidity and lower life expectancy than patients described in clinical trials or practice guidelines. In this review, we outline a framework for individualizing end-stage renal disease management decisions in older patients. The framework considers three factors: life expectancy, the risks and benefits of competing treatment strategies, and patient preferences. We illustrate the use of this framework by applying it to three key end-stage renal disease decisions in older patients with varying life expectancy: choice of dialysis modality, choice of vascular access for hemodialysis, and referral for kidney transplantation.

In several instances, this approach might provide support for treatment decisions that directly contradict available practice guidelines, illustrating circumstances when strict application of guidelines may be inappropriate for certain patients. By combining quantitative estimates of benefits and harms with qualitative assessments of patient preferences, clinicians may be better able to tailor treatment recommendations to individual older patients, thereby improving the overall quality of end-stage renal disease care.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^114Z4kzp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Phase III trials involving DOACs have excluded patients with severe renal dysfunction, specifically those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of less than 30 mL/min, where a reduced dose is recommended for CrCl between 15 to 30 mL/min, and avoidance is advised for CrCl less than 15 mL/min. The 2018 AF guidelines recommend both warfarin and apixaban for patients with end-stage renal disease (CrCl < 15 mL/min or on dialysis). However, warfarin has little proven benefit and poses a significant risk of harm in end-stage renal disease. There is growing evidence that apixaban in patients with AF and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease may be associated with a lower risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin, or at the very least, similar rates of bleeding.

Rivaroxaban use in severe CKD, particularly in patients on dialysis, is quite contentious. The package labeling states that rivaroxaban can be used in such cases.

### The efficacy and safety of short- and long-term dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with mild or moderate chronic kidney disease: results from the Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Observation (CREDO) trial [^115uu2DW]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Mild and moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) are associated with decreased survival and increased adverse events following a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Therapy with clopidogrel decreases adverse events in large patient populations. Therefore, we sought to determine the efficacy and safety of long-term clopidogrel therapy in patients with CKD.
- **Methods**: Two thousand two patients from the CREDO trial, in whom an elective PCI of a single or multiple vessels was planned, were analyzed. Patients were randomly assigned to a 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel before PCI, followed by clopidogrel 75 mg/day for a year, versus a placebo loading dose at the time of the PCI procedure and clopidogrel 75 mg/day for 28 days and placebo for the remainder of a year. Patients were categorized by their estimated creatinine clearance (> 90 [normal, n = 999], 60–89 [mild CKD, n = 672], < 60 mL/min [moderate CKD, n = 331]).
- **Results**: Diminished renal function was associated with worse outcomes. Patients with normal renal function who received 1 year of clopidogrel had a marked reduction in death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared with those who received placebo (10.4% vs 4.4%, P < .001), whereas patients with mild and moderate CKD did not have a significant difference in outcomes with clopidogrel therapy versus placebo (mild: 12.8% vs 10.3%, P = 0.30; moderate: 13.1% vs 17.8%, P = 0.24). Clopidogrel use was associated with an increased relative risk of major or minor bleeding, but this increased risk was not different based on renal function (relative risk 1.2, 1.3, 1.1).

### Daptomycin use in neutropenic patients with documented gram-positive infections [^113TsYEA]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to describe the outcomes associated with daptomycin treatment of documented gram-positive infections in patients with neutropenia.

All patients with neutropenia (≤ 500 cells/m³) and at least one documented gram-positive culture from 2006–2009 were identified from a retrospective, multicenter, and observational registry (Cubicin® Outcome Registry and Experience (CORE®)). Investigators assessed patient outcomes as cured, improved, failed, or non-evaluable at the end of daptomycin therapy. All patients were included in the safety analysis.

The efficacy population consisted of 186 patients; 159 (85%) patients had either a cure (n = 108, 58%) or improved outcome (n = 51, 27%). Success rates (cure plus improved) by the lowest WBC during daptomycin treatment were 98/116 (84%) for ≤ 100 cells/m³ and 61/70 (87%) for 101–499 cells/m³, P = 0.6. Most patients had cancer; 135/186 (73%) had hematological malignancy, 26/186 (14%) had solid tumors, and 9 (5%) had both.

One hundred fifty-six (84%) patients received other antibiotics before daptomycin treatment, with 82% having received vancomycin, and 31% failing vancomycin therapy. The most common infections were bacteremia (78%), skin and skin structure infections (8%), and urinary tract infections/pyelonephritis (6%). The most common pathogens were vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (47%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (20%), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%). The median (min, max) initial daptomycin dose was 6 mg/kg (3.6, 8.3). The median (min, max) daptomycin duration of therapy was not specified in the available text.

### Diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease in advanced and end-stage renal disease [^115ee2t1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

- **Duration of DAPT**: The 2014 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that in patients undergoing urgent noncardiac surgery performed less than 4 to 6 months after BMS or DES implantation, DAPT should be continued unless the relative risk of bleeding outweighs the benefit of prevention of stent thrombosis. Moreover, DAPT should be continued for at least 6 months in patients with DESs if the risk of surgical delay is greater than the risk of DES thrombosis. Importantly, the ACC/AHA guidelines also recommend that perioperative management of DAPT should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team, including the operating surgeon, cardiologist, anesthesiologist, and patient, to weigh the risks of bleeding and stent thrombosis in an individualized fashion.

Important factors to consider in perioperative DAPT management are the type, number, and size of stents versus the risk of delaying renal transplantation in favor of prolonging DAPT to prevent stent thrombosis. A newer generation of DESs with enhanced biocompatibility and reduced thrombogenicity may require only 1 to 6 months of DAPT, depending on the type of stent, but more evidence is needed. These considerations highlight the fact that DAPT should be tailored to the individual patient. For example, patients requiring multivessel PCI with the use of a DES for lesions involving coronary ostia, long lesions, bifurcation lesions, chronic total occlusions, or for cases in which the minimal stent area achieved is small, may benefit from a prolonged course of DAPT. In contrast, patients with high bleeding risk or single-vessel disease who may have contraindications to prolonged DAPT might require a modified strategy.

### Brilinta [^112Dd6y1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Renal impairment**: No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
- **Patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis**: Clinical efficacy and safety studies with Brilinta did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using Monte Carlo simulation [^117RhEz2]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Few drug dosing recommendations for patients receiving home hemodialysis (HHD) have been published, which has hindered the adoption of HHD. HHD regimens vary widely and differ considerably from conventional, thrice-weekly, in-center hemodialysis in terms of treatment frequency, duration, and blood and dialysate flow rates. Consequently, vancomycin and daptomycin clearances in HHD are also likely to be different. Therefore, HHD dosing regimens must be developed to ensure efficacy and minimize toxicity when these antibiotics are used. Many HHD regimens are used clinically. This study modeled ten common HHD regimens and determined optimal vancomycin and daptomycin dosing for each HHD regimen.
- **Methods**: Monte Carlo simulations using pharmacokinetic data derived from the literature and demographic data from a large HHD program treating patients with end-stage kidney disease were incorporated into a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Virtual vancomycin and daptomycin doses were administered post-HHD, and drug exposures were determined in 5,000 virtual patients receiving ten different HHD regimens. Serum concentration monitoring with subsequent dose changes was incorporated into the vancomycin models. Pharmacodynamic target attainment rates were determined for each studied dose. The lowest possible doses that met predefined targets in virtual patients were chosen as optimal doses.
- **Results**: HHD frequency, total dialysate volumes, and HHD durations influenced drug exposure and led to different dosing regimens to meet targets. Antibiotic dosing regimens were identified based on these parameters.

Choices for healthy outcomes in caring for end-stage renal disease (CHOICE) study

CHOICE is a longitudinal observational cohort study of 1,041 incident dialysis patients originally funded by the AHRQ to measure several aspects of patients' experiences and outcomes related to their choice of renal replacement therapy. CHOICE includes a highly demographically diverse sample of patients cared for around the US in urban and rural settings, receiving peritoneal dialysis or in-center hemodialysis. The CHOICE population (initial enrollment in 1995, with ongoing passive follow-up) has more detailed information about comorbidity, laboratory data, process of care, and clinical outcomes than registries and other retrospective data sources, enhancing its benefits for use in effectiveness studies. CHOICE data are linked to the USRDS registry to obtain information on patients' health conditions and healthcare utilization. CHOICE data are also linked to the National Death Index to confirm patients' vital status and cause-specific mortality, which were confirmed with comprehensive chart reviews.

Dialysis Clinic, Inc (DCI)

DCI is the largest non-profit provider of dialysis care and the third largest dialysis provider in the US, serving approximately 13,000 patients at 209 dialysis facilities in 27 states. The population of patients within DCI is diverse and demographically representative of the US dialysis population, with an overrepresentation of African Americans. Information about comorbid conditions, hospitalization dates, oral and intravenous medications, quality of life, and the delivery of care is collected.

### Summary of the KDIGO guideline on anemia and comment: reading between the (guide)line(s) [^112K6LAb]. Kidney International (2012). High credibility.

The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is designed to assist healthcare providers in treating CKD patients with anemia. A guideline is not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one, nor should it be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. It is intended to provide information and to allow the practitioner to make an informed decision, based on evidence and expert judgment. Every healthcare professional making use of these recommendations is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in any particular clinical situation. Owing to the general nature of a guideline, it is sometimes difficult to translate it to an individual patient's condition. As the primary goal is to improve patient care, we have decided to focus on practical clinical aspects of the KDIGO anemia guideline.

### Antiplatelet agents for chronic kidney disease [^114aoceA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet agents are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. The risks and benefits of antiplatelet agents may differ in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where occlusive atherosclerotic events are less prevalent, and bleeding hazards might be increased. This is an update of a review first published in 2013.
- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of antiplatelet agents in people with any form of CKD, including those not receiving renal replacement therapy, patients undergoing any form of dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients.
- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 July 2021 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized controlled trials comparing any antiplatelet agents versus placebo or no treatment, or direct head-to-head antiplatelet agent studies in people with CKD. Studies were included if they enrolled participants with CKD or encompassed broader at-risk populations where data for subgroups with CKD could be disaggregated.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Four authors independently extracted data from primary study reports and any available supplementary information concerning study population, interventions, outcomes, and risks of bias. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for outcomes of interest.

### The use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in patients with CKD and cancer: A clinical approach [^115Qds9R]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have been used to manage anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) to reduce transfusion requirements and alleviate anemia symptoms. The lack of objective benefit in normalizing hemoglobin (Hb) levels, along with increased evidence of ESA-induced complications in individuals with anemia, has resulted in clinicians generally trying to maintain Hb levels in the 10 to 11 g/dL range.

In 2000, concerns arose for patients with cancer, attributing associations of ESA use with increased mortality, thrombotic complications, and cerebrovascular accidents. This led to a change in the US Food and Drug Administration oncology guidelines, limiting the use of ESAs for chemotherapy-induced anemia. However, no specific guidance was provided for individuals with CKD and cancer. Persons with CKD, whether they have remote or active malignancy, should receive the lowest ESA doses possible to achieve a maximum Hb level of 10 g/dL.

Based on available data, while ESAs may promote progression or worsen outcomes in some cancers, there is a lack of evidence to suggest that ESAs increase the likelihood of developing new cancers in patients on dialysis or in earlier stages of CKD.

The baseline Hb values were between 8 to 11 g/dL in the United States (US) and 9 to 12 g/dL outside the US. INNO2VATE-1 (NCT02865850) included patients with incident DD-CKD who initiated dialysis within 16 weeks prior to beginning trial participation and who were ESA-naive, had limited prior ESA use, or were maintained on ESAs. INNO2VATE-2 (NCT02892149) included patients on chronic maintenance dialysis for more than 12 weeks who had converted from prior ESA therapy. In INNO2VATE-1, INNO2VATE-2, and the pooled INNO2VATE program, the median and range of time from initiating dialysis to starting vadadustat was 0.1 (0.01 to 0.4), 2.7 (0.2 to 31.3), and 2.3 (0.01 to 31.3) years, respectively. The pooled population from the two trials ranged from 19 to 93 years of age, with 55.9% male, and included 64.5% Caucasian, 38.5% Hispanic, 24.1% Black (including African Americans), and 4.5% Asian patients. In both trials, Vafseo was non-inferior to darbepoetin alfa in correcting and maintaining Hb levels across geographic-specific target Hb ranges (10 to 11 g/dL in the US and 10 to 12 g/dL outside the US) in adults with DD-CKD at weeks 24 to 36 and weeks 40 to 52.

### Intradialytic administration of daptomycin in end stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis [^115dSnKW]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Infusion of intravenous antibiotics after hemodialysis (HD) may delay the initiation of treatment for the next HD shift. Intradialytic administration of drugs such as vancomycin during the final hour of HD obviates these delays. Daptomycin has potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, but the manufacturer recommends that the dose be infused after HD ends. This study determined the pharmacokinetics of intradialytically dosed daptomycin in patients with ESRD.

This prospective crossover study compared single-dose daptomycin (6 mg/kg, 30-min intravenous infusion) pharmacokinetics administered after HD versus during the last part of HD with high-permeability (HP) and low-permeability (LP) dialyzers to seven patients who had ESRD and were on thrice-weekly HD. Serial blood samples were collected to determine daptomycin serum concentrations and protein binding. Statistical analysis was done using linear mixed model analysis.

The maximum serum concentration observed with a 6 mg/kg post-HD dose was 61.1 ± 7.6 microg/ml with a mean protein binding of 89.2%. Intradialytic daptomycin administration resulted in reduced maximum serum concentration and area under the curve values that were approximately 12 to 20% lower when administered during HD with LP dialyzers and approximately 35% lower with HP dialyzers.

Intradialytic daptomycin administration during the last 30 minutes of HD is feasible, provided that larger dosages are used to compensate for intradialytic drug loss.

### Cancer risk among elderly persons with end-stage renal disease: a population-based case-control study [^115ZAAcu]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have an elevated cancer risk. While cancer risk increases with age, associations of ESRD with specific malignancies are incompletely studied for older individuals.
- **Methods**: We conducted a population-based case-control study involving 1,029,695 cancer cases and 99,610 controls among the U.S. elderly using SEER-Medicare linked data. ESRD was defined as the presence of dialysis claims in the three months prior to selection.
- **Results**: Although ESRD was not associated with excess cancer risk overall (odds ratio 1.02; 95% CI 0.91–1.14), risk was specifically increased for cancers of the stomach (1.45; 1.16–1.81), small intestine (1.92; 1.27–2.92), colon (1.17; 1.00–1.36), liver (1.53; 1.16–2.01), biliary tract (1.78; 1.20–2.65), lung (1.17; 1.02–1.34), cervix (2.12; 1.39–3.23), kidney (2.42; 2.01–2.92), and for multiple myeloma (1.77; 1.40–2.24) and chronic myeloid leukemia (1.74; 1.08–2.80). The association between liver cancer and ESRD was attenuated upon adjustment for hepatitis B and C infection or diabetes mellitus. Multiple myeloma risk was highest with short ESRD duration (p < 0.0001), possibly reflecting reverse causality, while kidney cancer risk showed a borderline rise over time (p = 0.08).
- **Conclusions**: Among elderly individuals with ESRD, the excess risks for some cancers may reflect immune dysfunction or a high prevalence of other risk factors, such as viral infections or diabetes mellitus. Our results underscore the need for studying biological pathways of carcinogenesis in ESRD.

### Vafseo [^115sEGck]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety of Vafseo has not been established for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults not on dialysis, and its use is not recommended in this setting [see Indications and Usage (1)].
- **Serious adverse reactions**: In large clinical trials in adults with anemia of CKD who were not on dialysis (PRO2TECT-1 and PRO2TECT-2), an increased risk of mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, serious acute kidney injury, serious hepatic injury, and serious gastrointestinal erosions was observed in patients treated with Vafseo compared to darbepoetin alfa.
- **Malignancy**: Because increased hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 levels may be associated with unfavorable effects on cancer growth, Vafseo has not been studied and is not recommended in patients with active malignancies. In the INNO2VATE-1 and INNO2VATE-2 clinical trials, malignancies were observed in 2.2% (1.3 per 100 PY) of patients treated with Vafseo and 3.0% (1.8 per 100 PY) of patients treated with darbepoetin alfa. No evidence of increased carcinogenicity was observed in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Cancer risk among elderly persons with end-stage renal disease: a population-based case-control study [^112f63xb]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Of all these cancers, only multiple myeloma showed a significant change in risk with the duration of ESRD. For multiple myeloma, there was a substantial decline with prolonged ESRD, such that risk was highest immediately after the first Medicare claim for dialysis. The odds ratios (ORs) were 3.74 in the 0–12 months, 1.89 in the 12–25 months, 0.89 in the 25–44 months, and 0.79 in the 44+ months after the first claim (p < 0.001). There was a borderline trend of increasing risk of kidney cancer with longer duration of ESRD (ORs 1.85 in the 0–12 months, 1.75 in the 12–25 months, 1.61 in the 25–44 months, and 3.57 in the 44+ months after the first claim, p = 0.08).

We evaluated whether associations with ESRD were affected when we adjusted for the presence of other medical conditions. Adjustment for the presence of obesity did not change the observed associations with ESRD for any cancers (data not shown). Likewise, associations with ESRD were not materially affected when we made the following model-based adjustments (data not shown):

- **Risks of stomach and esophagus cancers**: Adjusted for history of peptic ulcer or pernicious anemia.
- **Risk of colon cancer**: Adjusted for diverticular disease, ulcerative colitis, or regional enteritis.
- **Risks of renal and urinary bladder cancers**: Adjusted for history of kidney disease or hypertension.
- **Risk of biliary tract cancer**: Adjusted for the presence of gallstones.

For liver cancer, the association with ESRD remained significant after adjustment for alcoholic liver disease or hemochromatosis (data not shown).

### Vafseo [^114wAW69]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of VAFSEO, given once daily for the treatment of anemia in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis, were demonstrated in two global, multi-center, randomized, active-controlled, non-inferiority, open-label trials comprising a total of 3,923 patients with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (DD-CKD). These trials, named INNO2VATE-1 and INNO2VATE-2, randomized patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive either VAFSEO, starting at a dose of 300 mg once daily, or darbepoetin alfa, administered subcutaneously or intravenously as per the prescribing information, for 52 weeks to assess the efficacy endpoints.

VAFSEO was titrated in increments of 150 mg up to 600 mg to achieve the target hemoglobin (Hb) level. After 52 weeks, patients continued with the study medication to assess long-term safety until the event-driven major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) endpoints were reached. Efficacy in each study was based on the difference in mean change of Hb from baseline to the primary evaluation period (Weeks 24 to 36). An additional efficacy endpoint was the difference in mean change of Hb from baseline to the secondary evaluation period (Weeks 40 to 52). MACE was defined as all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke, and was evaluated in both trials.

### Higher hemoglobin levels and quality of life in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: No longer a moving target [^115d8Nyb]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

International clinical practice guidelines for the management of anemia in chronic kidney disease suggest target hemoglobin levels ≤ 11.5 g/dl (115 g/l), with individualized consideration of slightly higher hemoglobin targets to improve quality of life. An updated meta-analysis of randomized trials demonstrates no significant improvement in quality of life with erythropoietin-stimulating agent therapy targeting higher hemoglobin levels. Limitations of the available data suggest that individualized targets should nonetheless remain an option in future clinical practice guidelines.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in CKD [^117WjGeS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease provides clinicians with comprehensive evidence-based recommendations to improve patient care. In this commentary, we review these recommendations and the underlying evidence. Most recommendations are well reasoned, although for some, the evidence is unclear, necessitating some qualification.

While the KDIGO guideline stresses the potential risks of intravenous iron therapy, withholding iron might have its own risks. The recommendation to avoid hemoglobin levels falling below 9 g/dL sets a lower bound of "acceptability" that may increase blood transfusion. Given the lack of research supporting the optimal transfusion strategy for end-stage renal disease patients, it is difficult to weigh the risks and benefits of red blood cell transfusion.

We find a paucity of evidence that a hemoglobin concentration targeted between 11 and 11.5 g/dL is associated with a safety risk. Although the evidence that erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use improves patient quality of life is poor, it is possible that the instruments used to measure quality of life may not be well attuned to the needs of chronic kidney disease or dialysis patients.

Our last section focuses specifically on the recommendations to treat anemia in children.

### Daptomycin versus vancomycin for bloodstream infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with a high vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration: A case-control study [^112HQffJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Reports have found a link between vancomycin treatment failure in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections (BSIs) and higher vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), despite MICs being below the susceptibility breakpoint of 2 μg/mL. Consensus guidelines recommend considering the use of alternative agents for infections involving higher vancomycin MICs, although few data support this approach.
- **Methods**: This retrospective case-control study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of vancomycin compared with daptomycin in the treatment of MRSA BSIs with a high vancomycin MIC (i.e. > 1 μg/mL).
- **Results**: A total of 118 vancomycin-treated subjects were compared with 59 daptomycin-treated subjects. Clinical failure, defined as a composite of mortality, microbiologic failure, and/or recurrence of infection, was numerically lower in daptomycin-treated subjects (31% vs. 17%; p = 0.084) and was mainly driven by a lower incidence of mortality in the daptomycin group (20% vs. 9%; p = 0.046). Factors independently associated with clinical failure included acute renal failure (odds ratio [OR], 3.91 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.05–14.56]) and being in the vancomycin treatment group (OR, 3.13 [95% CI, 1.00–9.76]). Right-sided endocarditis was independently associated with clinical success (OR, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.01–0.83]). A comparison of 60-day mortality between vancomycin- and daptomycin-treated subjects found a higher probability of survival in the daptomycin-treated group (P = 0.022).
- **Conclusions**: The results demonstrated that daptomycin was a [text cuts off]

### Management conundrum in a case of renal cell cancer (RCC) on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for recently placed coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) [^117J57FC]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A man in his 50s presented in an emergency with breathlessness and chest discomfort. On evaluation, he was diagnosed with coronary artery disease, with more than 80% narrowing of the right coronary and left circumflex arteries. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and was started on dual antiplatelet (DAPT) therapy. After starting DAPT, the patient developed gross haematuria with a drop in haematocrit. Further evaluation revealed a left renal mass with urinary bladder clots. Because of the risk of stent thrombosis on stopping DAPT, radical nephrectomy was deferred, and the patient underwent left renal artery angioembolisation and bladder clot evacuation. On follow-up, the patient was stable with a gradual decrease in renal mass size, and following a year, the patient underwent definitive surgery. The patient is doing well in 4 years of follow-up with no metastasis.

### Diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease in advanced and end-stage renal disease [^1129Zh21]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

**Des versus BMS**: The choice of the types of stents used for PCI in patients with CKD and ESRD presents a clinical dilemma. Compared with patients with normal renal function, restenosis rates in patients with CKD and ESRD are significantly higher. Several studies have shown that the implantation of a DES is associated with lower rates of target vessel revascularization compared to patients who receive a BMS. Nevertheless, the risk of restenosis with a DES in patients with ESRD compared to patients with normal renal function is still higher. A randomized multicenter study evaluating the efficacy of everolimus-eluting stents versus BMS of identical size and implanted in the same patient showed a reduction in ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization in patients with CKD who received DES. However, it is important to note that a BMS may be preferred in patients in whom renal transplantation is planned within 6 to 12 months, such as those planned to receive living donor transplants, to limit the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). More novel stents that are polymer- and carrier-free but are drug-coated have been shown to be superior to BMS with respect to requiring target vessel revascularization on only 1 month of DAPT. This type of stent confers the benefit of a DES with an improved safety profile over a BMS, with the additional advantage of a short course of DAPT, which may be ideal for patients with ESRD. Aggressive medical therapy is also an option, given the high restenosis rates in patients with CKD.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: A short case series [^112WXoKc]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

As determined using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, CKD 2 is defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m², CKD 3 as a GFR of 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m², and CKD 4–5 as a GFR of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

Follow-up durations include a microbiologic assessment (urine culture) at approximately 3 days, with clinical assessments up to approximately 7 days post-treatment.
- **Use of unusually high per-weight dose**: This was recommended by the infectious disease (ID) specialist for the concomitant management of Staphylococcus spp. bacteremia. An ID consultation led to a clinical decision to treat every 24 hours rather than every 48 hours for more rapid results in this patient.

The daptomycin-based courses of antibiotic treatment achieved clinical cure and successful eradication of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in all patients in this representative sample of a diverse patient population in our medical facility. Indwelling catheters are common sites of infection, and similar results of daptomycin treatment were observed in patients with and without Foley catheters. Daptomycin was effective at eradicating VRE in patients regardless of whether they had had previous urinary tract infections (UTIs). Additionally, daptomycin eradicated VRE regardless of the level of renal function. Overall, daptomycin was well-tolerated, and there were no reports of adverse events such as alteration of kidney function, muscle weakness or pain, and elevated levels of CPK enzymes included in the study.

For most patients, CPK levels were measured at the time of daptomycin therapy initiation and once or twice more in the next 7 to 10 days. Even for the patient receiving the highest dose (13 mg/kg, patient 3), no elevation was observed above the normal CPK range.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116zSyq8]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically in relation to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend targeting hemoglobin levels between 100 and 120 g/L in adults, young patients, and children aged ≥ 2 years. This applies to both patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those receiving dialysis on ESA therapy.

### Daptomycin in the treatment of bacteremia [^113sRWzv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical experience with daptomycin in the treatment of bacteremia. Patients with a diagnosis of catheter-related or non-catheter-related bacteremia and no other concurrent infections were identified from the Cubicin Outcomes Registry and Experience (CORE) 2004. Treatment success was determined by investigators using protocol criteria and defined as cure or improvement.

Of 168 patients with bacteremia, 126 were clinically evaluable. Of those, 52 (41%) patients were aged 66 years or older, 54 (43%) received daptomycin in an intensive care unit, and 25 (20%) had chronic renal failure. The most common pathogens isolated were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (33%), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (30%), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (30%).

Among the 126 patients, 86% received daptomycin after previous antibiotic therapy, and most (69%) received concomitant antibiotics with daptomycin. Daptomycin therapy was initiated at a median dose of 4.0 mg/kg (range, 2.5 to 9.2 mg/kg). The overall clinical success rate of daptomycin therapy was 89%. Clinical success was independent of baseline renal function, daptomycin dose, pathogen, first-line use, or concomitant antibiotic therapy.

These results support the findings of a recent study in which daptomycin was demonstrated to be an effective option in the treatment of S. aureus bacteremia. The data provide insight into the clinical experience using daptomycin to treat bacteremia caused by other gram-positive pathogens. Given the limitations of retrospective studies, further research is warranted to substantiate these findings.

### Aranesp [^116okFQs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When treating patients who have chronic kidney disease and cancer, physicians should refer to Warnings and Precautions (5.1 and 5.2).
- **Conversion from epoetin alfa to Aranesp in patients with CKD on dialysis**: Aranesp is administered less frequently than epoetin alfa. Administer Aranesp once weekly in patients who were receiving epoetin alfa 2 to 3 times weekly. Administer Aranesp once every 2 weeks in patients who were receiving epoetin alfa once weekly. Estimate the starting weekly dose of Aranesp for adults and pediatric patients on the basis of the weekly epoetin alfa dose at the time of substitution (see Table 1). Maintain the route of administration (intravenous or subcutaneous injection).

	- For pediatric patients receiving a weekly epoetin alfa dose of < 1,500 Units/week, the available data are insufficient to determine an Aranesp conversion dose.
- **Conversion from epoetin alfa to Aranesp in patients with CKD not on dialysis**: Refer to Table 1. The dose conversion depicted in Table 1 does not accurately estimate the once monthly dose of Aranesp.
- **Patients on cancer chemotherapy**: Initiate Aranesp in patients on cancer chemotherapy only if the hemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL, and if there is a minimum of two additional months of planned chemotherapy. Use the lowest dose of Aranesp necessary to avoid RBC transfusions.

	- **Recommended starting dose**: The recommended starting dose and schedules are:
		- 2.25 mcg/kg every week subcutaneously until completion of a chemotherapy course.
		- 500 mcg every 3 weeks subcutaneously until completion of a chemotherapy course.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using Monte Carlo simulation [^116RWgSh]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

This present study also used the previously developed "virtual TDM" technique to mimic the clinical situation and further guide the subsequent dosing for clinicians. The MCS analysis indicated that targeting pre-dialysis concentrations of 20–24 mg/L after one week of our recommended initial regimens would attain and maintain an AUC 24h ≥ 400 mg∙h/L for the following week in most simulated patients with 10 different HHD. Thus, virtual TDM was designed to target a pre-dialysis concentration of 24 mg/L to ensure the target attainment in virtual patients with all simulated HHD settings. This pre-dialysis concentration target may result in a slightly higher new MD than necessary in some HHD settings. For example, the adjusted MD after TDM using this target pre-dialysis concentration in 3-hour HHD occurring 5 times a week resulted in the target (AUC 24h ≥ 400 mg∙h/L) attainment in almost all virtual patients, but a higher proportion of patients had AUC 24h ≥ 600 mg∙h/L. However, this pre-dialysis concentration of 24 mg/L was found to be the best predictor for attaining targets in all simulated HHD settings.

This target pre-dialysis concentration of 24 mg/L is also higher than those (15–20 mg/L) recommended in patients receiving thrice-weekly IHD in the vancomycin consensus guidelines. Of note, this guideline recommendation is based on another MCS study showing that pre-dialysis vancomycin concentrations of 10–20 mg/L would result in a mean AUC 24h from 250 to 450 mg·h/L in patients receiving thrice-weekly IHD. The mean new TDM-based vancomycin MD in all HHD settings were not significantly different.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^113cf2UM]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Treatment of anaemia - Erythropoiesis stimulating agents**: We recommend that treatment with Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) should be offered to patients with anaemia of CKD who are likely to benefit in terms of quality of life and physical function and to avoid blood transfusion, especially in patients considered suitable for transplantation (1B).
- **Audit measure**: Proportion of patients on renal replacement therapy (on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for more than 3 months) with Hb level < 100 g/L who are not prescribed an ESA.
- **Rationale**: Treatment of anaemia in CKD with ESA can be expensive, takes time to work, and carries a small but significant risk to the patient. It is therefore reasonable, as with any therapy, to treat only those who are expected to benefit in the timeframe that therapy is being considered. For example, patients with severe sepsis, inflammation, or acute bleeding are unlikely to respond. Patients with a very short life expectancy (days or weeks) are not likely to survive long enough for therapy to provide a benefit in terms of an increase in Hb. The clinician and patient should agree on a therapeutic plan and, at an appropriate time, review whether therapy is providing enough benefit to continue treatment.
- **Treatment of anaemia - Choice of ESA**: We recommend that the decision on the choice of ESA is based on local availability of ESAs (1B).
- **Audit measure**: Each renal unit should audit the type, route, and frequency of administration and weekly dose of ESA prescribed.
- **Rationale**: Many studies have been published co

### Retacrit [^113ZqoMV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For pediatric patients with CKD: initiate RETACRIT treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL. If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 12 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of RETACRIT. The recommended starting dose for pediatric patients (ages 1 month or older) is 50 Units/kg, administered three times weekly either intravenously or subcutaneously. When treating patients who have chronic kidney disease and cancer, physicians should refer to warnings and precautions (sections 5.1 and 5.2).
- **Zidovudine-treated patients with HIV infection**:
	- **Starting dose**: The recommended starting dose in adults is 100 Units/kg, to be administered intravenously or subcutaneously three times per week.
	- **Dose adjustment**: If hemoglobin does not increase after 8 weeks of therapy, increase the RETACRIT dose by approximately 50 to 100 Units/kg at 4- to 8-week intervals until hemoglobin reaches a level necessary to avoid RBC transfusions or 300 Units/kg. Withhold RETACRIT if hemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dL. Resume therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose when hemoglobin declines to less than 11 g/dL. Discontinue RETACRIT if an increase in hemoglobin is not achieved at a dose of 300 Units/kg for 8 weeks.

### Prostate specific antigen levels and prostate cancer detection rates in patients with end stage renal disease [^111EmYy3]. The Journal of Urology (2012). High credibility.

Patients with end stage renal disease plus prostate cancer are ineligible to receive a renal transplant at most centers until an acceptable cancer-free period is demonstrated. To our knowledge, previously established prostate specific antigen reference ranges have not been validated in patients with end stage renal disease. We determined age-stratified 95th percentile prostate specific antigen reference ranges and the prostate cancer detection rate at specific prostate specific antigen intervals for these patients.
- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 775 male patients with end stage renal disease on the waiting list for a renal transplant who had undergone a serum prostate specific antigen test. Prostate specific antigen was stratified by age at the time of the blood test, and 95th percentile reference ranges were calculated for each decade. A total of 80 patients underwent prostate biopsy for increased prostate specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination. The cancer detection rate was calculated for specific prostate specific antigen reference ranges.
- **Results**: The age-specific 95th percentile prostate specific antigen reference ranges were 0 to 4.0 ng/ml for ages 40 to 49 in 137 patients, 0 to 5.3 ng/ml for ages 50 to 59 in 257 patients, 0 to 10.5 ng/ml for ages 60 to 69 in 265 patients, and 0 to 16.6 ng/ml for ages 70 to 79 years in 69 patients. The cancer detection rate was 44%, 38%, and 67% for prostate specific antigen levels of 2.5 to 4.0, 4 to 10, and greater than 10 ng/ml, respectively.
