## Question

paratyphoid B

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Paratyphoid B, including its epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostics, treatment, prevention, and public health implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the microbiology and nomenclature to anchor the entity. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and transmission patterns. Next, I will review clinical manifestations and severity. After that, I need to examine diagnostic strategies and their limitations. Then, I should appraise antimicrobial resistance and treatment options, including empiric choices. Finally, I will consider prevention, public health management, and special populations, and close with a concise synthesis and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the microbiology and nomenclature so I don't misclassify the pathogen. Paratyphoid B is caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi B, one of the human-restricted typhoidal Salmonella serovars that cause enteric fever; historically, some isolates labeled "Paratyphi B" were actually non-typhoidal Salmonella serovar Java, which causes gastroenteritis rather than enteric fever, so I need to ensure we are discussing the typhoidal Paratyphi B and not the non-typhoidal variant when discussing systemic illness and carriage [^113nnopJ] [^117PjZLG].

> I will now examine the epidemiology and transmission to frame risk and prevention. Paratyphoid B is less common than Paratyphi A globally, with most cases in endemic regions of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa; in non-endemic settings, cases are predominantly travel-associated, and person-to-person transmission is uncommon but documented, including a pediatric cluster in England with close genetic relatedness by WGS, which underscores the potential for local transmission from carriers and the need to consider paratyphoid even without travel history in the right epidemiologic context [^113nnopJ] [^1156tyUD] [^1168C53b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity; I should review clinical manifestations carefully. Paratyphoid B typically presents with insidious fever, malaise, headache, anorexia, abdominal discomfort, and may include relative bradycardia, hepatosplenomegaly, and rose spots; diarrhea is more common in children than adults, and the overall syndrome is clinically indistinguishable from typhoid, though some series suggest paratyphoid may be milder on average, which could reflect ascertainment bias rather than true biology [^113nnopJ] [^1168C53b] [^1112m4kc].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach because sensitivity matters for timely management. Blood culture remains the reference standard but has limited sensitivity, roughly 40–80% depending on timing, inoculum, and prior antibiotics; bone marrow culture increases sensitivity to 80–95% but is invasive and impractical in many settings; stool and urine cultures are less sensitive, and serologic tests like Widal are not recommended due to poor accuracy; rapid diagnostic tests exist but most detect only S. Typhi and have only moderate sensitivity/specificity, so a negative RDT does not exclude paratyphoid, and clinicians should prioritize culture while recognizing that multiple samples may be needed [^113nnopJ] [^111NRyKo] [^116F556V] [^1125xWDy].

> I need to check antimicrobial resistance patterns before recommending empiric therapy. Fluoroquinolone resistance is common in South Asia and increasingly elsewhere, and nalidixic acid resistance correlates with reduced ciprofloxacin susceptibility; multidrug resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole varies by region; emerging ceftriaxone resistance has been reported in some regions, so empiric choices must be anchored to local epidemiology and travel history while awaiting susceptibilities [^113nnopJ] [^112yyKTb] [^111fbKRH].

> Let me consider first-line treatment options and their trade-offs, and I should double-check pediatric data. For uncomplicated disease, azithromycin is a reasonable oral option with supportive evidence, particularly in settings with fluoroquinolone resistance; for severe or hospitalized cases, parenteral ceftriaxone is standard; fluoroquinolones may still be used where local susceptibility is confirmed, but caution is warranted in South Asia due to resistance; duration is typically 7–14 days depending on severity and response, and treatment failure should prompt reassessment for resistance, complications, or alternative diagnoses [^113nnopJ] [^111EmmcE] [^111VJrTk] [^1125xWDy].

> But wait, what if the patient is a returned traveler from a region with XDR strains; I should verify empiric guidance. For travelers returning from Iraq or Pakistan where ceftriaxone resistance is more common, azithromycin is preferred for uncomplicated illness and a carbapenem may be needed for complicated disease; for other regions, ceftriaxone or azithromycin remain appropriate empiric choices while cultures are pending, with de-escalation once susceptibilities return [^1125xWDy].

> Next, I should review prevention, because treatment alone will not control transmission. Safe food and water practices and hand hygiene are foundational; typhoid conjugate vaccines reduce typhoid burden but do not protect against Paratyphi, so travelers should be vaccinated against typhoid and counseled that paratyphoid risk remains; there is no licensed paratyphoid vaccine, though candidates are in development, which reinforces the primacy of WASH and careful food choices in endemic travel [^113nnopJ] [^1168C53b] [^113psxCZ].

> I will now examine public health management and carrier clearance, and I need to ensure I align with non-endemic guidance. In non-endemic settings, public health authorities should investigate non-travel cases for potential carriers or unrecognized transmission chains; clearance testing with repeated stool cultures is recommended after treatment, and chronic carriers may require prolonged eradication therapy; targeted screening of close contacts and food handlers is prudent in certain contexts, consistent with risk-based public health algorithms [^116xwbyo] [^1116Yf5N].

> Let me think about special populations and complications so I don't miss high-risk scenarios. Children can develop severe disease and complications such as intestinal perforation, hemorrhage, encephalopathy, and cholecystitis, particularly when diagnosis and treatment are delayed; immunocompromised patients, including those on anti-TNF therapy, are at increased risk of invasive and disseminated infection and warrant aggressive evaluation and management; chronic carriage is more likely with biliary disease and can perpetuate transmission, necessitating longer eradication regimens and, in select cases, cholecystectomy [^113nnopJ] [^117F7YHL] [^114kpjrZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the incubation period for paratyphoid B was uniformly 7–14 days like typhoid, but I should verify that nuance. While many authoritative sources describe a 7–14 day incubation for enteric fever broadly, CDC notes paratyphoid incubation can be shorter, approximately 1–10 days, so I should acknowledge that range and counsel patients accordingly while recognizing clinical overlap with typhoid [^113nnopJ] [^113uePBB].

> To synthesize, Paratyphoid B is a human-restricted typhoidal Salmonella infection that is less common than Paratyphi A but clinically similar to typhoid, with transmission via contaminated food and water and occasional person-to-person spread; diagnosis relies on culture with awareness of limited sensitivity, empiric therapy should be guided by travel history and local resistance patterns with azithromycin or ceftriaxone as core options, and prevention hinges on WASH and typhoid vaccination with counseling that paratyphoid risk persists; vigilance for chronic carriage and public health follow-up are essential to interrupt transmission and reduce morbidity [^113nnopJ] [^1168C53b] [^1125xWDy].

---

Paratyphoid B is a **human-restricted Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi B** infection causing enteric fever [^113nnopJ], with transmission via the fecal–oral route through contaminated water or food [^117RwXGj]. It presents with **insidious fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, and gastrointestinal symptoms** [^1168C53b]; complications include intestinal perforation, hemorrhage, and chronic carriage [^115QpABy]. Diagnosis relies on **blood culture** (sensitivity 40–80%) [^111NRyKo] and bone marrow for higher yield [^1125xWDy]; stool/urine cultures are less sensitive [^1125xWDy]. Treatment is with **azithromycin, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin** (if susceptible) [^113nnopJ], guided by local resistance patterns [^111VJrTk]; resistance to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins is rising [^111fbKRH]. Prevention depends on safe water, sanitation, hygiene, and typhoid vaccination [^113D8oys]; there is **no licensed paratyphoid vaccine** [^113nnopJ], though candidates are in development [^1119y3ag].

---

## Epidemiology and transmission

Paratyphoid B is **endemic in regions with poor sanitation and unsafe water**, particularly in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa [^notfound]. Transmission is primarily via the **fecal–oral route** through contaminated drinking water, food prepared with unsafe water, and poor hand hygiene [^117RwXGj]. Chronic carriers are important reservoirs and can shed bacteria for months to years, perpetuating transmission [^114kpjrZ].

---

## Clinical presentation

The clinical presentation of paratyphoid B is similar to typhoid fever, characterized by:

- **Insidious onset**: Gradual fever over 3–7 days, malaise, headache, and myalgia [^113nnopJ].
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, nausea, and vomiting [^1168C53b].
- **Relative bradycardia**: Slower heart rate than expected for the degree of fever [^1112m4kc].
- **Rose spots**: Transient, blanching maculopapular rash on the trunk [^1125xWDy].
- **Hepatosplenomegaly**: Enlargement of liver and spleen [^1168C53b].

Complications can be severe, including **intestinal perforation, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, encephalopathy, and chronic carriage** [^1112m4kc].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis of paratyphoid B relies on laboratory confirmation:

- **Blood culture**: Sensitivity 40–80%, highest in the first week of illness [^111NRyKo].
- **Bone marrow culture**: Higher sensitivity (80–95%), useful in chronic or complicated cases [^1125xWDy].
- **Stool and urine cultures**: Less sensitive but useful in chronic carriers [^114kpjrZ].
- **Serological tests**: Widal test is non-specific and not recommended for diagnosis [^1125xWDy].

---

## Treatment

Effective antibiotic therapy is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. Recommended regimens include:

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Azithromycin | First-line oral therapy | Effective against multidrug-resistant strains [^112S3G8w] |
| Ceftriaxone | Severe or complicated cases | Intravenous therapy [^111VJrTk] |
| Ciprofloxacin | Susceptible strains | Increasing resistance limits use [^112pKjUn] |

---

Antibiotic selection should be guided by **local resistance patterns** and **antimicrobial susceptibility testing** [^113nnopJ].

---

## Prevention

Prevention of paratyphoid B focuses on **improving water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure** [^113D8oys] and **implementing vaccination strategies**. Typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) are recommended by WHO for endemic regions, but they do not provide protection against paratyphoid B [^111fbKRH]. Research is ongoing to develop effective paratyphoid vaccines [^1119y3ag].

---

## Antimicrobial resistance

Antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern in paratyphoid B, with increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins reported globally [^notfound]. This resistance complicates treatment and necessitates **ongoing surveillance** and **development of new therapeutic options** [^1139gzhB].

---

Paratyphoid B is a significant public health concern, particularly in regions with poor sanitation and unsafe water. Effective management requires accurate diagnosis, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and robust prevention strategies, including improved WASH infrastructure and vaccination efforts [^113nnopJ].

### Salmonella paratyphi B; public health and parental choice: when to treat asymptomatic carriers of infection? [^1156tyUD]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Salmonella Paratyphi B (Paratyphoid B) is a rare infection and a notifiable disease in England. Disease is typically mild, and chronic carriage in children has been described in endemic countries. Almost all cases in England are imported, with very few cases of community transmission reported.

Methods

The aim of this work was to describe an unusual cluster of Paratyphoid B cases transmitted within England, examining clinical, epidemiologic and microbiologic data. Detailed phylogenetic analysis is presented to corroborate public health epidemiologic links between cases.

Results

One child had recently returned from an endemic area and had mild gastrointestinal symptoms. One year later, 2 other children with no travel history developed invasive disease requiring hospitalization. Epidemiologic links confirmed person-to-person spread between these three cases. All isolates of S. Paratyphi B (n = 93) received by the Gastrointestinal Bacteria Reference Unit between 2014 and 2019 were typed using whole genome sequencing. Three cases of Paratyphoid B were identified in the same geographical location over a 2-year period. S. Paratyphi B strains isolated from the stool and blood of the three cases were closely linked (0–5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms) using whole genome sequencing.

Conclusions

This case series highlights the potential public health risks of paratyphoid B and the range of pediatric complications associated with this illness, especially in younger children. Although rare, chronic carriage of Paratyphoid B can lead to transmission in nonendemic areas and should be considered in all children presenting with signs of enteric fever even where there is no history of foreign travel.

### Enteric (typhoid and paratyphoid) fever [^113nnopJ]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Enteric fever, caused by the human-restricted bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (typhoid) and Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A, B, and C (paratyphoid), affects persons residing in, or travelling from, areas lacking safe water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure. Transmission is by the faecal-oral route. A gradual fever onset over 3–7 days with malaise, headache, and myalgia is typical. Symptoms can be altered by previous antimicrobial use. Life-threatening complications can arise in the second week of untreated illness. Differentiation from other febrile illnesses is challenging. Blood or bone marrow culture remain reference standard diagnostic methods, despite the low sensitivity of blood culture. Azithromycin, ciprofloxacin (excepting cases originating in south Asia due to drug resistance), or ceftriaxone are recommended treatment options for both typhoid and paratyphoid; however, choice should be guided by local resistance patterns. Ciprofloxacin-resistant and ceftriaxone-resistant typhoid is common in Pakistan. Three vaccine types are available for prevention of typhoid disease, including the newer, more effective typhoid Vi-conjugate vaccines. Vaccination as well as water, sanitation, and hygiene measures are cornerstones of prevention.

### Epidemiology of typhoid and paratyphoid: implications for vaccine policy [^117G98Wp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Typhoid and paratyphoid, collectively known as enteric fever, are among the most common bacterial causes of morbidity worldwide, with the greatest burden in low- and middle-income countries. Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi (Salmonella Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid, is estimated to cause about 12 million illnesses and 128 000 deaths, and Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi (Salmonella Paratyphi) A, B, and C, the causative agents of paratyphoid, are estimated to cause 4 million illnesses and 25 000 deaths annually. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) in settings with high burdens and prequalified the first TCV. There is no vaccine for paratyphoid. Countries are now facing important decisions regarding vaccine target groups and introduction strategies that require contemporary and locally relevant epidemiological data. Current estimates are primarily derived from sporadic, historical studies, and suffer from coarse geographical and temporal resolutions.

For effective implementation of the TCV, important questions regarding typhoid and paratyphoid epidemiology remain to be answered. For decades, typhoid was not considered severe enough in children under 2 years old to warrant treatment or hospitalization. A few recent studies identified typhoid in young children, but severity in this age group remains largely unknown. With the widespread use of antibiotics, case fatality rates and severe consequences of enteric fever, like intestinal perforation and peritonitis, have decreased significantly. With low numbers of obvious, severe clinical outcomes, evaluating severity in endemic countries is difficult, yet necessary for informed policy decisions.

Typhoid and paratyphoid are considered a single disease, with the management of paratyphoid based on lessons learned from typhoid studies; yet, data on severities of illnesses from paratyphoid versus typhoid are conflicting. This is of specific interest in light of recent reports of increasing trends of paratyphoid from several countries, most of which have limited data sets. Most epidemiological data are obtained from hospital inpatient departments (IPD), but in endemic countries, a large number of patients seek care and are treated at outpatient departments (OPD).

### The global burden of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2017 [^115QpABy]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, collectively referred to as enteric fever, are caused by systemic infection with Salmonella enterica subspecies serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A, B, and C. Whereas most non-typhoidal Salmonella spp infections typically produce diarrhoeal illness and less commonly cause bloodstream infection, typhoid and paratyphoid infections produce primarily bacteraemic febrile illnesses, with prolonged high fever, headache, and malaise being characteristic symptoms. Without effective treatment, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers can lead to altered mental states (termed the typhoid state), ileus, gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation, septic shock, and death. Typhoid and paratyphoid infections are relatively common in countries with poor water supply and sanitation, especially south Asia, southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, where they are a major cause of death and disability, especially among children.,

With growing antimicrobial resistance, and intensifying conversations around typhoid vaccine policy, accurate and detailed estimates of enteric fever burden are required. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) of WHO convened in October, 2017, and recommended the use of typhoid conjugate vaccines in children between 6 months and 2 years of age, with a catch-up campaign for children up to 15 years of age, where possible, and WHO prequalified the first typhoid conjugate vaccine in December, 2017. These developments give typhoid-endemic, low-income countries priority access and funding for the vaccine and could make vaccines increasingly accessible. However, data to support their introduction remain sparse.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed for "("typhoid" OR "paratyphoid" OR "typhi" OR "paratyphi") AND ("burden" OR "estimates" OR "model")", with no restrictions placed on date of publication or language. We identified global (or near-global) estimates of enteric fever incidence, ranging from 12 million to 27 million cases annually. Estimates of mortality ranged from 129 000 to 223 000 deaths. Most previous studies assumed a case fatality of 1%, whereas one study estimated a case fatality range of 0·4% to 2·1%. Only previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) have reported estimates of temporal trends and health gap metrics for typhoid and paratyphoid fevers separately.

### Typhoid and paratyphoid fever: a call to action [^1112m4kc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

THE DISEASE AND PATHOGENESIS

Typhoid fever is caused by infection with S. enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhi (S. Typhi), a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacillus. Paratyphoid fever results from infection with the related organism S. enterica subspecies enterica serovar paratyphi (S. Paratyphi), which is divided into three subtypes – S. Paratyphi A, B, and C. S. Typhi and Paratyphi are collectively referred to as typhoidal Salmonella serovars and infection with either can result in the clinical syndrome of enteric fever. Unlike other S. enterica serovars, S. Typhi, and Paratyphi are human-restricted pathogens that cause a systemic illness progressing to an asymptomatic chronic carrier state in some individuals.

Transmission of S. Typhi and Paratyphi occurs through consumption of contaminated food or water via short-cycle or long-cycle transmission. Short-cycle transmission is defined as the contamination of food and water in the immediate environment through inadequate hygiene and sanitation measures, either by shedding from acute or chronic carriers. Long-cycle transmission is defined as contamination of the broader environment, such as pollution of water supplies by sewage, or inadequate treatment of piped water. The relative contribution of each transmission mode may vary depending on the epidemiological context and may differ between S. Typhi and Paratyphi.

The clinical presentation of typhoid fever is highly variable, ranging from a mild-illness characterized by low-grade fever and malaise, through to a severe life-threatening systemic illness with multiple complications, including intestinal perforation, intestinal hemorrhage, and encephalopathy. Ingestion of bacteria and systemic invasion is followed by a short-lived period of asymptomatic primary bacteraemia. The incubation period, typically lasts 7–14 days, but can range from 3 to 60 days dependent, in part, on the size of the inoculum. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and include fever, malaise, anorexia, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and dry cough. Sporadic, asymptomatic, shedding of the bacteria in the stool can occur prior to the development of symptomatic disease. Clinical signs may include high fever, relative bradycardia, abdominal tenderness, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or rose-spots. S. Paratyphi may cause a milder disease than S. Typhi, although field data from the largest case series to-date, comprising 609 enteric fever patients in Nepal suggest that both serovars cause an indistinguishable clinical syndrome.

### Redefining typhoid diagnosis: what would an improved test need to look like? [^116TAGmK]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Typhoid fever is one of the most common bacterial causes of acute febrile illness in the developing world, with an estimated 10.9million new cases and 116.8 thousand deaths in 2017. Typhoid point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests are widely used but have poor sensitivity and specificity, resulting in antibiotic overuse that has led to the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant strains. With recent advances in typhoid surveillance and detection, this is the ideal time to produce a target product profile (TPP) that guides product development and ensure that a next-generation test meets the needs of users in the resource-limited settings where typhoid is endemic.

Methods

A structured literature review was conducted to develop a draft TPP for a next-generation typhoid diagnostic test with minimal and optimal desired characteristics for 36 test parameters. The TPP was refined using feedback collected from a Delphi survey of key stakeholders in clinical medicine, microbiology, diagnostics and public and global health.

Results

A next-generation typhoid diagnostic test should improve patient management through the diagnosis and treatment of infection with acute Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi or Paratyphi with a sensitivity ≥ 90%and specificity ≥ 95%. The test would ideally be used at the lowest level of the healthcare system in settings without a reliable power or water supply and provide results in < 15min at a cost of < US$1.00.

Conclusion

This report outlines the first comprehensive TPP for typhoid fever and is intended to guide the development of a next-generation typhoid diagnostic test. An accurate POC test will reduce the morbidity and mortality of typhoid fever through rapid diagnosis and treatment and will have the greatest impact in reducing antimicrobial resistance if it is combined with diagnostics for other causes of acute febrile illness in a treatment algorithm.

### Fluoroquinolones for treating typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever) [^111VJrTk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Typhoid and paratyphoid are febrile illnesses, due to a bacterial infection, which remain common in many low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends the fluoroquinolone antibiotics in areas with known resistance to the older first-line antibiotics.

Objectives

To evaluate fluoroquinolone antibiotics for treating children and adults with enteric fever.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register (February 2011); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 2); MEDLINE (1966 to February 2011); EMBASE (1974 to February 2011); and LILACS (1982 to February 2011). We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) in February 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials examining fluoroquinolone antibiotics, in people with blood, stool or bone marrow culture-confirmed enteric fever.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the trial's methodological quality and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Comparative effectiveness has been interpreted in the context of; length of treatment, dose, year of study, known levels of antibiotic resistance, or proxy measures of resistance such as the failure rate in the comparator arm.

Main Results

Twenty-six studies, involving 3033 patients, are included in this review. Fluoroquinolones versus older antibiotics (chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, amoxicillin and ampicillin)In one study from Pakistan in 2003–04, high clinical failure rates were seen with both chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole, although resistance was not confirmed microbiologically. A seven-day course of either ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin were found to be superior. Older studies of these comparisons failed to show a difference (six trials, 361 participants). In small studies conducted almost two decades ago, the fluoroquinolones were demonstrated to have fewer clinical failures than ampicillin and amoxicillin (two trials, 90 participants, RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.57). Fluoroquinolones versus current second-line options (ceftriaxone, cefalexin, and azithromycin)The two studies comparing a seven day course of oral fluoroquinolones with three days of intravenous ceftriaxone were too small to detect important differences between antibiotics should they exist (two trials, 89 participants). In Pakistan in 2003–04, no clinical or microbiological failures were seen with seven days of either ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin or cefixime (one trial, 139 participants). In Nepal in 2005, gatifloxacin reduced clinical failure and relapse compared to cefixime, despite a high prevalence of NaR in the study population (one trial, 158 participants, RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.31). Compared to a seven day course of azithromycin, a seven day course of ofloxacin had a higher rate of clinical failures in populations with both multi-drug resistance (MDR) and nalidixic acid resistance (NaR) enteric fever in Vietnam in 1998–2002 (two trials, 213 participants, RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.94). However, a more recent study from Vietnam in 2004–05, detected no difference between gatifloxacin and azithromycin with both drugs performing well (one trial, 287 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Generally, fluoroquinolones performed well in treating typhoid, and maybe superior to alternatives in some settings. However, we were unable to draw firm general conclusions on comparative contemporary effectiveness given that resistance changes over time, and many studies were small. Policy makers and clinicians need to consider local resistance patterns in choosing a fluoroquinolone or alternative. There is some evidence that the newest fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin, remains effective in some regions where resistance to older fluoroquinolones has developed. However, the different fluoroquinolones have not been compared directly in trials in these settings.

### Typhoid and paratyphoid fever [^114J35Wz]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Typhoid fever is estimated to have caused 21.6 million illnesses and 216,500 deaths globally in 2000, affecting all ages. There is also one case of paratyphoid fever for every four of typhoid. The global emergence of multidrug-resistant strains and of strains with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones is of great concern. We discuss the occurrence of poor clinical response to fluoroquinolones despite disc sensitivity. Developments are being made in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis, and genomic and proteomic studies reveal the possibility of new targets for diagnosis and treatment. Further, we review guidelines for use of diagnostic tests and for selection of antimicrobials in varying clinical situations. The importance of safe water, sanitation, and immunisation in the presence of increasing antibiotic resistance is paramount. Routine immunisation of school-age children with Vi or Ty21a vaccine is recommended for countries endemic for typhoid. Vi vaccine should be used for 2–5 year-old children in highly endemic settings.

### The challenge of enteric fever [^113YnLAG]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Enteric fever, a non-specific, systemic infection caused by S. Typhi or Paratyphi A, B or C, is common in resource-limited regions of the world, where poor sanitation infrastructure facilitates faeco-oral transmission. Prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics minimises illness severity, but presentation to health care facilities is often delayed because of the non-specific nature of the symptoms and the lack of reliable diagnostic tests. Disease prevention requires significant investment in provision of clean water and sanitation in the long term; vaccination offers a more realistic strategy for medium term control. However, implementation of existing vaccines and development of more efficacious vaccines has been hindered by the lack of an established correlate of protection and under appreciation of the true disease burden. Human microbial infection studies could provide a vehicle for the rapid evaluation of novel vaccines and investigation of the immunobiology of enteric infection.

### WITHDRAWN: azithromycin for treating uncomplicated typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever) [^116RhU6u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Review status: Current question - no update intended. Azithromycin treatments are included in the review: Fluoroquinolones for treating typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever). (Thaver D, Zaidi AKM, Critchley JA, Azmatullah A, Madni SA, Bhutta ZA. Fluoroquinolones for treating typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever). Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2008, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD004530. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004530.pub3.) This latter review is being updated, and will be published in late 2011. Enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fever) is potentially fatal. Infection with drug-resistant strains of the causative organism Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi or Paratyphi increases morbidity and mortality. Azithromycin may have better outcomes in people with uncomplicated forms of the disease.

Objectives

To compare azithromycin with other antibiotics for treating uncomplicated enteric fever.

Search Strategy

In August 2008, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and mRCT. We also searched conference proceedings, reference lists, and contacted researchers and a pharmaceutical company.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing azithromycin with other antibiotics for treating children and adults with uncomplicated enteric fever confirmed by cultures of S. Typhi or Paratyphi in blood and/or stool.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Dichotomous data were presented and compared using the odds ratio, and continuous data were reported as arithmetic means with standard deviations and were combined using the mean difference (MD). Both were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Seven trials involving 773 participants met the inclusion criteria. The trials used adequate methods to generate the allocation sequence and conceal allocation, and were open label. Three trials exclusively included adults, two included children, and two included both adults and children; all were hospital inpatients. One trial evaluated azithromycin against chloramphenicol and did not demonstrate a difference for any outcome (77 participants, 1 trial). When compared with fluoroquinolones in four trials, azithromycin significantly reduced clinical failure (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.89; 564 participants, 4 trials) and duration of hospital stay (MD -1.04 days, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.34 days; 213 participants, 2 trials); all four trials included people with multiple-drug-resistant or nalidixic acid-resistant strains of S. Typhi or S. Paratyphi. We detected no statistically significant difference in the other outcomes. Compared with ceftriaxone, azithromycin significantly reduced relapse (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.70; 132 participants, 2 trials) and not other outcome measures. Few adverse events were reported, and most were mild and self limiting.

Authors' Conclusions

Azithromycin appears better than fluoroquinolone drugs in populations that included participants with drug-resistant strains. Azithromycin may perform better than ceftriaxone.

### Fluoroquinolones for treating typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever) [^116FFqea]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Fluoroquinolones are recommended as first-line therapy for typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever), but how they compare with other antibiotics and different fluoroquinolones is unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate fluoroquinolone antibiotics for treating enteric fever in children and adults compared with other antibiotics, different fluoroquinolones, and different durations of fluoroquinolone treatment.

Search Strategy

In November 2007, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, mRCT, conference proceedings, and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of fluoroquinolones in people with blood or bone marrow culture-confirmed enteric fever.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the trials' methodological quality and extracted data. We calculated odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed trials with greater than 60% children separately from trials of mostly adults.

Main Results

Of 38 included trials, 22 had unclear allocation concealment and 34 did not use blinding. Four trials included exclusively children, seven had both adults and children, and three studied outpatients.

Adults

Among primary outcomes (clinical failure, microbiological failure, and relapse), compared with chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones were not statistically significantly different for clinical failure (594 participants) or microbiological failure (378 participants), but they reduced clinical relapse (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.50; 467 participants, 6 trials). We detected no statistically significant difference versus co-trimoxazole (82 participants, 2 trials) or azithromycin (152 participants, 2 trials). Fluoroquinolones reduced clinical failure compared with ceftriaxone (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.45; 120 participants, 3 trials), but not microbiological failure or relapse. Versus cefixime, fluoroquinolones reduced clinical failure (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.24; 238 participants; 2 trials) and relapse (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.91; 218 participants, 2 trials).

Children

In children with high proportions of nalidixic acid-resistant strains, older fluoroquinolones increased clinical failures compared with azithromycin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.11; 125 participants, 1 trial), with no differences using newer fluoroquinolones (285 participants, 1 trial). Fluoroquinolones and cefixime were not statistically significantly different (82 participants, 1 trial). Trials comparing different durations of fluoroquinolone treatment were not statistically significantly different (889 participants, 9 trials). Norfloxacin had more clinical failures than other fluoroquinolones (417 participants, 5 trials).

Authors' Conclusions

Trials were small and methodological quality varied. In adults, fluoroquinolones may be better for reducing clinical relapse rates compared to chloramphenicol. Data are limited for other comparisons, particularly in children.

### Fluoroquinolones for treating typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever) [^115qxr6D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Fluoroquinolones are recommended as first-line therapy for typhoid and paratyphoid fever, but how they compare with other cheaper antibiotics and different fluoroquinolones is unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate fluoroquinolone antibiotics for treating enteric fever in children and adults compared with other antibiotics, different fluoroquinolones, and different treatment durations of the same fluoroquinolone.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (August 2004), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2004), EMBASE (1974 to August 2004), LILACS (1982 to August 2004), conference proceedings, reference lists, and contacted researchers.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of fluoroquinolones in people with blood or bone marrow culture-confirmed enteric fever.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of trials and extracted data. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals. We analysed norfloxacin separately.

Main Results

Thirty-three trials met the inclusion criteria; 22 had unclear allocation concealment, and 29 were not blinded. Three trials exclusively included children, and two studied outpatients. The main analysis examined clinical failure, microbiological failure, and relapse. Compared with chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones were not statistically significantly different for clinical (544 participants) or microbiological failure (378 participants) in adults; they reduced clinically diagnosed relapse in adults (OR 0.14, 0.04 to 0.50; 467 participants, 6 trials), but this was not statistically significant in participants with blood culture-confirmed relapse (121 participants, 2 trials). Compared with co-trimoxazole, we detected no statistically significant difference (82 participants, 2 trials). Among adults, fluoroquinolones reduced clinical failure compared with ceftriaxone (OR 0.08, 0.01 to 0.45; 120 participants, 3 trials), but showed no difference for microbiological failure or relapse. We detected no statistically significant difference between fluoroquinolones and cefixime (80 participants, 1 trial) or azithromycin (152 participants, 2 trials). In trials of hospitalized children, fluoroquinolones were not statistically significantly different from ceftriaxone (60 participants, 1 trial, involving norfloxacin) or cefixime (82 participants, 1 trial). Norfloxacin had more clinical failures than other fluoroquinolones (417 participants, 5 trials). Trials comparing different durations of fluoroquinolone treatment showed no statistically significant differences (693 participants, 8 trials).

Authors' Conclusions

Many trials were small, and methodological quality varied widely. Although enteric fever most commonly affects children, trials in this group were particularly sparse. Insufficient data in all comparisons preclude any firm conclusions to be made regarding superiority of fluoroquinolones over first-line antibiotics in children and adults.

### Typhoid and paratyphoid fever: a call to action [^116vNn99]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND

Enteric fever remains a major public health problem, affecting millions of people every year and disproportionately impacting low- and middle-income countries. The global enteric fever landscape has transformed steadily over the past two decades, illustrated by the emergence and dissemination of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of Salmonella Typhi, an increasing burden of S. Paratyphi A infection in South Asia and the development of a new generation of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs). The recent approval and impending deployment of TCVs is a cause for optimism in efforts to achieve control of enteric fever globally. Nevertheless, several challenges remain. This review aims to summarize the contemporary enteric fever landscape, focussing on burden of disease, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of enteric fever. In addition to summarizing several new research advances, we aim to identify knowledge gaps that could be addressed in future studies.

### Azithromycin for treating uncomplicated typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever) [^112S3G8w]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fever) is potentially fatal. Infection with drug-resistant strains of the causative organism Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi or Paratyphi increases morbidity and mortality. Azithromycin may have better outcomes in people with uncomplicated forms of the disease.

Objectives

To compare azithromycin with other antibiotics for treating uncomplicated enteric fever.

Search Strategy

In August 2008, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and mRCT. We also searched conference proceedings, reference lists, and contacted researchers and a pharmaceutical company.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing azithromycin with other antibiotics for treating children and adults with uncomplicated enteric fever confirmed by cultures of S. Typhi or Paratyphi in blood and/or stool.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Dichotomous data were presented and compared using the odds ratio, and continuous data were reported as arithmetic means with standard deviations and were combined using the mean difference (MD). Both were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Seven trials involving 773 participants met the inclusion criteria. The trials used adequate methods to generate the allocation sequence and conceal allocation, and were open label. Three trials exclusively included adults, two included children, and two included both adults and children; all were hospital inpatients. One trial evaluated azithromycin against chloramphenicol and did not demonstrate a difference for any outcome (77 participants, 1 trial). When compared with fluoroquinolones in four trials, azithromycin significantly reduced clinical failure (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.89; 564 participants, 4 trials) and duration of hospital stay (MD -1.04 days, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.34 days; 213 participants, 2 trials); all four trials included people with multiple-drug-resistant or nalidixic acid-resistant strains of S. Typhi or S. Paratyphi. We detected no statistically significant difference in the other outcomes. Compared with ceftriaxone, azithromycin significantly reduced relapse (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.70; 132 participants, 2 trials) and not other outcome measures. Few adverse events were reported, and most were mild and self limiting.

Authors' Conclusions

Azithromycin appears better than fluoroquinolone drugs in populations that included participants with drug-resistant strains. Azithromycin may perform better than ceftriaxone.

### The current status of enteric fever diagnostics and implications for disease control [^116LoQET]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Enteric (typhoid) fever is a clinical syndrome caused by ingestion of the gram-negative bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) or Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi (S. Paratyphi) A, B, or C. Despite the availability of good antimicrobial treatment regimens and new-generation conjugate vaccines for preventing S. Typhi infection (TCVs), enteric fever continues to cause a significant degree of morbidity and mortality worldwide; current estimates suggest approximately 13.5–26.9 million new cases of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A (the focus of this review) each year. The uncertainty around these estimates is, in part, due to the limitations in availability and performance of current diagnostic tools.

Enteric fever is associated with a broad spectrum of clinical disease, ranging from asymptomatic to severe symptoms, such as fever, malaise, headache, and complications of ileal ulceration including perforation and profuse hemorrhage. Furthermore, some individuals who are exposed to S. Typhi or S. Paratyphi A will go on to become long-term carriers, where the organisms are retained in the gallbladder and occasionally at other sites including the kidney. Why different individuals present with differing clinical symptoms is not understood, but laboratory models and human challenge with virulent organisms have revealed a highly complex natural history of infection resulting from the co-evolution of bacteria with humans. The result is that both S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A are exquisitely adapted to transit almost effortlessly throughout the human body, triggering a cascade of events that result in symptomatic disease in some, and long-term asymptomatic carriage in others. Consequently, diagnosing enteric fever remains an enigma, with symptomatic infections mimicking various aspects of many other infectious diseases. These factors are especially relevant in settings with the limited resources found in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where differential diagnostic tests (many of which have their own inherent limitations) for febrile disease are often not available, and diagnosis is performed purely on the clinical judgment of an attending healthcare worker.

### Treatment response in enteric fever in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance: an individual patient data analysis of 2092 participants enrolled into 4 randomized, controlled trials in Nepal [^115pYKdV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Enteric (typhoid) fever is a systemic infection caused by the Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A, B, and C. Enteric fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in low-income regions and was responsible for an estimated 12.2 million disability-adjusted life-years and > 190 000 deaths globally in 2010. The fatality rate of enteric fever is low (< 1%) but is higher when antimicrobial therapy is delayed or unavailable. Therefore, antimicrobials are essential for the clinical management of enteric fever. Chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and cotrimoxazole were first-line treatments for enteric fever until the early 1990s when the increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR; defined as resistance to these 3 antimicrobial drugs) S. Typhi organisms led to the use of fluoroquinolones. Yet, organisms with reduced susceptibility against fluoroquinolones became a problem in Asia soon after their introduction. Recent phylogeographic analyses that document an ongoing epidemic of a global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) S. Typhi lineage suggest that the potential for regional or global dispersal of a lineage exhibits resistance to fluoroquinolones is now a real threat. In the absence of effective and accessible vaccines and lack of sanitation improvements, development of tailored antimicrobial therapy recommendations is critical to reduce morbidity and prevent disease transmission.

In Kathmandu, Nepal, S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A are the most commonly isolated organisms from the blood of febrile adults and children. Over the last decade we conducted 4 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate enteric fever treatment in this endemic region. Our aim in this study was to use the largest collection of individual patient data assembled to date from enteric fever treatment trials to evaluate the effect of treatment drug on differences in clinical outcome between S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A infections and those with blood culture-negative enteric fever. We further sought to compare the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles over time between S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A isolates and to investigate their impact on outcome. An in-depth understanding of trends and clinical implications of AMR enteric fever should guide policymakers and clinicians in decisions regarding treatment in an era of rapidly diminishing therapeutic options.

### Global trends in typhoid and paratyphoid fever [^116fbEnP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever continue to be important causes of illness and death, particularly among children and adolescents in south-central and Southeast Asia, where enteric fever is associated with poor sanitation and unsafe food and water. High-quality incidence data from Asia are underpinning efforts to expand access to typhoid vaccines. Efforts are underway to develop vaccines that are immunogenic in infants after a single dose and that can be produced locally in countries of endemicity. The growing importance of Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi A in Asia is concerning. Antimicrobial resistance has sequentially emerged to traditional first-line drugs, fluoroquinolones, and third-generation cephalosporins, posing patient treatment challenges. Azithromycin has proven to be an effective alternative for treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever. The availability of full genome sequences for S. enterica serotype Typhi and S. enterica serotype Paratyphi A confirms their place as monomorphic, human-adapted pathogens vulnerable to control measures if international efforts can be redoubled.

### Treatment of enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fever) with cephalosporins [^117HSb48]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and management

Two review authors (NS and DE) independently extracted data from trials identified in the February 2013 searches using a standardized, pre‐tested data extraction form incorporating information about the trial population, intervention used (type of drug, means of administration, duration of treatment) and outcomes (side effects, success of treatment). TD and CP completed the same data extraction process for trials identified in the April 2017 search and CP and RK completed the same data extraction process for trials identified in the November 2021 search.

For dichotomous outcomes, we extracted data concerning clinical failure, the total number of participants randomized, the number of participants analysed and the total number of participants who experienced that event.

For continuous outcomes, we extracted data concerning time to defervescence, the total number of participants, arithmetic means, and standard deviations. If trials did not report the standard deviation, we used the confidence interval (CI) to calculate it.

We contacted trial authors for additional data when they were unavailable or not in the format required to undertake the analyses.

We compared extracted data between review authors to identify errors. Any conflicts were resolved by discussion with CP or BB.

Two review authors (NS and RK) entered data into the Review Manager file (RevMan Web 2022), and DE and CP verified data entry was correct.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each included trial: NS and DE for the 2013 search, TD and CP for the April 2017 search, and RK and CP for the 2021 search, using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, RoB 1 (Higgins 2011). We used the tool to assess whether adequate steps were taken to reduce the risk of bias across six domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors), incomplete outcome data (follow‐up was considered adequate if 90% or more of the randomized culture‐positive participants were in the final analysis and inadequate if this figure was less than 90%), selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias. We categorized judgements as either 'yes' (low risk of bias), 'no' (high risk of bias), or 'unclear'. We compared entries and resolved disagreements by discussion between review authors.

We summarized the risk of bias judgements in tables.

### Overview of the nontyphoidal and paratyphoidal Salmonella vaccine pipeline: current status and future prospects [^113psxCZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Enteric fever is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. The 2 major pathogens responsible for enteric fever are Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and S. Paratyphi A. These organisms cause acute illnesses characterized by fevers, chills, abdominal pain, and in the more severe cases, hemodynamic compromise. While, in general, Paratyphi strains tend to have a more indolent course, both S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi (including Paratyphi A and B) can cause life-threatening illness. Incidence rates of paratyphoid disease vary widely according to geography. Estimates of age-standardized incidence rates of combined typhoid and paratyphoid disease range from 549 cases per 100 000 person-years in South Asia, 81 in central sub-Saharan Africa, and 39 in North Africa and the Middle East, with paratyphoid disease accounting for approximately 25% of these cases.

In sub-Saharan Africa, nontyphoidal Salmonella serovars Enteritidis and Typhimurium (including monophasic variant 1,4,[5],12:i:−) are a major pediatric public health concern. The bulk of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease (typified by bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis) occurs in children under 5 years old, and case-fatality rates range from 12% to 28%. Invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella infections are widespread and reported as a cause of bacteremia in 33 out of 54 African countries. Furthermore, the rise in antibiotic resistance makes the treatment of these infections increasingly problematic.

At present, there is no paratyphoid or iNTS vaccine licensed for use in humans, and development of effective interventions, including vaccination, is needed.

### Treatment of enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fever) with cephalosporins [^111EmmcE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric fever) are febrile bacterial illnesses common in many low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends treatment with azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone due to widespread resistance to older, first-line antimicrobials. Resistance patterns vary in different locations and are changing over time. Fluoroquinolone resistance in South Asia often precludes the use of ciprofloxacin. Extensively drug-resistant strains of enteric fever have emerged in Pakistan. In some areas of the world, susceptibility to old first-line antimicrobials, such as chloramphenicol, has re-appeared. A Cochrane Review of the use of fluoroquinolones and azithromycin in the treatment of enteric fever has previously been undertaken, but the use of cephalosporins has not been systematically investigated and the optimal choice of drug and duration of treatment are uncertain.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of cephalosporins for treating enteric fever in children and adults compared to other antimicrobials.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 24 November 2021. We also searched reference lists of included trials, contacted researchers working in the field, and contacted relevant organizations.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults and children with enteric fever that compared a cephalosporin to another antimicrobial, a different cephalosporin, or a different treatment duration of the intervention cephalosporin. Enteric fever was diagnosed on the basis of blood culture, bone marrow culture, or molecular tests.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were clinical failure, microbiological failure and relapse. Our secondary outcomes were time to defervescence, duration of hospital admission, convalescent faecal carriage, and adverse effects. We used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 27 RCTs with 2231 total participants published between 1986 and 2016 across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the Caribbean, with comparisons between cephalosporins and other antimicrobials used for the treatment of enteric fever in children and adults. The main comparisons are between antimicrobials in most common clinical use, namely cephalosporins compared to a fluoroquinolone and cephalosporins compared to azithromycin. Cephalosporin (cefixime) versus fluoroquinolones Clinical failure, microbiological failure and relapse may be increased in patients treated with cefixime compared to fluoroquinolones in three small trials published over 14 years ago: clinical failure (risk ratio (RR) 13.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.24 to 55.39; 2 trials, 240 participants; low-certainty evidence); microbiological failure (RR 4.07, 95% CI 0.46 to 36.41; 2 trials, 240 participants; low-certainty evidence); relapse (RR 4.45, 95% CI 1.11 to 17.84; 2 trials, 220 participants; low-certainty evidence). Time to defervescence in participants treated with cefixime may be longer compared to participants treated with fluoroquinolones (mean difference (MD) 1.74 days, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.98, 3 trials, 425 participants; low-certainty evidence). Cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) versus azithromycin Ceftriaxone may result in a decrease in clinical failure compared to azithromycin, and it is unclear whether ceftriaxone has an effect on microbiological failure compared to azithromycin in two small trials published over 18 years ago and in one more recent trial, all conducted in participants under 18 years of age: clinical failure (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.57; 3 trials, 196 participants; low-certainty evidence); microbiological failure (RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.36 to 10.64, 3 trials, 196 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether ceftriaxone increases or decreases relapse compared to azithromycin (RR 10.05, 95% CI 1.93 to 52.38; 3 trials, 185 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Time to defervescence in participants treated with ceftriaxone may be shorter compared to participants treated with azithromycin (mean difference of -0.52 days, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.12; 3 trials, 196 participants; low-certainty evidence). Cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) versus fluoroquinolones It is unclear whether ceftriaxone has an effect on clinical failure, microbiological failure, relapse, and time to defervescence compared to fluoroquinolones in three trials published over 28 years ago and two more recent trials: clinical failure (RR 3.77, 95% CI 0.72 to 19.81; 4 trials, 359 participants; very low-certainty evidence); microbiological failure (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.40 to 6.83; 3 trials, 316 participants; very low-certainty evidence); relapse (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.92; 3 trials, 297 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and time to defervescence (MD 2.73 days, 95% CI -0.37 to 5.84; 3 trials, 285 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether ceftriaxone decreases convalescent faecal carriage compared to the fluoroquinolone gatifloxacin (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.72; 1 trial, 73 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and length of hospital stay may be longer in participants treated with ceftriaxone compared to participants treated with the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin (mean of 12 days (range 7 to 23 days) in the ceftriaxone group compared to a mean of 9 days (range 6 to 13 days) in the ofloxacin group; 1 trial, 47 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on very low- to low-certainty evidence, ceftriaxone is an effective treatment for adults and children with enteric fever, with few adverse effects. Trials suggest that there may be no difference in the performance of ceftriaxone compared with azithromycin, fluoroquinolones, or chloramphenicol. Cefixime can also be used for treatment of enteric fever but may not perform as well as fluoroquinolones. We are unable to draw firm general conclusions on comparative contemporary effectiveness given that most trials were small and conducted over 20 years previously. Clinicians need to take into account current, local resistance patterns in addition to route of administration when choosing an antimicrobial.

### Challenges and opportunities for typhoid fever control: a call for coordinated action [^1153PXUr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The burden of enteric fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi is substantial and has high impact in toddlers and young children. This burden is relatively well documented in Asia, and this supplement provides new data on the substantial burden in several sub-Saharan African countries. Challenges in standardized surveillance and imperfect diagnostic tools have resulted in patchy local disease data, which are not well acknowledged or integrated into local country evidence and health awareness for decision making. There is a need to strengthen diagnostics for the generation of burden data in country. Furthermore, the guidelines and training for treatment of enteric fever cases in Africa are sorely needed to help mitigate the inappropriate use of antimicrobial treatment. Classic water safety and access to sanitation development remain powerful tools for the control of typhoid fever, yet the huge economic costs and long timelines are unlikely to provide a short- to middle-term solution. Emerging threats, including multidrug resistance and increasing urbanization in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, warrant focused attention to shorter-term interventions including immunization, and must include vaccine strategies with the new typhoid conjugate vaccines.

### Treatment of enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fever) with cephalosporins [^116jH2Sp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

Most trials reported our primary outcomes: clinical failure (26 trials); microbiological failure (21 trials) and relapse (21 trials).

The definition of outcomes varied between trials; some did not define outcomes at all. The time period at which outcomes were assessed also varied considerably between trials, for example, some trials defined time to defervescence as the first documented 'normal' body temperature and other trials as an axillary temperature of less than 37.5 °C for at least 48 hours. In some trials it was not clear whether the adverse events recorded were considered due to the antimicrobial received or the disease process itself. Further details are presented in Characteristics of included studies section.

We received data from one author group to calculate the mean time to defervescence in the comparison of cefixime versus fluoroquinolones (Pandit 2007).

Excluded studies

Of the 30 excluded trials, we excluded 24 because they were not randomized, or it was unclear if they were randomized. For further details see Characteristics of excluded studies section.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever [^111NRyKo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

RDTs have the potential to be useful to clinicians working in resource‐limited settings in LMICs. Differentiating the common causes of the febrile patient by clinical criteria is challenging without the laboratory support for blood films, serology, or blood cultures (Bhutta 2006). A diagnostic test in such a setting must be cheap, simple to perform, and able to quickly deliver a result. Such a test should correctly identify true enteric fever cases among febrile patients, ensuring prompt and specific treatment, allowing the avoidance of broad‐spectrum medication that cover all common causes of fever. In many endemic areas, treatment for enteric fever may be given to all patients with fever (Larsson 2008). The diagnosis of enteric fever by an RDT could reduce unnecessary prescription of antimicrobials, reduce drug expenditure, and limit the development of antimicrobial resistance (Andrews 2015). The role of an enteric fever RDT in practice is to identify those febrile patients who warrant anti‐ Salmonella antibiotic treatment as opposed to conservative management, antimalarial treatment, or treatment for other bacterial infections (Parry 2011).

The reference standard for diagnosing enteric fever has been culture of S. Typhi or Paratyphi A from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or other sterile sites. The mainstay of diagnosis in clinical practice is a positive blood culture, although the test is only positive in 40% to 80% of cases, usually in the first two weeks of the disease (Parry 2002; WHO 2003). This lack of sensitivity is due to the low number of bacteria circulating in the blood, and may also be affected by: prior antimicrobial therapy (Wain 1998); the type of culture medium used; the ratio of blood to broth; stage of illness at the time of presentation; and the duration of incubation (Mogasale 2016). Bone marrow culture gives a higher culture‐positive rate, probably because the concentration of organisms is higher than in the blood, and may remain positive even after antibiotic therapy has been started (Wain 2001). Bone marrow culture is positive in 80% to 95% of patients with enteric fever, including in patients who have been taking antibiotics for several days regardless of the duration of the illness (Parry 2002). Although bone marrow culture is more sensitive, it is difficult to obtain, relatively invasive, and is of little use in public health settings (Wain 2001). Even with sophisticated laboratories, confirming the diagnosis of enteric fever can be difficult with negative blood or bone marrow cultures despite a patient actually having enteric fever (Baker 2010).

### Typhoid fever [^117AtLJJ]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Control of typhoid fever relies on clinical information, diagnosis, and an understanding for the epidemiology of the disease. Despite the breadth of work done so far, much is not known about the biology of this human-adapted bacterial pathogen and the complexity of the disease in endemic areas, especially those in Africa. The main barriers to control are vaccines that are not immunogenic in very young children and the development of multidrug resistance, which threatens efficacy of antimicrobial chemotherapy. Clinicians, microbiologists, and epidemiologists worldwide need to be familiar with shifting trends in enteric fever. This knowledge is crucial, both to control the disease and to manage cases. Additionally, salmonella serovars that cause human infection can change over time and location. In areas of Asia, multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S Typhi) has been the main cause of enteric fever, but now S Typhi is being displaced by infections with drug-resistant S enterica serovar Paratyphi A. New conjugate vaccines are imminent and new treatments have been promised, but the engagement of local medical and public health institutions in endemic areas is needed to allow surveillance and to implement control measures.

### A personal perspective on clinical research in enteric fever [^115Fx7kk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

With the global spread of enteric fever, the emergence of Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi as a major pathogen (particularly in Asia), the spread of drug resistance, and the global increase in the incidence of non-Typhi salmonella, particularly in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus, there is now more than ever a need for clinical research in enteric fever. The work of Ted Woodward 60 years ago remains relevant today, and his holistic approach to clinical research inspired many of us to follow in his footsteps. There remains healthy discussion among clinicians about the best treatment for enteric fever, and pragmatic, well-designed, randomized controlled trials are required to provide clear evidence. Vaccines and public health measures will have the greatest impact on the overall burden of disease; however, while we wait for these measures, prompt diagnosis and early treatment with the best available and affordable drug will help patients, reduce transmission within the community, and potentially help to contain the spread of drug resistance. Better integration of clinical medicine with epidemiology, public health, vaccine development, and modern laboratory science will help to yield tangible benefits for the vast number of people who have this disease.

### Case report: serovar paratyphi B infection in a febrile ill child during enhanced passive surveillance in an urban slum in mirpur, dhaka [^1162xRk4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

The household members of the child patient had no complaints of enteric fever, and their stool culture results did not show any evidence of being asymptomatic carrier of S. Paratyphi B. The infant also did not have any history of contact with animals. Hence, the patient could have acquired the infection from the environment while playing in surroundings around the household. Recent studies have suggested that children are more likely to be infected by fecal contamination from the environment in slum settings with contaminated water bodies and open sewers. – Improvement of sanitation system will be beneficial for the children who are at risk for acquisition of enteric fever from the environment.

Resistance to first-line antibiotics (chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and cotrimoxazole) has complicated antibiotic choice to treat the patients with typhoid and paratyphoid fever. Third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and azithromycin are widely used to treat enteric fever. Delayed defervescence has been reported for the currently used antibiotics, except fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin and gatifloxacin). – Fluoroquinolones are now not recommended for the treatment of enteric fever patients empirically in South Asia as a result of the spread of antimicrobial resistance. – Although antibiotic susceptibility testing indicated that the strain isolated from both blood and stool was sensitive to azithromycin, the patient did not respond despite 3 days of treatment. The breakpoints for azithromycin in the treatment of typhoidal Salmonellae are uncertain, and there are few clinical data on response to treatment in S. Paratyphi A infection. In addition, there are no validated guidelines for azithromycin susceptibility in S. Paratyphi A/B; hence, further studies are needed to define optimal management for treatment of S. Paratyphi B infection. Good responses are expected with the use of third-generation cephalosporin, and, therefore, the antibiotic was switched to cefixime. However, after initiation of appropriate treatment, it generally takes long time (96–145 hours) for defervescence from enteric fever, as was seen in our patient.

This report shows the presence of S. Paratyphi B in South Asia, where S. Paratyphi A is considered as the main cause of paratyphoid fever, and highlights the importance of surveillance to identify changes in the epidemiology of enteric fever, particularly in the context of introduction of new typhoid conjugate vaccines to control typhoid, which may promote emergence of paratyphoid as a more significant cause of enteric fever.

### Estimating the subnational prevalence of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella enterica serovars typhi and paratyphi A infections in 75 endemic countries, 1990–2019: a modelling study [^113D8oys]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

A 2022 modelling studyestimated that routine immunisation with typhoid conjugate vaccine at age 9 months and a catch-up campaign up to age 15 years could avert up to 67 million cases of typhoid fever in the 73 LMICs eligible for GAVI support over 10 years, reflecting a reduction between 46% and 74% of cases in individual countries, depending on age structure and vaccination coverage. In addition, the relative prevalence of AMR typhoid fever was predicted to decline by 16%. The estimates for AMR prevalence were based on the systematic review by Browne and colleagues, which was also a foundation of this study.

Preventing typhoid fever would lead to a decrease in antibiotic consumption that is associated with this illness. Studies estimate that between three and 25 patients are treated with antibiotics for suspected typhoid fever for each true (ie, blood culture confirmed) case, a consequence of the unavailability of sensitive and specific rapid testsand the absence of universal health care in high-burden countries, that incentivises self-medication (non-prescription use) with antibiotics as the cheapest treatment option. Such inappropriate antimicrobial use promotes the resistance evolution in bystander organisms, creating an important AMR gene pool that can be transferred to other pathogens and contribute to an increased burden of AMR.

As a faeco-orally transmitted disease, control of enteric fever will ultimately depend on improvements in WASH. These are important building blocks of an integrated approach to reduce the incidence of infections, as mandated by the WHO Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance. The World Bank considers investments in WASH as AMR-sensitive development priorities and emphasises the interdependency between the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 6 (achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water and adequate sanitation and hygiene for all) and AMR. In keeping with our findings, the coverage for basic sanitation services was less than 50% in sub-Saharan Africa, India, Bangladesh, and Nepal in 2015. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 24% of the population (data only available for 6 countries) used safely managed drinking water (defined as on site, available when needed, and free from contamination), whereas insufficient data were available from India. The current pace of WASH progress is projected to be too slow to achieve the SDG targets set for 2030, which will not only negatively affect diarrhoeal diseases and AMR, but also gender equality and social justice.

### Treatment of enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fever) with cephalosporins [^1177qE3p]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical failure

Three trials conducted over 20 years earlier reported clinical failure in 15/62 (24.2%) participants treated with ceftriaxone compared to 0/58 (0%) participants treated with a fluoroquinolone (Smith 1994; Tran 1994; Wallace 1993); a more recent trial (Arjyal 2016), reported 19/119 (16.0%) participants with clinical failure in the ceftriaxone group compared with 18/120 (15.0%) participants in the fluoroquinolone group (RR 3.77, 95% CI 0.72 to 19.81; 4 trials, 359 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 3.1). One trial reported no cases of clinical failure in participants receiving ceftriaxone and no cases in participants receiving ofloxacin (Kumar 2007). No clear relationship was seen on analysis according to ceftriaxone dose (2 g daily compared to more than 2 g daily).

Microbiological failure

Microbiological failure was not significantly different in participants in the ceftriaxone group compared to participants in the fluoroquinolone group (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.40 to 6.83; 3 trials, 316 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 3.2). No clear relationship was seen on analysis according to ceftriaxone dose (2 g daily compared to more than 2 g daily).

Relapse

Relapse was not significantly different in participants in the ceftriaxone group compared to participants in the fluoroquinolone group (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.92; 3 trials, 297 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 3.3). One trial reported that no participant in either the ceftriaxone or ofloxacin group experienced clinical relapse with fever (Kumar 2007). No clear relationship was seen on analysis according to ceftriaxone dose (2 g daily compared to more than 2 g daily).

Time to defervescence

Average time to defervescence was 2.73 days longer in participants treated with ceftriaxone compared to participants treated with fluoroquinolones, but the analysis was underpowered and we are uncertain if this is a true difference (MD 2.73 days, 95% CI −0.37 to 5.84; 3 trials, 285 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 3.4). No clear relationship was seen on analysis according to ceftriaxone dose (2 g daily compared to more than 2 g daily). We were unable to calculate the mean time to defervescence calculated in one trial due to missing data on standard deviation (Kumar 2007).

### Rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever [^113qzo81]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Target condition being diagnosed

Typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever are diseases caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Paratyphi A respectively. Typhoid, the more common infection, is an important infectious disease in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) with over 22 million new cases worldwide and an estimated 200,000 deaths annually (WHO 2003). South and South‐East Asia are the most affected areas of the world, with an estimated annual incidence in some areas of greater than 100 people per 100,000 population (Crump 2004). Enteric fever is common in areas with inadequate sanitation and hygiene, particularly regarding food, water, and disposal of human excrement, and only to this extent are these diseases tropical (Gill 2009). Despite advances in technology and public health strategies, enteric fever remains a major cause of morbidity in the developing world (Bhutta 2006). Urbanization, global warming, and traditional methods of waterside living have created even greater demands for clean water in developing countries (UNICEF 2006). We will use the term 'enteric fever' throughout this Cochrane Review to include both typhoid and paratyphoid fever, unless specified. The causative organisms are Gram‐negative bacilli that are transmitted by the faecal‐oral route when a person ingests food or water that is contaminated with infected human faeces. The most important reservoirs of infection are short‐term convalescents or chronic human carriers. Food handlers who are carriers are a particularly important source of transmission (Gill 2009; Andrews 2015).

### Evaluation of the clinical and microbiological response to Salmonella paratyphi A infection in the first paratyphoid human challenge model [^114dxpkZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Forty healthy adult participants were enrolled into the study between 20 May and 20 November 2014 (Table 1; Supplementary Figure 2). Twenty participants were challenged with S. Paratyphi A at a target dose of 1–5 × 10³ CFU (group 1). A second group of 20 participants was challenged at a target dose of 0.5–1.0 × 10³ CFU (group 2).

Table 1.
Participant Demographic Characteristics

Paratyphoid infection was diagnosed in 50% (20/40) of all participants challenged. The primary study objective was achieved in challenge group 1, where 12 of 20 participants met the prespecified diagnostic criteria for paratyphoid fever (attack rate, 60%; 95% confidence interval, 36%–81%) (Figure 1). Eleven participants (11/12 [92%]) in this group were diagnosed following a positive blood culture for S. Paratyphi A and 1 participant was diagnosed based on temperature criteria with subsequent blood culture confirmation. Median time from challenge to initiation of treatment was 6.4 days (range, 5.9–8.3 days) (Table 2).

### Treatment of enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fever) with cephalosporins [^111MqNWQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology

In 2017 the global number of cases of typhoid and paratyphoid fever was estimated to be 14.3 million, with Styphi causing 76.3% of cases, in the Global Burden of Disease trial (Stanaway 2019). This overall represented a decline from previous estimates ranging between 11.9 million to 27.1 million cases per year (Antillón 2017; Buckle 2012; Crump 2004; Kim 2017; Mogasale 2014). Global deaths from typhoid and paratyphoid fever were estimated at approximately 135,900 (76,900 to 218,900) in 2017, and higher in typhoid compared to paratyphoid cases (Stanaway 2019). Regions with the highest estimated burden of disease are South Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub‐Saharan Africa (Garrett 2022; Marks 2017; Meiring 2021). In some areas estimates are limited by lack of data, most notably from Oceania and Latin America. Cases occur in high‐income countries in returned travellers from endemic countries or in those in close contact with people recently returned from endemic countries, and occasionally food‐borne outbreaks occur. Overall, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers were responsible for 9.8 million (5.6 to 15.8) disability‐adjusted life‐years (DALYs) in 2017, 67.0% (61.6 to 72.4) occurring amongst children younger than 15 years of age (Stanaway 2019).

Prevention

Disease burden can be reduced by provision of adequate water and sanitation infrastructure and through typhoid vaccination. The World Health Organization (WHO) has approved three typhoid vaccines which, until recently, have not been part of national routine immunization programmes. Several countries are now introducing the typhoid Vi conjugate vaccine following evidence from recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs; Patel 2021; Qadri 2021; Shakya 2021). There are no paratyphoid fever vaccines (WHO 2019).

### Epidemiology of typhoid and paratyphoid: implications for vaccine policy [^1139y9nR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Most low- and middle-income countries have introduced, or are in the process of introducing, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, based on relevant burden and vaccine efficacy data, which has significantly decreased the burden of pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type b diseases. However, it remains difficult to make evidence-based decisions on the control of enteric fever, as only a few, small, incomprehensive studies have addressed disease epidemiology. With the recent WHO prequalification of TCV, a detailed understanding of typhoid in infants and young children is important for developing the most effective vaccination strategy. We conducted enteric fever surveillance from 2004 through 2016 to generate data on typhoid and paratyphoid cases in Bangladesh, where Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A are the most common causes of bloodstream infections in children over 2 months of age.

In recent years, there have been several reports of increasing proportions of paratyphoid, as compared to typhoid. Our surveillance revealed no trend of change, corroborating results from a meta-analysis of data from India. We did observe moderate year-to-year fluctuations in the proportions of the 2 diseases, which could be due to a number of factors, including changing patterns in the antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A or other environmental factors. For example, in Bangladesh, the multidrug resistance (resistance to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol) of Salmonella Typhi has significantly decreased in recent years; there is no multidrug-resistant Paratyphi A strain. Almost all Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A strains are non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones. As antibiotic consumption prior to seeking care is very common, the presentation of cases at a facility depends on the available antibiotics in the market, dynamics of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the organisms, and rates of treatment failure in the community.

### Evaluation of the clinical and microbiological response to Salmonella paratyphi A infection in the first paratyphoid human challenge model [^115a8ia4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The most common symptom reported by those with paratyphoid illness was headache (17/20 [85%]), followed by malaise (15/20 [75%]), abdominal pain (14/20 [70%]), and myalgia (14/20 [70%]). The majority of solicited symptoms were graded as mild and did not result in limitation of usual activity (Figure 1; Supplementary Table 2). In comparison with participants challenged with S. Typhi in earlier studies, paratyphoid resulted in a milder symptom profile, characterized by fewer severe symptoms and lower cumulative symptom scores (Figure 2; Supplementary Table 3).

### Treatment of enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fever) with cephalosporins [^114kpjrZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical

Infection is caused by consumption of food or water contaminated with S typhi or S paratyphi during preparation where insufficient food hygiene and handwashing facilities are practised (Crump 2019). Contamination occurs when bacteria are shed in the faeces of individuals who are acutely unwell, convalescing or are chronic carriers (Bhan 2005). Risk of transmission is increased by lack of access to clean drinking water, insufficient food hygiene practices and poor sanitation including inadequate handwashing. The severity of the infection depends on the initial infective dose, the virulence of the organism, the host's co‐morbidities and immune response (Tsolis 1999). The bacteria usually penetrate the intestinal mucosa and proliferate in the underlying lymphoid tissue, from where they disseminate via the lymphatic system or are released into the bloodstream, or both, resulting in spread to other organs. The organs most commonly affected include the liver, spleen, bone marrow and gall bladder (Parry 2002; Raffatellu 2008).

The clinical features of enteric fever typically include progressive intermittent fever, headache, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly (Bhan 2005; Walia 2006). It is not possible to distinguish between typhoid and paratyphoid fever on the basis of clinical symptoms. Complications of enteric fever occur in 10% to 15% of cases, are more frequent in patients whose illness has lasted over two weeks, and can affect multiple organ systems (Bhan 2005; Parry 2002). Intestinal perforation and haemorrhage, shock, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, pneumonia, myocarditis and encephalopathy are possible (Bhan 2005).

Between 1% to 5% of patients develop chronic carriage of salmonellae following infection (defined as excretion of bacteria in faeces or urine for more than 12 months; Ferreccio 1988). Chronic carriage occurs more frequently in women, and in patients with gallstones or other biliary tract abnormalities (Levine 1982). Biliary carriage has been associated with an increased risk of cancer, particularly of the biliary system (Caygill 1994).

### Estimating the subnational prevalence of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella enterica serovars typhi and paratyphi A infections in 75 endemic countries, 1990–2019: a modelling study [^111fbKRH]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Consistent with whole genome sequencing studies that revealed the introduction of clades H58 from Asia into eastern sub-Saharan Africa, and the microevolution and spread of endemic clade H56 (renamed genotype 3.1.1) in western sub-Saharan Africa, our estimates show the emergence of MDR S Typhi in western sub-Saharan Africa around 2000 and in eastern sub-Saharan Africa around 2005, and subsequent dominance of this MDR phenotype.

Due to its comprehensiveness and global approach, our analysis serves as a stark reminder of the scarce treatment options available for enteric fever. Although S Typhi has regained susceptibility to the former first-line drugs (eg, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and co-trimoxazole) in several countries in south Asia, these options are not as efficacious. Due to the high prevalence of MDR S Typhi in conjunction with increasing levels of FQNS, patients in sub-Saharan Africa might be unable to obtain or afford effective alternative treatments, such as ceftriaxone or azithromycin. We also highlight the rise of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant S Typhi in south Asia. This is particularly noteworthy in the context of Pakistan, where the persisting high prevalence of MDR suggests the emergence of extensively drug-resistant S Typhi isolates, but this has not been explicitly modelled.

Our analysis and estimates can serve as a tool to inform and guide the implementation of policies and programmes to combat AMR enteric fever. In 2018, typhoid conjugate vaccines that are safe and highly immunogenic in children younger than 2 years became available. Large, randomised trials in children (aged 9 months to 16 years) showed high vaccine efficacies (> 80%) in endemic settings in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Malawi after 1 year of follow-up.WHO recommends typhoid conjugate vaccine for use in all countries where typhoid is endemic, prioritising countries with the highest burden of typhoid disease or antimicrobial resistance, and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, has endorsed funding of vaccine roll-out in eligible countries. In Pakistan, typhoid conjugate vaccines have been successfully deployed in outbreak settings to avert extensively drug-resistant S Typhiand have been integrated into routine childhood vaccination. However, there are no long-term efficacy data on typhoid conjugate vaccines, nor do they offer cross protection against S Paratyphi infections, which showed a disproportionate increase in many countries in south and southeast Asia over the past decade, which might continue as vaccination drives down the incidence of S Typhi.

### Evaluation of the clinical and microbiological response to Salmonella paratyphi A infection in the first paratyphoid human challenge model [^112fQXEK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, we have established the first S. Paratyphi A human challenge model and have described the clinical and microbiological response to challenge in healthy adult volunteers, presenting marked differences from those previously seen with S. Typhi. While S. Typhi challenge models have existed for several decades, the need for a S. Paratyphi A challenge model arguably exceeds that for S. Typhi, as far less is understood regarding the responses to infection and there are no specific control measures yet available. Development of a successful paratyphoid challenge model could offer distinctive insights into paratyphoid disease as well as providing a platform to expedite the development and implementation of much-needed vaccines and diagnostics.

### The relationship between blood sample volume and diagnostic sensitivity of blood culture for typhoid and paratyphoid fever: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111WivMg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates that the sensitivity of blood culture for detecting infection with S Typhi and S Paratyphi is dependent on sample volume, as well as patient age, duration of symptoms, and prior antimicrobial use. Further prospective studies are needed to better characterize these relationships. The evaluation of novel diagnostics and efforts to integrate data across incidence studies of typhoid fever should take into account the potential influence of these factors.

### Evaluation of the clinical and microbiological response to Salmonella paratyphi A infection in the first paratyphoid human challenge model [^112RA991]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

To expedite the evaluation of vaccines against paratyphoid fever, we aimed to develop the first human challenge model of Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A infection.

Methods

Two groups of 20 participants underwent oral challenge with S. Paratyphi A following sodium bicarbonate pretreatment at 1 of 2 dose levels (group 1: 1–5 × 10³ colony-forming units [CFU] and group 2: 0.5–1 × 10³ CFU). Participants were monitored in an outpatient setting with daily clinical review and collection of blood and stool cultures. Antibiotic treatment was started when prespecified diagnostic criteria were met (temperature ≥ 38°C for ≥ 12 hours and/or bacteremia) or at day 14 postchallenge.

Results

The primary study objective was achieved following challenge with 1–5 × 103 CFU (group 1), which resulted in an attack rate of 12 of 20 (60%). Compared with typhoid challenge, paratyphoid was notable for high rates of subclinical bacteremia (at this dose, 11/20 [55%]). Despite limited symptoms, bacteremia persisted for up to 96 hours after antibiotic treatment (median duration of bacteremia, 53 hours [interquartile range, 24–85 hours]). Shedding of S. Paratyphi A in stool typically preceded onset of bacteremia.

Conclusions

Challenge with S. Paratyphi A at a dose of 1–5 × 103 CFU was well tolerated and associated with an acceptable safety profile. The frequency and persistence of bacteremia in the absence of clinical symptoms was notable, and markedly different from that seen in previous typhoid challenge studies. We conclude that the paratyphoid challenge model is suitable for the assessment of vaccine efficacy using endpoints that include bacteremia and/or symptomatology.

### British Infection Association guidelines for the diagnosis and management of enteric fever in england [^1116Yf5N]. The Journal of Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Enteric fever (EF) is an infection caused by the bacteria called Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi. Infection is acquired through swallowing contaminated food or water. Most EF in England occurs in people returning from South Asia and other places where EF is common; catching EF in England is rare. The main symptom is fever, but stomach pain, diarrhoea, muscle aches, rash and other symptoms may occur. EF is diagnosed by culturing the bacteria from blood and/or stool in a microbiology laboratory. EF usually responds well to antibiotic treatment. Depending on how unwell the individual is, antibiotics may be administered by mouth or by injection. Over the past several years, there has been an overall increase in resistance to antibiotics used to treat enteric fever, in all endemic areas. Additionally, since 2016, there has been an ongoing outbreak of drug-resistant EF in Pakistan. This infection is called extensively drug-resistant, or XDR, EF and only responds to a limited number of antibiotics. Occasionally individuals develop complications of EF including confusion, bleeding, a hole in the gut or an infection of the bones or elsewhere. Some people may continue to carry the bacteria in their stool for a longtime following treatment for the initial illness. These people may need treatment with a longer course of antibiotics to eradicate infection. Travellers can reduce their risk of acquiring EF by following safe food and water practices and by receiving the vaccine at least a few weeks before travel. These guidelines aim to help doctors do the correct tests and treat patients for enteric fever in England but may also be useful to doctors and public health professionals in other similar countries.

### Typhoid and paratyphoid fever in travellers [^114wHFmD]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2005). Medium credibility.

Enteric fever — a more inclusive term for typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever — is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella enterica, including S enterica serotype Typhi (S typhi) and serotype Paratyphi (S paratyphi). In developed countries there have been two major changes in the pattern of the disease: a marked decline in its incidence and its characterisation as a predominantly travel-associated disease. The risk to travellers appears to vary by geographic region visited, with travel to the Indian subcontinent accounting for the greatest travel risk. Although the most common cause of enteric fever is S typhi, the incidence of disease caused by S paratyphi among travellers may be more important, since the available vaccines only protect against S typhi. Descriptions of the clinical presentation in travellers are scarce but severe complications and death are rare, probably due to rapid access to readily available medical care. Drug resistance reflects the situation in endemic countries, and shows a steady increase in multidrug-resistance patterns. Currently, the recommendation for first-line therapy is ceftriaxone and, where isolates have been found to be quinolone sensitive, fluoroquinolones can still be given. Preventive measures are educating travellers about hygiene precautions and vaccination. With an increase in multidrug-resistant strains, a more effective vaccine for S typhi and S paratyphi is urgently needed.

### Guidelines for the public health management of typhoid and paratyphoid in england: practice guidelines from the national typhoid and paratyphoid reference group [^116xwbyo]. The Journal of Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The Typhoid and Paratyphoid Reference Group (TPRG) was convened by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH) to revise guidelines for public health management of enteric fever. This paper presents the new guidelines for England and their rationale.

Methods

Methods include literature reviews including grey literature such as audit data and case studies; analysis of enhanced surveillance data from England, Wales and Northern Ireland; review of clearance and screening schedules in use in other non-endemic areas; and expert consensus.

Results

The evidence and principles underpinning the new guidance are summarised. Significant changes from previous guidance include:

- Algorithms to guide risk assessment and management, based on risk group and travel history;
- Outline of investigation of non-travel cases;
- Simplified microbiological clearance schedules for cases and contacts;
- Targeted co-traveller screening and a "warn and inform" approach for contacts;
- Management of convalescent and chronic carriers.

Conclusions

The guidelines were launched in February 2012. Feedback has been positive: the guidelines are reported to be clear, systematic, practical and risk-based. An evaluation of the guidelines is outlined and will add to the evidence base. There is potential for simplification and consistency between international guidelines.

One review author (LW) screened the titles and abstracts of articles identified by the search strategy. We coded articles that did not fulfil the inclusion criteria as 'do not retrieve'. In the case of potentially eligible articles or if we were unclear whether the articles met the inclusion criteria or not, we coded these articles as 'retrieve'. We retrieved the full‐text texts of articles in the 'retrieve' category. Two review authors (LW and CMP) independently assessed the full‐text articles for inclusion and consulted a third review author (SM) in case of disagreement. We listed all studies excluded after full‐text assessments and their reasons for exclusion in the ' Characteristics of excluded studies ' section. We presented the study selection process in a study flow diagram.

Aetiology models

We estimated the aetiological breakdown of the typhoid–paratyphoid fever envelope using data from national surveillance, population-based cohort studies, and vital registration sources (appendix pp 59–60). Although studies typically classify cases as being typhoid or paratyphoid fever, sources rarely differentiate between Paratyphi A, B, and C. We assume, but cannot confirm, that Paratyphi A is the primary paratyphoid serovar. We used two DisMod-MR models: one for the proportion of the total cases caused by typhoid fever, and a second for the proportion of cases caused by paratyphoid fever. We rescaled each proportion estimate to ensure that the proportions due to typhoid and paratyphoid fever always summed to one. For each age-sex-year-location, and for each draw, the incidence of typhoid fever was calculated as the product of total incidence and the proportion of that total from typhoid fever; and the incidence of paratyphoid fever was calculated as the product of the total incidence and proportion of that total due to paratyphoid fever.

### A comparison of fluoroquinolones versus other antibiotics for treating enteric fever: meta-analysis [^112pKjUn]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Enteric fever (typhoid or paratyphoid fever) caused by Salmonella serotype Typhi (S Typhi) or Salmonella serotype Paratyphi (S Paratyphi) remains endemic in many areas of the developing world, causing over 26 million infections and over 200 000 deaths annually. The incidence is highest in south-central Asia and South East Asia (over 100/100 000 cases/year), with the highest burden of disease in children aged 2–15 years. S Typhi represents the commonest cause of bacteraemia in this age group, and annual typhoid rates (confirmed by blood culture) in recent studies from India, Pakistan, and Indonesia range from 149 to as high as 573 cases per 100 000 children. Other regions contributing to global morbidity and mortality include Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and other parts of Asia.

Fluoroquinolones are recommended as first line therapy for children and adults infected with sensitive as well as multidrug resistant (resistant to all three first line inexpensive antibiotics, chloramphenicol, amoxicillin, and co-trimoxazole) S Typhi and Paratyphi. A summaryof randomised controlled trials of enteric fever concluded that fluoroquinolones had lower clinical failures and shorter fever clearance times compared with first line antibiotics and ceftriaxone and cefixime. However, few trials enrolled children, and a meta-analysis was not conducted.

The recommendation to use fluoroquinolones as first line therapy for enteric fever, particularly in children, irrespective of sensitivity patterns — and without a thorough analysis and assessment of quality of evidence — has had profound public health implications for developing countries. These range from increasing costs of treatment to alarming rates of drug resistance. Strains of S Typhi and Paratyphi with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones have rapidly emerged — most displaying resistance to nalidixic acid and associated with poor response to treatment. Even more alarming are reports of high level fluoroquinolone resistance. Although newer generation fluoroquinolones such as gatifloxacin are active against nalidixic acid resistant strains, it may only be a matter of time before resistance to newer agents becomes widespread if indiscriminate and inappropriate use of fluoroquinolones for any febrile illness continues in endemic areas.

### Laboratory-based surveillance of paratyphoid fever in the United States: travel and antimicrobial resistance [^112yyKTb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of paratyphoid fever, including paratyphoid fever caused by antimicrobial-resistant strains, is increasing globally. However, the epidemiologic and laboratory characteristics of paratyphoid fever in the United States have never been studied.

Methods

We attempted to interview all patients who had been infected with laboratory-confirmed Salmonella serotypes Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B, or Paratyphi C in the United States with specimens collected from 1 April 2005 through 31 March 2006. At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), isolates underwent serotype confirmation, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing.

Results

Of 149 patients infected with Salmonella Paratyphi A, we obtained epidemiologic information for 89 (60%); 55 (62%) of 86 were hospitalized. Eighty-five patients (96%) reported having travel internationally, and 80 (90%) had traveled to South Asia. Of the 146 isolates received at the CDC, 127 (87%) were nalidixic acid resistant; nalidixic acid resistance was associated with travel to South Asia (odds ratio, 17.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.8–75.9). All nalidixic acid-resistant isolates showed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration, ≥ 0.12 microg/mL). Of 49 patients infected with Salmonella Paratyphi B, only 12 (24%) were confirmed to have Paratyphi B when tested at the CDC. Four (67%) of 6 patients were hospitalized, and 5 (83%) reported travel (4 to the Andean region of South America). One case of Salmonella Paratyphi C infection was reported in a traveler to West Africa with a urinary tract infection.

Conclusions

Physicians should be aware of the increasing incidence of infection due to Salmonella Paratyphi A and treatment options given its widespread antimicrobial resistance. A paratyphoid fever vaccine is urgently needed. Continued surveillance for paratyphoid fever will help guide future prevention and treatment recommendations.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever [^114tDiR8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of enteric fever varies from a mild illness with a low‐grade fever, malaise, and slight dry cough to a severe clinical illness with multiple complications including intestinal perforation (Ismail 2006). Toxic apathy, blanching 'rose spots' on the trunk, abdominal organomegaly, and diarrhoea are also associated with enteric fever, but the clinical picture is highly variable between geographical location and age groups. Enteric fever can present in many different and non‐specific ways, thus posing a diagnostic challenge for the health professional. Enteric fever is usually diagnosed on clinical grounds and treated presumptively. The diagnosis may be delayed or missed, while other febrile illnesses are being considered (Parry 2002).

There is antimicrobial resistance to S. enterica serovar Typhi and Paratyphi A worldwide (Kariuki 2015). Health professionals in the tropics overprescribe antimicrobials for many reasons, including cultural factors and patient expectation (Okeke 2005). The purchase of drugs such as antimicrobials from untrained vendors and unlicensed pharmacists is commonplace in the developing world (Larsson 2008). A major challenge is the inability to confirm diagnoses in resource‐limited settings where traditional laboratory methods of diagnosing enteric fever are unavailable. Healthcare workers are therefore reliant on their clinical skills to make an educated guess of the cause of illness or to prescribe an antimicrobial that targets several bacteria, or both (Shetty 2008). This over treatment has contributed to increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones (for example, ciprofloxacin) and multiple drug resistance (resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and co‐trimoxazole) in S. enterica serovar Typhi and Paratyphi A in endemic Asian countries (Chuang 2009).

### Treatment of enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fever) with cephalosporins [^116GpJDH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

We analysed data using RevMan Web 2022.

We analysed data using pairwise comparisons. We compared each cephalosporin with each comparator antimicrobial class and subgrouped by the specific antimicrobial.

The data are organized into the following comparisons:

cefixime versus fluoroquinolones
ceftriaxone versus azithromycin
ceftriaxone versus fluoroquinolones
ceftriaxone versus cefixime
ceftriaxone versus chloramphenicol
cefixime versus chloramphenicol
cefixime versus cefpodoxime
cefoperazone versus chloramphenicol
cefixime versus aztreonam
ceftriaxone versus aztreonam
duration of ceftriaxone

If clinical and methodological characteristics of individual trials were sufficiently homogeneous, we pooled the data in meta‐analyses. When there were no concerns of clinical or statistical heterogeneity we used the fixed‐effect model in meta‐analyses. Where clinical or statistical heterogeneity was detected, and we still considered it appropriate to pool the data, we used the random‐effects model.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We planned to investigate heterogeneity by conducting subgroup analyses according to age (paediatric populations 0 to 16 years and adults over 17 years), hospitalization status, presence of MDR/NaR/intermediate ciprofloxacin susceptibility and duration of treatment. We tried to make contact with the trial authors if these distinctions were unclear from the data.

These planned subgroup analyses were not possible due to the limited number of trials in each comparison.

Sensitivity analysis

We planned to assess the robustness of the data by performing a sensitivity analysis for each of the risk of bias assessment factors, but were again unable to do this due to the low number of trials.

10. Ceftriaxone versus aztreonam

One small trial conducted in participants less than 16 years of age in Egypt compared ceftriaxone with aztreonam (Girgis 1995).

Clinical failure

No cases of clinical failure were reported in any participant in either treatment group at four weeks of follow‐up (1 trial, 74 participants).

Microbiological failure

No cases of microbiological failure were reported in either treatment group at four weeks of follow‐up (1 trial, 74 participants).

Relapse

Relapse was reported in 2/43 (4.7%) participants treated with ceftriaxone compared to 2/31 (6.5%) participants in the aztreonam group (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.11 to 4.84; 1 trial, 74 participants; Analysis 10.1).

Time to defervescence

Time to defervescence was shorter in participants treated with ceftriaxone compared to aztreonam (MD −1.4 days, 95% CI −2.44 to −0.36; 1 trial, 74 participants; Analysis 10.2).

Convalescent faecal carriage was not detected in 0/38 (0%) participants treated with ceftriaxone compared to detection in 2/35 (5.7%) participants treated with gatifloxacin (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.72; 1 trial, 73 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 3.5).

Length of hospital stay

The mean length of hospital stay was longer in participants treated with ceftriaxone compared to participants treated with ofloxacin. However, there was overlap in the ranges between treatment groups (mean of 12 days (range 7 to 23 days) in the ceftriaxone group compared to a mean of 9 days (range 6 to 13 days) in the ofloxacin group; 1 trial, 47 participants; low‐certainty evidence, Smith 1994). We were unable to calculate the mean difference due to unknown standard deviations in each group.

Adverse events

One trial reported a 'probable' anaphylactic reaction in 1 of 15 participants in the ceftriaxone group (Tran 1994). One trial reported a mild skin rash in 2 of 25 participants in the ceftriaxone group and pruritis in 1 of 22 participants in the ofloxacin group (Smith 1994). One trial reported complications of hepatitis (9/62 participants), intestinal bleeding (3/62 participants) and pleural effusion (1/62 participants); it was not stated which treatment was received by participants experiencing these complications or whether they were considered due to the drug or the disease process (Kumar 2007).

### Introductory article on global burden and epidemiology of typhoid fever [^1134Vipj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

This article introduces a collection of studies undertaken within the "Tackling Typhoid" (T2) project, which aimed to consolidate the current body of literature on national and regional typhoid fever trends in incidence, mortality, and severe complications. The T2 project included a systematic review of the literature and eight-country case studies in Chile, Nigeria, South Africa, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam. Case studies examined typhoid and paratyphoid fever incidence trends in conjunction with changes in relevant contextual factors, such as water treatment and distribution, sanitation infrastructure, female literacy, poverty rates, and diarrheal mortality, and included in-depth interviews with local public health experts to identify local interventions and control measures that were implemented to reduce the transmission of typhoid fever directly or indirectly by targeting other infectious disease. The studies in this supplement collectively characterize global and regional trends in typhoid and paratyphoid fever, and the findings can inform recommendations on interventions and policies that can best help curb the continued spread of this disease.

Epidemiology.

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are enteric infections caused by the bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and Paratyphi A, B, and C (S. Paratyphi A, B, and C), respectively, collectively referred to as typhoidal Salmonella, and the causes of enteric fever. Humans are the only reservoir for Salmonella Typhi with disease transmission occurring via the fecal–oral route, usually through the consumption of food or water contaminated by human feces. An estimated 17 million cases of typhoid and paratyphoid fever illnesses occurred globally in 2015, mostly in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, with both the largest burden and incidence occurring in South Asia (Figure 1). Left untreated, both typhoid and paratyphoid fever may be fatalwith 178,000 deaths estimated worldwide in 2015.

Typhoid

Enteric fever or typhoid is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella enterica, serotype typhi. Symptoms range from mild fever and gastrointestinal upset to severe disseminated infection with multi-organ involvement. Severe disease occurs in around 10–15% of cases. Paratyphoid, caused by S. paratyphi A, B and C, has a similar clinical presentation and is often less severe. Typhoid is spread via the faecal–oral route and is mainly a disease of poor sanitation and food hygiene. It is common throughout South Asia, Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa with an estimated 14.3 million cases per year. The estimated global case fatality rate is 1%.

Antibiotic resistant typhoid is rising in prevalence globally, largely due to widespread availability of over-the-counter antibiotics in countries with limited antimicrobial stewardship. A recent outbreak of extensively drug resistant (XDR) typhoid in Sindh, Pakistan, highlights the importance of vaccination against typhoid.

There are two types of vaccination available in the UK, the oral-live attenuated vaccine and the polysaccharide vaccine. The oral-live attenuated vaccine should be avoided in immunosuppressed people but the polysaccharide vaccine is safe. Studies in immunocompetent individuals estimate efficacy between 55 and 75%. There are no data on immune response to typhoid vaccination in immunosuppressed patients but efficacy is likely to be lower. There is no effective vaccination against paratyphoid, and so irrespective of vaccination good food hygiene remains important.

Prior test(s)

A RDT for enteric fever should be used in a patient who presents with fever who currently lives in, or has recently visited, an area of medium to high endemicity. It is likely that patients would not have received any prior testing. However, it is more likely that a patient may have been given a clinical diagnosis, or indeed empirical antimicrobial treatment, based on history and examination (Darton 2014). The setting could be primary, secondary, or even tertiary care, but more commonly in a setting that has limited diagnostic laboratory facilities. Unfortunately the clinical diagnosis of the disease is imprecise, so any patient with a fever from endemic regions should be subject to an enteric fever RDT, not just those with classical signs and symptoms of the target conditions (Parry 2011). In areas endemic for HIV, dengue, and malaria as well as enteric fever, patients may have had other point‐of‐care testing performed (Abba 2011).

### Epidemiology of typhoid and paratyphoid: implications for vaccine policy [^112xFPhM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

With 8882 cases of enteric fever identified from 2004 through 2016, our findings demonstrate that typhoid and paratyphoid are common in young children. Although the case fatality rate is low, the emergence of widespread antimicrobial resistance is threatening effective treatment and, if the right intervention strategies are not instituted soon, increases in mortality rates in the near future may occur. We found that 15% of cases occur in children under 2 years old, with equivalent disease severity as seen in older children. Early immunization with TCVs could avert substantial morbidity. Efforts to reduce exposure to contaminated water and food, as well as developing vaccines against paratyphoid, are important steps for the prevention and control of enteric fever.

### Epidemiology of typhoid and paratyphoid: implications for vaccine policy [^117Aj1kN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

In our study, children with paratyphoid were generally older than children with typhoid (median age 90 months vs 60 months, respectively), but 9.4% and 31.5% of paratyphoid cases occurred in children under 2 and 5 years old, respectively, with a similar peak in young adults. A study conducted in a general hospital in Nepal that serves patients of all ages also depicted a higher median age of paratyphoid patients, compared to typhoid patients.

In Bangladesh and the surrounding region, most health-care costs are paid out of pocket and, therefore, the most impoverished seek care only when absolutely necessary; most enteric fever cases are empirically treated at the OPDs of hospitals or community clinics. Patients are admitted in an IPD only when they are very sick and/or are not responding to treatment. Hospitalized patients are eager to leave when they feel slightly better and/or are no longer able to afford the costs. Furthermore, amidst fierce competition for beds, hospital physicians advise OPD-based treatment if the case is not considered severe enough to require hospitalization. Based on these accounts and the rarity of known complications of enteric fever, we selected hospitalizations and durations of hospital stays as proxies of severity.

The proportion of children hospitalized with typhoid decreased with age, and younger children were significantly more likely to be hospitalized. While it is possible that younger children are more likely to be hospitalized than older children with the same degree of severity of the disease, the data delineate that typhoid is definitely not less severe or benign in young children. There was no difference in the durations of hospital stays between age groups, further illustrating equal severities of disease cases across age groups. Paratyphoid cases are less likely to be hospitalized than typhoid cases (21% vs 32%, respectively), and those paratyphoid patients who are hospitalized are likely to stay for a shorter duration. Although paratyphoid appears less severe than typhoid and there was no increase over the surveillance period, it is still an important disease that frequently affects young children, leads to the hospitalization of one-fourth of the affected children, and, hence, merits immediate action on prevention and control.

### Review of methods suitable for environmental surveillance of Salmonella typhi and paratyphi [^114DdWQC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The current disease burden estimate is quite imprecise because often the reported numbers are based on cases that were severe and needed hospitalization, but most patients do not develop severe symptoms and are treated by local medical practitioners or remain untreated. Knowing and acknowledging the disease burden is crucial for making informed public health decisions such as vaccine strategies, allocating resources, and monitoring the effects of interventions. However, as the burden of typhoid fever greatly varies over space and time (ie, the incidence can vary within a single city or geographical area), localized clinical surveillance data may not be easily extrapolated. Furthermore, traditional population-based study approaches to assess disease burden are resource intensive and expensive, requiring both robust laboratory infrastructure and population-based clinical data collection encompassing a substantial numbers of participants.

Given that typhoid fever is a disease that can transition between an active outbreak and a more latent/dormant endemic form, clinical surveillance alone may be inadequate for disease monitoring within a population. In such cases or in the absence of clinical surveillance, ES may be an effective tool.

### Evaluation of the clinical and microbiological response to Salmonella paratyphi A infection in the first paratyphoid human challenge model [^115D8dgE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Laboratory parameters were in keeping with those expected for acute enteric fever (Supplementary Figure 3). Among those meeting diagnostic endpoints, peripheral blood biochemistry demonstrated elevated C-reactive protein and alanine aminotransferase, while hematology revealed a modest fall in hemoglobin, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts.

We documented at least 1 positive blood culture in all participants diagnosed with paratyphoid (20/20 [100%]; median number of positive blood cultures, 5.5; range, 1–8). Median bacteremia clearance times were 2.2 days (interquartile range [IQR], 1–3.5 days) for S. Paratyphi (Figures 2 and 3). The median time from challenge to bacteremia was 5.2 days (IQR, 5.0–6.4 days) in group 1 and 7 days (IQR, 6.7–7.4 days) in group 2. Quantitative blood cultures performed prior to antibiotic treatment demonstrated median bacterial loads of 1.1 CFU/mL (range, 0–4.1 CFU/mL) in group 1 and 0.2 CFU/mL (range, 0–6.9 CFU/mL) in group 2 participants, which are comparable to those seen in cases of typhoid fever in earlier challenge studies and in endemic settings [. The rate of blood culture positive days was twice as high in S. Paratyphi A–diagnosed participants than in S. Typhi–diagnosed participants from our previous study (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.46–3.1; P < .001) (Figure 2; Table 2).

### Updated recommendations for the use of typhoid vaccine – advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2015 [^117XFiLs]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Typhoid fever is uncommon in the United States, with an average of about 400 cases reported annually during 2007–2011. Approximately 90% of U.S. cases occur among persons returning from foreign travel, and > 75% of travelers had been in India, Bangladesh, or Pakistan. Most travelers (≥ 55%) reported that their reason for travel was visiting friends or relatives. Even short-term travel to high-incidence areas is associated with risk for typhoid fever. CDC recommends typhoid vaccination for travelers to many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, but, as of 2010, no longer recommends typhoid vaccine for travelers to certain Eastern European and Asian countries; the most recent pre-travel vaccination guidelines are available at.

The importance of vaccination and other preventive measures for typhoid fever is heightened by increasing resistance of Salmonella serotype Typhi to antimicrobial agents, including fluoroquinolones, in many parts of the world.

Paratyphoid fever, caused primarily by Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi A, but also by serotypes Paratyphi B (tartrate negative) and C, is an illness clinically indistinguishable from typhoid fever. Serotype Paratyphi A is responsible for a growing proportion of enteric fever cases in many countries, accounting for as much as half of the cases. Neither typhoid vaccine available in the United States is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for prevention of paratyphoid fever, although limited observational data suggest the oral, live-attenuated Ty21a vaccine might offer some protection against Paratyphi B (tartrate negative).

No serious adverse events were reported. trial authors reported that mild reactions including nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain were observed in some participants in both treatment groups.

### Disseminated Salmonella paratyphi infection in a rheumatoid arthritis patient treated with infliximab [^117F7YHL]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha treatments are immunosuppressant and represent an important risk factor for developing infections. We report a case of Salmonella paratyphi bacteraemia associated with soft tissue infection in a patient who used infliximab and had recently travelled to India. This case report provides supporting evidence, essentially based only on case reports, that patients receiving anti-TNF-alpha treatments have an increased susceptibility to Salmonella infections, which may develop at unusual and disseminated sites. We emphasize the importance of appropriate counselling of patients undergoing anti-TNF treatment and travelling to areas in which Salmonellae are endemic, as well as the importance of advice to these patients concerning food hygiene.

### Estimating the subnational prevalence of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella enterica serovars typhi and paratyphi A infections in 75 endemic countries, 1990–2019: a modelling study [^116FA15r]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Another caveat is the timeliness of data. Our analysis provides estimates from 1990 to 2019 in endemic countries, as there is very little up-to-date data of AMR S Typhi and S Paratyphi A available and sharable. Unfortunately, the most prominent global initiative for the surveillance of bacterial pathogens, the WHO Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System (GLASS), which collates and publishes routinely collected AMR data annually (from 76 countries in 2021), reports only aggregated AMR data for Salmonella species. Therefore, we were not able to incorporate these data. It would be desirable for WHO GLASS to report AMR data for S Typhi and S Paratyphi A, as well as non-typhoidal Salmonella separately, to monitor progress.

This study provides comprehensive and detailed estimates of the prevalence of MDR, FQNS and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant S Typhi and S Paratyphi A in all 75 endemic countries, spanning the past 30 years. Our analysis highlights the worsening trends in AMR enteric fever, concerning the magnitude, geographical extent and scale of AMR, which includes the recent emergence of extensively drug-resistant S Typhi. The detailed spatial maps could also help countries to prioritise the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines into routine childhood immunisation schedules. A reduction of enteric fever incidence, or preferably elimination, would reduce the associated antibiotic use and have substantial health benefits. Lastly, this modelling framework and AMR benchmark has the potential to guide empirical treatment of enteric fever in settings, where microbiological facilities and AMR surveillance systems are scarce, and could be updated with real-time microbiology data if those became available.

### Antimicrobial resistance in typhoidal Salmonella: around the world in 3 days [^1139gzhB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

SALMONELLA ENTERICA SEROVAR PARATYPHI A: THE SIDEKICK

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are often considered a single disease, with the management of paratyphoid fever based on lessons learned from typhoid studies. However, there is growing realization in the scientific community that they are not identical diseases. For example, S. Paratyphi A (the primary cause of paratyphoid fever) has different AMR profiles than that of S. Typhi. A previous study from Bangladesh showed that MDR in Paratyphi A strains appears to be much less prevalent than in S. Typhi. Furthermore, in comparison to children with typhoid, children with paratyphoid are more likely to be older, and are more often treated in the outpatient department. As TCV does not protect against paratyphoid fever, and because S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A exhibit different AMR profiles, disease dynamics and effectiveness of empirical therapy are likely to change in the near future. Therefore, gaining further knowledge about S. Paratyphi A is crucial, and in this conference, at least 23 presentations focused on AMR trends/patterns of S. Paratyphi A in addition to S. Typhi, and 1 presentation was dedicated to Paratyphi A only.

HIV-related nontyphoidal Salmonella — treatment duration by immune status and severity: For patients with CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm³ who have mild gastroenteritis without bacteremia, 7 to 14 days of treatment is recommended (BIII), while for the same patients with bacteremia, 14 days is appropriate provided clearance is documented, with longer treatment if bacteremia persists or infection is complicated (BIII). For advanced HIV disease (CD4 count < 200 cells/mm³) with Salmonella infection, a minimum of 2 weeks with extension up to 6 weeks of antibiotics in severe disease or bacteremia is often recommended (BIII).

### Evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility profile in Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi A: presenting the current scenario in India and strategy for future management [^117Latv4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Over the last few years, several surveillance studies have attempted to estimate the enteric fever burden and the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trend from the endemic regions of India. Although these studies have managed to capture the enteric fever incidences in tertiary care centers, the peripheral areas of the healthcare system are still untouched. To understand the contributing factors, outcomes, and available treatment options of typhoid fever in India, data on the burden of enteric fever and its antimicrobial resistance profile across India need to be generated. To fill such knowledge gaps, we undertook a multicentric study — the Surveillance of Enteric Fever in India (SEFI). As part of the study objectives, we made efforts to identify the difference in the disease and AMR burden of typhoidal Salmonella with respect to different surveillance settings such as at the community level (a defined catchment area) and secondary care and tertiary care hospitals in different locations within India, the results of which are presented in this study. These data would in turn aid in formulating the antibiotic policy, implementation of typhoid conjugate vaccines, prevention and control measures.

### Spatial and temporal patterns of typhoid and paratyphoid fever outbreaks: a worldwide review, 1990–2018 [^116QcvwN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Analyses of the global spatial and temporal distribution of enteric fever outbreaks worldwide are important factors to consider in estimating the disease burden of enteric fever disease burden.

Methods

We conducted a global literature review of enteric fever outbreak data by systematically using multiple databases from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2018 and classified them by time, place, diagnostic methods, and drug susceptibility, to illustrate outbreak characteristics including spatial and temporal patterns.

Results

There were 180 940 cases in 303 identified outbreaks caused by infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A or B (S. Paratyphi). The size of outbreak ranged from 1 to 42 564. Fifty-one percent of outbreaks occurred in Asia, 15% in Africa, 14% in Oceania, and the rest in other regions. Forty-six percent of outbreaks specified confirmation by blood culture, and 82 outbreaks reported drug susceptibility, of which 54% had multidrug-resistant pathogens. Paratyphoid outbreaks were less common compared to typhoid (22 vs 281) and more prevalent in Asia than Africa. Risk factors were multifactorial, with contaminated water being the main factor.

Conclusions

Enteric fever outbreak burden remains high in endemic low- and middle-income countries and, despite its limitations, outbreak data provide valuable contemporary evidence in prioritizing resources, public health policies, and actions. This review highlights geographical locations where urgent attention is needed for enteric fever control and calls for global action to prevent and contain outbreaks.

### Redefining typhoid diagnosis: what would an improved test need to look like? [^112UCGkq]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

The 2017 Global Burden of Disease study estimated that S. Paratyphi affected 3.4 million people annually, with 19.1 thousand deaths, compared with 10.9 million cases and 116.8 thousand deaths for S. Typhi. The higher morbidity and mortality of S. Typhi makes it a greater public health concern, but the increasing prevalence of S. Paratyphi in certain regions makes it prudent for a next-generation test to detect S. Paratyphi as well as S. Typhi. Delphi survey feedback noted that not being able to detect S. Paratyphi could undermine clinician confidence in a next-generation typhoid POC test as S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi may cause indistinguishable clinical syndromes. As drug-resistant typhoid continues to spread, it may become necessary to differentiate between these two serovars prior to starting therapy due to different antibiotic susceptibility profiles.

The minimum diagnostic requirement for a typhoid RDT in this TPP was ≥ 90% sensitivity and ≥ 95% specificity, with an optimum threshold of ≥ 95% sensitivity and ≥ 98% specificity. Consensus agreement was achieved in the Delphi survey for specificity but not sensitivity, reflecting the substantial variability seen in the published literature with proposed targets ranging from 80%–90% for sensitivity and 90%–98% for specificity. The poor sensitivity of blood culture as a reference standard for typhoid diagnosis makes it difficult to accurately assess the performance of novel diagnostic tests. Diagnostic accuracy can be improved by reliably identifying alternative infections and by using a CRS that incorporates the results of multiple tests.CRSs that have been used for typhoid diagnosis include culture and/or clinical findings; culture and/or Widal test; culture and/or PCR; culture, Widal test and/or clinical finding; and culture, PCR and/or Widal test. Evaluation of CRSs has been limited by a lack of consistency between studies, with a systematic review identifying 21 studies that stated use of a CRS as the reference method for a typhoid diagnostic test, but no 2 studies utilised an identical CRS. For a CRS to be reproducible, it has been proposed that the individual test components need to be standardised, with clinical signs that match the WHO definition of suspected typhoid fever, assays that are commercially available and well-defined blood culture parameters. Further work is needed to identify a standardised CRS before it can be included in a typhoid TPP.

### Epidemiology of typhoid and paratyphoid: implications for vaccine policy [^112yrnA3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Typhoid and paratyphoid remain the most common bloodstream infections in many resource-poor settings. The World Health Organization recommends typhoid conjugate vaccines for country-specific introduction, but questions regarding typhoid and paratyphoid epidemiology persist, especially regarding their severity in young children.

Methods

We conducted enteric fever surveillance in Bangladesh from 2004 through 2016 in the inpatient departments of 2 pediatric hospitals and the outpatient departments of 1 pediatric hospital and 1 private consultation clinic. Blood cultures were conducted at the discretion of the treating physicians; cases of culture-confirmed typhoid/paratyphoid were included. Hospitalizations and durations of hospitalizations were used as proxies for severity in children < 12 years old.

Results

We identified 7072 typhoid and 1810 paratyphoid culture-confirmed cases. There was no increasing trend in the proportion of paratyphoid over the 13 years. The median age in the typhoid cases was 60 months, and 15% of the cases occurred in children < 24 months old. The median age of the paratyphoid cases was significantly higher, at 90 months (P < .001); 9.4% were in children < 24 months old. The proportion of children (< 12 years old) hospitalized with typhoid and paratyphoid (32% and 21%, respectively) decreased with age; there was no significant difference in durations of hospitalizations between age groups. However, children with typhoid were hospitalized for longer than those with paratyphoid.

Conclusions

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are common in Dhaka, including among children under 2 years old, who have equivalent disease severity as older children. Early immunization with typhoid conjugate vaccines could avert substantial morbidity, but broader efforts are required to reduce the paratyphoid burden.

Fever or bloody diarrhea — diagnostic and management recommendations state that people with fever or bloody diarrhea should be evaluated for enteropathogens for which antimicrobial agents may confer clinical benefit, including Salmonella enterica subspecies, Shigella, and Campylobacter (strong, low). Enteric fever should be considered when a febrile person (with or without diarrhea) has a history of travel to areas in which causative agents are endemic, or has laboratory exposure to Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi (strong, moderate). In this document, Salmonella Typhi represents the more formal and detailed name Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi, and Salmonella Paratyphi corresponds to the Paratyphi serovar.

### Spatial and temporal patterns of typhoid and paratyphoid fever outbreaks: a worldwide review, 1990–2018 [^117BnH6v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are potentially severe and life-threatening febrile illnesses caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A and B, respectively, collectively known as enteric fever. Despite a dramatic decline in incidence in the early 20th century due to improved sanitation and hygiene practices, enteric fever remains a pressing burden for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Accurate estimation of enteric fever incidence is an epidemiological challenge. Most health facility–based studies underestimate the true incidence, especially in countries where fewer people have access to healthcare services or in which many people seek care outside of the public health system. Lack of rapid and reliable diagnostic methods adds to the difficulty, as blood culture is time- and resource-intensive, misses at least 39% of cases, and is often not used in enteric fever confirmation in developing countries. This problem is exacerbated during outbreaks where the demand on health services may often outstrip the available capacity for culture confirmation. Moreover, reporting systems in these settings often do not capture enteric fever cases rigorously — or in many cases not at all — due to diagnostic or systemic limitations, resulting in further underestimation in country reports.

Global disease burden estimates depend on extrapolation of available incidence data from published community-based studies that cover well-defined, geographically limited areas. These community-based studies are often carried out for a short duration, are resource-intensive, and do not capture concurrent enteric fever outbreaks occurring outside the small study area. Omission of such outbreak data in global disease burden (incidence) estimates results in underestimation of the total burden. The number, size, and location of enteric fever outbreaks worldwide may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemic patterns of disease outbreaks and localize areas with higher typhoid disease burden.

Additionally, large typhoid outbreaks may be important targets for reactive vaccination campaigns. However, to date, there has been limited experience with use of vaccine amid typhoid outbreaks. A better understanding of the size, duration, geographical spread, and age distributions of outbreaks would help inform strategies for vaccine introduction to prevent or contain outbreaks.

Previous reviews on enteric fever outbreaks have focused on local issues and socioeconomic aspects at the national context but not at global levels. To address these knowledge gaps, we reviewed outbreaks over the last 27 years to characterize the global spatial and temporal distribution of enteric fever outbreaks and their risk factors.

### Comparative epidemiology of Salmonella enterica serovers paratyphi A and typhi causing enteric fever, Bangladesh, 2018–2020 [^112Db4kt]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Enteric fever is caused by Salmonella enterica serovars Paratyphi A, B, and C, which cause paratyphoid fever, and Typhi, which causes typhoid fever. Globally, an estimated 9.3 million cases and 107,459 deaths related to typhoid and paratyphoid fevers occurred in 2021; they especially affected children living in low- and middle-income countries. Although Salmonella Typhi played a major role, Salmonella Paratyphi A constituted 23.3% of enteric fever cases in South Asia countries. Preventing enteric fever by improving water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and practices remains challenging where resources are constrained, placing great reliance on antimicrobial therapy. Increasing multidrug resistance (MDR), defined as resistance to former first-line drugs including ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole), in Salmonella Typhi is hampering successful therapy. However, previous studies show that MDR rates declined before the emergence of fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible Salmonella Paratyphi A and Salmonella Typhi strains that render fluoroquinolone less suitable as first-line therapy prescribed by clinicians. Furthermore, the increase in azithromycin resistance in some settings is worrisome. Given the overlapping clinical features of Salmonella Paratyphi A infections, laboratory diagnostics are essential for distinguishing between the pathogens to guide appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Because antimicrobial resistance (AMR) makes treatment more difficult, vaccines and WASH interventions play a vital role in prevention.

World Health Organization (WHO)–approved typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) are available, and bivalent vaccines targeting both Salmonella Paratyphi A and Salmonella Typhi are in development. In this study, we analyzed data from a cluster randomized trial of Vi-tetanus (Vi-TT) toxoid conjugate vaccine, based on the Vi capsular polysaccharide of Salmonella Typhi, in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh, to assess epidemiologic features of enteric fever. We conducted this study as part of the original vaccine trial study (protocol no. PR-17115), which received ethical approval from the research review committee and the ethical review committee of icddr, b in Dhaka. No additional ethics submission was required. We obtained informed written consent from legal guardians of child participants and from adult participants.

### Burden of typhoid and paratyphoid fever in India [^112DGw5D]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

In 2017, more than half the cases of typhoid fever worldwide were projected to have occurred in India. In the absence of contemporary population-based data, it is unclear whether declining trends of hospitalization for typhoid in India reflect increased antibiotic treatment or a true reduction in infection.

Methods

From 2017 through 2020, we conducted weekly surveillance for acute febrile illness and measured the incidence of typhoid fever (as confirmed on blood culture) in a prospective cohort of children between the ages of 6 months and 14 years at three urban sites and one rural site in India. At an additional urban site and five rural sites, we combined blood-culture testing of hospitalized patients who had a fever with survey data regarding health care use to estimate incidence in the community.

Results

A total of 24,062 children who were enrolled in four cohorts contributed 46,959 child-years of observation. Among these children, 299 culture-confirmed typhoid cases were recorded, with an incidence per 100,000 child-years of 576 to 1173 cases in urban sites and 35 in rural Pune. The estimated incidence of typhoid fever from hospital surveillance ranged from 12 to 1622 cases per 100,000 child-years among children between the ages of 6 months and 14 years and from 108 to 970 cases per 100,000 person-years among those who were 15 years of age or older. Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi was isolated from 33 children, for an overall incidence of 68 cases per 100,000 child-years after adjustment for age.

Conclusions

The incidence of typhoid fever in urban India remains high, with generally lower estimates of incidence in most rural areas. (Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; NSSEFI Clinical Trials Registry of India number, CTRI/2017/09/009719; ISRCTN registry number, ISRCTN72938224.).

### Prospects of future typhoid and paratyphoid vaccines in endemic countries [^117DTWpN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Typhoid fever remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries, with evidence of a significant burden in children. With the prequalification of TCVs and Gavi funding, endemic countries have an opportunity to incorporate TCV into their national immunization programs, but more work is still needed to control paratyphoid fever.

### Enteric fever: a travel medicine oriented view [^115Dcyis]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Enteric fever continues to be an important infection among populations in endemic countries and among travelers to these areas. This review aims to describe recent epidemiological trends and developments in diagnosis, treatment and prevention.

Recent Findings

Data indicate that the burden of enteric fever is declining in many middle-income countries, whereas the bulk of cases occur in the Indian subcontinent and in south-east Asia. In these regions, Salmonella Paratyphi A is increasingly seen and sometimes surpasses Salmonella Typhi as the main pathogen. Enteric fever caused by S. Paratyphi A is indistinguishable from that caused by S. Typhi. In addition, drug resistance, including nalidixic acid/quinolone resistance now occurs in the majority of clinical isolates of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A in Asia. Currently, third generation cephalosporins and azythromycin are the only reasonable therapeutic options for most cases of travel-related enteric fever.

Summary

The ongoing emergence of S. Paratyphi A results in partial benefit from current typhoid vaccines in the prevention of enteric fever in travelers. Increasing antimicrobial resistance complicates therapy for travel-related enteric fever. New vaccines, offering protection against both agents of enteric fever, are urgently needed; however, none of the current vaccine candidates is likely to be available for several years.

Table 2.
Status of Salmonella Paratyphoid A Vaccines

Late-phase vaccine development is complicated by the low attack rate, which makes efficacy trials difficult. A controlled human infection model of S. Paratyphi has been developed by the University of Oxford. Such a model can potentially be a valuable and cost-effective way to assess the efficacy of the current paratyphoid vaccine candidates to expedite vaccine development and implementation.

As with typhoid, it will be important to monitor the burden of paratyphoid fever, especially with implementation of TCV. Antimicrobial resistance against S. Paratyphi remains a threat and surveillance should be strengthened. Further, the cost-effectiveness of the paratyphoid and bivalent vaccine over other preventive measures will need to be explored to prioritize the vaccine for global use.

### Epidemiology of typhoid and paratyphoid: implications for vaccine policy [^113jR5Es]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

An important limitation of the study is that it was not designed to actively identify suspected enteric fever cases. The use of blood cultures was dependent on the treating physicians: it likely differed between facilities and may have biased age patterns and the proportion of typhoid and paratyphoid cases. Our study included hospitalized typhoid/paratyphoid cases only from pediatric hospitals and severity analyses were conducted only in children < 12 years old. Further work is required to understand and compare the severities of the diseases in older age groups.

Important strengths of our study include (1) the large number of culture-proved cases, which allowed for robust analyses of age distributions, (2) analyses of both proportions of hospitalizations and durations of hospital stays for the assessment of severity, and (3) a long surveillance period, with data collection for many years, which confirmed consistency instead of providing snapshots of the disease. This knowledge is crucial, both to control the diseases with appropriate utilization of interventions and as baseline data for future vaccine impact studies. Monitoring the age distribution of typhoid cases and the burden of paratyphoid will be important following the introduction of TCVs.

### The relationship between blood sample volume and diagnostic sensitivity of blood culture for typhoid and paratyphoid fever: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115MFSLc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We conducted our systematic review according to an a priori-specified protocol (see, Supplement S1 & S2) and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting. One author (M. A.) performed the search and screening. The data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted in duplicate (M. A. and N.J.S.), and discrepancies were resolved through consensus or by a third reviewer (V.E.P.).

Inclusion Criteria and Search Strategy

We searched Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and PubMed Central for studies published before June 19, 2016, without additional date or language restriction. We identified relevant publications using controlled vocabulary and free text related to enteric fever and blood or bone marrow culture (see Supplement S1). We defined eligible publications as epidemiological studies of any design that assessed the sensitivity of blood culture to detect typhoid or paratyphoid among patients who also had at least 1 sample of blood and bone marrow cultured for either infection. We did not include editorials, commentaries, or reviews (see Supplement S2). We screened the title and abstract of the studies identified, confirmed eligibility by full-text review, and identified additional articles by cross-checking the references of original articles and reviews.

Data Extraction

We extracted data on the number of positive and negative blood and bone marrow cultures, as well as the volume of each sample, if reported (see Supplement S3). We also obtained data on the number of additional patients identified by positive cultures of other sites (rose spots, rectal swab, stool, urine). Because some studies did not report the concordance between blood and bone marrow culture results, we calculated the proportion of blood cultures that grew colonies of S Typhi or S Paratyphi (A, B, or C) among individuals with at least 1 positive culture from any site, thereby leveraging as many studies as possible.

Risk of Bias Assessment

We modified the QUADAS-II tool to fit our research question and assessed the risk of bias in patient recruitment, index test (blood culture), reference test (bone marrow culture), or the flow and timing of the 2 cultures (see Supplement S3).

### Integrating facility-based surveillance with healthcare utilization surveys to estimate enteric fever incidence: methods and challenges [^116B4FRg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Enteric fever, an invasive infection with Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi, is estimated to be the cause of more than 15 million illnesses and 150000 deaths annually, the vast majority of which occur in low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization recently prequalified a new typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) and issued a recommendation that TCVs be utilized in the prevention of typhoid and to be prioritized in countries with the highest burden of disease. However, the majority of countries where typhoid is believed to be endemic lack recent and geographically representative data on typhoid incidence. This may represent an obstacle to introducing typhoid vaccines, including decision making concerning which countries or subnational regions to prioritize, as well as assessment of their impact on disease burden.

The most rigorous form of infectious disease burden estimation is a prospective, community-based cohort study. This form of study, commonly used for vaccine trials, involves recruitment of healthy participants in the community who are followed closely for the development of incident typhoid fever. Because individuals with typhoid often seek medical care within days of symptom onset, studies often involve contacting each participant 2–3 times weekly to assess for the development of fever, followed by diagnostic testing for those who report fever. As the incidence of typhoid is typically < 1% per year, typhoid cohort studies typically involve enrolling tens of thousands of participants, which is costly and requires substantial research infrastructure. Consequently, this approach is relegated largely to short-term research studies and is not a sustainable approach to disease surveillance. Additionally, by actively contacting participants, diagnoses are typically made early in the disease course, prompting therapy that averts severe sequelae. This may alter the spectrum of disease toward more mild cases, which may not be representative of the severity of illness that may be seen in the absence of surveillance. For these reasons, cohort studies may be less attractive for assessing vaccine effectiveness.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever [^116F556V]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Differentiating both typhoid (Salmonella Typhi) and paratyphoid (Salmonella Paratyphi A) infection from other causes of fever in endemic areas is a diagnostic challenge. Although commercial point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for enteric fever are available as alternatives to the current reference standard test of blood or bone marrow culture, or to the widely used Widal Test, their diagnostic accuracy is unclear. If accurate, they could potentially replace blood culture as the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended main diagnostic test for enteric fever.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of commercially available rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and prototypes for detecting Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi A infection in symptomatic persons living in endemic areas.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, IndMED, African Index Medicus, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 4 March 2016. We manually searched WHO reports, and papers from international conferences on Salmonella infections. We also contacted test manufacturers to identify studies.

Selection Criteria

We included diagnostic accuracy studies of enteric fever RDTs in patients with fever or with symptoms suggestive of enteric fever living in endemic areas. We classified the reference standard used as either Grade 1 (result from a blood culture and a bone marrow culture) or Grade 2 (result from blood culture and blood polymerase chain reaction, or from blood culture alone).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the test result data. We used a modified QUADAS-2 extraction form to assess methodological quality. We performed a meta-analysis when there were sufficient studies for the test and heterogeneity was reasonable.

Main Results

Thirty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria and included a total of 5080 participants (range 50 to 1732). Enteric fever prevalence rates in the study populations ranged from 1% to 75% (median prevalence 24%, interquartile range (IQR) 11% to 46%). The included studies evaluated 16 different RDTs, and 16 studies compared two or more different RDTs. Only three studies used the Grade 1 reference standard, and only 11 studies recruited unselected febrile patients. Most included studies were from Asia, with five studies from sub-Saharan Africa. All of the RDTs were designed to detect S. Typhi infection only. Most studies evaluated three RDTs and their variants: TUBEX in 14 studies; Typhidot (Typhidot, Typhidot-M, and TyphiRapid-Tr02) in 22 studies; and the Test-It Typhoid immunochromatographic lateral flow assay, and its earlier prototypes (dipstick, latex agglutination) developed by the Royal Tropical Institute, Amsterdam (KIT) in nine studies. Meta-analyses showed an average sensitivity of 78% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71% to 85%) and specificity of 87% (95% CI 82% to 91%) for TUBEX; and an average sensitivity of 69% (95% CI 59% to 78%) and specificity of 90% (95% CI 78% to 93%) for all Test-It Typhoid and prototype tests (KIT). Across all forms of the Typhidot test, the average sensitivity was 84% (95% CI 73% to 91%) and specificity was 79% (95% CI 70% to 87%). When we based the analysis on the 13 studies of the Typhidot test that either reported indeterminate test results or where the test format means there are no indeterminate results, the average sensitivity was 78% (95% CI 65% to 87%) and specificity was 77% (95% CI 66% to 86%). We did not identify any difference in either sensitivity or specificity between TUBEX, Typhidot, and Test-it Typhoid tests when based on comparison to the 13 Typhidot studies where indeterminate results are either reported or not applicable. If TUBEX and Test-it Typhoid are compared to all Typhidot studies, the sensitivity of Typhidot was higher than Test-it Typhoid (15% (95% CI 2% to 28%), but other comparisons did not show a difference at the 95% level of CIs. In a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients presenting with fever where 30% (300 patients) have enteric fever, on average Typhidot tests reporting indeterminate results or where tests do not produce indeterminate results will miss the diagnosis in 66 patients with enteric fever, TUBEX will miss 66, and Test-It Typhoid and prototype (KIT) tests will miss 93. In the 700 people without enteric fever, the number of people incorrectly diagnosed with enteric fever would be 161 with Typhidot tests, 91 with TUBEX, and 70 with Test-It Typhoid and prototype (KIT) tests. The CIs around these estimates were wide, with no difference in false positive results shown between tests. The quality of the data for each study was evaluated using a standardized checklist called QUADAS-2. Overall, the certainty of the evidence in the studies that evaluated enteric fever RDTs was low.

Authors' Conclusions

In 37 studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for enteric fever, few studies were at a low risk of bias. The three main RDT tests and variants had moderate diagnostic accuracy. There was no evidence of a difference between the average sensitivity and specificity of the three main RDT tests. More robust evaluations of alternative RDTs for enteric fever are needed.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever [^1119a821]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Differentiating both typhoid (Salmonella Typhi) and paratyphoid (Salmonella Paratyphi A) infection from other causes of fever in endemic areas is a diagnostic challenge. Although commercial point‐of‐care rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for enteric fever are available as alternatives to the current reference standard test of blood or bone marrow culture, or to the widely used Widal Test, their diagnostic accuracy is unclear. If accurate, they could potentially replace blood culture as the World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended main diagnostic test for enteric fever.

### Evaluation of the clinical and microbiological response to Salmonella paratyphi A infection in the first paratyphoid human challenge model [^1168jzxr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

We performed a post hoc comparison of symptom data collected during earlier typhoid challenge studies and noted that paratyphoid challenge resulted in a milder disease profile than that previously observed following typhoid challenge. In our model, paratyphoid was characterized by high rates of afebrile bacteremia in groups 1 and 2 (11/20 [55%]) with minimal symptoms, which may otherwise have escaped detection in the absence of intensive sampling. Case series from the preantibiotic era reported that S. Paratyphi A caused a spectrum of clinical manifestations that "closely resembles that of mild enteric fever", and asymptomatic cases of paratyphoid infection are well described [. Although the largest published case series to date indicates that S. Typhi and Paratyphi A infections cause an indistinguishable clinical syndrome, this study was limited to patients who attended healthcare facilities and may not account for ambulatory or mild cases of paratyphoid in the community. In keeping with this, epidemiological data from endemic settings suggest that subclinical paratyphoid infection frequently occurs. In light of our challenge model data, we interpret earlier data as being supportive of the hypothesis of an underappreciated and undiagnosed burden of paratyphoid disease in the community. In a proportion of individuals, exposure to the bacillus is followed by asymptomatic bacteremia and asymptomatic stool shedding, potentially perpetuating both long- and short-cycle transmission. In keeping with this, asymptomatic shedding of S. Paratyphi A was also observed in our model, including in individuals who did not meet diagnostic criteria for paratyphoid disease.

### Evaluation of the clinical and microbiological response to Salmonella paratyphi A infection in the first paratyphoid human challenge model [^111GHUbq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In 1909, Proescher reported a case of "two individuals who accidentally swallowed a small amount of a pure culture" of Salmonella Paratyphi A and who "became ill… five and seven days after imbibing" the culture. Here, we describe the first deliberate and controlled human challenge model using a contemporary circulating strain of S. Paratyphi A. Although S. Typhi challenge studies have become well established over the past half-century, we have uniquely demonstrated that S. Paratyphi A challenge can also be undertaken safely in an outpatient setting. Challenge at a target dose of 1–5 × 10³ CFU was sufficient to achieve an attack rate of 60% in a cohort of naive volunteers, whereas challenge using a lower dose resulted in a reduced attack rate and increased time to bacteremia.

While Vi-conjugate typhoid vaccines are currently licensed in both India and China, the paratyphoid A vaccine pipeline is less well developed. The effect of future Vi-based typhoid vaccine programs on the burden of paratyphoid fever is unknown and there is conflicting evidence of serovar replacement following historical typhoid vaccination campaigns [. This presents a pressing need for accelerated paratyphoid A vaccine development, which could be facilitated by the establishment of a human paratyphoid A challenge model. In support of this, the World Health Organization has stated that well-validated challenge studies can provide "considerable supporting evidence of the efficacy" of typhoid Vi-conjugate vaccines, as well as offering insights into immunological correlates of protection. We suggest that the model described herein could fulfill an equivalent role for paratyphoid by providing a platform to assess the efficacy of paratyphoid vaccines currently in development.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Salmonella typhi is the etiological agent of typhoid fever, an acute, febrile enteric disease. Typhoid fever continues to be an important disease in many parts of the world. Travelers entering infected areas are at risk of contracting typhoid fever following the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Typhoid fever is considered to be endemic in most areas of Central and South America, the African continent, the Near East and the Middle East, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent (3). There are approximately 500 cases of typhoid fever per year diagnosed

in the United States (4). In 62% of these patients (data from 1975–1984) the disease was acquired outside of the United States while in 38% of the patients the disease was acquired within the United States (5). Of 340 cases acquired in the United States between 1977 and 1979, 23% of the cases were associated with typhoid carriers, 24% were due to food outbreaks, 23% were associated with the ingestion of contaminated food or water, 6% due to household contact with an infected person and 4% following exposure to S. typhi in a laboratory setting (6).

The majority of typhoid cases respond favorably to antibiotic therapy. However, the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains has greatly complicated therapy and cases of typhoid fever that are treated with ineffective drugs can be fatal (7). Approximately 2–4% of acute typhoid cases result in the development of a chronic carrier state (8). These non-symptomatic carriers are the natural reservoir for S. typhi and can serve to maintain the disease in its endemic state or to directly infect individuals (3).

Follow-up evaluations after laboratory-confirmed pathogen-specific diarrhea — Follow-up testing is not recommended in most people for case management following resolution of diarrhea (strong, moderate), although serial stool specimens using culture-dependent methods for Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi, STEC, Shigella, nontyphoidal Salmonella, and other bacterial pathogens are recommended in certain situations by local health authorities following cessation of diarrhea to enable return to child care, employment, or group social activities (strong, moderate), and practitioners should collaborate with local public health authorities to adhere to return policies (strong, high). A clinical and laboratory reevaluation may be indicated in people who do not respond to an initial course of therapy and should include consideration of noninfectious conditions including lactose intolerance (weak, low). Noninfectious conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), should be considered in people with symptoms lasting 14 or more days and unidentified sources (strong, moderate). Reassessment of fluid and electrolyte balance, nutritional status, and optimal dose and duration of antimicrobial therapy is recommended in people with persistent symptoms (strong, high).

### Typhoid and paratyphoid fever | Yellow book… [^1168C53b]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Infectious agent Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi, Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B, and Paratyphi C cause potentially severe and occasionally life-threatening bacteremic illnesses referred to as typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever, and collectively as enteric fever. Other Salmonella serotypes, collectively known as nontyphoidal Salmonella, typically cause gastroenteritis as the main symptom. Paratyphoid fever caused by Paratyphi B or Paratyphi C is rarely reported. Approximately 85% of typhoid fever and 80% of paratyphoid fever cases in the United States occur among international travelers; of those, more than 70% are in travelers returning from South Asia, primarily Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Other travelers with enteric fever have visited Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, or less commonly, East Asia and the Caribbean.

Fever is commonly lowest in the morning, peaking in the late afternoon or evening. Anorexia, headache, and malaise are nearly universal, and abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea are common. Diarrhea and vomiting are more common in children than in adults. People also can have dry cough, fatigue, myalgias, and sore throat. Hepatosplenomegaly often can be detected. A transient, maculopapular rash of rose spots can occasionally be seen on the trunk. Clinical diagnosis Poor sensitivity and specificity of rapid antibody tests and the time it takes to obtain a positive culture mean that the initial diagnosis must often be made clinically. Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are clinically indistinguishable. The combination of risk factors for infection and gradual onset of fever that increases in severity over several days should raise suspicion of enteric fever.

Both vaccines are unconjugated, which means the polysaccharide antigens are not paired with a protein to elicit a strong response from the immune system. Because these vaccines protect 50–80% of recipients, remind travelers that typhoid immunization is not 100% effective and take the opportunity to reinforce safe food and water precautions. Neither vaccine is licensed to prevent paratyphoid fever, although limited data from efficacy trials suggest that the Ty21a vaccine might provide some cross-protection against Paratyphi B.

### Salmonella paratyphi infection (Salmonella enterica serotypes… [^117PjZLG]. ndc.services.cdc.gov (2022). Medium credibility.

CSTE Position Statement
- 18-ID-08 Background S. Paratyphi A, B, and C are bacteria that often cause a potentially severe and occasionally life-threatening bacteremic illness. While fever and gastrointestinal symptoms are common, the clinical presentation varies, including mild and atypical infections. In the United States, approximately 80 cases of paratyphoid fever caused by S. Paratyphi A are reported each year, 90% of which are acquired during international travel. Cases of paratyphoid fever caused by serotypes S. Paratyphi B and C are reported much less frequently. Ongoing surveillance of S. Paratyphi infections is essential to detect and control outbreaks, determine public health priorities, monitor trends in illness, and assess effectiveness of public health interventions. Of note, S. Paratyphi B, previously known as S.

Java, typically causes an uncomplicated gastroenteritis, with lower rates of hospitalization and recent international travel compared with S. Paratyphi A, B, and C. For these reasons, Paratyphi B is categorized as salmonellosis instead of an S. Paratyphi Infection. Clinical Description Infections caused by Salmonella enterica serotypes Paratyphi A, B, and C are often characterized by insidious onset of sustained fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, relative bradycardia, constipation or diarrhea, and non-productive cough. However, mild and atypical infections may occur. Carriage of S. Paratyphi A, B, and C may be prolonged. Comments Persons with isolation of S. Paratyphi B from a clinical specimen should be categorized as a salmonellosis case. Several serological tests have been developed to detect antibodies to. S. Paratyphi A, B, and C.

However, no current serological test is sufficiently sensitive or specific to replace culture-based tests for the identification of S. Paratyphi infections. Whether public health follow-up for positive serologic testing is conducted and how is at the discretion of the jurisdiction. The percentage of persons with S. Paratyphi A, B, or C infections that become chronic carriers is not known.

### Clinical guidance for typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever… [^1125xWDy]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Evaluation Clinical features Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever are systemic illnesses caused by Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi, respectively. Both diseases have an insidious onset characterized by some or all of the following symptoms:

- Fever
- Headache
- Constipation or diarrhea
- Malaise
- Chills
- Myalgias
- Emesis. A transient, maculopapular rash of rose spots may be present on the trunk. Severe cases may have encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, or intestinal perforation, which typically occur after 2–3 weeks of illness. Few clinical features reliably distinguish these illnesses from a variety of other infectious diseases. Diagnosis Blood culture is the mainstay of diagnosis. Bone marrow cultures have sensitivity of 80% in some studies and can remain positive despite antibiotic therapy. Stool and urine cultures are positive less frequently. Usually, multiple cultures are needed to identify the pathogen.

Serologic tests, such as the Widal test, are not recommended because of the high rate of false positives. CDC offers testing for Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi. CDC accepts specimens for analysis only from state public health laboratories and other federal agencies. Private healthcare providers and institutions must submit specimens to their state public health laboratory for processing. Treatment Antibiotic use helps patients recover faster and lowers the risk of complications and death. High rates of antimicrobial resistance can limit treatment options. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing can help guide treatment decisions. While waiting for culture results, obtain a thorough travel history to inform empiric treatment.
- Ceftriaxone resistance is now common among travelers returning from Iraq and Pakistan. It has been observed less frequently in travelers returning from neighboring countries, including India and Afghanistan. For patients who.

traveled to Iraq or Pakistanand patients who did not travelinternationally:

- Uncomplicated illness may be treated empirically with azithromycin.
- Complicated illness may be treated empirically with a carbapenem.
- Uncomplicated illness may be treated empirically with azithromycin.
- Ceftriaxone and azithromycin remain appropriate empiric treatment options for patients returning from most countries other than Iraq and Pakistan.
- Most typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever infections diagnosed in the United States are caused by strains that are not susceptible to fluoroquinolones.
