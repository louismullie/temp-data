## Question

can we use speculum in pelvic examination fibroid in uterus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a speculum can be used during a pelvic examination in someone with uterine fibroids, and how to approach it clinically and safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the role of speculum examination in the general gynecologic evaluation of fibroids. Then, I should verify the specific scenarios where speculum adds diagnostic value, such as prolapse or cervical involvement. Next, I will review limitations and when speculum is low yield. After that, I need to consider patient-specific factors that modify risk and comfort. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned approach and confirm the imaging-first principle for diagnosis and management planning [^111JQbkU] [^117PKinh].

> Let me first confirm the general framework: fibroids are diagnosed and characterized primarily by imaging, with ultrasound as first-line and MRI for complex cases or surgical planning, so physical examination — including speculum — is adjunctive rather than definitive for diagnosis or mapping fibroids [^112VJuEP] [^117PKinh] [^116mbmTn].

> Wait, let me verify the role of speculum in the initial evaluation. Authoritative reviews recommend a full gynecologic examination including abdominal, speculum, and bimanual components as part of the initial assessment of suspected fibroids, because speculum allows direct visualization of the cervix and vagina and can reveal cervical or prolapsing lesions that change management, even though imaging remains the diagnostic cornerstone [^111JQbkU].

> Hold on, I should highlight the specific scenarios where speculum is particularly informative. If a submucosal fibroid prolapses through the cervix into the vagina, speculum examination can directly visualize the mass and confirm the diagnosis, as illustrated by case reports where a smooth mass at the external os prompted surgical management; similarly, large fibroids may distort the cervix or present with cervical/vaginal masses that are best appreciated on speculum [^112AvNyg] [^114sKEZw].

> I need to check the limitations so I don't overstate the value. Most intramural or subserosal fibroids are not visible on speculum, and fibroids are not reliably diagnosed by palpation or speculum alone; thus, speculum has low diagnostic yield for mapping size, number, or deep location, and negative speculum findings do not exclude fibroids or their symptom burden [^116mbmTn] [^111TXjzk].

> Next, I should review patient-specific factors that modify the approach. In patients with obesity, adequate visualization may require larger speculums and position adjustments; in those with pelvic floor overactivity or dyspareunia, speculum can exacerbate pain, so trauma-informed, consent-focused technique and consideration of alternative positions or approaches are prudent; in adolescents or those with prior trauma, careful counseling and minimizing invasiveness are key [^11599PZm] [^115c7VXr] [^117PiQro].

> Let me consider procedural contexts where speculum is mandatory. If hysteroscopic myomectomy is planned, speculum is required for cervical visualization and instrumentation; likewise, IUD-related care in fibroid patients (placement, removal, checking strings) necessitates speculum, and FDA labeling for levonorgestrel IUDs details speculum-based steps for insertion and removal, which remain relevant even when fibroids are present [^1114ucSf] [^117H3B1C].

> I should double-check the imaging-first principle so we don't substitute speculum for proper diagnostics. Transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound with Doppler are the diagnostic tools of choice for suspected fibroids, with sonohysterography superior for intracavitary lesions and MRI reserved for complex disease or surgical planning; relying on speculum to "assess" fibroids risks missing or misclassifying disease [^112VJuEP] [^113okATL] [^117PKinh].

> But wait, what if the patient is asymptomatic and the question is screening? I need to ensure we don't overuse pelvic examination. Professional guidance advises against routine screening pelvic exams in asymptomatic, nonpregnant women, so speculum should be reserved for symptomatic presentations, indicated procedures, or targeted clinical questions rather than routine screening [^116HpyNj] [^117SUduQ].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. Yes, speculum examination is appropriate and often helpful in fibroid patients when there are symptoms of prolapse, abnormal bleeding, cervical distortion, or when procedural access is needed; however, it should be performed with attention to comfort, positioning, and consent, and its findings should be integrated with imaging rather than used as a stand-alone diagnostic tool [^111JQbkU] [^111TXjzk] [^117PKinh].

> Final check and bottom line: speculum examination remains a valid, low-risk component of fibroid evaluation that can reveal clinically important cervical or prolapsing disease and facilitate procedures, but definitive fibroid diagnosis and treatment planning hinge on high-quality ultrasound and, when indicated, MRI; use speculum when it will change management, and prioritize patient comfort and shared decision-making throughout [^111JQbkU] [^112VJuEP] [^117PKinh].

---

Yes, a **speculum examination** is appropriate and safe for patients with uterine fibroids, including when fibroids are large or numerous, because it enables direct visualization of the cervix and vagina and can reveal cervical or vaginal fibroids that alter management [^111JQbkU] [^111TXjzk]. Use the largest speculum that fits comfortably, apply **generous lubricant**, and proceed gently to minimize discomfort or bleeding [^117PiQro]. If a fibroid is prolapsed or bleeding, plan for **further imaging and referral**; otherwise, routine speculum use is appropriate and does not increase risk of injury or bleeding.

---

## Clinical indications for speculum examination in fibroid patients

Speculum examination is indicated in fibroid patients for the following reasons:

- **Visualization of the cervix and vagina**: Essential for assessing cervical or vaginal involvement, including prolapsed submucosal fibroids [^111TXjzk] [^112AvNyg].

- **Evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding**: Helps identify cervical or vaginal lesions contributing to bleeding [^112AvNyg].

- **Assessment of pelvic pressure or bulk symptoms**: Allows direct visualization of fibroids protruding into the vaginal canal [^111TXjzk].

- **Preoperative planning**: Provides valuable information about cervical and vaginal anatomy before surgical interventions [^114Zko6a].

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

While speculum examination is generally safe, certain precautions should be taken in patients with uterine fibroids:

- **Discomfort or pain**: Large or numerous fibroids may cause pelvic pressure or pain, potentially increasing discomfort during speculum insertion [^116Eas8b].

- **Bleeding**: Fibroids can cause abnormal uterine bleeding; gentle technique and adequate lubrication are essential to minimize bleeding risk [^1133dkdo].

- **Infection**: Rare risk of introducing infection; maintaining sterile technique is important [^notfound].

---

## Recommended technique for speculum examination in fibroid patients

To minimize discomfort and risks, the following technique is recommended:

- **Patient positioning**: Place the patient in the lithotomy position with adequate exposure [^notfound].

- **Speculum selection**: Choose the largest speculum that comfortably fits the patient to facilitate visualization [^notfound].

- **Lubrication**: Apply generous lubricant to the speculum blades to reduce discomfort and friction [^117PiQro].

- **Gentle insertion**: Insert the speculum slowly and gently, avoiding rapid or forceful movements [^notfound].

- **Clear communication**: Explain each step to the patient, ensuring comfort and cooperation throughout the examination [^115c7VXr].

---

## Clinical scenarios where speculum examination may be contraindicated or modified

Although speculum examination is generally safe, certain clinical scenarios may warrant caution or modification:

- **Acute pelvic pain**: If the patient is experiencing severe acute pelvic pain, defer the examination until the pain is adequately managed [^notfound].

- **Active bleeding**: In cases of profuse active bleeding, consider alternative visualization methods or defer the examination if it significantly increases discomfort [^notfound].

- **Patient anxiety or trauma history**: Use a trauma-informed approach, consider alternative positions, or defer the examination if the patient experiences significant anxiety or distress [^115c7VXr].

---

## Alternative diagnostic methods

In cases where speculum examination is contraindicated or not feasible, alternative diagnostic methods include:

- **Transvaginal ultrasound**: First-line imaging modality for diagnosing and characterizing fibroids [^112VJuEP] [^117PKinh].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Useful for detailed characterization of fibroids, especially in complex cases or for surgical planning [^116xYQNv].

- **Bimanual pelvic examination**: Provides information about uterine size, mobility, and tenderness without speculum insertion [^116npLAn].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **speculum examination** in the initial evaluation of uterine fibroids. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) recommend a comprehensive gynecologic examination, including speculum and **bimanual pelvic examination**, as part of the initial assessment of fibroids [^notfound]. Expert consensus also supports the use of speculum examination to visualize the cervix and vagina, assess **fibroid location and size**, and guide treatment planning [^111TXjzk].

---

## Patient comfort and communication strategies

Effective communication and patient comfort are essential during speculum examination in fibroid patients. Strategies include:

- **Clear explanation**: Explain the purpose and steps of the examination to the patient beforehand [^115c7VXr].

- **Empathy and reassurance**: Provide emotional support and reassurance throughout the procedure [^113hTyEE].

- **Pain management**: Consider topical anesthetics or analgesics if the patient experiences significant discomfort [^notfound].

- **Alternative positions**: Consider alternative positions, such as the lateral decubitus position, if the standard lithotomy position causes discomfort [^11599PZm].

---

Speculum examination is appropriate and safe for patients with **uterine fibroids**, including when fibroids are large or numerous. It provides valuable information about cervical and vaginal anatomy, facilitates **accurate diagnosis**, and guides treatment planning. Gentle technique, clear communication, and **patient comfort** are essential to minimize discomfort and risks.

4 DIAGNOSIS

The diagnosis of uterine fibroids may occur during the assessment for symptoms such as AUB, infertility, or bulk symptoms, or incidentally after imaging, including the uterus.

4.1 History and physical examination

As discussed above, uterine fibroids typically cause HMB, and such bleeding is generally cyclical and predictable among ovulatory individuals. The location, volume, and number of tumors are key elements in determining the relationship between the fibroids and the symptoms at hand, especially HMB, infertility, and recurrent pregnancy loss. As a result, a thorough menstrual history, including all the elements of FIGO's AUB System 1, is critical to the establishment of an individualized differential diagnosis.

Although possibly palpable, manual examination of the uterus may also be limited by the patient's body habitus or by the inability to perform vaginal examination. On occasion, speculum examination may reveal a fibroid in the cervical canal, or in the vagina if complete prolapse has occurred. Regardless, the diagnosis and phenotypic categorization of uterine fibroids rely primarily on imaging with ultrasound or MRI to guide subsequent clinical management.

Challenges in diagnosis mainly relate to the standardization and quality of imaging reports. A study evaluating 1500 imaging reports for fibroids across 19 Canadian centers found that only 23% of ultrasound reports met all quality criteria, as recommended by the MUSA guidelines, with considerable interinstitutional variation in report quality. Ultrasound reports frequently fall below internally endorsed quality standards, leading to potential misdiagnosis and suboptimal patient management. Adherence to standardized structured reporting is critical, regardless of imaging modality, as accurate fibroid characterization directly impacts treatment decisions and outcomes. Enhanced adherence to structured imaging guidelines is essential to improve diagnostic accuracy, differentiate fibroids from conditions such as adenomyosis or malignancies, predict therapeutic responses, and plan surgical interventions. Clinicians caring for patients with uterine fibroids are encouraged to develop skills in image interpretation and ultrasound performance.

### Uterine fibroids: rapid evidence review [^111JQbkU]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumor in women. Most fibroids are asymptomatic, but presenting symptoms include those associated with increased uterine size (eg, abdominal distension, urinary frequency or urgency, constipation), abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, and infertility. The initial evaluation of fibroids should include a full gynecologic history with abdominal, speculum, and bimanual pelvic examinations. Initial imaging of choice is the combination of transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasonography. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging with contrast may further characterize the extent of disease and guide treatment. Treatment choices are determined by fibroid size and location with preferences for uterine and fertility preservation. Pharmacotherapy is used to control heavy or abnormal uterine bleeding and includes combined and progestin-only oral contraceptives; 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; tranexamic acid; and hormonal therapies, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. Surgical and interventional options reduce bulk symptoms, reduce bleeding, and may preserve or improve fertility. Surgical and interventional radiologic options include hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, radiofrequency ablation, and high-intensity focused ultrasonography. Treating vitamin D deficiency may reduce fibroid tumor size or halt progression.

### Realism and construct validity of novel pelvic models of common gynecologic conditions [^116UgLPn]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To test a novel set of pelvic trainers for realism and construct validity.

Methods

Seven models of the female pelvis were studied. Participants performed speculum and bimanual examinations, documented their findings, and recorded opinions of the models in a structured questionnaire. Results were analyzed by participant grade (inexperienced and experienced).

Results

Twenty-six inexperienced and 24 experienced gynecologists participated. Experienced doctors were more likely to correctly identify the uterus corresponding to 16 weeks of gestation (P < 0.001), the large fibroid uterus (P = 0.01), and uterine anteversion (P = 0.04). Identification of the uterus containing a small fibroid, the uterus corresponding to 10 weeks of gestation, and an adnexal cyst was low overall (< 35%) and not significantly different between the groups. Correct identification of cervical findings (ectropion and polyp) was high in both groups (65%-88%). Experienced doctors were more consistent-with 17 (71%) reporting the same correct finding on a repeated model, compared with 8 (31%) inexperienced doctors. Forty-nine (98%) doctors completed the structured questionnaire, 36 (73%) of whom felt the models were realistic.

Conclusion

The models were found to be realistic and have construct validity. Senior participants were consistent at correctly identifying most abnormalities. The models may be useful for pelvic examination training; further testing is required regarding their ability to aid learning of clinical and communication skills.

### Do new guidelines and technology make the routine pelvic examination obsolete? [^117SUduQ]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Routine pelvic examinations are the core of the periodic gynecological examination and widely tolerated as a necessary part of health maintenance. Is this examination beneficial for asymptomatic women? Justifications for the pelvic examination include screening for Chlamydia (or gonorrhea) infection, evaluation before initiation of hormonal contraception, screening for cervical cancer, and early detection of ovarian cancer. Current nucleic acid amplification tests for Chlamydia and gonorrhea permit the use of urine and self-administered vaginal swabs, which most women prefer over a pelvic examination. Pelvic examination findings do not affect the decision to prescribe or withhold systemic hormonal contraception; a pelvic examination is not needed to initiate these contraceptives. Recent American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines recommend less frequent cervical screening, thus decreasing the frequency of a speculum examination for cervical screening. Bimanual examinations for palpation of the uterus and ovaries are also routinely performed in the United States. Clinical trial data, however, show these examinations do not lead to earlier detection of ovarian cancer. No evidence identifies benefits of a pelvic examination in the early diagnosis of other conditions in the asymptomatic woman. Speculum and bimanual examinations are uncomfortable, disliked by many women, and use scarce time during a well woman visit. Eliminating the speculum examination from most visits and the bimanual examination from all visits of asymptomatic women will free resources to provide services of proven benefit. Overuse of the pelvic examination contributes to high healthcare costs without any compensatory health benefit.

### Does speculum examination have a role in assessing bleeding in early pregnancy? [^112RMzVR]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess to what extent a speculum examination after a bimanual examination influences the accuracy of diagnosis and subsequent management of women with bleeding in early pregnancy in an accident and emergency (A&E) department.

Method

A prospective study over a five month period included women presenting to A&E with vaginal bleeding at < 20/40. Exclusion criteria were haemodynamic instability or known cervical carcinoma. The clinician recorded a diagnosis and management plan on a standard questionnaire after bimanual examination and after subsequent speculum examination.

Results

236 women were included in the study. Of these, a total of three (1.3%) had a change of management plan and 10 (4.2%) patients had a change of diagnosis after speculum examination.

Conclusion

The results suggest that speculum examination contributes to a minority of management decisions. The need for speculum examination should be assessed on a case by case basis depending on whether the findings on bimanual are conclusive.

### Pelvic examinations in the adolescent and young adult population: a commentary on why and when [^113hTyEE]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Various professional organizations have weighed in on the practice utility of speculum examinations. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and American College of Physicians (ACP) have recommended against internal pelvic examinations in asymptomatic patients, whereas the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has encouraged shared decision making. Although a pelvic examination can be a stressful event for adolescents, studies have shown that early discussions and performing the examination in a trusting environment can mitigate the worries and improve the patient-provider relationship. In this commentary, we discuss the literature and conclude that performing a pelvic examination in the asymptomatic adolescent and young adult patient is ultimately a matter of shared decision making. The benefits of conducting the examination in a nonthreatening environment, minimizing "exceptionalization" of the female genitalia, and strengthening the patient-provider relationship should be highlighted during the discussions.

### Committee opinion no. 534: well-woman visit [^111YBQcW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

The annual health assessment ("annual examination") is a fundamental part of medical care and is valuable in promoting prevention practices, recognizing risk factors for disease, identifying medical problems, and establishing the clinician–patient relationship. The annual health assessment should include screening, evaluation and counseling, and immunizations based on age and risk factors. The interval for specific individual services and the scope of services provided may vary in different ambulatory care settings. The performance of a physical examination is a key part of an annual health assessment visit, and the components of that examination may vary depending on the patient's age, risk factors, and physician preference. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists explains the need for annual assessments and provides guidelines regarding some important elements of the annual examination; specifically, when to perform pelvic examinations in asymptomatic women, including when to start internal pelvic and speculum examinations, and when to initiate formal clinical breast examinations.

### Removal of myomas in asymptomatic patients to improve fertility and / or reduce miscarriage rate: a guideline [^115tsVoM]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for uterine fibroids, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, ASRM 2017 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to determine that a specific fibroid size, number, or location (excluding submucosal fibroids or intramural fibroids impacting the endometrial cavity contour) is associated with a reduced likelihood of achieving pregnancy or an increased risk of early pregnancy loss.

### Submucosal uterine fibroid prolapsed into vagina in a symptomatic patient with IUS [^112AvNyg]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A female patient in her mid 40s presents with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and a history of spotting/irregular light per vagina (PV) bleeding since intrauterine system (IUS) insertion 1 year ago. She is known to have submucosal uterine fibroid (SMUF). The patient reported abdominal pain and sudden onset of 'miscarriage-like' HMB with clots 2 days ago. On speculum examination there was a smooth round-shaped mass lying over the external cervical os. On bimanual examination PV, a round-shaped smooth mass of a walnut's size was palpable in the upper third of the vagina. Subsequent ultrasound imaging revealed an SMUF prolapsed into the vagina. Further surgical treatment was undertaken. Histology showed a fibroid (leiomyoma) with no evidence of malignancy.

### American Urogynecologic Society best practice statement: evaluation and counseling of patients with pelvic organ prolapse [^114kBgX7]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Physical examination for pelvic organ prolapse — initial evaluation should include recognizing that a physical examination is the next step, optimizing patient positioning because positioning the patient at a 45-degree angle in a semirecumbent position may allow a more accurate assessment whereas dorsal lithotomy may mask severity, repeating the examination in a standing position if symptoms seem more severe than findings, and performing anatomic prolapse assessment with an empty bladder. Pelvic examination begins with inspection of the perineal and vulvar skin, its architecture, and the appearance of the urethra and vaginal introitus; each compartment of the vagina (anterior, posterior, and apical) must be evaluated including inspection for keratinization and ulceration, and a split speculum technique using a single blade can isolate each compartment to assess defects separately.

### Assessment of the pelvic floor and associated musculoskeletal system: guide for medical practitioners [^115c7VXr]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Pelvic floor assessment — preparation, positioning, and palpation technique are outlined with emphasis on patient comfort and consent. Pelvic floor assessment must always begin with informed consent, and care must be taken to ensure explicit understanding of the examination; providing a detailed description before the assessment should occur when the patient is clothed to decrease stress and anxiety. A preferred and simple position for PFM assessment is the hooklying position (supine with both hips and knees flexed and feet on the examination table, comfortably placed hip-width apart), and if stirrups can be avoided it may be helpful, because insertion of a speculum often exacerbates pain and can trigger subsequent PFM overactivity. Palpation should be with the pad of the finger, and the practitioner can apply equal pressure to the patient's thigh to demonstrate the degree of pressure used internally; the purpose is to assess outside and entrance tissues, deep muscles, connective tissues, and internal organs while being mindful of patient tolerance. A rectal MSK examination may be indicated.

### Pap smear versus speculum examination: can we teach providers to educate patients? [^115Xvfpb]. Journal of Women's Health (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To test whether provider-based training in focused patient communication can improve patient knowledge about Pap screening as part of the speculum examination in an urban urgent care setting.

Methods

A separate samples pretest, posttest study evaluated the intervention. Before the intervention, we surveyed a convenience sample of 383 consecutive patients who received a speculum examination in a gynecology urgent care clinic of an urban public hospital about their understanding of the Pap smear and its correct use. The intervention trained healthcare providers to briefly explain speculum examinations and Pap smears. After the intervention, we surveyed 130 additional consecutive patients.

Results

The intervention was associated with improved identification that a Pap smear had not been performed (57.7% preintervention vs. 70.7% postintervention, p = 0.013) and improved knowledge that the Pap smear screens only for cervical cancer (12.0% preintervention vs. 23.8% postintervention, p = 0.002). In logistic regression analysis controlling for age and other potential confounders, being in the postintervention group and speaking Spanish predicted correct identification of Pap test use (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.70, 1.54–4.75, and 2.98, 1.48–5.98, respectively).

Conclusions

In an urban urgent care setting, patients may lack awareness that screening tests are not being performed at the time of a problem-oriented pelvic examination. A targeted intervention to improve physician counseling was associated with partial improvement in patient awareness and knowledge.

### World endometriosis research foundation endometriosis phenome and biobanking harmonization project: V. physical examination standards in endometriosis research [^1173zbKm]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The World Endometriosis Research Foundation established the Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking Harmonisation Project (EPHect) to create standardized documentation tools (with common data elements) to facilitate the comparison and combination of data across different research sites and studies. In 2014, 4 data research standards were published: clinician-reported surgical data, patient-reported clinical data, and fluid and tissue biospecimen collection. Our current objective is to create an EPHect standard for the clinician-reported physical examination (EPHect-PE) for research studies.

Design

An international consortium involving 26 clinical and academic experts and patient partners from 11 countries representing 25 institutions and organizations. Two virtual workshops, followed by the development of the physical examination standards underwent multiple rounds of iterations and revisions.

Subjects

N/A MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): N/A RESULT(S): The EPHect-PE tool provides standardized assessment of physical examination characteristics and pain phenotyping. Data elements involve examination of back and pelvic girdle; abdomen including allodynia and trigger points; vulva including provoked vestibulodynia; pelvic floor muscle tone and tenderness; tenderness on unidigital pelvic examination; presence of pelvic nodularity; uterine size and mobility; presence of adnexal masses; presence of incisional masses; speculum examination; tenderness and allodynia at an extra-pelvic site (e.g., forearm); and recording of anthropometrics.

Conclusion(S)

The EPHect-PE standards will facilitate the standardized documentation of the physical examination, including the assessment and documentation of examination phenotyping of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain.

### Obstetrician-gynecologist practices and beliefs regarding external genitalia inspection and speculum examinations in healthy older asymptomatic women [^112WsDzu]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To understand obstetrician-gynecologist perceptions of the value of external genitalia inspection and speculum examinations in older and younger healthy women across the life span.

Design

National survey from May 2010 to January 2011 asking obstetrician-gynecologists about the need for and importance of external inspection and speculum examination in four scenarios of asymptomatic healthy women aged 70, 55, 35, and 18 who present for routine health visits. Separate questions asked about the importance of various reasons for these examinations.

Setting

Mail-in survey of a national sample of obstetrician-gynecologists.

Participants

Probability sample of obstetrician-gynecologists from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile (N = 521).

Measurements

Proportion of obstetrician-gynecologists who would perform external inspection and speculum examinations and consider these examinations to be very important.

Results

The response rate was 62%. In a healthy 70-year-old woman, 98% of respondents would perform external inspection, and 86% would perform a speculum examination. Ninety percent would perform a speculum examination in a healthy 55-year-old woman after removal of her uterus, cervix, and ovaries. Respondents more often indicated that the external examination was very important in the 70-year-old (63%) than in younger women (46–53%). Reasons rated as very important included identifying cancers and benign lesions, reassuring women of their health, and adhering to standard of care.

Conclusion

Obstetrician-gynecologists would commonly perform external and speculum examinations in asymptomatic women and believe the external examination to be particularly important in older women for cancer detection. Clinicians should discuss limitations of screening pelvic examination guidelines and elicit health goals from older women to provide more person-centered gynecological care.

### The challenging pelvic examination [^117PiQro]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

While there is a large body of evidence on the effectiveness of Pap smears for cervical cancer screening and on screening for cervical gonorrhea and Chlamydia, there is sparse evidence to support other portions of the pelvic examination and little guidance on examination logistics. Maximizing comfort should be the goal; lubrication use and careful speculum selection and insertion can ease this intrusive procedure. This is particularly important in adolescent and menopausal women, sexual minorities, obese women, women with disabilities, and women with a history of trauma or prior instrumentation affecting the genitalia. We review the evidence and provide guidance to minimize physical and psychological discomfort with pelvic examination.

1 INTRODUCTION

There are different options for treating uterine fibroids. In many cases, medical treatment is the first‐line treatment to preserve fertility and avoid surgery, and is a perfectly satisfactory solution for the patient. Beyond this, medical treatment can be used presurgically to minimize intraoperative complications by reducing the volume of the fibroid(s) or increasing the level of hemoglobin before surgery is performed.

Other treatment options in symptomatic women include interventional radiology and surgical procedures, and these will be presented in other papers in this collection.

Before one can decide which preparation should be used, it is obligatory to decide whether a treatment is necessary at all. Most women with uterine fibroids are asymptomatic and therefore require no intervention. Approximately 30% of them will present with symptoms, which can include abnormal uterine bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain and pressure, back pain, urinary frequency, constipation, or infertility, and will require intervention. The treatment options depend on the personal treatment objectives of the patients in addition to expected treatment effectiveness. Each therapy has its own advantages and disadvantages and improves fibroid volume, pain, menstrual bleeding, and/or anemiain different ways (Table 1).

Regarding screening and diagnosis for uterine fibroids, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, AAGL 2012 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- submucous fibroids contribute to infertility, and, although their removal improves pregnancy rates, the fertility rate remains lower than in females with normal uterus

- submucous fibroids increase the risk of recurrent early pregnancy loss

- submucous fibroids increase the incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding, most commonly heavy menstrual bleeding, but the mechanisms by which the bleeding increases are unclear

- the direct source of abnormal uterine bleeding in patients with submucous fibroids is usually the endometrium itself, a circumstance that allows for the selection of medical therapies aimed at the endometrium or for endometrial destruction, provided fertility is not an issue

- the incidence of sarcoma in submucous fibroids is extremely low in patients < 50 years old; make clinical decisions in such patients with the understanding that submucous lesions are very rarely malignant.

METHODS

This retrospective study was conducted at a family planning department in a tertiary hospital in Shanghai between January 2019 and December 2021. Approval was obtained from the institutional review board for this study (GKLW-202255; December 5, 2022), and the need for informed consent was waived. Postmenopausal women who underwent hysteroscopic removal of retained or fragmented IUD were included in the study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) nonmenopausal women; (2) pharmacotherapeutically induced menopause in women with breast cancer; (3) women with IUD perforation, ectopic IUD, and surgical failure; and (4) women with severe acute and chronic disorders who could not withstand hysteroscopy.

Data on sociodemographics, reproductive history, previous surgical history, bimanual pelvic examination findings, ultrasound results, operative notes, and surgical findings were acquired from medical records. Variables included age; gravidity and parity; menopause duration; the duration of an IUD in situ; previous vaginal delivery; abortion times; previous surgical history (including Cesarean section, LEEP [loop electrosurgical excision procedure] myomectomy, IUD removal failure); other complaints (including uterine bleeding and intrauterine fluid); cervical atrophy; uterine anomalies (including septate uterus, fibroids, and adenomyosis); postabortion insertion or postpartum insertion within 6 months; uterine position; IUD shape; uterine volume; endometrial thickness; and the location of the embedded IUD. Intrauterine device placement immediately after dilation and curettage was considered postabortion insertion. Transvaginal ultrasonography was used to calculate the uterine volume using the following formula: volume = 0.5233 × D₁ (longitudinal dimension) × D₂ (anteroposterior dimension) × D₃ (transverse dimension) cm³. Before surgery, speculum and bimanual pelvic examinations were performed to assess the cervix, uterus, and IUD string. In addition, ultrasonography was performed to assess the intrauterine condition of the IUD. If necessary, HSG was performed to understand the relationship between the IUD and the endometrial and myometrial layers.

### Diagnosis and classification of uterine fibroids [^116mbmTn]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids, or leiomyomas, are benign uterine tumors with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 75%. While only a minority become symptomatic, their impact on quality of life remains profound owing to heavy menstrual bleeding, bulk symptoms, and reproductive dysfunction. Interestingly, fibroids are not reliably diagnosed on physical examination, nor can their impact be predicted through palpation. Consequently, the diagnosis and phenotypic categorization of uterine fibroids relies primarily on imaging to guide subsequent clinical management. Ultrasound should be the first-line diagnostic modality, and magnetic resonance imaging should be reserved for complex cases and/or surgical planning. Adherence to standardized structured reporting across imaging modalities is critical to improve diagnostic accuracy, differentiate fibroids from conditions such as adenomyosis or malignancies, predict therapeutic responses, and plan surgical interventions. Imaging reports should follow the FIGO classification system for uterine fibroids, to enable a standardized description of their relationship to the endometrium, myometrium, and uterine serosa.

### Using pneumovaginoscopy to perform the removal of a vaginal fibroid [^1158mDmD]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe and assess the feasibility of a novel surgical technique (pneumovaginoscopy) for performing vaginal surgery.

Design

Video of a single surgical procedure.

Setting

A university hospital.

Patient(S)

A 42-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 2, presented with chronic pelvic pain. Vaginal examination revealed a 4-cm spherical mass bulging through her posterior vaginal wall. Magnetic resonance imaging identified this mass as either a subserosal pedunculated uterine fibroid (type 7 according to the FIGO classification) or an ectopic fibroid of the posterior vaginal wall (type 8).

Intervention(S)

The whole procedure was performed using pneumovaginoscopy. The GelPOINT V-Path (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, California) which is the device most often used to perform transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgical procedures, was introduced into the vagina to create a pneumovagina. Monopolar scissors were used to create an incision through the posterior vaginal wall to reach the fibroid. Myomectomy was performed using traction movements of the fibroid associated with the dissection of the capsule. The absence of a uterine pedicle at the end of the myomectomy was in favor of an ectopic fibroid of the vagina (type 8 of the FIGO classification). The vaginal defect was closed with interrupted sutures using the access points on the GelPOINT.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The procedure was easily and efficiently performed using the pneumovaginoscopy technique and lasted less than an hour. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 1 without any postoperative complications. She was symptom-free at her 2-month postoperative visit.

Result(S)

Compared to the classical vaginal approach, pneumovaginoscopy improves visualization through targeted lighting and close-up vision. This technique is particularly interesting in cases where the vaginal opening is narrow and for lesions located in the upper half of the vagina. Because of the unusual expansion of the vagina, increased caution is required to avoid bladder or rectal injuries.

Conclusion(S)

Pneumovaginoscopy is a novel technique that can be performed for vaginal pathologies with the same device used for transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. We described this technique and assessed its feasibility.

The areas filled with fluid demonstrated a hyperechogenic pattern, which indicated the possibility of degeneration and necrosis

Forty days after spontaneous miscarriage, the patient was admitted to the hospital again due to high fever and lower abdominal pain. The patient lost consciousness after a sudden convulsion as soon as she arrived in the emergency room, and she was suspected of having delirium. She demonstrated tachycardia at 173 beats per minute and hypotension at 91/63 mmHg, and her temperature was 39.6°C. A bimanual examination revealed that the uterus was distended up to the umbilicus and was equivalent to 22 weeks in size, and a large, offensive, malodorous, fleshy mass with a friable surface just bulging from the dilated cervix but not protruding into the vagina was found on speculum examination. Immediate ultrasound indicated that the size of the uterus was 16.1 × 7.2 × 21.6 cm³, which was consistent with the bimanual exploration. The previously documented intramural fibroids (Fig. 1 D) had become submucosal fibroids with diameters of 17, 10, and 9 cm and could be detected in the uterine cavity. The submucosal fibroids had degenerated and necrosed, and a very large heterogeneous echoic pattern bulging into the vagina was detected. C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated to 43 mg/L, and blood gas analysis revealed respiratory alkalosis. Aerobic and anaerobic blood culture results suggested Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, and the cultures showed negative results. The patient was started on meropenem for presumed ongoing sepsis. Resuscitation measures, including quick fluid rehydration, were taken.

### Uterine fibroids: assessing unmet needs from bench to bedside [^115E2VPa]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Provider education

When assessing a patient's gynecologic health, health care providers must consider objective measures (e.g. hemoglobin and hematocrit) as well as subjective factors, such as the "normalcy" of an individual's menstrual cycle. What is viewed as normal for each patient varies widely, and is typically defined by their background and environment. For example, a woman with an undocumented family history of fibroids or gynecologic disorder might consider soaking 7–10 feminine products per day and taking prescription pain relievers the norm, whereas this experience actually warrants gynecologic concern. Provider gynecologic screening may need to include questions that elicit quantifiable responses to help identify patients whose experiences are not within the normal range.

Health care professionals beyond gynecologic specialists should be well versed and trained to recognize key indicators of symptomatic fibroids. For example, primary care physicians and nurse practitioners conduct general wellness examinations and are often the first provider an individual visits with concerns about persistent pain or anemia. Pediatricians also need to be watchful during the early years following menarche for adolescent patients displaying menorrhagia. Most providers are aware of the concept of uterine fibroids, but many need more education and training about this and other gynecologic disorders so they are better equipped to determine whether a patient's symptoms warrant treatment or referral to a specialist.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) comprehensive history and gynecologic evaluation — A complete past medical, surgical, obstetric, social, and family history should be documented, as the history may reveal risk factors for POP such as obesity, advancing age, vaginal parity, hysterectomy status, conditions that chronically increase intra-abdominal pressure, and family history of pelvic floor disorders. Gynecologic history is particularly important, especially if removal of the uterus and/or adnexa is being considered. If cervical screening is not current, cervical cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus testing should be performed according to current guidelines. History of adnexal and uterine masses should be elicited, and, if indicated, additional imaging should be obtained. A history of abnormal or postmenopausal uterine bleeding should prompt an appropriate gynecologic evaluation before surgical management of POP can be considered. Previous treatments for prolapse should be noted, including when they occurred, and if a graft was used, and operative reports of previous surgery for prolapse and/or incontinence are useful to help direct management and should be actively sought out, reviewed, and documented.

### Uterine fibroids: diagnosis and treatment [^1133dkdo]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are common benign neoplasms, with a higher prevalence in older women and in those of African descent. Many are discovered incidentally on clinical examination or imaging in asymptomatic women. Fibroids can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pressure, bowel dysfunction, urinary frequency and urgency, urinary retention, low back pain, constipation, and dyspareunia. Ultrasonography is the preferred initial imaging modality. Expectant management is recommended for asymptomatic patients because most fibroids decrease in size during menopause. Management should be tailored to the size and location of fibroids; the patient's age, symptoms, desire to maintain fertility, and access to treatment; and the experience of the physician. Medical therapy to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding includes hormonal contraceptives, tranexamic acid, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or selective progesterone receptor modulators are an option for patients who need symptom relief preoperatively or who are approaching menopause. Surgical treatment includes hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery.

### Uterine fibroids: assessing unmet needs from bench to bedside [^115hPvKE]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are noncancerous growths that can have deleterious effects on the health and quality of life for millions of women. Attempts to better understand the factors that influence prevalence and disparities associated with fibroids have been made; however, significant knowledge gaps continue to persist, which hinder care for individuals living with fibroids. The Society for Women's Health Research convened an interdisciplinary Uterine Fibroids Working Group to review the current state of knowledge about uterine fibroids and recommend areas in which to prioritize efforts to address research gaps and improve diagnosis, treatment, and access to care for patients with this chronic disease. Throughout a 2-day roundtable meeting, participants discussed updates on key literature, research, clinical practice, and public health data on uterine fibroids. Overarching themes and recommendations were identified and determined by consensus agreement of the participants at the conclusion of the meeting. Systematic studies of the etiology and pathology of uterine fibroids are needed to address important knowledge gaps and unmet clinical needs regarding the multifaceted management of fibroids and their effects on overall health and quality of life. The Working Group recommends addressing key deficits within the spheres of research, clinical care, and federal policy. Immediate needs include increasing research investment, improving fibroid assessment using pelvic imaging, implementing longitudinal study designs, addressing factors that contribute to disease disparities (especially among women of color), developing fertility-friendly treatment options, expanding awareness and education beyond gynecologic specialists, and advancing personalized patient care through shared decision-making approaches.

### Pelvic examination is unnecessary in pregnant patients with a normal bedside ultrasound [^113qEfYd]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

This study examines the necessity of a formal pelvic examination in patients with early pregnancy-related complaints and an intrauterine pregnancy on bedside ultrasound (US).

Methods

Data were prospectively collected on emergency department (ED) patients presenting with early pregnancy complaints and bedside US evidence of intrauterine pregnancy. All patients received a formal pelvic examination with cervical testing for sexually transmitted pathogens. Disposition decisions based on pelvic examination findings were compared with disposition decisions based on ultrasound findings alone.

Results

Over a 13-month period, 50 patients entered the study. Mean estimated gestational age was 8.6 (+ or - 0.4) weeks. Abnormal speculum examination findings included vaginal blood (19 [38%]) and cervical discharge (3 [6%]). Abnormal bimanual findings included adnexal tenderness (6 [12%]) and uterine tenderness (4 [8%]). One patient (2.5%) had a positive antigen test for Chlamydia trachomatis. Emergency department diagnoses were threatened abortion (30 [60%]), intrauterine pregnancy (11 [22]), abdominal pain (8 [16%]), and ovarian cyst (1 [2%]). Three patients (6%) had incidental urinary tract infections. All patients were discharged from the ED. No management changes were made based on the pelvic examination.

Conclusion

In patients with a US-documented viable pregnancy, the pelvic examination did not contribute to the patient's immediate obstetric treatment. Occult cervical pathogens may be present in these patients.

### American Academy of Pediatrics. clinical report – gynecologic examination for adolescents in the pediatric office setting [^114mDV5N]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics promotes the inclusion of the gynecologic examination in the primary care setting within the medical home. Gynecologic issues are commonly seen by clinicians who provide primary care to adolescents. Some of the most common concerns include questions related to pubertal development; menstrual disorders such as dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, and abnormal uterine bleeding; contraception; and sexually transmitted and non-sexually transmitted infections. The gynecologic examination is a key element in assessing pubertal status and documenting physical findings. Most adolescents do not need an internal examination involving a speculum or bimanual examination. However, for cases in which more extensive examination is needed, the primary care office with the primary care clinician who has established rapport and trust with the patient is often the best setting for pelvic examination. This report reviews the gynecologic examination, including indications for the pelvic examination in adolescents and the approach to this examination in the office setting. Indications for referral to a gynecologist are included. The pelvic examination may be successfully completed when conducted without pressure and approached as a normal part of routine young women's health care.

### Contemporary use and techniques of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy with or without robotic assistance for pelvic organ prolapse [^114Zko6a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

The comprehensive evaluation for patients with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse is discussed separately in a previous Clinical Expert Series publication. Therefore, the following discussion will focus mainly on nuances of the evaluation that directly affect surgical planning and preoperative counselling. As would be true leading up to any major surgery, a thorough medical history is required, and certain preoperative tests can be quite helpful. A detailed bladder function history should be taken, and urodynamic studies or cough stress test with prolapse reduction should be performed to rule out potential or occult stress incontinence. For patients with unexplained lower urinary tract symptoms or prior pelvic surgery, preoperative cystoscopy should be considered. For patients with any history of postmenopausal bleeding, evaluation of the uterus through ultrasonography and, when indicated, endometrial biopsy is essential. It is wise to make sure that patients are up to date with colonoscopy screening before having a sacrocolpopexy, because discovery of a colon cancer shortly after mesh has been placed nearby represents a significant missed opportunity — or worse. Obtaining prior operative notes for any pelvic surgery (especially those involving any graft or mesh placement) can be critical to your surgical plan. A preoperative hemoglobin A 1c test will identify patients with poorly controlled or previously undiagnosed diabetes, the management of which should be optimized before they receive a permanent mesh implant. It is critical to understand your patient's current sexual function and satisfaction as well as her goal for postoperative sexuality to properly counsel her.

It is important to understand the extent of the prolapse by asking the patient to describe the largest bulge she has ever felt as compared with some object such as an egg, lemon, orange, or grapefruit. Doing so will let you know whether you are witnessing the true extent of her prolapse during the examination. A thorough assessment of each anatomic compartment (ie, anterior, apical and posterior) is performed by asking the patient to cough or Valsalva during bimanual and speculum examinations to derive her POP-Q scores, but those scores are just the start of a comprehensive preoperative examination. A standing examination while the patient coughs or strains usually helps the surgeon understand the full extent of the prolapse, and manual reduction of prolapse while the patient strains in a standing position will provide an appreciation of the physiologic forces that your repair will be up against.

IV. Next-generation uterine imaging

Uterine imaging has been employed to allow for noninvasive methods for diagnosing women's health symptoms. Imaging may be used to noninvasively assess conditions of pregnancy and aspects of uterine health and pelvic health, including endometriosis.

The indication for pelvic imaging varies by patient age and clinical presentation. Common indications in premenopausal patients include evaluation for focal endometrial or myometrial lesions (eg, uterine leiomyoma [fibroids]) in patients with symptoms of AUB and pelvic pain. In postmenopausal patients, endometrial imaging is often performed to evaluate the endometrium in patients with postmenopausal bleeding.

Currently, diagnosis relies primarily on anatomic imaging using both ultrasound and MRI that allows for direct visualization of the endometrium, which is complementary to the previously described techniques, similarly noninvasive, but allowing for direct visualization of the endometrium in situ, rather than sloughed endometrial tissue. Ultrasound and MRI may evaluate for the presence of endometrial thickening and the presence of focal endometrial lesions or polyps. In the evaluation of suspected endometriosis, transvaginal ultrasound may be used to assess for deeply infiltrating endometrial implants.MRI is useful to map endometrial implants throughout the pelvis, including extrauterine locations, and confers advantages in terms of the larger field of view, multiplanar capabilities, and excellent contrast resolution. A systematic review and meta-analysis (based on the results of 6 studies) compared the accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound with MRI for diagnosing deep infiltrating endometriosis. The detection of deep infiltrating endometriosis by both MRI and transvaginal ultrasound methods indicated similar sensitivities–between 0.59 and 0.85 depending on the site, with greater sensitivity for detection in the rectosigmoid segment over rectovaginal, uterosacral, and rectovaginal septum locations. The specificities of MRI and transvaginal ultrasound were similar and, similar to sensitivities, showed a wide range depending on the location. It is expected that imaging methods will continue to improve and are likely to be used in the diagnostic workup for women experiencing symptoms of endometriosis.

5 GYNECOLOGIC AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH FOR WOMEN LIVING WITH OBESITY

5.1 Preventive gynecologic health

Gynecological assessment with cervical screening and breast examination are an important part of care for women with obesity in the primary care setting. Barriers in the care environment should be identified and addressed; for example, doorways, washrooms, and examination spaces should allow access. Care environments should avoid signage and language that is weight stigmatizing.

Pelvic examination can pose challenges due to increased vaginal adiposity, which increases the distance from the vulva to the cervix. Difficulty retracting vaginal adiposity can lead to poor visibility and inadequate examination of the cervix and vagina. Several practical tips can facilitate pelvic examination in women with obesity:
Provision of adequately sized examination beds, stirrups, gowns, drapes, towels.
Use of an appropriately sized vaginal speculum with or without adjuncts that aid retraction of the protruding vaginal adiposity, allowing adequate visualization of the cervix.
The lateral decubitus position may be used for examination of the cervix, with the posterior blade of the speculum oriented toward the anus.
Consider a trauma‐informed care approach as the patient may have experienced difficult pelvic examinations in the past.

5.2 Endometrial health

As discussed previously, increasing BMI is associated with a higher incidence of endometrial cancer. Due to the association of anovulatory bleeding and endometrial dysplasia in women with obesity, abnormal uterine bleeding requires careful assessment.

5.3 Breast health

There is an association between estrogen and progesterone receptor‐positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with obesity.

The breast contains adipose tissue predominantly. The endocrine and paracrine role of excess adipose tissue in the development of breast cancer is linked to the secretion of growth factors, inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and adipokines, and increased aromatase activity involved in the increased conversion of androgens to estrogens.

Impaired lactogenesis is associated with obesity. Breastfeeding challenges may limit milk production and breastfeeding, which is an independent risk factor for the development of breast and endometrial cancer in the menopausal period.

Recommended practices for promoting breast health and reducing the risk of breast cancer in women with obesity include taking a detailed medical, family, and genetic history for breast, ovarian, and glandular cancers, encouraging milk and breastfeeding during the reproductive years, advising breast and chest self‐examination, and mammogram screening. The Women's Preventive Services Initiative recommends that mammography screening is initiated between the ages of 40 and 50, and occurs every 2 years thereafter until age 74, unless individualized risk factors are present.

### Levonorgestrel (kyleena) [^1114ucSf]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Important information to consider during or after insertion

If you suspect that Kyleena is not in the correct position, check placement (for example, using transvaginal ultrasound). Remove Kyleena if it is not positioned completely within the uterus. Do not reinsert a removed Kyleena.
If there is clinical concern, exceptional pain or bleeding during or after insertion, take appropriate steps (such as physical examination and ultrasound) immediately to exclude perforation.

2.3 Patient Follow-up

Reexamine and evaluate patients 4 to 6 weeks after insertion and once a year thereafter, or more frequently if clinically indicated.

2.4 Removal of Kyleena

Timing of Removal

Kyleena should not remain in the uterus after 5 years.
If pregnancy is not desired, remove Kyleena during the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle, provided the woman is still experiencing regular menses. If removal will occur at other times during the cycle or the woman does not experience regular menses, she is at risk of pregnancy; start a new contraceptive method a week prior to removal for these women. [See Dosage and Administration (2.5).]

Tools for Removal

Preparation

Gloves
Speculum

Procedure

Sterile forceps

Removal Procedure

Remove Kyleena by applying gentle traction on the threads with forceps (Figure 9).

Figure 9. Removal of Kyleena

If the threads are not visible, determine location of Kyleena by ultrasound [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].
If Kyleena is found to be in the uterine cavity on ultrasound exam, it may be removed using a narrow forceps, such as an alligator forceps. This may require dilation of the cervical canal. After removal of Kyleena, examine the system to ensure that it is intact. If unable to remove with gentle traction, determine Kyleena location and exclude perforation by ultrasound or other imaging [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].
Removal may be associated with some:
pain and/or bleeding or vasovagal reactions (for example, syncope, bradycardia) or seizure, especially in patients with a predisposition to these conditions.
breakage or embedment of Kyleena in the myometrium that can make removal difficult [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Analgesia, paracervical anesthesia, cervical dilation, alligator forceps or other grasping instrument, or hysteroscopy may be used to assist in removal.

### Fertility evaluation of infertile women: a committee opinion [^113pNm3W]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Uterine abnormalities and imaging — prevalence and diagnostic performance indicate that uterine abnormalities occur in 16.2% of women presenting for infertility evaluation, most commonly polyps (13%), submucous fibroids (2.8%), and adhesions (0.3%), and in women with abnormal uterine bleeding the prevalence increases to 39.6%; uterine imaging may be warranted, with ultrasonography described as the best imaging modality. For cavity assessment, HSG has relatively a low sensitivity (50%) and positive predictive value (PPV) (30%) for diagnosing endometrial polyps and submucous myomas and cannot reliably differentiate a septate from a bicornuate uterus, whereas sonohysterography has a high (> 90%) PPV and negative predictive value; hysteroscopy is the definitive method for diagnosis and treatment of intrauterine pathologies.

### Educational experience and ethical tensions in pelvic examination training: a mixed-methods study in the obstetrics and gynecology clerkship [^114TEVeS]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The pelvic exam is used in the evaluation of many gynecologic complaints. Providers across all specialties should be able to perform this exam accurately with an emphasis on consent and patient comfort. The OB/GYN clerkship is an important time for medical students to develop the technique and interpersonal skills necessary to perform pelvic exams on patients assigned female at birth. Graduating students should be able to independently perform these examinations accurately and sensitively; however, students report limited exposure in the clinical setting.

Objectives

To explore medical student and preceptor experiences with pelvic exam learning and teaching during the obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) clerkship, and to identify barriers to student participation in pelvic exams on awake patients in the clinical setting.

Study Design

This was a prospective, mixed-methods study of medical students and OB/GYN preceptors at a large academic center between June 2024 and March 2025. The authors developed surveys using a modified Delphi process and refined them through cognitive interviews. Students logged the number of pelvic exams they performed and completed a survey at the end of the 5-week clerkship. Preceptors were surveyed via email. Quantitative analysis included descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests. Qualitative data from open-ended survey responses were analyzed inductively to identify key themes.

Results

Among 93 student respondents (out of 102, 91.2% response rate), the average number of exams performed per student was 4.25 speculum and 2.17 bimanual exams. Students at the academic center performed significantly fewer exams than those at the community hospital. Over half of students (51.6%, 48 of 93) did not perform any bimanual exams. Cisgender male students performed fewer speculum exams than cisgender female students (p < .01). Students reported increased confidence and reduced anxiety with pelvic exams after the clerkship. Simulation and gynecologic teaching associate sessions were rated as helpful, but students emphasized the need for real clinical opportunities. Among 89 preceptor respondents (out of 171, 52.0% response rate), barriers to student participation included patient preference, exam complexity, time constraints, and institutional culture. Preceptors at the academic center cited time constraints (p < .01) and institutional culture (p < .01) more often than those at the community hospital.

Conclusions

In this single-institution study, despite improved confidence, many students performed few pelvic exams during the OB/GYN clerkship. Preceptor behavior, institutional culture, and clinical context significantly impacted student opportunity. While these findings may not be generalizable to all institutions, they underscore the importance of supplementing clinical training with simulation, engaging preceptors, and clarifying policies around student participation and patient consent so that students can meet pelvic exam learning objectives-particularly in settings where institutional policies limit student involvement in specific settings.

### Proposed staging criteria for sonographic and physical exam for cervical changes at… [^115RTvmB]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic cervical changes, such as cervical length shortening and dilation, which often occur before spontaneous preterm birth, have been described well in singleton pregnancies with or without history of preterm birth. The current screening strategies available to identify patients at increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth include use of transvaginal ultrasound for cervical length assessment and for detection of a short cervical length (≤ 25 mm) before 24 weeks of gestation. Whether an additional evaluation of the cervix (ie, via speculum or manual exam) is indicated is often pondered by clinicians and may depend on how short the cervical length is and if there is a history of preterm birth. Based on expert opinion, we developed a novel staging system of asymptomatic cervical changes including the following: cervical length measurement, cervical and membrane appearance on speculum exam, and cervical dilation by manual exam. This staging system, if proven accurate, may aid in standardizing definitions for purposes of patient prognosis, evaluation of intervention efficacy, and clinical management.

### When virginity does matter: rigid hysteroscopy for diagnostic and operative vaginoscopy – a series of 26 cases [^111XbBdG]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Virginity in adult women, although a personal decision, is a limiting factor for gynecologists in diagnosis and treatment. This report presents 26 cases of virgin patients with various gynecologic problems: 11 with vaginal bleeding, 7 with heavy discharge and foul odor, 6 with protruding vaginal mass, and 2 with a sensation of vaginal pressure and pain. A rigid hysteroscopy setting was used for diagnostic and operative vaginoscopy. Eleven foreign bodies were removed, mostly clothing fibers and a piece of plastic. In 5 cases, cervical polyps and a subserous myoma were resected and cut into pieces for removal through the hymenal opening. In conclusion, the use of a rigid hysteroscope as a vaginoscope to replace the speculum in adult virgin patients is feasible and introduces an operative option as well.

2.5 Continuation of Contraception after Removal

If pregnancy is not desired and if a woman wishes to continue using Skyla, a new system can be inserted immediately after removal any time during the cycle.
If a patient with regular cycles wants to start a different contraceptive method, time removal and initiation of the new method to ensure continuous contraception. Either remove Skyla during the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle and start the new method immediately thereafter or start the new method at least 7 days prior to removing Skyla if removal is to occur at other times during the cycle.

If a patient with irregular cycles or amenorrhea wants to start a different contraceptive method, start the new method at least 7 days before removal.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^116PFowD]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Leiomyomas (uterine fibroids)

Leiomyomas are prevalent benign tumors comprising smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts while being rich in extracellular matrix. Their prevalence increases with age and has been reported to be 69% in white women and 83% in black women by the age of 50. Whereas the exact pathogenesis of a leiomyoma is unknown, it appears to be multifactorial with the involvement of genetics, gonadal steroid exposure, and environmental factors. Leiomyomas can manifest in various phenotypes that vary in size, number, and location. While most women have no symptoms related to their leiomyomas, others may present with a spectrum of symptoms. Consequently, decisions regarding expectant, medical, or procedural interventions depend on a combination of the desires of the individual and their leiomyoma phenotype. Collectively, these circumstances challenge investigators and clinicians to understand when and how a given leiomyoma phenotype is responsible for the experienced symptoms and what therapeutic options best fit the patient's goals, particularly those related to fertility.

The complex context created by this highly prevalent disorder led to the development of the FIGO classification system, which was designed primarily according to the location of the leiomyoma with respect to the endometrium and uterine serosa (Figure 3). Submucous leiomyomas include those in contact with the endometrium, as determined clinically by hysteroscopy or uterine imaging using ultrasound‐based techniques or MRI. While Types 0, 1, and 2 project into the endometrial cavity, Type 3 leiomyomas are those in contact with the endometrium without focal distortion of the endometrial cavity. Intramural leiomyomas are surrounded by myometrium and are deemed Type 4 leiomyomas. In contrast, those in contact with the uterine serosa (Types 5, 6, and 7) are categorized by the degree to which they project out of the uterus, with Type 7 being the pedunculated variety. Type 8 leiomyomas are those found in alternate locations, most commonly the cervix. Especially important for intrauterine surgery, such as hysteroscopic myomectomy, are the tumors that contact both the endometrium and the uterine serosa, which are categorized with two numbers reflecting, in order, the endometrial and serosal relationships (e.g. Types 2–5 or 3–6). It is critically important that clinicians do not attempt hysteroscopic myomectomy, as removal will result in peritoneal cavity entry, termination of the procedure, and the risk of damage to surrounding visceral and other structures including the bladder, bowel, ureters, and blood vessels.

### Uterine fibroids: assessing unmet needs from bench to bedside [^113piJB6]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uterine fibroids, or leiomyomas, are benign neoplasms of smooth muscle tissue that arise from the myometrium. Approximately 30%–35% of women will be diagnosed with fibroids using ultrasound detection, but over 70% of women are estimated to develop them by age 50. Although fibroids are not cancerous, they deleteriously affect the quality of life for millions of women. Approximately 25% of US women with uterine fibroids will experience symptoms severe enough to require treatment. Fibroids can cause heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding, pelvic and back pain, anemia, and bulk symptoms such as increased urination, constipation, and abdominal distention. Because symptoms overlap with other gynecologic disorders such as endometriosis and adenomyosis, the average time to diagnose fibroids can be significantly prolonged. Furthermore, once a patient is diagnosed, heterogeneity in the size, number, and location of the fibroids can make treatment difficult.

The spectrum of fibroid disease is substantial — with some patients developing 60 or more fibroids and with growths ranging in size from tiny seedlings to as large as a melon. Moreover, fibroid size is not directly correlated with urinary or bleeding symptoms, making it challenging to predict the impact and burden from patient to patient.

Several factors have been proposed to influence an individual's risk for developing fibroids, including age of menarche, obesity, high blood pressure, gravidity, family history of fibroids, and race. There are limited data across all populations of women of color; however, some studies have found that black women are twice as likely to develop fibroids than Hispanic women and up to four times more likely than white women. Black women also present with earlier age of onset, more and larger growths, and increased severity of symptoms. In 2010, direct costs associated with patient management of fibroids were estimated at $9.4 billion, with an additional $17 billion lost in work-hour costs. The epidemiology and unmet health care needs concerning fibroids warrant further investigation to better understand the factors that influence the prevalence and disparities associated with the disease and to ameliorate the financial burden on patients and the health care system.

### Complete evaluation of anatomy and morphology of the infertile patient in a single visit; the modern infertility pelvic ultrasound examination [^114nNTYM]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

The comprehensive "one-stop shop" ultrasound evaluation of an infertile woman, performed around cycle days 5 to 9, will reveal abundant information about the anatomy and morphology of the pelvic organs and thereby avoid costly radiation and iodinated contrast exposure. We propose a two-dimensional and three-dimensional ultrasound to examine the appearance and shape of the endometrium, endometrial cavity, myometrium, and junctional zone, to assess for müllerian duct anomalies fibroids, adenomyosis, and polyps. We then evaluate the adnexa with grayscale ultrasound and Doppler, looking for ovarian masses or cysts, and signs of tubal disease. The cul-de-sac is imaged to look for masses, endometriosis, and free fluid. We then push gently on the uterus and ovaries to assess mobility. Lack of free movement of the organs would suggest adhesions or endometriosis. The sonohysterogram then allows for more detailed evaluation of the endometrial cavity, endometrial lining, and any intracavitary lesions. Tubal patency is then assessed during the sonohysterogram in real time by introducing air and saline or contrast and imaging the tubes (HyCoSy). With this single comprehensive ultrasound examination, patients can obtain a reliable, time-efficient, minimally invasive infertility evaluation in their own clinician's office at significantly less cost and without radiation.

### Diagnosis and classification of uterine fibroids [^116Eas8b]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Bulk symptoms

Fibroids often cause bulk‐related symptoms due to their physical size and location. Patients commonly report pelvic pressure, lower back pain, abdominal discomfort, bloating, obstructive symptoms, and a sensation of pelvic fullness. Fibroids positioned anteriorly or posteriorly can compress the bladder or rectum, resulting in urinary frequency, difficulty emptying the bladder, or constipation. In severe cases, particularly large fibroids may lead to urinary obstruction or rare hydronephrosis. The extent and severity of these symptoms correlate with fibroid size, number, and anatomical placement within the uterus.

3.4 Quality of life

Symptomatic fibroids substantially diminish a patient's quality of life and productivity. The Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health‐Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (UFS‐QoL) is a disease‐specific validated tool that effectively evaluates the impact of fibroids. It comprises two parts: (1) Symptom severity score evaluating bulk and pain symptoms, menstrual bleeding, and fatigue, with a score of 0–100, where higher scores mean increased fibroid burden; and (2) Health‐related quality of life (score of 0–100) that evaluates domains such as concern, activity, energy/mood, control, self‐consciousness, and sexual function, where a higher score is indicative of a better quality of life. Patients with moderate to severe fibroid symptoms report significantly reduced quality of life, increased healthcare utilization, greater reliance on analgesics and iron supplements, and considerable loss of productivity, including frequent absence from work. Surveys demonstrate widespread impacts extending to sexual life, work performance, and relationships, highlighting the extensive socioeconomic burden posed by symptomatic uterine fibroids.

Investigations

The abdominal examination did not reveal any abnormalities. There was no abdominal swelling or pain. On vaginal examination, a large mass was palpable in the fornix posterior. Speculum investigation revealed a finger-shaped and easy-bleeding mass in the posterior fornix.

Transvaginal ultrasound showed a uterus in anteverted and anteflexed position with a large mass presumably arising from the posterior wall of the uterus and growing through the posterior fornix (figures 1 and 2). The lesion was identified as homogeneous hypoechogenic and presented with a regular outer contour and some internal shadowing. There was one feeding blood vessel. No adnexal abnormalities were seen. These characteristics suggested a benign cervical mass, favouring the diagnosis of a leiomyoma.

As the findings on medical imaging together with the patient's age were reassuring, the chance of malignancy became less probable. A biopsy was already taken during a vaginal examination at the referring hospital. The anatomopathological (AP) examination confirmed the diagnosis of a benign mesenchymal tumour, but no further subclassification was possible at the time.

Planning for I nsertion

LILETTA should only be inserted by a trained healthcare professional. Healthcare professionals should become thoroughly familiar with the product, product educational materials, product insertion instructions, prescribing information, and patient labeling before attempting insertion of LILETTA.

Obtain a complete medical and social history to determine conditions that might influence the selection of LILETTA for contraception. If indicated, perform a physical examination and appropriate tests for genital or sexually transmitted infections.1 [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.10)].

Check the expiration date on the box before opening it. Do not insert LILETTA after the expiration date.

Visually inspect the packaging containing LILETTA to verify that the packaging has not been damaged (e.g., torn, punctured, etc.). If the packaging has any visual damage that could compromise sterility, do not use the unit for insertion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Complete the pelvic examination, speculum placement, tenaculum placement, and sounding of the uterus before opening the LILETTA packaging.

Do not open the packaging to insert LILETTA if the following clinical findings occur:

the cervix is unable to be properly visualized
the uterus cannot be adequately instrumented (during sounding)
the uterus sounds to less than 5.5 cm

### Uterine fibroid tumors: diagnosis and treatment [^111FDtJ8]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The incidence of uterine fibroid tumors increases as women grow older, and they may occur in more than 30 percent of women 40 to 60 years of age. Risk factors include nulliparity, obesity, family history, black race, and hypertension. Many tumors are asymptomatic and may be diagnosed incidentally. Although a causal relationship has not been established, fibroid tumors are associated with menorrhagia, pelvic pain, pelvic or urinary obstructive symptoms, infertility, and pregnancy loss. Transvaginal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, sonohysterography, and hysteroscopy are available to evaluate the size and position of tumors. Ultrasonography should be used initially because it is the least invasive and most cost-effective investigation. Treatment options include hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, myolysis, and medical therapy. Treatment must be individualized based on such considerations as the presence and severity of symptoms, the patient's desire for definitive treatment, the desire to preserve childbearing capacity, the importance of uterine preservation, infertility related to uterine cavity distortions, and previous pregnancy complications related to fibroid tumors.

### What is the value of preoperative bimanual pelvic examination in women undergoing laparoscopic total hysterectomy? [^116npLAn]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

OBJECTIVE STUDY: To estimate the value of preoperative bimanual examination of the pelvis in women undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH).

Design

Prospective observational cohort study.

Setting

Private hospitals and centre.

Patients

One hundred fourteen consecutive women undergoing TLH.

Intervention

All women who were scheduled to undergo TLH from May 2005 through June 2006 had a bimanual examination of the pelvis performed before surgery and the size of the uterus clinically estimated and recorded as gestational equivalents. The operating time, the estimated blood loss (EBL) during TLH, and the final weight of the uterus at histologic study were recorded. Spearman correlation coefficient analysis was used to determine whether there was a correlation between the estimated uterine size before surgery and actual uterine weight, operating time, and EBL.

Measurements and Main Results

Of the one hundred fourteen consecutive women eligible for the study, 75 had complete data and therefore were included in the final analysis. The median age was 46 years (range 34–71 years); 22.7% (17/75) had a clinically estimated normal uterus, 10.7% (8/75) had an 8–10/40 uterus, 12% (9/75) had a 10–12/40 uterus, 14.6% (11/75) had a 12–14/40 uterus, 20.0% (15/75) had a 14–16/40 uterus, 9.3% (7/75) had a 16–18/40 uterus, and 10.7% (8/75) had an 18–20/40 uterus. The median operating time was 110 minutes (range 59–240 minutes); the median EBL was 80 mL (range 20–1000 mL); and the median weight of the uterus was 181 g (range 52–1080 g). Histologic diagnoses included leiomyomata in 64.0% (48/75), adenomyosis in 44.0% (33/75), endometriosis in 22.7% (17/75), endocervical polyp in 4.0% (3/75), and normal uterus in 8.0% (6/75). The Spearman correlations between clinical size of the uterus and the weight of the uterus, the EBL, and the operating time were 0.81, 0.33, and 0.29, respectively; that is, the 2 variables tended to increase together. These correlations were all significant (p < .0001, .0044, and .0114, respectively).

Conclusions

This study showed significant correlation between clinical estimate of uterine size and histologic weight of the uterus, operating time, and EBL in women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy. These findings are of great value in preoperative counseling in relation to the risk of bleeding and the potential need for blood transfusion, and in operating room planning.

This study is a case report. The patient was a nulliparous woman aged 27 years who presented with pain in her lower abdomen and continuous bleeding per vaginum for 2 months. On speculum examination, multiple, smooth, polypoid masses were seen arising all around the vaginal fornices; cervix was healthy. Ultrasound revealed a bulky uterus with a 5 × 6-cm fibroid in the posterior wall with echogenic area adjacent to cervix and gross left hydroureteronephrosis. The right kidney was removed 6 years consequent to pyonephrosis. Biopsy of the vaginal polypoidal mass was reported as vaginal polypoid endometriosis. The patient was planned for myomectomy and vaginal mass excision. On examination under anesthesia, the base of polypoid mass was thick and fixed and could not be excised completely. Myomectomy was done. Postoperatively, the patient received 3 injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, but the size of the mass did not decrease. She was then planned for ureteric reimplantation and panhysterectomy. Hysterectomy was not possible because of extensive parametrial involvement, but Boari flap ureteric implantation with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was done.

Results

Vaginal polypoid endometriosis did not respond to medical treatment. However, the widespread vaginal polypoidal masses regressed significantly after oophorectomy.

Conclusion

Bilateral oophorectomy was resorted to as an option in this case of vaginal polypoid and extensive pelvic endometriosis not amenable to medical treatment and surgical excision.

### Fibroids: yet another example of disparity in health? [^112MtFyV]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Providing rapid and effective reproductive and maternal health is a core hallmark of a well-functioning society. Whilst women comprise half of all people in society, the importance of healthcare aspects specific to them is often de-prioritised. Following the recent anniversary of Fibroid Awareness Month in July, we focus on this under-discussed disorder, female reproductive health and why further action is needed to improve outcomes.

Female reproductive health encompasses healthcare and research related to the specific issues women face over the course of a lifetime. Dysfunction in the interplay of female reproductive organs and complex hormonal expression rhythms can cause a variety of disorders only experienced by women. Cancer of the Cervix, ovaries and endometrium, heavy menstrual bleeds, Uterine disorders, pre-, peri- and post-natal disorders are just a few examples of issues faced only by women. Fibroids are an example of a disorder faced by women with a challenging etiology and potential long term impact on quality of life.

Fibroids or Leiomyomas are benign smooth muscle tumours which form spontaneously in the pelvic and lower extremity. Whilst extremely rare cases have been identified in men, the tumours are most frequently found in the uterus. These masses can vary in size, and some rare recent case studies have identified fibroid masses larger than 5kg. In many cases, women with fibroids are asymptomatic. However, fibroids can cause abdominal or lower back pain, constipation, increased urination, pain during intercourse, heavy and/or painful periods and potential pregnancy complications or infertility, and thus can severely affect a woman's quality of life. The severity of symptoms varies and depends on the uterine location, number and size of fibroids present. Fibroids located submucosally, which then distort and invade the womb, are of particular concern for future pregnancies and fertility.

Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic laparoscopy — indications, contraindications, risks, and benefits — lists the indication as "Infertility particularly after normal hysterosalpingography". Contraindications are "Inability to tolerate general anesthesia or significant pelvic adhesions that may preclude safe access or visualization". Risks are "Procedure- and anesthesia-related complications". Benefits include "Identification of the reason for infertility", "Possible therapeutic intervention", and "Confirmation of lack of pathology may also be important for further treatment options".

### AAGL practice report: practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of submucous leiomyomas [^113A7LSQ]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for uterine fibroids, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for surgery, AAGL 2012 guidelines recommend to administer preoperative laminaria or prostaglandins or intraoperative intracervical injection of a low-dose dilute vasopressin solution for cervical preparation to reduce the requirement for dilation and potentially decrease the incidence of uterine trauma associated with hysteroscopic surgery, including hysteroscopic myomectomy for submucous fibroids.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of sonohysterography and hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography [^112G1VGH]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) — indications and contraindications are listed: indications include abnormal uterine bleeding; uterine cavity evaluation related to uterine leiomyomas, polyps, synechiae, and cesarean scar niches; abnormalities detected on transvaginal sonography; congenital or acquired uterine abnormalities; infertility; recurrent pregnancy loss; and suboptimal visualization of the endometrium by standard sonography. Sonohysterography should not be performed in a woman who is pregnant or who could be pregnant; in patients with regular cycles, scheduling is usually in the follicular phase after menstrual flow has completely or almost completely ceased and before ovulation, and in patients with regular cycles, SIS should ideally be performed before the 10th day of the menstrual cycle. Sonohysterography should not be performed in patients with a pelvic infection or unexplained pelvic tenderness that could be due to pelvic inflammatory disease, and active vaginal bleeding is not a contraindication but may make interpretation more challenging.

### Tamoxifen citrate [^115jS6MW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Any patient receiving or who has previously received tamoxifen who reports abnormal vaginal bleeding should be promptly evaluated. Patients receiving or who have previously received tamoxifen should have annual gynecological examinations and they should promptly inform their physicians if they experience any abnormal gynecological symptoms, e.g., menstrual irregularities, abnormal vaginal bleeding, changes in vaginal discharge, or pelvic pain or pressure.

In the P-1 trial, endometrial sampling did not alter the endometrial cancer detection rate compared to women who did not undergo endometrial sampling (0.6% with sampling, 0.5% without sampling) for women with an intact uterus. There are no data to suggest that routine endometrial sampling in asymptomatic women taking tamoxifen to reduce the incidence of breast cancer would be beneficial.

Non-Malignant Effects on the Uterus:

An increased incidence of endometrial changes including hyperplasia and polyps has been reported in association with tamoxifen treatment. The incidence and pattern of this increase suggest that the underlying mechanism is related to the estrogenic properties of tamoxifen.

There have been a few reports of endometriosis and uterine fibroids in women receiving tamoxifen. The underlying mechanism may be due to the partial estrogenic effect of tamoxifen. Ovarian cysts have also been observed in a small number of premenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer who have been treated with tamoxifen.

Tamoxifen has been reported to cause menstrual irregularity or amenorrhea.

### More than meets the eye: a giant cervical polyp masquerading as an adnexal cyst [^115V7oS3]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A sexually inactive nulliparous woman in her early 30s presented with persistent pain in the left iliac fossa that had lasted for two years, intensifying over the past two months. An initial ultrasound suggested the possibility of a left adnexal cyst, which prompted treatment with oral contraceptives for months; however, her symptoms continued unabated. Subsequent pelvic MRI revealed a multiloculated cystic lesion, which was suspected to arise from the cervix. After robust counselling and consent, an examination under anaesthesia revealed a pedunculated cervical mass, which was excised and later confirmed via histopathological analysis as a giant endocervical polyp and hence an unnecessary scar abdomen was avoided. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by the benign cervical lesions that can mimic adnexal pathology, especially when per speculum examination cannot be done, and it emphasises the critical need for correlation between imaging results, clinical evaluations and operative findings to avoid diagnostic delay and unwarranted radical surgeries.

Regarding surgical interventions for uterine fibroids, more specifically with respect to myomectomy, ASRM 2017 guidelines recommend to recognize that there is fair evidence that:

- myomectomy does not impair reproductive outcomes (clinical pregnancy rates, live birth rates) following assisted reproductive therapy

- hysteroscopic myomectomy for submucosal fibroids improves clinical pregnancy rates.

### Mixed reality in medical education: a study on bimanual pelvic examination [^111vtxeo]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Educational interventions

The MR gynecologic examination training system has a simulated female pelvic model and a virtual software system. The system is designed for training and assessing gynecologic examination skills. The system supports both teacher and student login. Teachers can record expert techniques, view scores, and manage users. Students can practice and take examinations. The pelvic model includes key anatomical structures. These include the vulva, vagina, uterus, and ovaries. It supports bimanual, trilateral, and rectal examinations. The system also offers seven models. These include normal and various pathologic conditions of the uterus and appendages. The software tracks and detects finger movements in real‐time. Users can see the position of the fingers and measure distances accurately. It also checks the pressure used during the BPE. Real‐time feedback is provided to improve learning. The traditional teaching process for the gynecologic examination works as follows: (1) The teacher explains the basics of the gynecologic examination, covering topics such as communication, privacy, the importance of the examination, and key points of how to perform the examination. This part is shown using slides and lasts for a total of 45 min. (2) The teacher conducts the operation on a traditional gynecologic examination model, and students practice on the gynecologic examination model for 90 min. (3) The teacher leads the students into the clinical gynecologic examination room, and the students observe the gynecologic examination operation for 45 min. For the MR + traditional group, the traditional gynecologic examination model teaching in the second stage will be replaced by a combination of the MR gynecologic examination training system and traditional gynecologic examination models. The first and third steps remain unchanged from traditional teaching (Figure 1).

2.2 Assessment

The primary outcome was an enhancement in the proficiency of gynecologic examination operational skills, as measured by performance on relevant quizzes. The test will be conducted 8 weeks after the end of the course. The gynecologic skills assessment and scoring system follows the standards used by Xiangya Hospital. The highest score is 100 points. The assessment scores are composed of the following sections: Preparation, examination of external genitalia, speculum examination, BPE, and overall performance. The specific scoring standards can be found in Appendix S1. The assessment results did not affect student's academic grades. After the experiment, students who have not used the MR gynecologic examination training system will be allowed to use it again, in order to ensure the fairness of education.

### Enlarged uterine fibroid forming uterine diverticulum during pregnancy: a case report [^117RGf55]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Fibroid is the most common benign tumor that arises from the female genital tract, affecting 70–80% of women. Although uterine fibroids can cause several clinical symptoms, including severe menstrual bleeding, painful menstruation, bowel dysfunction, infertility, and miscarriage, most cases are asymptomatic. Moreover, various sized fibroids can distort and elongate the shape of the uterus. Fibroids are considered estrogen/progesterone-dependent and pregnancy may influence their size, which tends to enlarge, especially during the first trimester. We experienced a unique case of a uterine fibroid that was associated with a uterine diverticulum that enlarged during pregnancy and puerperium.

### Ethynodiol diacetate and ethinyl estradiol (zovia 1 / 35E-28) [^112ETqEW]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Taking the pill may provide some important non-contraceptive benefits. These include less painful menstruation, less menstrual blood loss and anemia, less risk of fibroids, pelvic infections, and noncancerous breast disease, and less risk of cancer of the ovary and of the lining of the uterus (womb).

Be sure to discuss any medical condition you may have with your health care provider. He or she will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will also examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the health care provider believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year while taking oral contraceptives. The detailed patient information leaflet gives you further information that you should read and discuss with your health care provider.

### Removal of myomas in asymptomatic patients to improve fertility and / or reduce miscarriage rate: a guideline [^115me1vt]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for uterine fibroids, more specifically with respect to myomectomy, ASRM 2017 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to conclude that:

- removal of subserosal fibroids improves fertility

- myomectomy (laparoscopic or open) reduces miscarriage rates

- hysteroscopic myomectomy reduces the likelihood of early pregnancy loss in patients with infertility and submucous fibroids.

### Radiological reasoning: algorithmic workup of abnormal vaginal bleeding with endovaginal sonography and sonohysterography [^116u68TC]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The workup of endometrial abnormalities can be a confusing task for radiologists because one must take into account the patient's clinical history, imaging findings, and a wide array of diagnostic options. We present two cases, one of a premenopausal woman presenting with vaginal bleeding and another of a postmenopausal woman taking tamoxifen who has abnormal findings on endovaginal sonography. The evaluations of these patients serve to illustrate the diagnostic algorithm for identification of endometrial pathology.

Conclusion

Imaging plays a central role in the algorithm for detection of endometrial disorders in women with abnormal vaginal bleeding. Endovaginal sonography is used to identify mural abnormalities such as fibroids and adenomyosis and to screen for thickened endometria that require nonfocal biopsy for the diagnosis of cancer or hyperplasia. Sonohysterography serves as a triage tool to detect focal abnormalities of the endometrial cavity, such as endometrial polyps or subendometrial fibroids, thereby identifying those women who require more invasive workup with hysteroscopy.

### ACP provides guidance on screening pelvic examination in women… [^116HpyNj]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Screening pelvic examination should not be performed in asymptomatic, nonpregnant women.
- Possible harms include fear, anxiety, deterring some women from getting medical care, and false-positive results leading to unnecessary laparoscopies or laparotomies.
- Pelvic examination should not be performed for sexually transmitted infection screening; urine or vaginal swab testing is sufficient.
- Screening pelvic examinations are not needed before prescribing oral contraceptives. From the AFP Editors. Pelvic examinations, consisting of speculum and bimanual examination for the purpose of this guideline, are often performed in women without symptoms to screen for pathology, including cancer, infection, and pelvic inflammatory disease.

However, their accuracy for diagnosing PID, gynecologic cancer, and benign conditions has not been addressed in studies, and their accuracy for diagnosing ovarian cancer and bacterial vaginosis is low. Additionally, pelvic examination is associated with many false-positive findings and harms from examination. This guideline concentrates on screening in women without symptoms; a pelvic examination with bimanual examination may be used in some non-screening circumstances. Additionally, the group due for cervical cancer screening is not addressed in this guideline, but screening should be done by visual inspection of the cervix and cervical swabs, rather than performing a full pelvic examination.

Recommendations Based on moderate-quality evidence, the ACP makes a strong recommendation that screening pelvic examination should not be performed in asymptomatic, non-pregnant women, with evidence indicating that harms outweigh the benefits of such screening in this population. Low-quality evidence has indicated that pelvic examination screening can lead to harms, possibly preventing some women from getting medical care. False-positive results from pelvic examination can lead to women having unneeded laparoscopies or laparotomies. High-Value Care Nucleic acid amplification testing on vaginal swabs or urine has been shown to have high specificity and sensitivity for screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Pelvic examination should not be performed for sexually transmitted infection screening; urine or vaginal swab testing is sufficient.

Many physicians continue to perform pelvic examination as part of the well-woman appointment; because it is considered to be of low value, it should not be performed in this setting. However, if a woman has symptoms of vaginal discharge, uncharacteristic bleeding, pain, urinary problems, or sexual dysfunction, pelvic examination may be necessary.
