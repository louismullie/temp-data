## Question

Edoxaban dosing in atrial fibrillation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about edoxaban dosing in atrial fibrillation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dosing framework and absolute contraindications. Then, I should verify the dose-reduction criteria and how they were operationalized in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48. Next, I will examine the pivotal trial outcomes and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data that justify dose adjustments. After that, I need to consider special populations, including the very elderly, frailty, and extremes of renal function. I will then review real-world dosing appropriateness and the consequences of off-label dosing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise dosing algorithm and highlight monitoring and peri-procedural considerations, making sure each assertion is supported by guidelines or trials.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-labeled foundation before moving further. The standard dose for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is edoxaban 60 mg once daily, reduced to 30 mg once daily if creatinine clearance is 15–50 mL/min, if body weight is 60 kg or less, or if potent P-glycoprotein inhibitors are used, and edoxaban should not be used when creatinine clearance exceeds 95 mL/min due to increased ischemic stroke risk observed in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, which is a critical label restriction I must not overlook.

> Wait, let me verify the trial design that underpins these dose rules. In ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, patients were randomized to higher-dose edoxaban (60 mg daily, reduced to 30 mg if criteria met), lower-dose edoxaban (30 mg daily, reduced to 15 mg if criteria met), or warfarin; dose reductions were triggered by CrCl 30–50 mL/min, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or concomitant potent P-gp inhibitors, which aligns with the FDA label and supports the exposure-based dose-reduction strategy embedded in the protocol [^113mcKK9] [^115nqesU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy without checking the outcomes. High-dose edoxaban was noninferior to warfarin for stroke or systemic embolism and reduced major bleeding, while low-dose edoxaban was noninferior for efficacy but less effective than warfarin for ischemic stroke, reinforcing that the 60 mg regimen is preferred when appropriate and that the 30 mg regimen trades some ischemic protection for bleeding reduction [^114WEffY] [^1113UozK].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic rationale for dose reduction. Dose reduction decreased edoxaban exposure by roughly 30–35% and anti-Factor Xa activity by about 20–25%, which meaningfully lowers bleeding risk while preserving efficacy versus warfarin. Importantly, the exposure–response curves show a steeper relationship for bleeding than for thromboembolism, supporting the concept of a narrower therapeutic window for bleeding and justifying careful dose tailoring in higher-exposure states [^113mcKK9].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with the very elderly. In patients aged 80 years and older without formal dose-reduction criteria, a post hoc ENGAGE analysis showed that 60 mg increased major bleeding, especially gastrointestinal bleeding, compared with 30 mg, without improving ischemic outcomes, suggesting that 30 mg may be reasonable in select octogenarians even when standard criteria are not met. However, I should emphasize this is hypothesis-generating and not a label change, so shared decision-making is essential [^114Scaud] [^111gKrze].

> Let me consider frailty and those ineligible for standard-dose anticoagulation. In ELDERCARE-AF, edoxaban 15 mg once daily reduced stroke or systemic embolism versus placebo in Japanese patients aged 80 years and older deemed unsuitable for standard doses, with a numerically higher major bleeding rate that did not reach statistical significance; benefits persisted across frailty strata, indicating that very-low-dose edoxaban can be a viable option when full-dose therapy is contraindicated, albeit with vigilance for bleeding [^1152eC2f] [^114RGS1H].

> I should double-check renal function extremes because they materially alter exposure. Edoxaban is contraindicated when CrCl > 95 mL/min due to increased ischemic stroke, and dose reduction to 30 mg is indicated for CrCl 15–50 mL/min; for CrCl < 15 mL/min or dialysis, data are limited and use is generally not recommended, so if anticoagulation is necessary, alternatives or specialist input should be considered rather than forcing an unstudied edoxaban dose [^116Njemy] [^114Scaud].

> But wait, what about body weight extremes and pharmacokinetics in obesity or very low body weight. Population PK suggests exposure is relatively stable across a wide weight range, and the labeled ≤ 60 kg reduction criterion remains appropriate; in very low body weight patients included in ELDERCARE-AF, edoxaban 15 mg retained efficacy with a higher bleeding signal, so if 30 mg is used in a 50–60 kg patient, I should monitor closely for bleeding and reassess dose if bleeding risk emerges [^111MbxRC] [^1171D6YJ].

> Next, I should review real-world dosing appropriateness, because misdosing is common and consequential. Multiple observational analyses show frequent underdosing without indication and overdosing without meeting reduction criteria, both associated with worse outcomes; underdosing increases stroke and death without improving bleeding, whereas overdosing increases bleeding, underscoring the need to adhere to labeled criteria and avoid empiric dose reductions based solely on advanced age or fear of bleeding [^114KQZU8] [^113fMqgk] [^116e5k6n].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical dosing algorithm and make sure it aligns with guidelines. First, calculate CrCl using Cockcroft-Gault and screen for body weight ≤ 60 kg and potent P-gp inhibitors. Use 60 mg once daily if none apply, reduce to 30 mg once daily if any criterion is present, and avoid edoxaban if CrCl > 95 mL/min. In select patients aged 80 years and older without formal criteria, consider 30 mg after discussing trade-offs in ischemic protection versus bleeding, recognizing this is off-label and evidence is limited to subgroup analyses [^116o4myW].

> I will now examine peri-procedural and drug–drug interaction management to avoid preventable bleeding. For elective procedures, hold edoxaban 1 day before low-to-moderate bleeding risk and 2 days before high bleeding risk, and avoid concomitant rifampin and other strong P-gp/CYP3A4 inducers when possible; if life-threatening bleeding occurs, andexanet alfa is an option for rapid reversal of factor Xa inhibitors in appropriate settings [^116iKzzm] [^116HpG3A] [^111SdrN5].

> Let me reconsider monitoring needs and renal surveillance. Routine drug-level monitoring is not required for edoxaban, but periodic renal function checks are prudent, especially in older adults or when interacting drugs are introduced; practical guidance to reassess renal function at intervals approximating CrCl divided by 10 (for CrCl < 60 mL/min) helps ensure continued dose appropriateness as kidney function fluctuates [^1128SZPk] [^1176vfZw].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. The evidence-based hierarchy is 60 mg once daily when criteria are not met, 30 mg once daily when dose-reduction criteria are present, avoidance when CrCl > 95 mL/min, and consideration of 15 mg only in carefully selected very elderly or high-bleeding-risk patients who cannot tolerate standard doses, with explicit acknowledgment that 15 mg is supported by ELDERCARE-AF but is not a standard regimen for typical AF patients eligible for full-dose therapy [^1152eC2f].

Edoxaban dosing for atrial fibrillation is **60 mg once daily** for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) 51–95 mL/min, with a mandatory reduction to **30 mg once daily** if CrCl is 15–50 mL/min, body weight is ≤ 60 kg, or potent P-gp inhibitors are used (e.g. verapamil, quinidine, dronedarone) [^notfound]. Edoxaban is **not recommended** for patients with CrCl > 95 mL/min due to increased ischemic stroke risk [^116Njemy]. Routine monitoring is not required, but renal function should be checked periodically and dosing adjusted as needed [^1128SZPk] [^1176vfZw].

---

## Standard dosing regimen

The **standard dose** is 60 mg orally once daily for patients with CrCl 51–95 mL/min [^11288yNK] [^115Dva1x]. The **reduced dose** is 30 mg orally once daily for patients with CrCl 15–50 mL/min, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or concomitant use of potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, quinidine, dronedarone) [^11288yNK] [^113rfDgM].

---

## Special considerations

### Renal impairment

- **CrCl > 95 mL/min**: Edoxaban is not recommended due to increased risk of ischemic stroke [^116Njemy] [^114Scaud].
- **CrCl 15–50 mL/min**: Dose reduction to 30 mg once daily is required [^11288yNK] [^114Scaud].
- **CrCl < 15 mL/min or dialysis**: Edoxaban is not recommended [^114Scaud].

---

### Body weight

Body weight **≤ 60 kg** warrants a dose reduction to 30 mg once daily due to increased exposure and bleeding risk [^11288yNK] [^113mcKK9].

---

### Concomitant medications

Potent **P-gp inhibitors** (e.g. verapamil, quinidine, dronedarone) necessitate a dose reduction to 30 mg once daily [^11288yNK] [^113mcKK9].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing recommendations

The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial demonstrated that both edoxaban regimens (60 mg and 30 mg) were **noninferior to warfarin** in preventing stroke or systemic embolism, with significantly lower rates of major bleeding [^114WEffY] [^113mcKK9]. Pharmacokinetic analyses confirmed that dose adjustments based on renal function, body weight, and concomitant medications effectively manage exposure and bleeding risk [^113mcKK9] [^1125D4X1].

---

## Monitoring and dose adjustment

Routine coagulation monitoring is **not required** for edoxaban [^1128SZPk]. Renal function should be assessed periodically — especially in elderly patients or those with fluctuating renal function — and dosing adjusted accordingly [^1176vfZw].

## Edoxaban dosing for atrial fibrillation

| **Patient characteristics** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|
| CrCl 51–95 mL/min | 60 mg once daily |
| CrCl 15–50 mL/min | 30 mg once daily |
| Body weight ≤ 60 kg | 30 mg once daily |
| Potent P-gp inhibitors | 30 mg once daily |
| CrCl > 95 mL/min | Not recommended |

---

Edoxaban dosing for atrial fibrillation is individualized based on renal function, body weight, and concomitant medications, with **60 mg once daily** as the standard dose and **30 mg once daily** for those requiring dose reduction.

### Association between edoxaban dose, concentration, anti-factor Xa activity, and outcomes: an analysis of data from the randomised, double-blind ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^113mcKK9]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

New oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation were developed to be given in fixed doses without the need for the routine monitoring that has hindered usage and acceptance of vitamin K antagonists. A concern has emerged, however, that measurement of drug concentration or anticoagulant activity might be needed to prevent excess drug concentrations, which significantly increase bleeding risk. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, higher-dose and lower-dose edoxaban were compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation. Each regimen incorporated a 50% dose reduction in patients with clinical features known to increase edoxaban drug exposure. We aim to assess whether adjustment of edoxaban dose in this trial prevented excess drug concentration and the risk of bleeding events.

Methods

We analysed data from the randomised, double-blind ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial. We correlated edoxaban dose, plasma concentration, and anti-Factor Xa (FXa) activity and compared efficacy and safety outcomes with warfarin stratified by dose reduction status. Patients with atrial fibrillation and at moderate to high risk of stroke were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive warfarin, dose adjusted to an international normalised ratio of 2.0–3.0, higher-dose edoxaban (60 mg once daily), or lower-dose edoxaban (30 mg once daily). Randomisation was done with use of a central, 24 h, interactive, computerised response system. International normalised ratio was measured using an encrypted point-of-care device. To maintain masking, sham international normalised ratio values were generated for patients assigned to edoxaban. Edoxaban (or placebo-edoxaban in warfarin group) doses were halved at randomisation or during the trial if patients had creatinine clearance 30–50 mL/min, bodyweight 60 kg or less, or concomitant medication with potent P-glycoprotein interaction. Efficacy outcomes included the primary endpoint of all-cause stroke or systemic embolism, ischaemic stroke, and all-cause mortality. Safety outcomes included the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding, fatal bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, and gastrointestinal bleeding. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00781391.

Findings

Between Nov 19, 2008 and Nov 22, 2010, 21105 patients were recruited. Patients who met clinical criteria for dose reduction at randomisation (n = 5356) had higher rates of stroke, bleeding, and death compared with those who did not have a dose reduction (n = 15749). Edoxaban dose ranged from 15 mg to 60 mg, resulting in a two-fold to three fold gradient of mean trough drug exposure (16.0–48.5 ng/mL in 6780 patients with data available) and mean trough anti-FXa activity (0.35–0.85 IU/mL in 2865 patients). Dose reduction decreased mean exposure by 29% (from 48.5 ng/mL [SD 45.8] to 34.6 ng/mL [30.9]) and 35% (from 24.5 ng/mL [22.7] to 16.0 ng/mL [14.5]) and mean anti-FXa activity by 25% (from 0.85 IU/mL [0.76] to 0.64 IU/mL [0.54]) and 20% (from 0.44 IU/mL [0.37] to 0.35 IU/mL [0.28]) in the higher-dose and lower-dose regimens, respectively. Despite the lower anti-FXa activity, dose reduction preserved the efficacy of edoxaban compared with warfarin (stroke or systemic embolic event: higher dose pinteraction = 0.85, lower dose pinteraction = 0.99) and provided even greater safety (major bleeding: higher dose pinteraction 0.02, lower dose pinteraction = 0.002).

Interpretation

These findings validate the strategy that tailoring of the dose of edoxaban on the basis of clinical factors alone achieves the dual goal of preventing excess drug concentrations and helps to optimise an individual patient's risk of ischaemic and bleeding events and show that the therapeutic window for edoxaban is narrower for major bleeding than thromboembolism.

Discussion

Of 21 105 subjects enrolled in the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial, 8474 patients were ≥ 75 years of age. This represents the largest number of elderly patients enrolled among the randomized controlled trials with a NOAC to date. In this prespecified analysis, we confirmed the strong relationships between age and risk of both thromboembolism and bleeding in patients with AF, even after adjustment for potential confounders. Notably, however, age had a greater impact on bleeding. As age increases, the slope for major bleeding increases more sharply than the corresponding slope for stroke or SEE, particularly above the age of 75 years. Similar findings of a greater influence of age on bleeding as compared to thromboembolic events were reported in a randomized trial of 973 patients age ≥ 75 years with atrial fibrillation randomized to warfarin or aspirin. 22

Due to the higher thromboembolic and particularly bleeding risk in the elderly as compared to the younger patients, the absolute benefits of edoxaban over warfarin were more marked in older patients, as compared to the benefits of edoxaban versus warfarin in younger patients. Importantly, with edoxaban, the incidence of ICH, the most feared complication of anticoagulant therapy, increased only gradually with increasing age, in contrast to a steeper increase in ICH rates with warfarin as age increases. As a result, there was a more pronounced relative decline in International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding with edoxaban as compared to warfarin as age increased; this was particularly apparent among the elderly who met dose reduction criteria at randomization. Furthermore, edoxaban provided superior absolute net clinical outcomes over warfarin in the elderly, including the secondary and tertiary net clinical outcomes, which were limited to more serious irreversible outcomes.

### Analysis of oral anticoagulant dosing and adherence to therapy among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^114KQZU8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Previous workobserved an approximately 4-fold higher use of reduced-dose direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in US cardiology practices compared with DOAC use in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) registration trials. In a Danish registry study, reduced-dose apixaban use was associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism and no significant difference in bleeding compared with warfarin. However, that study, like many others, lacked data on renal function or weight and, thus, was unable to determine whether reduced dosing was inappropriate or appropriate according to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dose labeling. In the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF II), patients who received off-label oral anticoagulation doses had higher CHA₂DS₂ -VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes, stroke, vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and female sex) scores, and underdosing (not recommended per FDA recommendations) was associated with significantly higher risk of cardiovascular hospitalization. A recent trialof older Japanese patients with NVAF who were not candidates for standard doses of oral anticoagulants found that a once-daily dose of 15 mg of edoxaban vs placebo was superior in preventing stroke while not increasing major bleeding risk. There are few data on the rationale behind off-label, reduced-dosed DOAC prescription, but this practice likely reflects both patient and clinician desire to have the patient stay anticoagulated while avoiding bleeding complications.

This study leveraged a large, national medical and prescription claims data set linked to clinical data, including patients' age, weight, and renal function, to determine the prevalence of patients with NVAF treated with a DOAC dose not recommended by FDA labeling (hereafter referred to as off-label dosing). We analyzed patient-level and prescribing practitioner factors associated with off-label underdosing or excess dosing. Finally, we examined prescription fill data to assess whether off-label underdosing of DOACs was associated with greater longitudinal adherence to anticoagulation in patients with CHA₂DS₂ -VASc score of 2 or higher who are at high risk for thromboembolism. We hypothesized that off-label dosing would be associated with increased risks of nonadherence and discontinuation of DOACs. We hypothesized that an increased risk of nonadherence and discontinuation may be a component of the mechanism for higher clinical risks (ie, stroke and bleeding) in patients prescribed an off-label DOAC dose.

### Inappropriate dosing of direct oral anticoagulants among very older inpatients with atrial fibrillation [^113bvcM6]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Among very older patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the frequency of inappropriate direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) dosing, associated factors, and temporal trends in practice are unknown. This retrospective study included consecutive inpatients aged 80 years or older with a discharge diagnosis of atrial fibrillation who were prescribed DOACs at discharge from Beijing Hospital between January 2018 and August 2023. Patients were stratified into underdosed, overdosed, or recommended dosing groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with inappropriate dosing, and temporal trends were evaluated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Among 676 inpatients aged ≥ 80 years with AF (mean age 84.4 ± 3.5 years; 53.1% female) who were prescribed a DOAC at hospital discharge (22.9% dabigatran, 62.3% rivaroxaban, 14.8% edoxaban), recommended dosing was observed in 338 patients (50.6%), underdosing in 308 (45.6%), and overdosing in 30 (4.4%). The overall rate of inappropriate dosing was 49.4%. Factors independently associated with underdosing included advanced age (OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.52–2.60, p < 0.001), lower creatinine clearance (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97–0.99, p = 0.01), and discharge from non-internal medicine wards (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.33–3.45, p = 0.002). Overdosing was associated with younger age (OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.19–0.75, p = 0.005). Although the proportion of recommended dosing increased over the study period, and inappropriate dosing showed a declining trend, these changes did not reach statistical significance. Inappropriate DOAC dosing, especially underdosing, remains common in very older AF inpatients. This issue persists despite years passing, emphasizing the need for patient-focused, collaborative AF management and thorough prognostic studies.

### Outcomes and drivers of inappropriate dosing of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116e5k6n]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Global guidelines recommend that non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). NOACs (including apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) have demonstrated at least similar efficacy in preventing AF-related stroke compared with warfarin and are safer concerning serious bleeding across several large-scale clinical studies. Consequently, NOACs are recommended as first-line therapy for stroke prevention among adult patients with AF.

Comorbidities (eg, chronic kidney disease and extreme body weight), as well as age and concomitant therapies, can impact the appropriate dosing of NOACs. Therefore, guidelines informed by clinical trials recommend dose adjustment to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events and bleeding complications for defined subgroups.

The product information of each NOAC provides clear guidance as to which patients should be considered for dose adjustment; however, a substantial number of patients in routine clinical practice are inappropriately prescribed adjusted doses. A 2016 study conducted in the USA found that 9.4% of patients with AF were underdosed and 3.4% were overdosed. Prescribers may perceive that this reduces bleeding risk; however, there is currently a lack of evidence as to whether routine underdosing reduces the risk of bleeding and adequately protects patients.

Several studies have indicated that inappropriate NOAC dosing may be associated with adverse events. Underdosing has been associated with increased stroke risk, while overdosing may increase the risk of adverse events such as bleeding. Several large observational studies have been conducted in the secondary care setting (USA, South Koreaand Europe), which show an association between inappropriate NOAC dosing and adverse health outcomes. Similar results have been found in high-risk populations such as nursing home residents.

To inform decision-makers whether the common practice of dosing outside of guidelines produces optimal patient outcomes, it is necessary to systematically evaluate the clinical and economic implications of off-label dosing and to establish what is driving decisions to dose outside of guidelines. To our knowledge, there is no published systematic review that examines the clinical and economic impacts, as well as drivers, of inappropriate NOAC dosing.

The primary objectives of this review were to identify the evidence for (1) the effect of inappropriate dosing (underdosing and overdosing) of a NOAC on clinical outcomes in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and (2) the economic impact of inappropriate NOAC dosing. The secondary objective is to identify patient characteristics associated with inappropriate dosing.

### Effect of 15-mg edoxaban on clinical outcomes in 3 age strata in older patients with atrial fibrillation: a prespecified subanalysis of the ELDERCARE-AF randomized clinical trial [^111RnGPE]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

The study ELDERCARE-AF (subanalysis) was published by Masaru Kuroda and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA Cardiol. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation. In the ELDERCARE-AF (subanalysis) study, the trial question was: what is the role of edoxaban in older adult patients with AF who were not considered candidates for standard-dose OACs? In the ELDERCARE-AF (subanalysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ELDERCARE-AF (subanalysis) study, the population was: 984 patients (565 female, 419 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged ≥ 80 years with AF who were not considered candidates for standard-dose OACs. The key exclusion criteria were moderate to severe MS; mechanical heart valves. In the ELDERCARE-AF (subanalysis) study, the interventions were: n = 492 edoxaban (at a dose of 15 mg PO once daily) n = 492 placebo (matching placebo once daily). In the ELDERCARE-AF (subanalysis) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in stroke or systemic embolism in patients aged ≥ 90 years (2.4% / p-y vs. 10.1% / p-y; HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.68). In the ELDERCARE-AF (subanalysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant decrease in stroke or systemic embolism in patients aged 85–89 years (2.8% / p-y vs. 7.3% / p-y; HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.99) No significant difference in net clinical outcome in patients aged ≥ 90 years (19.6% / p-y vs. 22.1% / p-y; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.42) No significant difference in death from all causes in group aged 80–84 years (6.4% / p-y vs. 5% / p-y; HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.67). In the ELDERCARE-AF (subanalysis) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in major bleeding, major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. significant difference in clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in group aged 85–89 years (15.0% per patient-year vs. 7.4% per patient-year). In the ELDERCARE-AF (subanalysis) study, the conclusion was: in patients aged ≥ 80 years with AF who were not considered candidates for standard-dose OACs, edoxaban was superior to placebo with respect to stroke or systemic embolism in patients aged ≥ 90 years.

### Edoxaban versus warfarin in atrial Fibrillation patients at risk of falling: ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 analysis [^111vJihB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Anticoagulation is often avoided in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at an increased risk of falling.

Objectives

This study assessed the relative efficacy and safety of edoxaban versus warfarin in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 48) trial in patients with atrial fibrillation judged to be at increased risk of falling.

Methods

We performed a pre-specified analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, comparing patients with versus without increased risk of falling.

Results

Nine hundred patients (4.3%) were judged to be at increased risk of falling. These patients were older (median, 77 vs. 72 years; p < 0.001), and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities including prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. After multivariable adjustment, patients at increased risk of falling experienced more bone fractures caused by falling (adjusted hazard ratio [HRadj]: 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.49 to 2.38; p < 0.001), major bleeding (HRadj: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.64; p = 0.023), life-threatening bleeding (HRadj: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.11 to 2.50; p = 0.013), and all-cause death (HRadj: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.70; p < 0.001), but not ischemic events including stroke/systemic embolic event (HRadj: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.51; p = 0.27). No treatment interaction was observed between either dosing regimens of edoxaban and warfarin for the efficacy and safety outcomes. Treatment with edoxaban resulted in a greater absolute risk reduction in severe bleeding events and all-cause mortality compared with warfarin.

Conclusions

Edoxaban is an attractive alternative to warfarin in patients at increased risk of falling, because it is associated with an even greater absolute reduction in severe bleeding events and mortality.

### Effect of 15-mg edoxaban on clinical outcomes in 3 age strata in older patients with atrial fibrillation: a prespecified subanalysis of the ELDERCARE-AF randomized clinical trial [^111Ni54V]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with age, and AF and age are both independent risk factors for stroke. To prevent cardioembolic stroke in patients with AF, clinical guidelines recommend using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), even in older patients. However, evidence on the use of DOACs in extremely older patients is lacking, and many physicians remain reluctant to prescribe standard doses of DOACs to extremely older patients owing to risk factors for bleeding in this patient group, such as severe kidney impairment, history of bleeding, previous falls, polypharmacy, and frailty.

The Edoxaban Low-Dose for Elder Care Atrial Fibrillation Patients (ELDERCARE–AF) trial was a randomized clinical trial in which the effect of a once-daily 15-mg dose of edoxaban vs placebo on the primary efficacy end point of stroke or systemic embolism was investigated in older Japanese patients (≥ 80 years) with AF who were not considered candidates for a standard OAC regimen. Edoxaban was found to be superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism. In contrast, the incidence of major bleeding was higher with edoxaban vs placebo; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Of major bleeding events, the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was higher with edoxaban vs placebo. Although there was no influence of age (≤ 85 and > 85 years) on the effect of edoxaban on stroke or systemic embolism, it remains unclear whether the effects of edoxaban are consistent even in extremely older patients, such as those 90 years or older.

The present subanalysis of the ELDERCARE–AF trial was conducted to (1) explore the risk of stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding in the prespecified 3 age strata among older patients with AF in the ELDERCARE-AF trial (≥ 80 years) and (2) explore the effect of edoxaban 15-mg treatment vs placebo in the 3 age strata.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Table 4 — anticoagulation dosing for venous thromboembolism (VTE) details direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and low–molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) regimens with renal considerations. Apixaban initial treatment is 10 mg orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg orally twice daily, and after ≥ 6 months of initial therapy either 5 mg orally twice daily or 2.5 mg orally twice daily can be considered. Rivaroxaban initial treatment is 15 mg orally twice daily with food for the first 21 days followed by 20 mg orally once daily with food, and after ≥ 6 months either 20 mg orally daily with food or 10 mg orally daily with or without food can be considered; avoid use in patients with a CrCl of < 15 mL/min. Dabigatran is dosed 150 mg orally twice daily when preceded by 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation, and patients with severe renal impairment (a CrCl of ≤ 30 mL/min) and those receiving hemodialysis were not enrolled, with no dosing recommendations in that population. Edoxaban is 60 mg orally once daily when preceded by at least 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation, with dose reduction to 30 mg once daily for patients with a CrCl 15–50 mL/min or body weight ≤ 60 kg. In cancer-associated VTE, dalteparin is 200 units/kg subcutaneously once daily for 1 month then 150 IU/kg once daily for months 2–6; enoxaparin is 1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily subcutaneously, with dose reduction to 1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily for patients with a CrCl of < 30 mL/min.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation anticoagulant dosing — direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonist (VKA) adjustments are detailed as follows: Apixaban 5 mg orally twice daily with dose reduction to 2.5 mg orally twice daily if at least 2 of the following are present: age ≥ 80 years, actual body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL. Dabigatran 150 mg orally twice daily with dose reduction to 75 mg orally twice daily if CrCl is 15–30 mL/min; the FDA has not approved this dose for AF in the United States; in the European label, 110 mg twice daily is recommended for patients age ≥ 80 years and "For consideration" for those ages 75–80 years. Edoxaban 60 mg orally once daily is for CrCl 51–95 mL/min (not recommended if CrCl > 95 mL/min), with dose reduction to 30 mg orally once daily if CrCl is 15–50 mL/min. Rivaroxaban 20 mg orally once daily reduces to 15 mg orally once daily with the evening meal for patients with CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min. When used with antiplatelet therapy (APT), VKA targets INR 2.0–3.0.

### Cardiovascular-and bleeding-related hospitalization rates with edoxaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation based on results of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^114ZCBYT]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). Medium credibility.

Background The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial (Effective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48) demonstrated noninferiority of once-daily 60 mg (30 mg dose-reduced) edoxaban compared with warfarin for prevention of stroke/systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. No previous analysis has explored the impact of treatment with edoxaban versus warfarin on rates of hospitalizations. Methods Detailed healthcare resource utilization data from ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 for the 14024 randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug were used to compare the rates of bleeding- and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations for edoxaban versus warfarin. Hospitalization rates were calculated for each treatment group, and relative rates were estimated using Poisson regression. The influence of patient characteristics on the impact of edoxaban versus warfarin was evaluated through the inclusion of interaction terms. Results The overall rate of cardiovascular- or bleeding-related hospitalization was significantly lower for edoxaban than warfarin (relative rate [RR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.85–0.97], P = 0.003). Rates of hospitalizations for cardiovascular reasons (RR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.85–0.97], P = 0.004), stroke (RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.72–0.88], P < 0.0001), and for each stroke subtype (ischemic: RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.81–0.99], P = 0.03; hemorrhagic: RR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.54–0.68], P < 0.0001) were also lower for edoxaban. Notably, significantly greater reductions with edoxaban versus warfarin were seen for ischemic stroke-related hospitalizations in vitamin K antagonist naive patients and patients with CHADS₂ scores 4 to 6, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, age ≥ 75, and no previous coronary artery disease. For nonstroke bleeding-related hospitalizations, greater reductions with edoxaban were seen in vitamin K antagonist naive patients, patients with CHADS 2 scores 4 to 6, and patients with moderate renal dysfunction. Conclusions Edoxaban 60 mg (30 mg dose-reduced) was associated with a significantly lower overall rate of cardiovascular- or bleeding-related hospitalization and significant reductions in the subcategories of cardiovascular-related, stroke-related, bleed-related, and nonstroke cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, when compared with warfarin. These results suggest the potential for cost offsets with edoxaban, with even greater reductions in higher-risk patients.

### Efficacy and safety of edoxaban in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^115nqesU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Study Population

The design and results of ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 have been described previously. 17, 18 In brief, ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 was a randomized, double‐blind, double‐dummy trial to establish the noninferiority of edoxaban compared with warfarin. Twenty‐one thousand one‐hundred and five patients with moderate‐to‐high‐risk AF were randomized with a median follow‐up of 2.8 years. The protocol and amendments were approved by all institutional review committees and all patients provided written informed consent. Edoxaban was provided by the sponsor, Daiichi‐Sankyo (Edison, NJ), who also funded the trial. Eligible patients were 21 years of age or older with documented AF within the 12 months preceding randomization at medium or high risk of thromboembolic events (CHADS₂ risk score ≥ 2). 19 Key exclusion criteria were an estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min; a condition associated with a high risk of bleeding (eg, prior intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], gastrointestinal bleeding or active peptic ulcer in the prior year, major surgery or trauma in the preceding 10 days, uncontrolled hypertension, hemorrhagic disorder); moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve, need for dual antiplatelet therapy, and an acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or revascularization procedure within 30 days prior to enrollment. 17, 18 There was no upper age limit for participation. Patients were seen in follow‐up at months 1, 3, and every 3 months thereafter, at which time a complete blood count and creatinine were measured.

Randomization and Study Drugs

Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to a higher‐dose edoxaban regimen (HDER) (60 mg once daily), a lower‐dose edoxaban regimen (LDER) (30 mg once daily), or to warfarin titrated to achieve a target international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0. The dose of edoxaban was reduced by 50% if any of the following characteristics were present at the time of randomization or during the study: calculated CrCl of ≤ 50 mL/min using the Cockcroft‐Gault formula, 20 body weight of 60 kg or less, or the concomitant use of potent P‐glycoprotein inhibitors.

### Application of the win ratio method in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial comparing edoxaban with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116PKYTm]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular trials often use a composite end point and a time-to-first event model. We sought to compare edoxaban versus warfarin using the win ratio, which offers data complementary to time-to-first event analysis, emphasizing the most severe clinical events.

Methods

ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48) was a double-blind, randomized trial in which patients with atrial fibrillation were assigned 1:1:1 to a higher dose edoxaban regimen (60/30 mg daily), a lower dose edoxaban regimen (30/15 mg daily), or warfarin. In an exploratory analysis, we analyzed the trial outcomes using an unmatched win ratio approach. The win ratio for each edoxaban regimen was the total number of edoxaban wins divided by the number of warfarin wins for the following ranked clinical outcomes: 1: death; 2: hemorrhagic stroke; 3: ischemic stroke/systemic embolic event/epidural or subdural bleeding; 4: noncerebral International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding; and 5: cardiovascular hospitalization.

Results

21105 patients were randomized to higher dose edoxaban regimen (N = 7035), lower dose edoxaban regimen (N = 7034), or warfarin (N = 7046), yielding > 49 million pairs for each treatment comparison. The median age was 72 years, 38% were women, and 59% had prior vitamin K antagonist use. The win ratio was 1.11 (95% CI, 1.05–1.18) for higher dose edoxaban regimen versus warfarin and 1.11 (95% CI, 1.05–1.18) for lower dose edoxaban regimen versus warfarin. The favorable impacts of edoxaban on death (34% of wins) and cardiovascular hospitalization (41% of wins) were the major contributors to the win ratio. Results consistently favored edoxaban in subgroups based on creatine clearance and dose reduction at baseline, with heightened benefit among those without prior vitamin K antagonist use.

Conclusions

In a win ratio analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, both dose regimens of edoxaban were superior to warfarin for the net clinical outcome incorporating ischemic and bleeding events. As the win ratio emphasizes the most severe clinical events, this analysis supports the superiority of edoxaban over warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Very elderly patients with atrial fibrillation treated with edoxaban: impact of frailty on outcomes [^116m4469]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Anticoagulation with recommended doses of edoxaban is feasible in very elderly patients with AF even if frail.

PERSPECTIVES

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: AF is the most common arrhythmia with increasing age. AF has an increased risk of stroke especially in very elderly frail patients.

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE: Stroke prevention in AF includes the use of anticoagulant drugs. However, in the very elderly (and frail) patients these drugs are underused because of fear of adverse events.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK 1: In the present study we assessed the incidence of major outcomes in very elderly (≥ 80 years) with AF starting anticoagulation with edoxaban.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK 2: Recommended dose edoxaban was feasible in very elderly patients with AF even if frail.

### Sudden cardiac death in patients with atrial fibrillation: insights from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^116Q7yrK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

This study represents an analysis from the Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation–Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 48 (ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48) trial. The ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial was a 3‐group, randomized, double‐blind, double‐dummy, multinational trial that compared 2 dosing regimens of the oral factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban with warfarin in 21 105 patients with AF (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00781391). 11 The study population and study design were described in detail previously. 12 In brief, eligible patients were aged ≥ 21 years and had electrocardiographic evidence of AF within 12 months prior to randomization, a CHADS 2 score ≥ 2, and planned anticoagulation. Key exclusion criteria were AF due to a reversible cause, presence of a mechanical valve or moderate‐severe mitral stenosis, increased risk of bleeding, recent acute coronary syndrome or stroke within 30 days prior to randomization, severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), and life expectancy < 12 months. Patients were randomly assigned to receive warfarin with continual dose adjustment to achieve an International Normalized Ratio of 2.0 to 3.0, edoxaban 60 mg once daily (higher dose edoxaban), or edoxaban 30 mg once daily (lower dose edoxaban). For patients in either edoxaban group, the dose was halved if ≥ 1 characteristic associated with anticipated increased drug exposure was present. 12 The protocol and amendments were approved by the ethics committee at each participating center. All patients provided written informed consent.

In the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial, treatment with edoxaban was noninferior to well‐managed warfarin for the risk of stroke and systemic embolic events and was associated with significantly less bleeding. In addition, compared with warfarin, edoxaban significantly reduced the rate of cardiovascular death. 11 Higher dose edoxaban is currently approved for clinical use in the United States, Europe, and Asia to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolic events in patients with AF.

### Outcomes and safety of very-low-dose edoxaban in frail patients with atrial fibrillation in the ELDERCARE-AF randomized clinical trial [^111cXoVX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia, increases with age, and frailty is also a common condition affecting the older population. Frailty is defined as the increased vulnerability resulting from an aging-associated decline in reserve and function across multiple physiological mechanisms, which is associated with an increased risk of a range of adverse outcomes, including weight loss, risk of falls, and renal deterioration. To prevent cardioembolic stroke in patients with AF, the clinical guidelines recommend using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) even in elderly and frail patients. However, as use of DOACs can increase the risk of bleeding, assessment and monitoring of the risk factors associated with frailty are recommended. The benefits of DOAC treatment are reported to outweigh the risks associated with frailty; however, evidence for the use of DOACs in very elderly patients with AF with frailty is lacking. Many physicians remain reluctant to prescribe standard doses of DOACs to very elderly patients with frailty because of risk factors for bleeding in this patient group, such as severe renal impairment, history of bleeding, previous falls, low body weight, and polypharmacy.

### Low-dose edoxaban in very elderly patients with atrial fibrillation [^1152eC2f]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Implementation of appropriate oral anticoagulant treatment for the prevention of stroke in very elderly patients with atrial fibrillation is challenging because of concerns regarding bleeding.

Methods

We conducted a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial to compare a once-daily 15-mg dose of edoxaban with placebo in elderly Japanese patients (≥ 80 years of age) with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who were not considered to be appropriate candidates for oral anticoagulant therapy at doses approved for stroke prevention. The primary efficacy end point was the composite of stroke or systemic embolism, and the primary safety end point was major bleeding according to the definition of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

Results

A total of 984 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a daily dose of 15 mg of edoxaban (492 patients) or placebo (492 patients). A total of 681 patients completed the trial, and 303 discontinued (158 withdrew, 135 died, and 10 had other reasons); the numbers of patients who discontinued the trial were similar in the two groups. The annualized rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 2.3% in the edoxaban group and 6.7% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19 to 0.61; P < 0.001), and the annualized rate of major bleeding was 3.3% in the edoxaban group and 1.8% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 0.90 to 3.89; P = 0.09). There were substantially more events of gastrointestinal bleeding in the edoxaban group than in the placebo group. There was no substantial between-group difference in death from any cause (9.9% in the edoxaban group and 10.2% in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.36).

Conclusions

In very elderly Japanese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who were not appropriate candidates for standard doses of oral anticoagulants, a once-daily 15-mg dose of edoxaban was superior to placebo in preventing stroke or systemic embolism and did not result in a significantly higher incidence of major bleeding than placebo.

### Dose reduction of edoxaban in patients 80 years and older with atrial fibrillation: post hoc analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 randomized clinical trial [^116o4myW]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

In older patients with atrial fibrillation who take anticoagulants for stroke prevention, bleeding is increased compared with younger patients, thus, clinicians frequently prescribe lower than recommended doses in older patients despite limited randomized data.

Objective

To evaluate ischemic and bleeding outcomes in patients 80 years and older with atrial fibrillation receiving edoxaban, 60 mg vs 30 mg, and edoxaban, 30 mg vs warfarin.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial (Effective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48) was a parallel-design, double-blind, global clinical trial that randomized patients with atrial fibrillation to either one of 2 edoxaban dosing regimens or warfarin. This secondary analysis focused on patients 80 years or older without dose-reduction criteria receiving edoxaban, 60 mg vs 30 mg, as well as patients with or without dose-reduction criteria receiving edoxaban, 30 mg, vs warfarin. Study data were analyzed between October 2022 and December 2023.

Interventions

Oral edoxaban, 30 mg once daily; edoxaban, 60 mg once daily; or warfarin.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary net clinical outcome of death, stroke or systemic embolism, and major bleeding and each individual component.

Results

The current analysis included 2966 patients 80 years and older (mean [SD] age, 83 [2.7] years; 1671 male [56%]). Among 1138 patients 80 years and older without dose-reduction criteria, those receiving edoxaban, 60 mg vs 30 mg, had more major bleeding events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.04–2.38; p = 0.03), particularly gastrointestinal hemorrhage (HR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.29–3.90; p = 0.004), with no significant difference in efficacy end points. Findings were supported by analyses of endogenous factor Xa inhibition, a marker of anticoagulant effect, which was comparable between younger patients receiving edoxaban, 60 mg, and older patients receiving edoxaban, 30 mg. In 2406 patients 80 years and older with or without dose-reduction criteria, patients receiving edoxaban, 30 mg, vs warfarin had lower rates of the primary net clinical outcome (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68–0.91; p = 0.001), major bleeding (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.45–0.77; P < .001), and death (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70–1.00; p = 0.046), whereas rates of stroke or systemic embolism were comparable.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this post hoc analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 randomized clinical trial, in patients 80 years and older with atrial fibrillation, major bleeding events were lower in patients randomized to receive edoxaban, 30 mg per day, compared with either edoxaban, 60 mg per day (in patients without dose-reduction criteria), or warfarin (irrespective of dose-reduction status), without an offsetting increase in ischemic events. These data support the concept that lower-dose anticoagulants, such as edoxaban, 30 mg, may be considered in older patients with atrial fibrillation even in the absence of dose-reduction criteria.

Methods and Results

Study Population and Treatments

ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 was a multinational, double‐blind randomized trial that compared the efficacy and safety of 2 dosing regimens of edoxaban with warfarin. 1, 11 The trial was approved by all institutional review committees and subjects provided informed consent. Edoxaban was provided by the sponsor, Daiichi Sankyo (Parsippany, NY), who also funded the trial. Briefly, 21 105 patients with a history of documented AF and a CHADS 2 score ≥ 2 were enrolled. Key exclusion criteria were severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance [CrCl] < 30 mL/min), a high bleeding risk, receiving or anticipated to receive dual antiplatelet therapy, or a history of stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or coronary revascularization within 30 days of randomization. The trial studied 2 dose regimens of edoxaban. The higher dose edoxaban regimen (HDER) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European as well as Japanese Medicine Agencies. This dose (60 mg/day) was reduced to 30 mg/day if any of the following characteristics, which would be expected to increase drug exposure, were present at the time of randomization or occurred during the trial 12: CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min; body weight ≤ 60 kg; or concomitant use of potent P‐glycoprotein inhibitors (verapamil, quinidine, or dronedarone). The lower‐dose regimen (LDER) was 30 mg/day and reduced to 15 mg/day for the same reasons. SAPT was administered as directed by the treating physician; aspirin ≤ 100 mg daily was strongly encouraged. If a clinical indication for dual antiplatelet therapy arose after randomization, the study drug was temporarily interrupted, but open‐label vitamin K antagonist (VKA) was permitted. Warfarin was well managed during the trial with median time in the therapeutic range (mTTR) of 68.4%. 1

Patients with events (death, stroke, systemic embolic event [SEE], or major bleeding) occurring before the 3 months visit were excluded from the primary analysis because a sizeable percentage of patients (n = 498; 7.46%) discontinued SAPT after they entered the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial and were begun on anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, in our primary analysis we compared SAPT with no SAPT beginning 3 months after randomization. Patients with or without SAPT use at randomization were evaluated in a sensitivity analysis.

### Twice-or once-daily dosing of direct oral anticoagulants, a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112N9Zam]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have similar half-lives, but the dosing regimen varies between once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID). For some prescribers, the QD regimen improves compliance. Others prefer BID regimens to promote better stability of plasma concentrations, particularly in the event of missed doses. Limited level of evidence provides guidance about the best treatment strategy. The purpose of this study was to compare the treatment effect of QD vs. BID administration of DOACs in major orthopedic surgery (MOS), non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), venous thromboembolism (VTE), and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review up to April 2020. We included phase II clinical trials comparing DOAC QD vs BID with same daily dose. We extracted data for the occurrence of major thrombosis (proximal deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke) and major hemorrhage (ISTH criteria and recommendations of the European Medicines Agency for surgical patients). Relative risks (RR) were combined using a fixed and random effects weighted meta-analysis.

Results

Twelve randomized, controlled, phase II trials were included (10,716 patients), representing 24 dosing regimen comparisons of apixaban, darexaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, letaxaban, and dabigatran. There was no difference for major thrombotic event (RR BID/QD = 1.06, 95%IC 0.86–1.30) nor for major bleeding (RR BID/QD = 1.02, 95%IC 0.84–1.23) between the BID vs QD regimens, without heterogeneity (I² = 0%).

Conclusion

Our study does not support a global difference in term of efficacy and safety of the BID and QD regimens of DOAC in MOS, NVAF, VTE and ACS.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose edoxaban by body weight in very elderly patients with atrial fibrillation: a subanalysis of the randomized ELDERCARE-AF trial [^115dw9t4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients Edoxaban Low‐Dose for Elder Care Atrial Fibrillation Patients

The eligibility criteria for the ELDERCARE‐AF trial included the following: age ≥ 80 years; CHADS 2 risk score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes, and history of stroke) ≥ 2. All patients were of Japanese ethnicity and had to be considered ineligible for OACs such as warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban at the recommended therapeutic strength or the approved doses due to at least 1 of the following reasons: low creatinine clearance (15–30 mL/min); history of bleeding from a critical area/organ or gastrointestinal bleeding; low body weight (≤ 45 kg); ongoing use of nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs; and current use of an antiplatelet medication. Excluded from the study were patients with moderate–severe mitral stenosis and/or mechanical heart valves.

For this subanalysis, 45 kg was used as a cutoff to stratify patients into 2 body weight groups (ie, ≤ 45 and > 45 kg). This cutoff was defined based on the design of the main ELDERCARE‐AF trial, in which a body weight of ≤ 45 kg was specified as one of the ineligibility criteria for OAC therapy at the recommended therapeutic strength or the approved doses. As a result of this enrollment criterion, many patients included in the overall ELDERCARE‐AF population had a body weight of 40 to 45 kg, thereby ensuring sufficient patient numbers in each body weight subgroup for comparative analysis. In addition, an exploratory analysis was performed with all patients divided into 4 subgroups based on quartiles of body weight: > 57.9 kg, > 49.0 to ≤ 57.9 kg, > 42.0 to ≤ 49.0 kg, and ≤ 42.0 kg.

End Points

The primary efficacy end point was SSE. The secondary efficacy end point was the net clinical outcome and all‐cause mortality, with the net clinical outcome defined as the composite of stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding, and all‐cause mortality. The primary safety end point was major bleeding as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis. The secondary safety end point was major bleeding and clinically significant nonmajor bleeding. Full definitions and details of how each end point was determined have been described. Other secondary efficacy and safety end points have also been previously defined.

Dabigatran with creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 50 mL/min is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk, and with CrCl 30–50 mL/min is held 2 d for low risk and 4 d for high risk. Edoxaban is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk. Rivaroxaban is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk. For warfarin, hold 5 d or for a target INR < 1.5; an alternative is 2–3 d for a target INR < 2. For patients with CrCl lower than the table values, the footnote states to consider holding for an additional 1 to 3 days, and it clarifies that the number of days refers to full days before surgery and the drug is also not taken the day of surgery.

### Efficacy and safety of edoxaban in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^1125D4X1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Dose reduction

Overall, there were 5356 (25.4%) patients who met criteria for dose reduction (10.4%, 18.2%, and 41.2% of patients age < 65, 65–74, and ≥ 75 years, respectively). Among the 3488 elderly patients who met dose reduction criteria, 2960 (84.9%) patients were dose‐reduced due to moderate renal dysfunction (CrCl 30–50 mL/min at screening visit). Regardless of dosage, the edoxaban concentration and anti‐FXa activity were similar across age groups with broad overlap in dose groups (Table S1). Dose reduction resulted in a decrease in median exposure of 30% to 40% in all age groups and a maximum decrease in anti‐FXa activity of 40% in the elderly. Observed event rates for both stroke or SEE and for major bleeding were generally higher with increasing age both in patients who did and who did not meet dose reduction criteria (Tables S2 and S3).

The efficacy and safety profiles of edoxaban as compared to warfarin were consistent regardless of dose reduction and age group (P interaction > 0.05), with the exception of major bleeding in the elderly. Dose reduction from 60 to 30 mg in elderly patients randomized to the HDER who met 1 of the 3 prespecified criteria for dose reduction at randomization decreased major bleeding as compared to warfarin to an even greater degree, than among elderly patients treated with HDER who were not dose‐reduced (HDER versus warfarin; HR 0.58 [0.43–0.77] for dose reduction, HR 1.06 [0.84–1.33] for no dose reduction, P interaction = 0.0013, Table S2). There also was a similar significant interaction observed with LDER (P interaction = 0.0001, Table S3).

Three‐way interactions between age group, dose reduction status, and randomized treatment were not statistically significant when HDER was compared with warfarin with regard to primary efficacy end point (P interaction = 0.52) and primary safety end point (P interaction = 0.09). Similarly, the 3‐way interaction was not significant for primary efficacy end point with LDER (P interaction = 0.82, Table S3). However, there was a marginal significant interaction with the primary safety end point (P interaction = 0.05).

### Uninterrupted administration of edoxaban vs vitamin K antagonists in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation catheter ablation: rationale and design of the ELIMINATE-AF study [^114hzeKS]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are at an approximately 0.5% to 3% increased risk of thromboembolism during and immediately after catheter ablation. Treatment guidelines recommend periprocedural oral anticoagulation plus unfractionated heparin during ablation. Rivaroxaban and dabigatran are the only non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants for which there are randomized controlled trials assessing uninterrupted anticoagulation in patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF. Edoxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, is noninferior vs warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism with less major bleeding in patients with nonvalvular AF. The ELIMINATE-AF (Evaluation of Edoxaban Compared With VKA in Subjects Undergoing Catheter Ablation of Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation) trial is a multinational, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, blinded-endpoint evaluation (PROBE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of once-daily edoxaban 60mg (30mg in patients indicated for a dose reduction) vs vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in patients with nonvalvular AF undergoing catheter ablation (http://www. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02942576). A total of 560 patients are planned for randomization to edoxaban or VKA (2:1 ratio) to obtain 450 patients fully compliant with the protocol. Patients will complete 21 to 28days of anticoagulation prior to the ablation and a 90-day post-ablation period. The primary efficacy endpoint is the composite of all-cause death, stroke, and major bleeding. The primary safety endpoint is major bleeding. A magnetic resonance imaging substudy will assess the incidence of silent cerebral lesions post-ablation. ELIMINATE-AF will define the efficacy and safety of edoxaban for uninterrupted oral anticoagulation during catheter ablation of AF.

### Two-year follow-up of patients with atrial fibrillation receiving edoxaban in routine clinical practice: results from the global ETNA-AF program [^112eCymF]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The annual risk of any stroke for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is between 1% and 20%. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as edoxaban, are preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with AF for the prevention of ischemic stroke. In a meta‐analysis of four pivotal studies, DOACs were associated with a combined 19% risk reduction for any stroke and systemic embolic events (SEEs), a 51% reduction in hemorrhagic stroke, and a 10% risk reduction of all‐cause mortality compared with VKAs. Major society guidelines recommend DOACs as the preferred drug class for stroke prevention in eligible patients with AF. In the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial, treatment with edoxaban versus warfarin prevented any stroke or SEEs with similar efficacy, lower rates of bleeding, and significantly lower rates of death from cardiovascular (CV) causes.

Randomized controlled trials have strict inclusion criteria, which limit the selection of patients. In addition, randomized controlled trials have historically included limited representation from various geographical regions, including Asian countries. These limitations have contributed to trial populations that may not fully capture the diversity observed in real‐world settings. Noninterventional studies overcome this limitation by including patients without specific criteria or restrictions, leading to a more diverse study population. Data from real‐world and randomized controlled trials are consistent and show that dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, effectively prevent thromboembolic events and exhibit similar or decreased risk of major bleeding compared with VKAs. Given these findings, additional data from real‐world analyses are needed demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of edoxaban in a diverse patient population over a long‐term follow‐up.

### Laboratory test predictors for major bleeding in elderly (≥ 80 Years) patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation treated with edoxaban 15 mg: sub-analysis of the ELDERCARE-AF trial [^111HSJLY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

A prespecified subanalysis of the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48) trial evaluated clinical outcomes of edoxaban versus warfarin in patients with AF according to age. Elderly patients (aged ≥ 75 years) treated with edoxaban were shown to derive therapeutic benefit. On the other hand, the risk of major bleeding exceeded the risk of stroke or systemic embolic events with increasing edoxaban concentration, resulting in a narrow therapeutic window. As such, while the results of the ELDERCARE‐AF trial suggest that prescribing low‐dose edoxaban (15 mg/day) can prevent stroke or systemic embolism in elderly patients with AF in whom other OACs are unsuitable, it remains important to consider the risk of bleeding. Thus, the findings of this subanalysis suggest that clinicians should particularly consider the results of laboratory tests such as hemoglobin and PT in elderly patients with reduced renal function before initiating edoxaban.

### Evaluation of the novel factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: design and rationale for the effective aNticoaGulation with factor xA next GEneration in atrial fibrillation-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction study 48 (ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48) [^116XEoB6]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin K antagonists have been the standard oral antithrombotic used for more than a half century for prevention and treatment of thromboembolism. Their limitations include multiple food and drug interactions and need for frequent monitoring and dose adjustments. Edoxaban is a selective and direct factor Xa inhibitor that may provide effective, safe, and more convenient anticoagulation.

Study Design

ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multinational, noninferiority design megatrial comparing 2 exposure strategies of edoxaban to warfarin. Approximately 20,500 subjects will be randomized to edoxaban high exposure (60 mg daily, adjusted for drug clearance), edoxaban low exposure (30 mg daily, adjusted for drug clearance), or warfarin titrated to an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0. The edoxaban strategies provide for dynamic dose reductions in subjects with anticipated increased drug exposure. Blinded treatment is maintained through the use of sham international normalized ratios in patients receiving edoxaban. Eligibility criteria include electrical documentation of atrial fibrillation ≤ 12 months and a CHADS₂ score ≥ 2. Randomization is stratified by CHADS(2) score and anticipated drug exposure. The primary objective is to determine whether edoxaban is noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism. The primary safety end point is modified International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding. Recruitment began in November 2008. The expected median follow-up is 24 months.

Conclusions

ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 is a phase 3 comparison of the novel oral factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban to warfarin for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Effect of non-recommended doses versus recommended doses of direct oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation patients: a meta-analysis [^114YSe2i]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, we included more studies to quantitatively assess the effect of both underdosing and overdosing DOACs on adverse outcomes among AF patients. Our results suggested that compared with recommended dosing of DOACs, non‐recommended low dosing of DOACs could increase the risks of stroke or systemic embolism and all‐cause death. For the secondary outcomes, the risk for ischemic stroke was not increased in patients with non‐recommended low dosing of DOACs, while the risk for all‐cause death was higher among subjects with non recommended low dose, supporting the possibility that worse patients' condition resulted in physicians' prescribing a lower dose, and the poor condition was also associated with a worse prognosis. In addition, we also found that non‐recommended high dosing of DOACs could increase risks of stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding. Herein, it was interesting to see the increased risk of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with non‐recommended high dosing of DOACs. In this part, we included five studies in the pooled analysis. As shown in Figure 3, all of the HRs were more than 1 across the included studies, although they were non‐significant. Therefore, the HR would be significant when increasing the sample size in the pooled analysis. The further studies should confirm these findings.

### Edoxaban vs warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in the US food and drug administration approval population: an analysis from the effective anticoagulation with factor Xa next generation in atrial fibrillation-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 48 (ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48) trial [^111PuEEo]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Edoxaban is a specific anti-Xa inhibitor that, in comparison to warfarin, has been found to be noninferior for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism (SSE) and to reduce bleeding significantly in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the higher-dose edoxaban regimen (60/30 mg) in patients with AF and a creatinine clearance of ≤ 95 mL/min. We report for the first time the clinical characteristics, efficacy, and safety of the FDA-approved population in the ENGAGE AF — TIMI 48 trial.

Methods

The patients included had been treated with either warfarin or edoxaban 60/30 mg and had a creatinine clearance of ≤ 95 mL/min. The primary efficacy was SSE, and the principal safety end point was major bleeding (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis classification). Median follow-up was 2.8 years.

Results

Patients in the FDA-approved cohort were older, were more likely female, and had higher CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores, as compared with patients not included in the FDA label. The primary end point occurred in 1.63%/y with edoxaban vs 2.02%/y with warfarin (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.67–0.97, P = 0.023). Edoxaban significantly reduced the rate of hemorrhagic stroke (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31–0.72, P < .001) and cardiovascular death (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73–0.97, P = 0.015). Ischemic stroke rates were similar between the treatment groups (1.31%/y vs 1.39%/y, P = 0.97). Major bleeding was significantly lower with edoxaban (3.16%/y vs 3.77%/y; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72–0.98, P = 0.023).

Conclusion

In the FDA-approved cohort of the ENGAGE AF — TIMI 48 trial, treatment with edoxaban 60/30 mg was superior to warfarin in the prevention of SSE and significantly reduced cardiovascular death and bleeding, especially fatal bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke.

### Very elderly patients with atrial fibrillation treated with edoxaban: impact of frailty on outcomes [^114NYp4J]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Study population and intervention

ESCAPE (Edoxaban Performance in Senior Citizens With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Evaluated per Frailty) was a multicenter prospective cohort study enrolling consecutive patients of 80 years or older with a new diagnosis of AF not related to rheumatic mitral stenosis or patients with mechanical valves that were considered for oral anticoagulation with recommended doses of edoxaban according to the summary of product characteristics. The Ethics Committee of the Padua University Hospital approved the protocol. All participants gave written informed consent, and the study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. AF had to be diagnosed by means of an electrical tracing within the 30 days preceding enrollment. In case patients had started low molecular weight heparin or vitamin K antagonists, they were switched to edoxaban, according to the summary of product characteristics. Patients were excluded (exclusion criteria provided in the Supplemental Appendix) if they had a known contraindication to anticoagulation therapy in general or edoxaban in particular. Baseline demographic characteristics, comorbidities, stroke and bleeding risk factors, medications, and blood tests, including hemoglobin, creatinine, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, were measured at baseline and reassessed at each follow-up visit. Stroke risk was assessed using the CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score. The first patient was enrolled in November 2018. Follow-up visits were set at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) was calculated at each visit using the Cockcroft-Gault formula, and the recommended doses of edoxaban were administered to all patients. Low dose edoxaban regimen, 30 mg once daily, was prescribed in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl 15–50 mL/min), in patients with body ≤ 60 kg, and in case of concomitant use of P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as ciclosporin, dronedarone, erythromycin, or ketoconazole. High dose edoxaban regimen, 60 mg once daily, was prescribed in the rest of patients. The off-label use of very low dose edoxaban, 15 mg, was not permitted. Edoxaban dosage (30 mg or 60 mg) could be changed according to CrCl, weight, or medications at each visit. Patients could be assessed at any time in between in case of adverse events, hospitalizations, or contacts requiring medical attention. At follow-up visits, the dedicated physician assessed adherence and compliance to therapy, relevant blood tests, and patient clinical status. Follow-up was conducted in person during medical office visits or by phone contact during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. The last patient was contacted on March 2022. The end of follow-up was considered the completion of 24 months of follow-up, the occurrence of an event part of the study outcome, permanent interruption of edoxaban, whichever came first. Temporary interruption of edoxaban for invasive procedures/interventions was permitted following the standard DOAC protocol.

### Edoxaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111hsk66]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 30 mg) was published by Giugliano RP and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 30 mg) study, the trial question was: is edoxaban noninferior to warfarin in patients with AF? In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 30 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 30 mg) study, the population was: 14070 patients (5371 female, 8699 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AF at moderate-to-high AF risk. The key exclusion criteria were AF due to a reversible disorder; high risk of bleeding; use of dual antiplatelet therapy; moderate-to-severe MS; other indications for anticoagulation therapy; acute coronary syndromes, coronary revascularization, or stroke in the past 30 days. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 30 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 7034 low-dose edoxaban (30 mg/day) n = 7036 warfarin (dose-adjusted to achieve an INR of 2.0–3.0). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 30 mg) study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in stroke or systemic embolic events (1.61% vs. 1.5%; HR 1.07, 97.5% CI 0.87 to 1.31). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 30 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in stroke, systemic embolism, or death from cardiovascular causes (4.23% vs. 4.43%; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05) Significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes (2.71% vs. 3.17%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.96) No significant difference in myocardial infarction (0.89% vs. 0.75%; HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.49). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 30 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in stroke and systemic embolic events. significant difference in major bleeding events (1.61% vs. 3.43%). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 30 mg) study, the conclusion was: in patients with AF at moderate-to-high AF risk, low-dose edoxaban was noninferior to warfarin with respect to stroke or systemic embolic events.

### Outcomes and safety of very-low-dose edoxaban in frail patients with atrial fibrillation in the ELDERCARE-AF randomized clinical trial [^114RGS1H]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Regardless of frailty status, among very elderly Japanese patients with AF who were considered ineligible for standard anticoagulant treatment because of their high bleeding risks, very-low-dose edoxaban (15 mg) was associated with reduced incidence of SSE and a higher incidence of major or CRNM bleeding than placebo. Edoxaban may be a suitable treatment option for these patients.

### Apixaban concentrations in routine clinical care of older adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^11683dfw]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

The second finding with important clinical implications is the lower concentrations with reduced dosing of apixaban. Even with label-recommended dosing, 2.5 mg twice daily produced 32% to 41% lower apixaban exposure than 5 mg twice daily. This is a larger difference than the 25% lower exposure observed in ARISTOTLE. Only 4.7% of those randomized to apixaban in ARISTOTLE received 2.5 mg twice daily (with 15% not meeting study-defined reduction criteria). Thus, conclusions regarding the efficacy of apixaban for stroke prevention in NVAF are based on the 95% of NVAF patients receiving 5 mg twice daily and concentrations associated with those doses. Curvilinear relationships have been modeled for stroke prevention as well as bleeding, for dabigatran and edoxaban. Across the range of apixaban concentrations analyzed in subgroups of ARISTOTLE and AVERROES (Apixaban VERsus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed Or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment), relationships were detected for bleeding and concentrations, but not for stroke, although events were low in the limited number of patients with concentrations measured. One observational study examining DOAC concentrations and stroke/thrombotic events in 565 atrial fibrillation patients (208 on apixaban) found thromboembolic complications only in patients with concentrations in the lowest quartile for each drug. Estimates are that 25% to 40% of NVAF patients are prescribed 2.5 mg twice daily, and outcomes may be worse when dosed lower than label recommendations. Until the stroke-prevention efficacy of 2.5 mg of apixaban twice daily is demonstrated, it would seem logical that evidence-based goals in patients with NVAF would be to approximate concentrations shown to be efficacious for stroke prevention with 5 mg twice daily dosing.

### Effect of non-recommended doses versus recommended doses of direct oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation patients: a meta-analysis [^112zXEjF]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In these years, more and more researchers have explored the effect of non‐recommended low dose or non‐recommended high dose of DOACs among patients with AF. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 However, the findings of those observational studies are sometimes quite different; and thus, the effectiveness and safety profiles among non‐recommended doses of DOACs remain unclear, leaving physicians with difficulties in decision‐making regarding the choice of DOAC doses. Therefore, we conducted a meta‐analysis and systematic review to examine the effect of non‐recommended doses (underdosing or overdosing) versus recommended doses of DOACs on effectiveness and/or safety outcomes among AF patients.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114Z5jKo]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS atrial fibrillation — direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): DOACs were developed to address the disadvantages of warfarin and are currently recommended as the first-line therapy over warfarin in patients with AF (except moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve recipients). Across pivotal trials, major bleeding risks were lower in the apixaban, dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, and edoxaban 30 mg or 60 mg daily dose groups versus warfarin, while differences were nonsignificant for the dabigatran 150 mg twice daily group or the rivaroxaban group; all DOAC groups showed significantly lower risks of intracranial hemorrhage. Gastrointestinal bleeding risks were significantly higher with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, edoxaban 60 mg once daily, and rivaroxaban compared with warfarin, whereas apixaban did not significantly increase gastrointestinal bleeding versus warfarin.

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^113P1c7r]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Apixaban and edoxaban were associated with lower rates of major bleeding, whereas both doses of dabigatran and rivaroxaban were associated with similar rates of major bleeding, as compared to warfarin (Table 2). Both doses of dabigatran were actually associated with lower bleeding rates, as compared to warfarin at CrCl > 80 mL/min. With decreasing CrCl, bleeding rates increased in both warfarin and dabigatran groups. The curves of dabigatran 150 mg and 110 mg crossed the warfarin curve at a CrCl of 50 and 40 mL/min, respectively, and surpassed warfarin rates at lower levels of CrCl. In an individual patient level meta-analysis of 71,683 patients (COMBINE AF) from the four RCTs where kidney function was assessed as a continuous variable, Harrington et al. classified patients into three groups: standard dose DOAC, low dose DOAC, and warfarin. Standard dose DOACs, as compared to warfarin, had lower hazards for stroke/SE, mortality, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and similar rates of major bleeding. The hazards for stroke/SE, mortality, and ICH with standard dose DOACs compared with warfarin dropped by 4.8, 2.1, and 6.2%, respectively, for every 10 mL/min reduction in CrCl. Patients treated with low-dose DOACs as compared to warfarin had a lower hazard of bleeding, death, and ICH across CrCl values above 35, 56 mL/min, or all CrCl values, respectively.

Based on these data, DOACs are preferable to warfarin for patients with moderate CKD. Dosing recommendations are shown in Figure 2.

### Can edoxaban be used at extremes of bodyweight and in patients with a creatinine clearance ≥ 95 mL / min? – A population pharmacokinetic analysis [^111MbxRC]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical evidence surrounding edoxaban use in patients weighing < 50 kg and > 120 kg is lacking. The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis Scientific and Standardisation Committee suggests avoiding edoxaban in patients > 120 kg. Additionally, concerns exist regarding decreased efficacy in patients prescribed edoxaban for atrial fibrillation with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 95 ml/min, a finding of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial when edoxaban was compared to warfarin.

Objective

To derive a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model using clinical practice data, to understand the impact of bodyweight and renal function on edoxaban pharmacokinetics.

Method

Edoxaban plasma concentrations and patient characteristics were collated from King's College Hospital anticoagulation clinics between 11/2016 and 08/2022. A PopPK model was developed using non-linear mixed effects modelling and used to simulate edoxaban concentrations at the extremes of bodyweight and with varying renal function.

Results

Data from 409 patients (46 < 50 kg, 34 > 120 kg and 123 with a CrCl > 95 ml/min) provided 455 edoxaban plasma concentrations. A one-compartment model with between-subject variability on clearance with a proportional error model best described the data. The most significant covariates impacting on edoxaban exposure were CrCl and bodyweight. Our work suggests that edoxaban exposure in patients weighing up to 140 kg is comparable to those weighing 75 kg. Edoxaban exposure is reduced in patients weighing < 50 kg due to the recommended dose reductions. There is also a reduction in AUCss when CrCl > 95 ml/min compared to CrCl 80 ml/min.

Conclusions

Our population PK model for edoxaban suggests that renal function is a key driver for overall edoxaban exposure. Further clinical outcome data is required to understand clinical effectiveness and adverse outcomes.

### Routine clinical practice in the periprocedural management of edoxaban therapy is associated with low risk of bleeding and thromboembolic complications: the prospective, observational, and multinational EMIT-AF / VTE study [^114obrsL]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidance for periprocedural anticoagulant management is mainly based on limited data from Phase III or observational studies and expert opinion.

Hypothesis

EMIT-AF/VTE was designed to document the risks of bleeding and thromboembolic events in more than 1000 patients on edoxaban undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in clinical practice.

Methods

Routine care in a multinational multicenter, prospective observational study. Participants were adult patients with atrial fibrillation and/or venous thromboembolism treated with edoxaban for stroke prevention or for secondary prevention in venous thromboembolic disease, undergoing a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Edoxaban therapy was interrupted periprocedurally at the treating physician's discretion. Patients were evaluated from 5days pre- until 30days postprocedure. Primary outcome was the incidence of International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis defined major bleeding; secondary outcomes included incidence of clinically relevant non-major bleeding, acute coronary syndrome, and acute thromboembolic events.

Results

Outcomes and management are reported for the first procedures in 1155 unselected patients. Five cases of major bleeding (0.4%) and eight of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (0.7%) were documented, five (38%) of which occurred outside the period of likely edoxaban effect (last edoxaban dose ≥ 3days prior to bleeding). Five (0.4%) deaths from any cause, seven acute thromboembolic events (0.6%) including two cardiac deaths (0.2%) in six patients, and one acute coronary event (0.1%) occurred.

Conclusions

The periprocedural bleeding and acute thromboembolic event risks for patients treated with edoxaban were low. This can help inform both clinical routine and guidelines for the periprocedural management of edoxaban.

### Differences in activated clotting time and initial heparin dosage during atrial fibrillation ablation for patients with edoxaban compared with warfarin [^115iSooA]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Different target activated clotting times (ACTs) during atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation have been proposed. Moreover, relationships between initial bolus dose of heparin at the start of AF ablation in patients receiving edoxaban anticoagulation therapy and ACT are unclear.

Methods

Patients who received anticoagulation with uninterrupted warfarin (control; n = 120) or interrupted edoxaban (n = 120) on the morning of day of ablation were studied. An initial dose of 100 U/kg heparin was administered as a reliable control for warfarin. Initial heparin doses of 120, 130, 140, or 150 U/kg were randomly administered to the edoxaban group.

Results

Edoxaban group showed shorter baseline ACT before the procedure (130 ± 16 seconds) than the warfarin group (152 ± 26 seconds, P < 0.0001). In the warfarin group, 100 U/kg heparin showed 361 ± 48 seconds 15-minute ACT. In the edoxaban group, an increase in initial dose induced prolongation of 15-minute ACT (i.e., 15-minute ACTs of 293 ± 56, 306 ± 39, 311 ± 45, and 319 ± 45 seconds for 120, 130, 140, and 150 U/kg initial doses, respectively). The total heparin required during the procedure was higher in the edoxaban group than in the warfarin group (109 ± 37 vs. 77 ± 21 U/kg/h, P < 0.0001). The 120–150 U/kg dose of heparin in edoxaban group did not cause thromboembolic or major bleeding complications.

Conclusion

Edoxaban interrupted on the day of ablation showed a shorter baseline ACT than uninterrupted warfarin. Edoxaban required a higher initial heparin dose to achieve a similar 15-minute ACT to warfarin. These results are useful for determining the initial heparin dose required to achieve variable target ACTs.

### Effectiveness and safety of reduced dose non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: propensity weighted nationwide cohort study [^112sCyrP]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of ischaemic stroke and mortality. During the past five years, large randomised trials have established that non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (novel oral anticoagulants, NOACs) have a similar efficacy to warfarin but have a superior safety profile, largely driven by a substantial reduction in associated risk of intracranial haemorrhage. These findings have subsequently changed guidelines to either include NOACs as an option for stroke prophylaxisor to recommend these agents as first choice of drug. The findings of clinical trials have been confirmed in various observational cohort studies based on data from clinical practice.

While meticulous dose adjustments are not required for NOACs as they are for warfarin, a clinical evaluation of appropriate (constant) dose is still necessary. Various degrees of renal function entails recommendations to offer these drugs in a reduced dosing regimen, but different cut-off values for age, body weight, or interacting drugs also require consideration for appropriate dose selection. Indeed, both age and chronic kidney disease in patients with atrial fibrillation intensifies the risk of stroke and increases the risk of bleeding during antithrombotic treatment. Elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (such as those aged ≥ 80) and patients with impaired renal function were included in the landmark trials of NOACs, but these important subgroups comprised only a small proportion of the patient populations.

Nevertheless, contemporary guidelines suggest a reduced dosing regimen for dabigatran (110 mg twice a day) if patients are aged ≥ 80 or have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30–50 mL/min; rivaroxaban (15 mg once a day) if eGRF is 15–49 mL/min; apixaban (2.5 mg twice a day) if two of the three following criteria are present: age ≥ 80 or an eGRF 15–29 mL/min or body weight ≤ 60 kg; or edoxaban (30 mg once a day) if eGFR is 15–50 mL/min. While subgroup analyses including patients with varying degree of renal function showed comparable efficacy with warfarin, evidence on reduce dose regimens of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants from "real world" clinical practice is scarce. In response to this lack of evidence about reduce dose regimens for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, we conducted a nationwide cohort study to examine effectiveness and safety compared with warfarin. To ascertain appropriateness of prescribing, we particularly focused on subgroups of elderly patients and those with impaired renal function, given their potential "indication for dose reduction" when NOACs are used.

### Off-label-dosing of non-vitamin K-dependent oral antagonists in AF patients before and after stroke: results of the prospective multicenter Berlin atrial fibrillation registry [^115tyYg6]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Randomized controlled trials (RCT) have demonstrated non-inferiority of non-vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulant (NOAC) compared to the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) warfarin in (recurrent) stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and at least moderate risk of stroke. NOACs are superior to warfarin by reducing the risk of intracranial bleeding. Present guidelines strongly recommend oral anticoagulation using a NOAC or a VKA for stroke prevention in patients with AF and prior ischemic stroke. Registry data showed a steep increase of NOAC use for secondary stroke prevention after ischemic stroke/TIA in AF patients, even in elderly stroke patients with AF. Treating physicians are advised to prescribe the guideline-recommended in-label NOAC dosage in each patient, taking patients' age (for dabigatran, apixaban, and edoxaban), renal function (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) as well as body weight (apixaban and edoxaban) into account. According to prior investigations, up to 50% of all patients prescribed NOACs were inappropriately dosed, the vast majority of patients being under-dosed. This is of clinical relevance, as results from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials as well as several registries showed that off-label NOAC dosing is associated with worse clinical outcome. Published data on off-label dosing of NOACs is almost exclusively based on AF cohorts including a subset of patients with prior stroke. Findings on AF patients with acute ischemic stroke are rare.

The Berlin Atrial Fibrillation Registry is a multicenter prospective registry including AF patients with acute ischemic stroke/TIA. First results on factors associated with oral anticoagulation use were published previously. In the present analysis, we focus on prevalence and predictors of NOAC under-dosing in AF patients before and after the index stroke.

### Cost-effectiveness of edoxaban vs warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation based on results of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^111n2PFD]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In 21,105 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial demonstrated that both higher dose (60mg/30mg dose reduced) and lower dose (30mg/15mg dose reduced) once-daily regimens of edoxaban were non-inferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism (SE), with significantly lower rates of bleeding and cardiovascular death. Higher dose edoxaban was associated with a greater reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke than lower dose edoxaban, and the FDA approved higher dose edoxaban in patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 95mL/min. This study evaluated the economic value of higher dose edoxaban vs warfarin based on data from patients in ENGAGE within the FDA-approved population.

Methods

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of edoxaban vs warfarin over a lifetime horizon from the US healthcare system perspective using a Markov model based on a combination of ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial data, US life tables, and published literature on the costs and long-term outcomes of non-fatal cardiovascular and bleeding events. Data from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial were used to calculate age-adjusted event rates for warfarin and hazard ratios (HRs) for the relative impact of edoxaban on embolic and bleeding complications. Based on the wholesale acquisition price, edoxaban and warfarin were assumed to cost $9.24 and $0.36/day, respectively.

Results

For edoxaban vs warfarin, lifetime incremental costs and QALYs were $16,384 and 0.444, respectively, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $36,862/QALY gained, using data from patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 95mL/min in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48. ICERs were more favorable for patients without compared to those with prior warfarin use; ICERs differed minimally by CHADS2 score.

Conclusions

Despite its higher acquisition cost, edoxaban is an economically attractive alternative to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and SE in patients with atrial fibrillation and creatinine clearance ≤ 95mL/min. These results were robust to variation of key model parameters, including assumptions regarding the cost and quality-of-life impact of stroke and bleeding events, and were favorable across both CHADS2 score stroke-risk categories.

### Very elderly patients with atrial fibrillation treated with edoxaban: impact of frailty on outcomes [^111uzdbE]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Age and frailty are associated with underuse of anticoagulation in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objectives

This study aimed at assessing major clinical outcomes in very elderly patients with AF treated with recommended dose edoxaban and look for a possible relation with frailty measured by a validated score.

Methods

This prospective multicenter cohort study enrolled consecutive very elderly (age ≥ 80 years) anticoagulation-naïve patients starting recommended doses of edoxaban. Upon entry into the study, patients were categorized into nonfrail, prefrail and frail with the SHARE-FI (Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe-Frailty Index) score. The primary outcome was a composite incidence of stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, and death between frail and fitter patients over 2 years follow-up. Secondary outcomes were frailty-related incidence of the individual components part of the composite outcome.

Results

Of the 180 screened patients, 176 were enrolled in the study. Of these, 58 (32.9%) were frail, 35 (19.8%) prefrail, and 83 (47.2%) nonfrail. The composite outcome occurred in 49 patients (18.9% per patient-year). No difference in the primary endpoint between frail and fitter patients (incidence rate ratio: 1.2; 95% CI: 0.6–2.2) was observed. On multivariable analysis, anemia was significantly related to the primary outcome (HR: 3.6; 95% CI: 1.8–7.3; P < 0.001), while frailty was not (frail vs nonfrail HR: 0.9; 95% CI: 0.5–1.8). No difference across frailty categories of the individual components of composite events was observed, except for death.

Conclusions

Anticoagulation with recommended dose edoxaban is feasible in very elderly patients with AF even if frail. (ESCAPE [Edoxaban and Frailty in Senior Individuals]; NCT03524924).

### Edoxaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^114WEffY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Edoxaban is a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor with proven antithrombotic effects. The long-term efficacy and safety of edoxaban as compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation is not known.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial comparing two once-daily regimens of edoxaban with warfarin in 21,105 patients with moderate-to-high-risk atrial fibrillation (median follow-up, 2.8 years). The primary efficacy end point was stroke or systemic embolism. Each edoxaban regimen was tested for noninferiority to warfarin during the treatment period. The principal safety end point was major bleeding.

Results

The annualized rate of the primary end point during treatment was 1.50% with warfarin (median time in the therapeutic range, 68.4%), as compared with 1.18% with high-dose edoxaban (hazard ratio, 0.79; 97.5% confidence interval [CI] 0.63 to 0.99; P < 0.001 for noninferiority) and 1.61% with low-dose edoxaban (hazard ratio, 1.07; 97.5% CI, 0.87 to 1.31; P = 0.005 for noninferiority). In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was a trend favoring high-dose edoxaban versus warfarin (hazard ratio, 0.87; 97.5% CI, 0.73 to 1.04; P = 0.08) and an unfavorable trend with low-dose edoxaban versus warfarin (hazard ratio, 1.13; 97.5% CI, 0.96 to 1.34; P = 0.10). The annualized rate of major bleeding was 3.43% with warfarin versus 2.75% with high-dose edoxaban (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.91; P < 0.001) and 1.61% with low-dose edoxaban (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.55; P < 0.001). The corresponding annualized rates of death from cardiovascular causes were 3.17% versus 2.74% (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.97; P = 0.01), and 2.71% (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.96; P = 0.008), and the corresponding rates of the key secondary end point (a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, or death from cardiovascular causes) were 4.43% versus 3.85% (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.96; P = 0.005), and 4.23% (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.05; P = 0.32).

Conclusions

Both once-daily regimens of edoxaban were noninferior to warfarin with respect to the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism and were associated with significantly lower rates of bleeding and death from cardiovascular causes.

### Efficacy and safety of edoxaban in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^1176vfZw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In a pharmacokinetic analysis from the RE‐LY trial, 24 efficacy and safety outcomes were associated with dabigatran plasma concentration, in which age and renal function, 2 highly correlated covariates, were the major determining factors. In ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48, while age itself was not included as 1 of the criteria for dose reduction, 41% of patients ≥ 75 years of age received a dose reduction, most commonly (89%) due to the presence of moderate renal dysfunction (CrCl < 50 mL/min). As such, edoxaban plasma concentration and anti‐FXa activity increased only slightly with increasing age.

In the elderly, dose reduction resulted in a decrease in median edoxaban plasma concentration of 30% to 40% and a decrease in median anti‐FXa activity of 20% to 40%. However, the efficacy of edoxaban compared with warfarin in preventing stroke or SEE was preserved, while there was a significant interaction demonstrating an even greater reduction in major bleeding among elderly who received a dose reduction of edoxaban as compared to similar patients in the warfarin group (P interaction < 0.01). These findings are consistent with previous analyses in the overall ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 population, showing that dose reduction did not alter relative treatment efficacy, but did provide a greater reduction in major bleeding with edoxaban as compared with warfarin. 16, 17 As age is a strong predictor of bleeding events, and since edoxaban has a relatively wider therapeutic window for thromboembolism than major bleeding, 16 our results support the dose reduction strategy incorporated in the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial. These findings reinforce the importance of selecting the right dose for patients, particularly in elderly patients with renal dysfunction, to avoid excess bleeding. The high frequency of moderate renal insufficiency in the elderly underscores the need for close monitoring of fluctuations in renal function to ensure proper dosing. A recent practical guide on the use of NOACs suggests repeat assessment of renal function at intervals in months equal to the CrCl divided by 10 for patients with a CrCl < 60 mL/min (for example, a patient with CrCl of 40 mL/min is recommended to have repeat measurements every 4 months). 25

### Label adherence of direct oral anticoagulants dosing and clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113fMqgk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implication of Label Adherence of NOAC Dosing

There are several studies that have reported clinical outcomes according to label adherence of NOAC dosing. Previously we reported lower relative effectiveness for the prevention of thromboembolic events with low‐dose edoxaban regimen (30 mg daily) compared with warfarin in patients with a creatinine clearance > 95 mL/min in real‐world setting. 12 In that study, a 30‐mg dosage of edoxaban was used in 31% of patients with supranormal renal clearance and ≈40% of patients were using lower doses of edoxaban inappropriately when analyzed based on body weight and creatinine clearance criteria of label‐recommended edoxaban dosing. In the ORBIT‐AF II registry, NOAC over‐ and underdosing were associated with increased risk for adverse events such as stroke or systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, and all‐cause mortality compared with the recommended dosing of NOACs. 10 Especially, inappropriate dose reduction of NOAC was associated with a reduced effectiveness for stroke prevention without any safety benefit. 11 Recently, a meta‐analysis of pivotal randomized controlled trials showed that NOACs had an improved benefit‐harm profile compared with warfarin when appropriately dose‐adjusted. 23 Efficacy and safety of reduced‐dose NOACs compared with warfarin in patients eligible for reduced‐dose NOACs were consistent with those of full‐dose NOACs relative to warfarin in those eligible for full‐dose NOACs. In our current study, the adverse clinical consequence was higher in the overdosing group compared with the on‐label dosing group, and there was no safety benefit of underdosing compared with the appropriate dosing of NOACs. Based on the results so far, label adherence of NOAC dosing is important to improve the clinical outcomes in AF patients, and further investigation is needed to assess the optimal dosing of NOACs in the Asian AF population.

### Individualized approaches to thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation [^117Si81W]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide. The prevalence of AF in persons older than 55 years is at least 33.5 million globally and is predicted to more than double in the next half-century. Anticoagulation, heart rate control, and heart rhythm control comprise the 3 main treatment strategies in AF. Anticoagulation is aimed at preventing debilitating stroke, systemic embolism, and associated mortality. Historically, anticoagulation in AF was achieved with a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin, which is supported by evidence demonstrating reduced incident stroke and all-cause mortality. However, warfarin has unpredictable pharmacokinetics with many drug-drug interactions that require regular monitoring to ensure patients remain in the therapeutic anticoagulant range. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban provide a possible solution to these issues with their more predictable pharmacokinetics, rapid onset of action, and greater specificity. Results from large randomized, controlled trials indicate that these agents are at least noninferior to warfarin in prevention of stroke. These trials also demonstrate a consistently lower incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, almost always all life-threatening bleeds, and many forms of major bleeds with the possible exception of gastrointestinal and some other forms of mucosal bleeding, compared with warfarin. Patients with AF are a heterogeneous population with diverse risk of stroke and bleeding, and different subgroups respond differently to anticoagulation. Important clinical questions have arisen regarding optimal anticoagulation drug selection in distinct populations such as those with renal impairment, older age, coronary artery disease, and heart failure as well as those at particularly high risk for bleeding or thromboembolism. In this review, treatment strategies in AF management are discussed in the context of different individual subgroups of patients.

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^113hrQAa]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Edoxaban

In a study from Japan, 93 participants with atrial fibrillation received either 15 mg of edoxaban (if they had a CrCl of 15–29 mL/min) or were randomized to receive 30 or 60 mg of edoxaban (if they had a CrCl > 50 mL/min). A 50% dose reduction was applied in the group of participants with a CrCl > 50 mL/min if they also had a body weight < 60 kg or were treated with quinidine or verapamil. Exposure at steady state with the 15 mg once daily dose in patients with stage IV CKD was comparable to drug exposure with the 30 and 60 mg once daily dose in patients with CrCl > 50 mL/min. This study confirmed prior results from population PK modeling, suggesting 50% dose reduction for edoxaban in patients with advanced CKD.

### Dose reduction of edoxaban in patients 80 years and older with atrial fibrillation: post hoc analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 randomized clinical trial [^111gKrze]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The study ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (post-hoc analysis, edoxaban 60 mg vs. 30 mg) was published by André Zimerman and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Cardiol. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (post-hoc analysis, edoxaban 60 mg vs. 30 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of edoxaban in elderly patients with AF? In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (post-hoc analysis, edoxaban 60 mg vs. 30 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (post-hoc analysis, edoxaban 60 mg vs. 30 mg) study, the population was: 1138 patients (411 female, 727 male). The inclusion criteria were elderly patients aged ≥ 80 years with AF who were receiving edoxaban without dose-reduction criteria. The key exclusion criteria were estimated CrCl < 30 mL/min; moderate or severe MS; mechanical heart valve; high risk of bleeding; use of dual antiplatelet therapy; AF due to a reversible disorder. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (post-hoc analysis, edoxaban 60 mg vs. 30 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 560 high-dose edoxaban (at a dose of 60 mg daily) n = 578 low-dose edoxaban (at a dose of 30 mg daily). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (post-hoc analysis, edoxaban 60 mg vs. 30 mg) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in stroke or systemic embolism (1.93% vs. 2.26%; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.36). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (post-hoc analysis, edoxaban 60 mg vs. 30 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death, stroke, systemic embolism, and major bleeding (10.65% vs. 9.47%; HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.4) No significant difference in death from all causes (5.35% vs. 5.37%; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.34) No significant difference in ischemic stroke (1.51% vs. 1.72%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.49). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (post-hoc analysis, edoxaban 60 mg vs. 30 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in major bleeding (4.84% vs. 3.08%), major gastrointestinal bleeding (3.28% vs. 1.49%). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (post-hoc analysis, edoxaban 60 mg vs. 30 mg) study, the conclusion was: in elderly patients aged ≥ 80 years with AF who were receiving edoxaban without dose-reduction criteria, high-dose edoxaban was not superior to low-dose edoxaban with respect to stroke or systemic embolism.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in older patients with atrial fibrillation: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113BtUZ1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Although older patients with atrial fibrillation are at heightened risk of thromboembolic and bleeding events, their optimal treatment choice remains uncertain.

Methods and Results

This meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials that compared thromboembolic or bleeding outcomes between a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and reported outcomes for patients aged ≥ 75years with atrial fibrillation. The efficacy outcome was the composite of stroke and systemic embolism. Safety outcomes included major bleeding, any clinically relevant bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage. Each DOAC and VKA was compared pairwise in a network meta-analysis. High- and low-dose regimens and factor IIa and Xa inhibitors were also compared. Seven randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis. Stroke and systemic embolism risks did not differ significantly among DOACs. There were no significant differences in major bleeding between each DOAC and VKA. Intracranial hemorrhage risk was significantly lower with dabigatran, apixaban, and edoxaban than with VKA and rivaroxaban, which had similar risks. High-dose regimens led to lower risks of stroke or systemic embolism compared with VKA and low-dose regimens, with both doses having similar bleeding risks.

Conclusions

In patients aged ≥ 75years with atrial fibrillation, DOACs were associated with fewer thromboembolic events compared with VKA, whereas dabigatran, apixaban, and edoxaban were associated with lower risks of intracranial hemorrhage compared with VKA and rivaroxaban.

### Low-dose edoxaban effective for stroke prevention in older patients with atrial fibrillation… [^114FFXVA]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Bottom Line A lower dose of edoxaban is effective in decreasing stroke and systemic embolism in older patients with atrial fibrillation compared with placebo. Although the difference in major bleeding rates with edoxaban vs. placebo did not reach statistical significance, edoxaban use led to higher rates of gastrointestinal bleeding and clinically significant nonmajor bleeding. This study was completed in Japan, and the mean body mass index of participants was 22 kg per m. 2, which may not generalize to the population in the United States. Synopsis Many older patients with atrial fibrillation may not be prescribed standard doses of anticoagulation for stroke prevention because of a perceived higher risk of bleeding. In this Japanese study, investigators enrolled patients 80 years and older with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and a CHADS.

2 score of 2 or more for whom standard doses of oral anticoagulants were considered inappropriate. A total of 984 patients were randomized to receive edoxaban, 15 mg daily, or a matched placebo. The two groups had similar baseline characteristics: mean age of 86. 6 years, mean body weight of
111. 5 lb, and a mean CHADS₂ score of 3. The annualized rate of stroke or systemic embolism was lower in the edoxaban group than in the placebo group.

The incidence of major bleeding was higher in the edoxaban group, although this difference did not reach significance. The edoxaban group had statistically significant higher rates of gastrointestinal bleeding (2. 3% vs.

### Laboratory monitoring of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant use in patients with atrial fibrillation: a review [^1128SZPk]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are administered in fixed doses without anticoagulant monitoring. Randomized trials show that unmonitored NOAC therapy is at least as effective as and safer than dose-adjusted warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Subgroup analyses indicate that plasma drug levels or anticoagulant activity of the NOACs predict stroke and bleeding. This review examines the historical basis for anticoagulant monitoring, discusses methods to measure and interpret drug levels, and critically assesses the role of routine laboratory monitoring in the management of NOAC therapy.

Observations

The predictable anticoagulant response of NOACs has provided the pharmacological basis for their administration in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring. Although it is possible to accurately measure NOAC drug levels, within-patient variability complicates interpretation of these results. Furthermore, patient characteristics, such as age and renal function, confound the association between NOAC drug levels and clinical outcomes. Information is lacking on the optimal drug level in particular patient groups (eg, elderly, the renally impaired, and those with high bleeding risk), the appropriate dose adjustment to achieve expected levels, and whether routine laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment will improve clinical outcomes. A benefit of a management strategy that incorporates routine therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment over current standard-of-care metrics without such monitoring remains unproven.

Conclusions and Relevance

Robust evidence from patients with atrial fibrillation randomized to NOACs or warfarin demonstrates that unmonitored NOAC therapy is at least as effective and safe as monitored warfarin, with lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage and reduced mortality. Further research is required to determine whether routine laboratory monitoring might provide a net benefit for patients. Until such data are available, clinicians should continue to prescribe NOACs in fixed doses without routine monitoring.

### Label adherence of direct oral anticoagulants dosing and clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1148RSsD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is rapidly increasing globally, especially in the Asian population, 1, 2 and oral anticoagulation (OAC) is the principal management for stroke prevention in patients with AF. 3, 4 The efficacy and safety of the non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) have all been shown at least as effective and safe as warfarin in large randomized controlled trials. 5, 6, 7, 8

Dose adjustment of NOACs is indicated in some AF patients, based on selected patient factors such as renal function, age, body weight, or concomitant medications. 9 However, whether these dose recommendations are adhered to in community practice remains a major concern. In a study with ORBIT‐AF II (Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation II) database, 10 NOAC over‐ and underdosing were shown to be associated with increased risk for adverse events. In addition, a previous study using a large US administrative database with about 15 000 AF patients revealed that the prescribed doses were often inconsistent with the renal dose recommendation by Food and Drug Administration labeling. 11 In that study, inappropriate dose reduction was related to reduced effectiveness for stroke prevention without any safety benefit. Recently, we reported the real‐world effectiveness and safety of edoxaban in Korean AF patients in relationship to renal function. 12 Interestingly, low‐dose edoxaban had lower effectiveness for stroke prevention compared with warfarin at higher levels of creatinine clearance, which is called super normal renal function.

Therefore, in the current study, we sought to assess the frequency of label adherence of NOAC dosing among Korean AF patients, and to analyze the associations between off‐label NOAC dosing and clinical outcomes in real‐world clinical practice.

### Frailty and cardiovascular health [^113bGivz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial Fibrillation

Frailty is highly prevalent among older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) and is associated with increased rates of mortality, stroke, and persistent or permanent AF. Despite this, the 2014 AHA/ACC/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines and their 2019 update do not explicitly address frailty. The 2020 ESC guidelines briefly address patients with older age and frailty, emphasizing that these patients benefit from oral anticoagulants and rate or rhythm control options offered to younger or more robust patients. In the years since these guidelines were published, a robust body of practice‐guiding research has grown about anticoagulation for patients with AF and frailty, while fewer studies have investigated rhythm and rate control in this population.

Anticoagulation

The decision for anticoagulation is challenging in adults with frailty due to increased risk of both stroke and bleeding. Studies have demonstrated that the net benefit of oral anticoagulants remains similar among frailty and fall‐risk statuses, with stroke‐protective benefits improving mortality and outweighing the risk of hemorrhage. Compared with warfarin, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran, apixaban has the most favorable outcomes, specifically in terms of reduced bleeding risk. Moreover, in certain patients not deemed suitable for full‐dose oral anticoagulation, the ELDERCARE‐AF (Edoxaban Low‐Dose for Elder Care Atrial Fibrillation Patients) RCT compared low‐dose edoxaban (15 mg daily) with placebo in Japanese patients with nonvalvular AF and age older than 80 years. Among these patients, 40.9% were frail, and the use of edoxaban showed a significant reduction in thromboembolic events without a significantly increased incidence of major bleeding.

However, in patients already established on warfarin, switching to a direct oral anticoagulant was associated with increased adverse events, including a higher bleeding risk (HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.23–2.32]), as demonstrated in the FRAIL‐AF (Frail Atrial Fibrillation) RCT. Therefore, while direct oral anticoagulants may be preferred for patients with AF and frailty who are anticoagulant‐naïve, switching patients already taking stable therapeutic doses of warfarin may do more harm than good.

Despite this evidence, patients with frailty remain less likely to be prescribed oral anticoagulants among health care settings, with frailty and falls cited as the most common reasons for anticoagulant nonprescription. In summary, based on the evidence and the 2023 Beer list recommendation, and in the context of shared decision‐making, clinicians should avoid prescribing warfarin and rivaroxaban. Instead, they should consider apixaban or a low dose in anticoagulant‐naïve patients with frailty.

### Efficacy and safety of edoxaban in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^113uev4i]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, and its prevalence is strongly related to age, 1, 2, 3, 4 predisposing the elderly to an increased risk of embolic stroke. Although oral anticoagulant therapy with vitamin K antagonists effectively reduces the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with AF, 5 there is a known increased bleeding risk with vitamin K antagonists, particularly in the elderly. 6, 7, 8 Thus, older age is an overlapping factor in both the CHA₂DS₂ ‐VASc score for stroke, 9 and the HAS‐BLED score for bleeding risk, 10 and frequent international normalized ratio monitoring is recommended to ensure the optimal level of anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists in the elderly. In addition, the use of vitamin K antagonists is limited by multiple drug and food interactions. As a consequence, anticoagulants are underused in the elderly, despite their high risk of ischemic events. 11, 12

Edoxaban, a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor, has a linear pharmacokinetic profile and is given once daily. In the Effective aNticoaGulation with factor Xa next GEneration in Atrial Fibrillation–Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction study 48 (ENGAGE AF–TIMI 48), 2 dose regimens of edoxaban were noninferior to well‐managed warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolic events (SEE) while reducing major bleeding and death from cardiovascular causes in patients with AF. Likewise, other non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have proven to be at least as effective as warfarin in reducing stroke with lower major bleeding rates. 13 However, subgroup analyses from 2 of these newer agents, namely, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, as compared to warfarin, have demonstrated a reduced safety margin with respect to bleeding in the elderly. 14, 15

As previously reported in a pharmacokinetic and outcomes analysis, the risk of stroke or SEE with edoxaban decreases gradually and linearly with increasing edoxaban concentration, in contrast with the steeper increase in the risk of major bleeding. 16 Thus, the therapeutic window for edoxaban is narrower for major bleeding than thromboembolism.

Given the concern over increased risk of bleeding in the elderly, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of edoxaban compared with warfarin stratified by age in the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in older patients with atrial fibrillation: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113H1Fq8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Although older patients with atrial fibrillation are at heightened risk of thromboembolic and bleeding events, their optimal treatment choice remains uncertain.

Methods and Results

This meta‐analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines. We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials that compared thromboembolic or bleeding outcomes between a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and reported outcomes for patients aged ≥ 75 years with atrial fibrillation. The efficacy outcome was the composite of stroke and systemic embolism. Safety outcomes included major bleeding, any clinically relevant bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage. Each DOAC and VKA was compared pairwise in a network meta‐analysis. High‐ and low‐dose regimens and factor IIa and Xa inhibitors were also compared. Seven randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis. Stroke and systemic embolism risks did not differ significantly among DOACs. There were no significant differences in major bleeding between each DOAC and VKA. Intracranial hemorrhage risk was significantly lower with dabigatran, apixaban, and edoxaban than with VKA and rivaroxaban, which had similar risks. High‐dose regimens led to lower risks of stroke or systemic embolism compared with VKA and low‐dose regimens, with both doses having similar bleeding risks.

Conclusions

In patients aged ≥ 75 years with atrial fibrillation, DOACs were associated with fewer thromboembolic events compared with VKA, whereas dabigatran, apixaban, and edoxaban were associated with lower risks of intracranial hemorrhage compared with VKA and rivaroxaban.

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety outcomes of edoxaban in 8040 women versus 13 065 men with atrial fibrillation in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^115h53dL]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Female sex is an independent risk factor for stroke and systemic embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety profile of edoxaban in women versus men.

Methods

The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial (Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48) randomly assigned 21105 patients (8040 women) with atrial fibrillation and CHADS 2 score ≥ 2 either to a higher-dose edoxaban regimen, a lower-dose edoxaban regimen, or warfarin. The primary end points of the trial were the composite of stroke or systemic embolic events (efficacy), and International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis-defined major bleeding (safety).

Results

In comparison with men, women were older, had lower body weight, were more likely to have hypertension and renal dysfunction, but less likely to smoke, drink alcohol, or have diabetes or coronary artery disease. Pretreatment endogenous factor Xa activity was significantly higher in women than in men (92.5% versus 86.1%, P < 0.001). Treatment with edoxaban in women resulted in greater peak edoxaban concentration and inhibition of endogenous factor Xa in comparison with men, resulting in similar endogenous factor Xa activity between the sexes 2 to 4 hours after dose. Treatment with higher-dose edoxaban regimen (versus warfarin) resulted in similar reduction in the risk of stroke/systemic embolic events (women: hazard ratio [HR], 0.87 [0.69–1.11], men: HR, 0.87 [0.71–1.06]; P -interaction = 0.97) and major bleeding (women: HR, 0.74 [0.59–0.92], men: HR, 0.84 [0.72–0.99]; P -interaction = 0.34) in women and men. However, women assigned to higher-dose edoxaban regimen experienced greater reductions in hemorrhagic stroke (HR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.15–0.59] versus HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.46–1.06]), intracranial bleeding (HR, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.10–0.39] versus HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.44–0.89]), and life-threatening or fatal bleeding (HR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.15–0.42] versus HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54–0.96]) than men (each P -interaction < 0.05).

Conclusions

Despite many differences in baseline characteristics between women and men and higher baseline endogenous factor Xa levels in women, the intensity of anticoagulation achieved with edoxaban between the sexes was similar. Treatment with higher-dose edoxaban regimen resulted in an even greater reduction in hemorrhagic stroke and several serious bleeding outcomes in women than in men, whereas the efficacy profile was similar between sexes.

Edoxaban — atrial fibrillation (AF) dose strategy and bleeding outcomes — was compared with warfarin in a phase 2 trial of 1,146 patients; the composite of major plus clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was higher with 30 or 60 mg bid than with warfarin (7.5%, 10.6%, and 3.2%, respectively), whereas once-daily 30 or 60 mg had rates similar to warfarin (3.0% and 3.8%). Based on these data, the phase 3 double-blind ENGAGE-AF-TIMI 48 trial compares 30 or 60 mg once daily (with dose adjustments for drug clearance) with warfarin (dose adjusted to achieve a target INR of 2–3), with enrollment completed and follow-up ongoing in this event-driven trial.

### Randomized, double-blind comparison of half-dose versus full-dose edoxaban in 14, 014 patients with atrial fibrillation [^115mN1t8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 48) trial, the lower dose edoxaban regimen (LDER) and the higher dose edoxaban regimen (HDER) were noninferior to well-managed warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.

Objectives

The objective of the present analysis of the ENGAGE AF TIMI-48 trial was to comprehensively compare the net clinical outcome (NCO) of LDER (30 mg once daily, dose reduced to 15 mg in selective patients) versus HDER (60 mg once daily, dose reduced to 30 mg in selective patients).

Methods

This study performed a pre-specified analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, comparing patients on LDER versus HDER.

Results

The pre-defined primary NCO (stroke/systemic embolism [SEE], major bleeding, death) was less frequent with LDER (7.26% vs. 8.01%; hazard ratio: 0.90; 95% confidence interval: 0.84 to 0.98; p = 0.014). The secondary (disabling stroke, life-threatening bleeding, or all-cause mortality) and tertiary pre-defined NCOs (stroke, SEE, life-threatening bleeding, or all-cause mortality) were similar between the 2 dosing regimens. Patients randomized to LDER versus HDER had a significantly higher risk of stroke/SEE (2.04% vs. 1.56%; hazard ratio: 1.31; 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 1.52; p < 0.001). Conversely, major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, major gastrointestinal bleeding, and life-threatening bleeding occurred significantly less frequently with LDER compared with those of HDER. These findings were supported by multiple pharmacokinetic findings.

Conclusions

In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, the primary NCO was reduced with LDER versus HDER, whereas the secondary and tertiary NCOs were similar between the 2 dosing regimens. These results may aid physicians in evidence-based individualization of edoxaban dosing. However, the approved HDER remains the standard therapy among the available edoxaban dosing regimens for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.

### Edoxaban tosylate (Savaysa) [^116Njemy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Reduced Efficacy in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Patients with CrCL > 95 mL/min

SAVAYSA should not be used in patients with CrCL > 95 mL/min. In the randomized ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study, NVAF patients with CrCL > 95 mL/min had an increased rate of ischemic stroke with SAVAYSA 60 mg daily compared to patients treated with warfarin. In these patients another anticoagulant should be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

5.2	Increased Risk of Stroke with Discontinuation of SAVAYSA in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of ischemic events. If SAVAYSA is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant as described in the transition guidance [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Edoxaban (savaysa) for the prevention of thromboembolic… [^115ofb2H]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Edoxaban is a once-daily, oral anticoagulant used to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. It is also labeled for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism following initial parenteral anticoagulation. Safety Edoxaban has been compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Edoxaban has a slightly lower risk of bleeding than warfarin. In clinical trials of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, major bleeding occurred in 2. 75% of patients receiving edoxaban vs. 1, 4 Thus, in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, edoxaban should not be prescribed in patients with a creatinine clearance greater than 95 mL per minute because of an increased risk of stroke.

1, 2 Edoxaban has not been studied in children, pregnant women, or nursing mothers and is a U. S. Food and Drug Administration pregnancy risk category C drug.

1. Effectiveness In a trial of 21, 105 patients with atrial fibrillation and a CHADS 2 score of 2 or greater, edoxaban and warfarin had similar effectiveness in the prevention of stroke or systemic embolic event, occurring in
2. 18% vs.
3. 50% of patients, respectively.
4. 3 No studies have directly compared edoxaban with other anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, or dabigatran. Simplicity Edoxaban is taken orally once daily. The recommended dosage is 60 mg daily and should be reduced to 30 mg daily in patients with moderate renal dysfunction.

Edoxaban should not be used in patients with renal failure, or in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with normal renal function. 1 No laboratory INR monitoring is needed.

### Updated European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin-K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: executive summary [^116boLpC]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

In 2013, the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) published a Practical Guide on the use of non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) (Heidbuchel H, Verhamme P, Alings M, Antz M, Hacke W, Oldgren J, Sinnaeve P, Camm AJ, Kirchhof P, European Heart Rhythm A. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel H, Verhamme P, Alings M, Antz M, Hacke W, Oldgren J, Sinnaeve P, Camm AJ, Kirchhof P. EHRA practical guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: executive summary. Eur Heart J 2013;34:2094–2106). The document received widespread interest, not only from cardiologists but also from neurologists, geriatricians, and general practitioners, as became evident from the distribution of > 350 000 copies of its pocket version (the EHRA Key Message Booklet) world-wide. Since 2013, numerous new studies have appeared on different aspects of NOAC therapy in AF patients. Therefore, EHRA updated the Practical Guide, including new information but also providing balanced guiding in the many areas where prospective data are still lacking. The outline of the original guide that addressed 15 clinical scenarios has been preserved, but all chapters have been rewritten. Main changes in the Update comprise a discussion on the definition of 'non-valvular AF' and eligibility for NOAC therapy, inclusion of finalized information on the recently approved edoxaban, tailored dosing information dependent on concomitant drugs, and/or clinical characteristics, an expanded chapter on neurologic scenarios (ischaemic stroke or intracranial haemorrhage under NOAC), an updated anticoagulation card and more specifics on start-up and follow-up issues. There are also many new flow charts, like on appropriate switching between anticoagulants (VKA to NOAC or vice versa), default scenarios for acute management of coronary interventions, step-down schemes for long-term combined antiplatelet-anticoagulant management in coronary heart disease, management of bleeding, and cardioversion under NOAC therapy.

### Concomitant use of single antiplatelet therapy with edoxaban or warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: analysis from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI48 trial [^1142TBVD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Current guidelines recommend that low‐dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day) and/or a P 2 Y12 antagonist may be given concurrently with an anticoagulant to prevent myocardial ischemic events and stroke in AF patients after coronary revascularization, a recent acute coronary syndrome or with high‐risk CAD. The associated increased risk of bleeding should be evaluated and efforts made to minimize it whenever possible. 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Also, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation guideline for secondary prevention in patients with AF and coronary or other atherosclerotic vascular disease recommends treatment with warfarin and low‐dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg daily). 14 However, for AF patients with stable coronary or peripheral arterial disease (ie, no acute events or revascularization for ≥ 12 months), oral anticoagulant therapy without antiplatelet therapy may be considered. 10, 16 In clinical practice, a combination of anticoagulant and dual antiplatelet therapy (triple antithrombotic therapy) may be administered, preferably for short periods in patients with AF who are at very high risk of a platelet‐driven event, such as patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome or stent implantation. 19 This increases the risk of serious bleeding and it should be reduced to double therapy (ie, an anticoagulant together with SAPT) whenever, or as soon as, possible.

The present report from the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial provides data on the relative efficacy and safety of combination antithrombotic therapy. At the time of enrollment, approximately one‐third of patients were receiving SAPT, usually aspirin. SAPT was discontinued in one quarter of these patients after randomization to anticoagulant therapy. SAPT was prescribed by the treating physician more commonly in patients with established CAD, diabetes, dyslipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, and those who were therefore at higher risk of development of acute coronary syndromes than were patients without these comorbidities. SAPT administration was used most frequently in North America and less frequently elsewhere. This difference may be explained, at least in part, by the greater frequency of patients at high risk enrolled in North America.

We observed that the addition of SAPT to an anticoagulant (warfarin or edoxaban) was associated with a significantly greater risk of bleeding. However, the addition of SAPT did not modify the relative efficacy and safety of edoxaban as compared to warfarin. Notably, when compared to warfarin, both edoxaban regimens significantly reduced all forms of bleeding, including ICH and life‐threatening bleeding, both in patients who were as well as those who were not, receiving a SAPT.

Atrial fibrillation — direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) dosing by renal function specifies creatinine clearance (CrCl) bands (> 95, 51–95, 31–50, 15–30, and < 15 or on dialysis) with the following doses. Apixaban lists 5 or 2.5 mg twice daily across all CrCl categories, with the footnote that if at least 2 of serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL, age ≥ 80 y, or body weight ≤ 60 kg are present, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily; the ARISTOTLE trial excluded patients with creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL or calculated CrCl < 25 mL/min. Dabigatran is 150 mg twice daily for CrCl > 95, 51–95, and 31–50; 75 mg twice daily for 15–30; and contraindicated for < 15 or on dialysis. Edoxaban is contraindicated when CrCl > 95 and when < 15 or on dialysis; 60 mg once daily is listed for 51–95 and 30 mg once daily for 31–50 and 15–30. Rivaroxaban is 20 mg once daily for > 95 and 51–95; 15 mg once daily for 31–50 and 15–30; and 15 mg once daily for < 15 or on dialysis, with the note that it is not recommended for other indications when CrCl < 15 mL/min and pharmacokinetic data are limited. The table notes that other, nonrenal considerations such as drug interactions may also apply and highlights that some gray-area doses were not studied in pivotal trials.

### Effect of non-recommended doses versus recommended doses of direct oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation patients: a meta-analysis [^112ahMhr]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

Since it was a meta‐analysis based on the published studies, ethical approval was not necessary. The data that support the findings of this study would be available from the corresponding author on the reasonable requests.

2.1 Literature search

The process of this meta‐analysis was conducted according to the guidance from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. The results of this meta‐analysis were presented according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analyses). The PubMed and Ovid electronic databases were systematically searched to identify the relevant studies that reporting the inappropriate DOAC dosing in AF patients. The retrieval periods were from January 2009 to December 2020 because the first publication of DOAC (dabigatran) in AF patients was reported in the year of 2009. As shown in Supplemental Table 1, the following index terms and their similar keywords were used in the electronic search: (1) "atrial fibrillation" OR "atrial flutter" AND (2) "direct oral anticoagulants" OR "non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants" OR "dabigatran" OR "rivaroxaban" OR "apixaban" OR "edoxaban" AND (3) dose OR dosing OR overdosing OR underdosing. To reduce the omission of available and value studies, we scanned the reference lists of relevant meta‐analyses and reviews based on the DOAC dosing. 3, 16, 17, 18, 19 We applied no linguistic restrictions in the search.

2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We included observational studies that reported the effect of non‐recommended doses (underdosing or overdosing) versus recommended doses of at least one DOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) on effectiveness and/or safety outcomes among AF patients. The low or high dose of DOACs was defined as non‐recommended low dose (underdosing) or non‐recommended high dose (overdosing) respectively if they did not conform to the label‐ or guideline‐ recommendations. We applied the dosing criteria of DOACs in each included study. The effect estimates of this study were adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). If several studies had overlapping data from the same data sources, we included the study with the longest follow‐up or highest sample size.

### Cerebrovascular events in 21 105 patients with atrial fibrillation randomized to edoxaban versus warfarin: effective anticoagulation with factor Xa next generation in atrial fibrillation-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 48 [^1113UozK]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The once-daily oral factor Xa inhibitor, edoxaban, is as effective as warfarin in preventing stroke and systemic embolism while decreasing bleeding in a phase III trial of patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate-high stroke risk. Limited data regarding cerebrovascular events with edoxaban were reported previously.

Methods

We analyzed the subtypes of cerebrovascular events in 21 105 patients participating in Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48 (ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48) comparing outcomes among patients randomized to warfarin versus 2 edoxaban regimens (high dose, low dose). The primary end point for this prespecified analysis of cerebrovascular events was all stroke (ischemic plus hemorrhagic), defined as an abrupt onset of focal neurological deficit because of infarction or bleeding with symptoms lasting ≥ 24 hours or fatal in < 24 hours. Independent stroke neurologists unaware of treatment adjudicated all cerebrovascular events.

Results

Patients randomized to high-dose edoxaban had fewer strokes on-treatment (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.98) than warfarin (median time-in-therapeutic range, 68.4%); patients in the low-dose edoxaban group had similar rates (hazard ratio, 1.10 versus warfarin; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.32). Rates of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack were similar with high-dose edoxaban (1.76% per year) and warfarin (1.73% per year; P = 0.81), but more frequent with low-dose edoxaban (2.48% per year; P < 0.001). Both edoxaban regimens significantly reduced hemorrhagic stroke and other subtypes of intracranial bleeds.

Conclusions

In patients with atrial fibrillation, once-daily edoxaban was as effective as warfarin in preventing all strokes, with significant reductions in various subtypes of intracranial bleeding. Ischemic cerebrovascular event rates were similar with high-dose edoxaban and warfarin, whereas low-dose edoxaban was less effective than warfarin.

### Efficacy and safety of edoxaban in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^1146ythP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Elderly patients with atrial fibrillation are at higher risk of both ischemic and bleeding events compared to younger patients. In a prespecified analysis from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, we evaluate clinical outcomes with edoxaban versus warfarin according to age.

Methods and Results

Twenty-one thousand one-hundred and five patients enrolled in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial were stratified into 3 prespecified age groups: < 65 (n = 5497), 65 to 74 (n = 7134), and ≥ 75 (n = 8474) years. Older patients were more likely to be female, with lower body weight and reduced creatinine clearance, leading to higher rates of edoxaban dose reduction (10%, 18%, and 41% for the 3 age groups, P < 0.001). Stroke or systemic embolic event (1.1%, 1.8%, and 2.3%) and major bleeding (1.8%, 3.3%, and 4.8%) rates with warfarin increased across age groups (Ptrend < 0.001 for both). There were no interactions between age group and randomized treatment in the primary efficacy and safety outcomes. In the elderly (≥ 75 years), the rates of stroke/systemic embolic event were similar with edoxaban versus warfarin (hazard ratio 0.83 [0.66–1.04]), while major bleeding was significantly reduced with edoxaban (hazard ratio 0.83 [0.70–0.99]). The absolute risk difference in major bleeding (-82 events/10 000 pt-yrs) and in intracranial hemorrhage (-73 events/10 000 pt-yrs) both favored edoxaban over warfarin in older patients.

Conclusions

Age has a greater influence on major bleeding than thromboembolic risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. Given the higher rates of bleeding and death with increasing age, treatment of elderly patients with edoxaban provides an even greater absolute reduction in safety events over warfarin, compared to treatment with edoxaban versus warfarin in younger patients.

### Edoxaban tosylate (Savaysa) [^11288yNK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation

The recommended dose of SAVAYSA is 60 mg taken orally once daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Assess creatinine clearance, as calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, before initiating therapy with SAVAYSA. Do not use SAVAYSA in patients with CrCL > 95 mL/min.

Reduce SAVAYSA dose to 30 mg once daily in patients with CrCL 15 to 50 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2 Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism

The recommended dose of SAVAYSA is 60 mg taken orally once daily following 5 to 10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Reduce SAVAYSA dose to 30 mg once daily in patients with CrCL 15 to 50 mL/min, patients who weigh less than or equal to 60 kg, or patients who are taking certain concomitant P-gp inhibitor medications [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

2.3	Administration Information

If a dose of SAVAYSA is missed, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day. Dosing should resume the next day according to the normal dosing schedule. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.

SAVAYSA can be taken without regard to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5	Discontinuation for Surgery and Other Interventions

Discontinue SAVAYSA at least 24 hours before invasive or surgical procedures because of the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

If surgery cannot be delayed, there is an increased risk of bleeding. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

SAVAYSA can be restarted after the surgical or other procedure as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established noting that the time to onset of pharmacodynamic effect is 1–2 hours [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Administer a parenteral anticoagulant and then switch to oral SAVAYSA, if oral medication cannot be taken during or after surgical intervention.

### Edoxaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation in relation to the risk of stroke: a secondary analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study [^112xNBp5]. American Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy and safety of the oral factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban compared to warfarin stratified by CHA₂DS₂ VASc scores have not been described.

Methods

The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial randomized patients with atrial fibrillation to once-daily edoxaban or warfarin. We classified patients based on CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score and compared pharmacokinetics (edoxaban concentration), pharmacodynamics (anti-factor Xa [FXa] with edoxaban, time-in-therapeutic range for warfarin), efficacy (stroke or systemic embolism [SSE]), safety (major bleeding [MB], intracranial hemorrhage), and cardiovascular mortality, for the approved edoxaban regimen vs warfarin.

Results

The distribution CHA₂DS₂ VASc score were: ≤ 3, N = 4159 (29.6%); 4, N = 4066 (28.9%); 5, N = 3165 (22.5%); and ≥ 6, N = 2681 (19.1%). Increasing rates of SSE (1.05 to 2.99%/year) and MB (2.27 to 4.66%/year) were observed in the warfarin arm as the CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score increased. The hazard ratios per unit increase of CHA₂DS₂ VASc score were 1.29 (1.21–1.38) and 1.26 (1.17–1.36) for SSE, and 1.20 (1.13–1.27) and 1.19 (1.12–1.27) for MB, with warfarin and edoxaban, respectively. Time-in-therapeutic range in warfarin-treated patients was similar and high (median 68%-69%) across CHA 2 DS 2 VASc scores, whereas edoxaban trough concentration, exogenous anti-FXa activity and %inhibition of endogenous FXa were higher at increasing CHA 2 DS 2 VASc scores. Edoxaban reduced SSE, MB, intracranial hemorrhage, and cardiovascular mortality vs warfarin to a similar degree across the range of CHA 2 DS 2 VASc scores (P-int = 0.90, 0.96, 0.21, and 0.37, respectively). Because of higher event rates the number of events prevented with edoxaban tended to be greater in patients with higher CHA 2 DS 2 VASc scores.

Conclusion

The benefit and safety of edoxaban versus warfarin is maintained across CHA 2 DS 2 VASc scores. While the relative risk reductions remain similar, edoxaban provides incrementally larger absolute reductions in outcomes over warfarin in patients with higher CHA 2 DS 2 VASc scores.

### Outcomes and drivers of inappropriate dosing of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112PqkuP]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Review methods

The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines and in accordance with the Centre for Review and Dissemination (CRD) Handbook. The protocol was preregistered on the PROSPERO register of systematic reviews.

Literature search

Published literature was captured through searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane library, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Econlit, PubMed and NHS EEDs databases. The searches were conducted on 12 October 2020 and included material from 2008 (see online supplemental S1, Search strategy for the full search strategy).

Conference proceedings were date limited 2018–2020. The Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science (Clarivate Analytics) and The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research conference databases were searched alongside a search of Embase limited to conference proceedings. The European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association were hand searched by a researcher (CC).

Study selection and screening

Studies were screened by two researchers independently (AW and HS) based initially on study title and abstract and subsequently on full text. Disagreements over study eligibility were resolved by a third researcher (AC).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria, data extraction and quality assessment

English language studies were included if they examined outcomes of, or factors associated with, inappropriate NOAC dosing (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban or rivaroxaban) for adult patients with NVAF. Doses were considered inappropriate if they did not conform to label or guideline recommendations, either non-recommended high dose (overdosing) or non-recommended low dose (underdosing) (table 1). We applied the NOAC dosing guidelines as used in each included study.

Table 1
Dose reduction criteria of NOACs

Data were extracted by one reviewer (AW) for each included study and independently checked by a second reviewer (HS). Information extracted included study information (author, year of publication, country, study design, follow-up length, study size and NOAC studied), patient characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities and concomitant medications), outcomes/factors assessed, measures used and effect sizes.

Factor and outcome definitions were applied as used in the included studies.

Study quality was assessed by two researchers independently using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Cut-off values of 0–3, 4–6 and 7–10 corresponding to low, moderate and high qualities, respectively, were assigned.

### Outcomes and safety of very-low-dose edoxaban in frail patients with atrial fibrillation in the ELDERCARE-AF randomized clinical trial [^113fWdWf]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is very-low-dose edoxaban (15 mg/day) beneficial across frailty status among very elderly Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation considered ineligible for standard dose oral anticoagulants because of their high bleeding risk?

Findings

In this cohort study of 944 patients using data from the ELDERCARE-AF trial, very-low-dose edoxaban was associated with lower incidence of stroke or systemic embolism consistently across frailty status, including each assessment parameter, with a numerically higher risk of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.

Meaning

These findings suggest that edoxaban (15 mg) is superior to placebo in preventing stroke or systemic embolism in very elderly patients with atrial fibrillation, regardless of frailty status, and may be a suitable treatment option for these patients.

### Efficacy and safety of edoxaban in patients with active malignancy and atrial fibrillation: analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^112AovxN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Current AF guidelines do not provide specific recommendations for oral anticoagulation in patients with active malignancy. 12, 13 Although robust randomized data in patients with malignancy and venous thromboembolism exist, 34, 35 generalizability of these results to patients with AF has its limitations given different pathophysiological and risk profiles. The European Society of Cardiology recommends consideration of a DOAC as first‐line therapy in patients with AF for stroke prevention. 13 Use of DOACs in patients with AF is increasing in clinical practice and the aging population. 36, 37 Older patients receiving DOACs may develop a new or recurrent malignancy because of shared risk factors with aging. 3, 4, 5, 6 We anticipate, therefore, an increase in use of DOACs in patients with cancer and a need for efficacy and safety data.

Because factor Xa has demonstrated procoagulant activity in cancer, 38 the factor Xa inhibitors especially warrant special consideration in these patients. All DOACs may interact with certain chemotherapeutic agents through the P‐glycoprotein transporter; 15 however, unlike rivaroxaban and apixaban, edoxaban has little inhibitory effect on CYP3A4. 20 This may be particularly relevant in patients undergoing chemotherapy because CYP3A4 is responsible for metabolism of several anticancer therapies, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 39 The lower potential for drug‐drug interactions combined with a fixed‐dosing regimen make edoxaban an attractive alternative to VKAs in patients with an active malignancy. Finally, the rapid onset (1–2 hours) and shorter half‐life of DOACs (6–12 hours) compared with warfarin (≈40 hours) offer additional practical advantages over VKAs in patients with active malignancy, because these patients often undergo frequent medication changes and invasive procedures.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose edoxaban by body weight in very elderly patients with atrial fibrillation: a subanalysis of the randomized ELDERCARE-AF trial [^114DiDmj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Atrial fibrillation (AF), which is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, has ischemic stroke as its most severe complication, leading to increased morbidity and mortality of affected patients. To prevent stroke, clinical guidelines recommend the use of oral anticoagulants (OACs), but the perceived risk of bleeding is a major obstacle to prescribing OACs. Treatment with OACs can lead to bleeding adverse events, and they are particularly difficult to use in patients at high risk for bleeding; elderly status, low body weight, and renal impairment are known risk factors for bleeding with OACs.

In patients at such a high risk of bleeding who are ineligible for OAC treatment, the ELDERCARE‐AF (Edoxaban Low‐Dose for Elder Care Atrial Fibrillation Patients) trial, which was a randomized, placebo‐controlled study comparing low‐dose edoxaban (15 mg once daily) with placebo, showed a significant reduction of stroke or systemic embolism (SSE) with edoxaban 15 mg compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.34 [95% CI, 0.19–0.61]), without a significant increase in major bleeding (HR, 1.87 [95% CI, 0.90–3.89]). In addition, subgroup analyses of ELDERCARE‐AF confirmed the consistent benefit of edoxaban 15 mg irrespective of age (80–84 years, 85–89 years, and ≥ 90 years) and renal function (creatinine clearance 15– < 30 mL/min, 30–50 mL/min, and > 50 mL/min).

### A prospective evaluation of edoxaban compared to warfarin in subjects undergoing cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: the edoxabaN vs. warfarin in subjectS undeRgoing cardiovErsion of atrial fibrillation (ENSURE-AF) study [^11476M17]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

We designed a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point evaluation parallel group Phase 3b clinical trial comparing edoxaban (a new oral factor Xa inhibitor) with enoxaparin/warfarin followed by warfarin alone in subjects undergoing planned electrical cardioversion of non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The primary efficacy end point is the composite end points of stroke, systemic embolic event, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular (CV) mortality, from randomization until the end of follow-up (day 56 post cardioversion). The primary safety end point is the composite of major and clinically-relevant non-major bleeding, from the first administration of study drug to end of treatment (Day 28 post cardioversion) +3 days. The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted on the intention-to-treat population whereas the primary safety analysis, on the safety population. The study includes stratification on the following levels: (i) approach to cardioversion (transoesophagel echocardiography or non-transoesophagel echocardiography) as determined by the Investigator; (ii) subject's experience in taking anticoagulants at the time of randomization (anticoagulant-experienced or anticoagulant-naïve); and (iii) assigned edoxaban dose (full 60 mg QD or reduced 30 mg dose QD). A subject with one or more factors (CrCl ≥ 15 mL/min and ≤ 50 mL/min, low body weight [≤ 60 kg], and concomitant use of p-pg inhibitors (excluding amiodarone) will receive a reduced dose (30 mg) of edoxaban if the subject is randomized to the edoxaban group. ENSURE-AF will be the largest prospective randomised trial of anticoagulation for cardioversion, also involving a Non-VKA Oral Anticoagulant-edoxaban.

### Dosing of target-specific oral anticoagulants in special populations [^116zQR2D]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review current literature for target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs) and provide critical analysis for dosing recommendations in special population groups.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted in Medline (1996 to April week 2 2015) and Embase (1980 to 2015 week 16) using key terms dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, kidney diseases, liver diseases, elderly, obesity, and special populations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized controlled trials in English assessing efficacy and safety of TSOACs in healthy adults and special populations were selected for analysis.

Data Synthesis

Phase 3 trials for TSOACs predominately excluded patients with severe renal impairment or active liver disease. There were no exclusion criteria based on age, body weight or body mass index. Additional conclusions were made in special populations, including those with renal or liver impairment and obese and elderly patients, based on secondary analyses, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic studies.

Conclusions

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes associated special populations may alter clinical decision with regard to drug selection and dosing. It is valuable to understand the rationale for labeled dosing recommendations in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism treatment and prevention, particularly in patients that fall into special population groups. Furthermore, the use of TSOACs is likely to increase as clinicians gain experience with these agents and additional TSOACs and indications are approved.

### Differences in preferences between clinicians and patients for the use and dosing of direct oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation [^11787GuU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban, are effective in reducing the risk of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) when prescribed at the dose studied in randomized clinical trials. In these trial protocols, reduced DOAC doses were prescribed to patients who had renal impairment for rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban, or met 2 of 3 criteria (age, body weight, creatinine level) for apixaban. The ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, for example, studied apixaban at 5 mg twice daily, while patients who met 2 of 3 dose reduction criteria received 2.5 mg twice daily. For patients who met labeled dose reduction criteria, the outcomes associated with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily versus warfarin to reduce the risk of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, and death were consistent with the outcomes associated with the labeled dose (apixaban 5 mg twice daily).

However, a prior study of cardiology practices in the United States revealed > 4‐fold higher rates of reduced‐dose apixaban use when compared with use in randomized trials (20.8% versus 4.7%). Additionally, in an analysis of ≈ 15 000 patients with AF initiated on a DOAC, 13% of patients received a reduced dose without meeting renal dose reduction criteria.DOAC underdosing (or unlabeled reduced dose) has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular hospitalization. Underdosing has also been linked to a higher risk of strokeand an increased risk of all‐cause mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction.

Little is known about clinician knowledge or clinician and patient preferences for DOAC dosing. In this study, we examined clinician knowledge of anticoagulation dosing recommendations based on labeled‐dose criteria, and compared clinician and patient preferences associated with anticoagulation selection and dosing.

### Edoxaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113fT5fD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) was published by Giugliano RP and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the trial question was: is edoxaban noninferior to warfarin in patients with AF? In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the population was: 14071 patients (5310 female, 8761 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AF at moderate-to-high AF risk. The key exclusion criteria were AF due to a reversible disorder; high risk of bleeding; use of dual antiplatelet therapy; moderate-to-severe MS; other indications for anticoagulation therapy; acute coronary syndromes, coronary revascularization, or stroke in the past 30 days. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 7035 high-dose edoxaban (60 mg/day) n = 7036 warfarin (dose-adjusted to achieve an INR of 2.0–3.0). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in stroke or systemic embolic events (1.18% vs. 1.5%; HR 0.79, 97.5% CI 0.63 to 0.99). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in stroke, systemic embolism, or death from cardiovascular causes (3.85% vs. 4.43%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.96) Significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes (2.74% vs. 3.17%; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97) No significant difference in myocardial infarction (0.7% vs. 0.75%; HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.19). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in stroke and systemic embolic events. significant difference in major bleeding events (2.75% vs. 3.43%). In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 60 mg) study, the conclusion was: in patients with AF at moderate-to-high AF risk, high-dose edoxaban was noninferior to warfarin with respect to stroke or systemic embolic events.

### Effect of non-recommended doses versus recommended doses of direct oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation patients: a meta-analysis [^113Ap9YG]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, resulting in increased risks of stroke and its related mortality and disability. 1 Anticoagulant drugs are effective drugs to prevent stroke risk in patients with AF. 2 Previous randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies have consistently demonstrated that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) are at least non‐inferior in reducing the risks of stroke and bleeding compared with warfarin. Over the past decade, DOACs have gradually changed the landscape of anticoagulation treatment in AF because of the superior effectiveness and safety profiles of DOACs compared to warfarin. Dose adjustments for DOACs based on the European Medicine Agency, Food and Drugs Administration, and European Society of Cardiology guidelines have similarly recommended the use of (1) low dose of dabigatran (110 mg twice a day) if patients are aged ≥ 80 years, or have a creatinine clearance of 30–49 ml/min; (2) low dose of rivaroxaban (15 mg once a day) if patients have a creatinine clearance level of 30–49 ml/min; (3) low dose of apixaban (2.5 mg twice a day) if patients have any two of the following risk factors: age ≥ 80 years, a creatinine clearance level of ≥ 1.5 mg/dl, and bodyweight ≤ 60 kg; (4) low dose of edoxaban (30 mg once a day) if patients have a bodyweight ≤ 60 kg, creatinine clearance level of 30–50 ml/min, or concomitant P‐glycoprotein inhibitors. 3, 4 Nevertheless, the use of reduced‐dose DOACs does not conform to the label‐ or guideline‐ recommendations in real‐world settings. The off label low or high dose of DOACs is regarded as non‐recommended low dose (underdosing) or non‐recommended high dose (overdosing), respectively. The reasons why the off label dose of DOACs is commonly used are still exploratory.

Edoxaban, an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor with a short half‐life (10–14 hours) and minimal interaction with the cytochrome P‐450 system, 20 was evaluated in the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study 48) trial. 21 Both higher‐dose (HDER) and lower‐dose (LDER) edoxaban regimens were noninferior to well‐managed warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolic events (SEEs) in patients with AF, and both regimens reduced bleeding and cardiovascular death. 22 To date, data are sparse in patients treated with edoxaban who have both AF and malignancy, although a recent randomized trial in 1046 patients with venous thromboembolism and malignancy showed that edoxaban was noninferior to dalteparin in the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism but was associated with a 2.9% absolute increase in the rate of major bleeding. 23 In the present analysis, we evaluate the safety and efficacy of edoxaban compared with warfarin in patients with AF who have developed a new or recurrent malignancy, with particular focus on the HDER because this is the regimen approved for clinical use.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose edoxaban by body weight in very elderly patients with atrial fibrillation: a subanalysis of the randomized ELDERCARE-AF trial [^1171D6YJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The ELDERCARE-AF trial showed that low-dose edoxaban benefits elderly patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation considered ineligible for standard oral anticoagulants due to high bleeding risk, but whether this applied to patients with extremely low body weight was unclear.

Methods and Results

This was a prespecified subanalysis by body weight (≤ 45, > 45kg) of the phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven ELDERCARE-AF trial, which compared low-dose edoxaban (15mg once daily) with placebo in Japanese patients considered ineligible for oral anticoagulants at the recommended therapeutic strength or the approved doses. The primary efficacy and safety end points were stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding (International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis definition), respectively. The ≤ 45-kg weight group included 374/984 patients (38.0%), and the > 45-kg group included 610/984 patients (62.0%). The stroke or systemic embolism rate was lower with edoxaban than placebo in both weight groups (≤ 45kg: hazard ratio [HR], 0.36 [95% CI, 0.16–0.80]; > 45kg: HR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.13–0.73]; interaction P = 0.82). Major bleeding incidence was numerically higher with edoxaban than placebo (≤ 45kg: HR, 3.05 [95% CI, 0.84–11.11]; > 45kg: HR, 1.40 [95% CI, 0.56–3.48), with no interaction with body weight (interaction P = 0.33). All-cause mortality was higher in the ≤ 45-kg group, with no significant difference between treatment groups.

Conclusions

The benefit of edoxaban 15 mg was consistent in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation and extremely low body weight, though clinicians must remain vigilant about the risk of major bleeding, especially gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Population pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in geriatric patients with atrial fibrillation [^111oYmpB]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation affects nearly half of geriatric inpatients, with edoxaban frequently used for stroke prevention. However, geriatric patients are underrepresented in drug trials with edoxaban. The limited data and high pharmacokinetic variability result in using this high-risk medication without a full understanding of its exposure in this population.

Objectives

To characterize the dose-exposure relationship and predict the sufficiency of current fixed-dose guideline for geriatric patients.

Methods

We conducted a single-center prospective PK study in geriatric inpatients. We built a population pharmacokinetics (popPK) model and used it to simulate various dosing strategies (n = 1000 simulations).

Results

Seventeen frail geriatric patients (median age 87 years, IQR 83–90) receiving routine edoxaban contributed a total of 85 steady-state PK samples. A two-compartment popPK model best described the edoxaban and M4 metabolite concentrations, with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) reducing relative bioavailability by 24%. Key parameters included absorption rate constant 0.104 h -1, clearance 9.02 L/h, and central and peripheral volumes 47.4 L and 42.7 L. Edoxaban concentrations correlated with factor-Xa inhibitor concentrations (ρ = 0.966). Nearly half of the patients had C min > 43 ng/mL, with no difference between PPI and non-PPI groups. Simulations showed a 6.75% probability of overexposure with 15 mg, 42.4% with 30 mg, and 84.25% with 60 mg.

Conclusion

Estimated PK parameters in geriatric patients differed from those reported in pivotal trial populations, suggesting increased exposure thereby potentially influencing bleeding risk. The impact of PPI was not clinically relevant. Further investigation is needed to assess the benefits of alternative dosing in this population.
