## Question

best maintenance inhaler during pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which maintenance inhaler is best to use during pregnancy and how to structure the regimen and counseling for pregnant patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of asthma management in pregnancy. Then, I should verify the preferred controller class and whether any specific inhaled corticosteroid is favored. Next, I will review combination therapy options and the role of single maintenance and reliever therapy. After that, I need to check safety data and guideline positions on stepping down or switching during pregnancy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and address common patient concerns and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: in pregnancy, the risks of uncontrolled asthma markedly outweigh theoretical medication risks, so the goal is to maintain control using the same stepwise approach as outside pregnancy, with close monitoring and a low threshold to treat exacerbations aggressively [^114MPmjv] [^111MJTiR] [^115uuDTu].

> I need to verify the preferred controller class. Inhaled corticosteroids are the cornerstone controller therapy in pregnancy, and guidelines emphasize continuing ICS-containing treatment rather than stopping or stepping down during pregnancy because ICS reduce exacerbations and cessation increases risk of worsening control [^114MPmjv] [^115WcbHP] [^111AgSVM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which ICS to pick. Historically, budesonide has the most robust human pregnancy safety data and is often preferred as first choice, but wait, let me verify whether other ICS are unsafe; comparative data and contemporary guidelines indicate that usual doses of other ICS, such as fluticasone and beclomethasone, are also acceptable if the patient is already controlled on them, with no clear perinatal safety differences demonstrated between budesonide and fluticasone in large cohorts [^113sdXjT] [^1113g7zB] [^114MPmjv].

> Next, I should review combination therapy. For patients who require more than low-dose ICS, adding a long-acting beta-agonist is standard, and single maintenance and reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol is preferred in guidelines for adolescents and adults because it reduces severe exacerbations compared with higher-dose ICS or fixed-dose ICS-LABA with SABA reliever. This principle applies in pregnancy as well when control is suboptimal on ICS alone [^112iyv6Z] [^115BE38n] [^1136hzs7].

> Let me consider the practical "best" regimen. For most pregnant patients, I would start or continue low-dose budesonide as the maintenance ICS, and if control is inadequate after confirming adherence and technique, I would escalate to low-dose budesonide-formoterol MART, which simplifies to a single inhaler for maintenance and rescue and has the best exacerbation-reduction signal. If MART is not available or not preferred, low-dose ICS-LABA with SABA reliever is a reasonable alternative, and SABA-only approaches should be avoided for persistent asthma in pregnancy [^112iyv6Z] [^115BE38n] [^114MPmjv].

> Wait, I should double-check the stance on stepping down during pregnancy. Guidelines place a low priority on stepping down ICS-containing therapy until after delivery, and VA/DoD explicitly advises avoiding step-down in pregnancy due to increased risk of loss of control. If a patient is already on combination therapy and doing well, I should generally maintain the regimen rather than attempt a pregnancy step-down [^114MPmjv] [^113at2R4] [^112qJMtP].

> I will now examine safety signals that might sway the choice. Budesonide has long-standing human pregnancy data, including randomized and registry data, without increased congenital malformations, and large cohort comparisons have not shown superiority of one ICS over another for perinatal outcomes; importantly, the risks of uncontrolled asthma, including preterm birth and low birth weight, are substantially higher than the theoretical risks of usual-dose ICS exposure in utero [^1133SiV3] [^1113g7zB] [^114MPmjv].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on fluticasone-salmeterol and well controlled? I should confirm that switching solely for pregnancy is unnecessary. Guidelines support continuing the effective regimen and do not mandate changing to budesonide if control is good, so switching is reasonable only if there are adherence or device issues or if we are optimizing for simplicity with MART [^114MPmjv] [^1113g7zB].

> Next, I should review patient education and monitoring. Many pregnant patients overestimate medication risks and underuse controllers, so I need to counsel explicitly that ICS are safe, that stopping ICS increases exacerbation risk, and that exacerbations themselves harm the fetus. Structured education, written action plans, and frequent check-ins, ideally every 4–6 weeks, improve adherence and outcomes during pregnancy [^114MPmjv] [^113eGF2b] [^113icu64].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. The best maintenance approach during pregnancy is to use an ICS-containing controller, with budesonide as the preferred ICS when starting anew due to its extensive pregnancy safety data, and to employ low-dose budesonide-formoterol MART if control is not achieved on ICS alone or if a simplified single-inhaler regimen is desired. If already well controlled on another ICS-LABA, continue it, avoid stepping down during pregnancy, and pair the regimen with close monitoring and exacerbation action planning [^114MPmjv] [^112iyv6Z] [^113at2R4].

---

The best maintenance inhaler during pregnancy is **low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)** [^113sdXjT], with **budesonide preferred** due to the most pregnancy safety data [^113sdXjT] [^1133SiV3] [^112ibZ6z]. If control is inadequate, add a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) such as formoterol or salmeterol [^113sdXjT] [^1113g7zB]; **single inhaler maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART/MART) with budesonide–formoterol** is a preferred option for moderate disease [^112iyv6Z] [^115BE38n]. Avoid stepping down or stopping ICS during pregnancy [^111AgSVM] [^113at2R4], as this increases exacerbation risk [^115WcbHP] and adverse perinatal outcomes [^114MPmjv]. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (e.g. montelukast) are safe if needed [^114MPmjv] [^117J67Qn], and biologics may be continued or initiated based on risk–benefit assessment [^1161qsKk] [^116bRhtW].

---

## Recommended maintenance inhaler therapy during pregnancy

### Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)

- **First-line therapy**: ICS are the cornerstone of asthma management during pregnancy, effectively reducing exacerbations and maintaining control [^114MPmjv] [^115WcbHP].

- **Preferred ICS**: Budesonide is the preferred ICS due to extensive pregnancy safety data [^113sdXjT] [^1133SiV3] and no demonstrated increase in congenital malformations or adverse perinatal outcomes [^1133SiV3] [^1113g7zB].

- **Alternative ICS**: Fluticasone and beclomethasone are also considered safe if budesonide is unavailable or if the patient is already well-controlled on these agents [^1113g7zB] [^114MPmjv].

---

### Long-acting beta-agonists (LABA)

Add-on therapy with LABA (e.g. formoterol or salmeterol) is recommended for patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled on ICS alone [^1118amuB]. Preferred combination: budesonide–formoterol in a single inhaler as maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART/MART) is particularly beneficial, reducing severe exacerbations and maintaining good control [^112iyv6Z] [^115BE38n].

---

### Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA)

Montelukast is **safe** and may be used as an alternative or adjunctive therapy, particularly in patients with allergic rhinitis or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^114MPmjv] [^117J67Qn].

---

### Biologic therapies

Biologics (e.g. omalizumab) may be continued or initiated during pregnancy if clinically indicated, with individualized risk–benefit assessment and shared decision-making [^1161qsKk] [^116bRhtW].

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

- **ICS safety**: Extensive data support the safety of ICS during pregnancy, with no significant increase in congenital malformations, preterm birth, or low birth weight [^1133SiV3] [^114MPmjv].

- **LABA safety**: LABA use in combination with ICS is considered safe, with no significant increase in adverse perinatal outcomes [^1113g7zB] [^114MPmjv].

- **LTRA safety**: Montelukast use during pregnancy is associated with minimal risk and is considered safe when clinically indicated [^114MPmjv] [^117J67Qn].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Maintain control**: Guidelines emphasize maintaining asthma control during pregnancy, as uncontrolled asthma significantly increases the risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes [^114MPmjv] [^112WrGXn].

- **Do not discontinue**: ICS-containing therapy should not be discontinued or stepped down during pregnancy due to increased risk of exacerbations [^111AgSVM] [^113at2R4].

- **Monitor regularly**: Regular monitoring and adjustment of therapy are recommended to ensure optimal control throughout pregnancy [^114MPmjv] [^1139yiut].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Medication class** | **Recommended use during pregnancy** | **Safety profile** |
|-|-|-|
| Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) | First-line therapy; budesonide preferred | Extensive safety data; no significant increase in adverse outcomes [^114MPmjv] [^1133SiV3] |
| Long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) | Add-on therapy if ICS alone insufficient; formoterol preferred | Safe when combined with ICS; no significant increase in adverse outcomes [^117J67Qn] [^114MPmjv] |
| Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) | Alternative or adjunctive therapy; montelukast preferred | Minimal risk; safe when clinically indicated [^114MPmjv] [^117J67Qn] |
| Biologic therapies | Continued or initiated if clinically indicated | Individualized risk–benefit assessment; limited but reassuring data [^1161qsKk] [^116bRhtW] |

---

Low-dose ICS, with **budesonide preferred**, is the best maintenance inhaler during pregnancy, with LABA added if needed and SMART/MART with budesonide–formoterol favored for moderate disease. Maintain control and avoid stepping down or stopping ICS, as this increases exacerbation risk and adverse perinatal outcomes [^114MPmjv] [^112WrGXn].

SECTION IV: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF INTERMITTENT ICS IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, but the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

Definitions of terms used in this section

"Intermittent" ICS dosing in this section includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. "Intermittent ICS dosing" does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. Intermittent ICS dosing allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. When to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual's decision (based on need, which is also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing), a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

"Controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The terms "ICS-LABA" (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2 -agonist combination, typically in a single device) and "ICS-formoterol" indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler.

"Quick-relief" therapy refers to medications (eg, an inhaled SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations. In this section, "as-needed" dosing (eg, of a SABA) is intermittent and is based on the patient's decision (Figs 2–4).

The definitions of "low-", "medium-", and "high-dose" ICS are based on the recommendations from EPR-3.

The term "puff" refers to a single actuation and inhalation of a medication delivered through any type of inhaler.

"Recurrent wheezing" as used for the studies included in this section is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child's lifetime or two episodes in the past year.

### Asthma in pregnancy: management strategies [^113JxvCS]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma is one of the most prevalent chronic medical conditions to complicate pregnancy. With approximately one-third of women experiencing a worsening of control during the course of their pregnancy, identifying those at greatest risk has the potential to improve maternal and fetal outcomes for a large number of pregnancies. Similarly, active management strategies that prioritize asthma control in this vulnerable population can have a far-reaching impact.

Recent Findings

Demographic characteristics and patient noncompliance place certain populations of pregnant women at increased risk of poor asthma control during pregnancy. In addition, undertreatment and disparities in care of acute exacerbations during pregnancy likely contribute. Targeted educational interventions and treatment algorithms using objective markers of disease activity have shown improved outcomes in asthma control.

Summary

Active management strategies which focus on identifying patient-specific risk factors, patient and provider education, and targeted treatment interventions can improve asthma care for women during pregnancy.

### Pregnancy and asthma: recent developments [^115R3Moy]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma is the most common potentially serious medical problem to complicate pregnancy. Asthmatic women have been shown to be at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy. Managing asthma during pregnancy is unique because the effects of both the illness and the treatment on the developing fetus and the patient must be considered.

Recent Findings

This review summarizes the recent studies addressing the interrelationships between asthma and pregnancy and general aspects of pharmacologic therapy of gestational asthma.

Summary

The prevalence of asthma in pregnant women appears to be increasing. Recent evidence supports that pregnant asthmatic women with moderate to severe asthma may have an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. The goal of asthma management during pregnancy is to optimize maternal and fetal health.

### Addressing sex and gender to improve asthma management [^111RWSd2]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of asthma during pregnancy

Pregnancy affects asthma control in many women; approximately one-third of women report symptom worsening, one-third report symptom improvement, and one-third report no noticeable difference. Poor maternal asthma control is associated with adverse outcomes, including increased risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, congenital malformations, perinatal death, and risk of childhood asthma –. In addition, a small reduction in the mother's oxygen levels (e.g. during an asthma exacerbation) can result in severe, life-threatening fetal hypoxia. It is, therefore, vital that pregnant women (and women who are thinking of becoming pregnant) are educated on taking their asthma medications as prescribed and have a plan for managing exacerbations.

However, understandably, many women report being apprehensive about using asthma medication during pregnancy over concerns of teratogenicity, meaning that adherence to medications may decrease. While the safety of most asthma medications (e.g. ICS, SABAs, long-acting beta-agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, OCS, and biologics) has not been unequivocally proven in pregnancy, they have now been used successfully for decades. Overall, evidence indicates asthma medications are safe in pregnancy, and their use is justified, as the benefits of good symptom control markedly outweigh the potential risks to mother and baby.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116aZEEc]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial asthma treatment in children 6–11 years provides preferred initial treatment by presenting symptoms, and states that these recommendations are based on evidence and consensus. Infrequent asthma symptoms (e.g., 1–2 days/week or less): Low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken (Evidence B) in combination or in separate inhalers. Asthma symptoms 2–5 days/week: Low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A); other options include taking ICS whenever SABA is taken in combination or separate inhalers (Evidence B), or daily LTRA (Evidence A for less effectiveness for exacerbations than ICS), and to consider likely adherence if the reliever is SABA. Asthma symptoms most days (e.g., 4–5 days/week) or waking due to asthma once a week or more: Low-dose ICS-LABA plus as needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Very-low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (Evidence B); other options include daily low-dose ICS and LTRA, plus as-needed SABA. Daily asthma symptoms, waking at night once or more a week, and low lung function: Medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, OR low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (MART). Initial asthma presentation during an acute exacerbation: Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of OCS if the exacerbation is severe; commence Step 3 or Step 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up.

Over the past few years, much has been learned that is relevant to the management of asthma in pregnancy. Although the studies that were reviewed here in provide more insight into the mechanisms that are involved and the treatment of asthma during pregnancy, there are more questions to be answered. It is hoped that the updated guidelines, which address the safety of contemporary asthma medications during pregnancy, will be a helpful resource in the treatment of our pregnant asthmatic patients.

### Chronic management of asthma during pregnancy [^111G6ciM]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is one of the most common potentially serious medical problems to complicate pregnancy. Optimal management of asthma during pregnancy is thus important for both mother and baby. Treating asthmatic women requires understanding the effects of pregnancy on the course of asthma, and, conversely, the effects of asthma on pregnancy outcomes. Successful management also requires an understanding the barriers to asthma control in this population of patients. Evidence has shown that it is essential that the allergist-immunologist, obstetrician, and patient work as a team during pregnancy to achieve optimal maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Asthma guideline — Recommendation 12 (ICS-formoterol single-inhaler maintenance and reliever therapy) recommends ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy for individuals aged 4 years and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, compared to either a higher-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as daily controller therapy and short-acting beta agonist (SABA) for quick-relief therapy or the same-dose ICS–long-acting beta agonist (LABA) as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy; this is a strong recommendation with high certainty of evidence for ages 12 years and above and moderate certainty of evidence for ages 4 to 11 years.

### Managing asthma during pregnancy and the postpartum period [^112NjFZH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in pregnancy and is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Asthma symptoms worsen in approximately 40% of women, and exacerbations requiring medical intervention occur in at least 20% of women. Factors associated with exacerbation and worsening asthma include multiparity, obesity, Black race, exacerbations before pregnancy, and poor asthma control. Exacerbations are associated with further increased risks for poor perinatal outcomes, including low birth weight, preterm birth, and small for gestational age (SGA) status, as well as an increase in the development of asthma in early childhood. Common medications used for asthma, including short-acting β-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids, are considered safe to use in pregnancy. Whereas guidelines generally suggest traditional step therapy for managing asthma in pregnancy, there are alternative models of care and management approaches that may be effective in pregnancy, but require more research. These include single-inhaler maintenance and reliever therapy, treatment adjustment with FeNO, treatable traits personalized medicine approaches, and telemedicine. Little is known about changes to asthma in the postpartum period. However, low adherence to medication and the potential effects of postpartum depression on asthma exacerbation risk warrant further research.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^1178TNY9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Ages 5–11 years asthma stepwise management — preferred controller/reliever options escalate from daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with as-needed short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA), to daily and PRN combination low-dose ICS–formoterol, then daily and PRN combination medium-dose ICS–formoterol, followed by daily high-dose ICS–long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) with PRN SABA, and finally daily high-dose ICS–LABA + oral systemic corticosteroid with PRN SABA. Assess control and actions include to first check adherence, inhaler technique, environmental factors, and comorbid conditions; step up if needed and reassess in 2–6 weeks; step down if possible if asthma is well controlled for at least 3 consecutive months; and consult with an asthma specialist if Step 4 or higher is required, considering consultation at Step 3. For adjuncts, Steps 2–4 conditionally recommend the use of subcutaneous immunotherapy as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy in individuals ≥ 5 years of age whose asthma is controlled at the initiation, build up, and maintenance phases of immunotherapy; consider Omalizumab, noting that Omalizumab is the only asthma biologic currently FDA-approved for this age range, and the FDA issued a Boxed Warning for montelukast in March 2020.

### Women's experiences of personalised support for asthma care during pregnancy: a systematic review of the literature [^1137kRYh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We found an embryonic evidence base concerning the benefits of personalised support, with only five papers that meet our inclusion and exclusion criteria and quality assessment scoring. Whilst the standing of this evidence base is low in relation to accepted hierarchies of evidence, and the strength of our recommendations consequently weak, they support the authoritative guidance that pregnant asthmatic women should receive monitoring and advice which helps them to understand their asthma symptoms and the role that their medications play in controlling them, including inhaled B2 agonists, and oral and inhaled corticosteroids. Larger randomised controlled trials investigating personalised care are required to build an evidence base to establish the efficacy of such interventions.

### Recent developments in asthma in pregnancy [^114HX478]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma affects up to 13% of pregnancies worldwide and has a varying and unpredictable clinical course during pregnancy. Pharmacological asthma treatment is recommended; however, studies show that some pregnant women with asthma cease their medication in early pregnancy. There is likely a large unmet disease burden arising from asthma in pregnancy.

Recent Findings

Antenatal and asthma guidelines lack sufficient information on asthma management in pregnant women, and implementation of the current guidelines seems inadequate. Prescription databases provide evidence of cessation of asthma medication during pregnancy on a population level. Population-based databases also provide evidence of rare adverse perinatal outcomes. The risk of childhood asthma in the offspring of women with asthma is reduced by adequate control of maternal asthma during pregnancy. Vitamin D sufficiency during pregnancy could also reduce the risk of childhood asthma.

Summary

The findings of this review demonstrate the need for improved asthma and antenatal guidelines regarding asthma management during pregnancy, and the need of adequate implementation of these guidelines. Furthermore, adequate asthma control during pregnancy is needed to reduce the risk of childhood asthma. To maintain asthma control, prepregnancy medication should be continued throughout pregnancy and adjusted according to the current treatment steps if required.

### Role of budesonide as maintenance therapy for children with asthma [^113zw4iz]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2003). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Inhaled corticosteroids are recognized as the preferred long-term control medication for persistent asthma based on their anti-inflammatory properties and significant evidence of efficacy. Inhaled budesonide is the most carefully characterized inhaled corticosteroid for childhood asthma. It is available for administration in children down to six months of age and to date has an excellent safety profile.

Regarding the use of levalbuterol hydrochloride INH (also known as Xopenex) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. The use of β-2 agonists during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of fetal abnormalities. The 2025 GINA guidelines recommend treating acute exacerbations of asthma during pregnancy aggressively with a short-acting β-agonist, oxygen, and early administration of systemic corticosteroids.

### The poorly explored impact of uncontrolled asthma [^111iB6VE]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

The goal of asthma management is to achieve disease control; however, despite the availability of effective and safe medications, for many patients asthma remains uncontrolled. One reason for this is the fear of long-term side effects from the regular use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). Adverse effects of poorly controlled asthma (for example, obesity, pneumonia, and risks to the fetus) can be perceived as side effects of ICSs. Poorly controlled asthma adversely affects children's cardiovascular fitness, while children with well-controlled asthma perform at the same level as their peers. Children with uncontrolled asthma also have a higher frequency of obesity than children with controlled asthma. Stress can affect asthma control, and children with poorly controlled asthma are more likely to have learning disabilities compared with those with good control. In adults, focused attention and concentration are negatively affected in patients with untreated asthma, and patients with asthma are at greater risk for depression. Also, poorly controlled asthma increases the risks of severe asthma exacerbations following upper respiratory and pneumococcal pulmonary infections. ICSs used to improve asthma control have been demonstrated to improve all of these outcomes. Lastly, the risks of uncontrolled asthma during pregnancy are substantially greater than the risks of recommended asthma medications. Treatments to maintain asthma control are the best approach to optimize maternal and fetal health in the pregnancies of women with asthma. The maintenance of asthma control has significant advantages to patients and greatly outweighs the potential risks of treatment side effects.

### Inhaled corticosteroid use and outcomes in pregnancy [^115yXJid]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Current asthma management guidelines recommend aggressive asthma treatment for women who are pregnant.

Objective

To examine asthma medication use and asthma-related health care use before and during pregnancy.

Methods

Women aged 15 to 45 years with a pregnancy claim (index event) and an asthma claim (diagnosis or asthma medication prescription) were identified from a database of US managed care organizations (PharMetrics Patient-Centric Database). Medical claims 6 months before and after the index event were studied to determine the impact of pregnancy on asthma medication use (ie, prescription claims) and asthma-related physician visits, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations.

Results

Of 7,235 women with a pregnancy claim and 6 months of preindex and postindex data, 633 had an asthma claim (334 had an asthma-related medication claim and 299 had no asthma-related medication claim before the index event). During the preindex period, 142 patients were using asthma controller medications, with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) the most commonly used controller (n = 101); 283 were using short-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (SABAs) with or without controllers. Among the 334 patients using asthma medication before pregnancy, the number using any controller decreased from 142 to 94 (-34%), those using ICSs decreased from 101 to 65 (-36%), and those using SABAs decreased from 283 to 137 (-52%) after the pregnancy claim. For these 334 patients, the number with an asthma-related ED visit increased from 14 to 17 (21%) after the pregnancy claim. Among those without a pharmacy record of medication use before pregnancy (n = 299), the number with an asthma-related ED visit increased from 4 to 7 (75%) after the pregnancy claim. For the 101 patients using ICSs before pregnancy, the number with an asthma-related physician visit decreased from 39 to 25 (-36%) and the number with an ED visit was unchanged. For the 532 patients not using an ICS before pregnancy, the number with an asthma-related physician visit increased from 84 to 107 (27%) and the number with an ED visit increased from 12 to 18 (50%).

Conclusion

For patients using an ICS before pregnancy, the rate of asthma-related physician visits decreased and the number of ED visits was unchanged after pregnancy, whereas physician and ED visits increased after pregnancy for patients not using an ICS before pregnancy. Overall, the data suggest that asthma is undertreated in women contemplating pregnancy and in those who are pregnant.

Track 1 (preferred) Step 3 for adults and adolescents: low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) — For adults and adolescents, the preferred Step 3 option is low-dose ICS-formoterol as both maintenance and reliever treatment (MART), with either budesonide-formoterol or beclometasone-formoterol used for daily maintenance and as an anti-inflammatory reliever; low-dose ICS-formoterol can also be used before exercise and before expected allergen exposure. Before considering a step up, check for common problems such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, and environmental exposures, and confirm that the symptoms are due to asthma. Double-blind studies included adult and adolescent patients with ≥ 1 exacerbation in the previous year despite maintenance low-dose ICS or ICS-LABA treatment, and open-label studies included patients taking at least low-dose ICS or ICS-LABA without requiring a history of exacerbations. Low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy reduced severe exacerbations and provided similar asthma control at relatively low ICS doses compared with a fixed dose of ICS-LABA maintenance or a higher dose of ICS, both with as-needed SABA (Evidence A), and in a meta-analysis switching from Step 3 treatment plus SABA reliever to MART was associated with a 29% reduced risk of severe exacerbation versus stepping up to Step 4 ICS-LABA maintenance plus SABA reliever and a 30% reduced risk versus staying on the same treatment with SABA reliever.

### The effectiveness of non-pharmacological healthcare interventions for asthma management during pregnancy: a systematic review [^112SbHki]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of non-pharmacological healthcare interventions for improving asthma management in pregnant women. The three studies included in the review assessed education, PMR and a FeNO-based algorithm, which were found to have some positive effects on asthma management in pregnancy. Firm conclusions however, cannot be drawn due to the limited number of reported studies, clinical heterogeneity of the interventions, variations in outcome measures and limitations in study designs.

Patient education is the cornerstone of asthma management during pregnancy as it promotes adherence and in turn, improves asthma control. Gibson et al. identified four components of an effective asthma education program: (1) information about asthma and its management, (2) self-monitoring of either symptoms or peak expiratory flow rate, (3) regular medical review for assessing asthma control, severity and medications, and (4) a written action plan to guide patient self-management of asthma exacerbations. Pregnant women with asthma should have a basic understanding of self-monitoring, how to use asthma medications correctly, how to manage worsening asthma and the importance of continued adherence to asthma management plans. Asthma education programs and self-management skills have been proven to be effective in improving health outcomes in adults with asthma. Both the studies of Murphy et al. and Powell et al. provided education to pregnant women on skills and knowledge to manage their asthma, leading to improvement in adherence to medication regimens and asthma action plans.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112iZmiD]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Managing asthma with multimorbidity and in specific populations emphasizes that multimorbidity is common in patients with chronic diseases such as asthma and that it is important to identify and manage multimorbidity, as it contributes to impaired quality of life, increased healthcare utilization, and adverse effects of medications. Comorbidities such as rhinosinusitis, obesity and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) may contribute to respiratory symptoms, and some contribute to poor asthma control. For patients with dyspnea or wheezing on exertion, distinguish between exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) and symptoms that result from obesity or a lack of fitness or are the result of alternative conditions such as inducible laryngeal obstruction, and provide advice about preventing and managing EIB. All adolescents and adults with asthma should receive inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment to reduce their risk of severe exacerbations, and it should be taken every day or, as an alternative in mild asthma, by as-needed ICS-formoterol for symptom relief. Refer patients with difficult-to-treat or severe asthma to a specialist or severe asthma service, after addressing common problems such as incorrect diagnosis, incorrect inhaler technique, ongoing environmental exposures, and poor adherence. Women with asthma who are pregnant or planning pregnancy should be advised not to stop ICS-containing therapy, as exacerbations increase the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, and the advantages of actively treating asthma in pregnancy with ICS-containing therapy markedly outweigh any potential risks of these medications.

Asthma Treatment Steps for Children 5 Years and Younger

Step 1

Provide inhaled SABA for relief of wheezing episodes. A need for SABA more than twice a week on average over 1 month indicates the need for a trial of controller medication.

Step 2

The preferred option is regular, daily, low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA, given for at least 3 months (see Box 6–6 in Referencefor ICS doses). Regular montelukast is less effective than low-dose ICS, and parents/caregivers should be counseled about potential neurobehavioral adverse effects, as in a boxed warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Step 3

Before considering step-up to double the "low" ICS dose, check for concomitant or alternative diagnoses, check and correct inhaler technique and adherence, and ask about risk factors such as exposure to allergens or tobacco smoke. ICS–LABA is not recommended in children < 4 years old, as there are insufficient data about efficacy and safety.

Step 4

Refer the child for expert advice if symptoms and/or flare-ups persist, or at any time if side effects of treatment are observed or suspected, or if there are doubts about diagnosis. See Chapter 6 in Referencefor details about other therapeutic options.

### Safety of asthma and allergy medications in pregnancy [^1113WpqR]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Given the unique nature of pregnancy with respect to obtaining safety data regarding medication exposures, developing comprehensive information on the wide variety of medications that might be of clinical benefit during pregnancy is a challenging and on-going task. For many of the most commonly used asthma and allergy medications that were covered in this article, there is at least limited human data are available. Even for relatively well-studied medications, there are many unanswered questions, and few studies exist that are large enough to rule out at least a doubling of risk for specific outcomes, particularly congenital anomalies. This challenge becomes even more daunting when evaluating risks of individual products is considered the optimal goal, as opposed to "lumping" all medication exposures within a class. All of these issues call for more human pregnancy data that are collected more efficiently so that the answers that clinicians and pregnant women need are available more readily. In the meantime, health care providers and pregnant women must work with the information that is available to evaluate the risks and benefits of a particular medication and alternative choices for treatment of asthma or allergy during pregnancy, while considering the potential for adverse effects if the woman with severe or uncontrolled asthma is under-treated. To assist in making a risk/benefit assessment, the clinician can draw on existing resources that provide systematic periodic review of new data on medications in pregnancy as it becomes available, and synthesize the entire body of data on a particular drug into concise summary statements. Two such resources are TERIS (TeratogenInformation System) [38] and Reprotox [39]; both on-line services are managed by experts in the field of teratology. An additional resource for clinicians and pregnant women is the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists [40], a network of risk-assessment counselors in the United States and Canada who specialize in research and the communication of risks that are associated with exposures in pregnancy.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116bRhtW]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma in pregnancy — biologics, exacerbations, and labor management — notes that evidence on use of biologic therapies during pregnancy is scarce, and a registry study found no evidence of an increased risk of major congenital malformations when mothers received omalizumab during pregnancy; women should be counselled that the potential risks associated with biologic exposure during pregnancy need to be balanced against the risks for themselves and their children caused by uncontrolled asthma. During acute asthma exacerbations, pregnant women may be less likely to be treated appropriately than non‑pregnant patients; to avoid fetal hypoxia, it is important to manage exacerbations aggressively with short‑acting beta‑agonist (SABA), oxygen, and early administration of systemic corticosteroids, and respiratory infections should be monitored and managed appropriately during pregnancy. During labor and delivery, usual maintenance medications should be taken, with reliever if needed; acute exacerbations are uncommon but bronchoconstriction may be induced by hyperventilation during labor and should be managed with SABA. Neonatal hypoglycemia may be seen, especially in preterm babies, when high doses of beta‑agonists have been given within the last 48 hours prior to delivery; if high doses of SABA have been given during labor and delivery, blood glucose levels should be monitored in the baby (especially if preterm) for the first 24 hours.

### Asthma and pregnancy [^113NPDJH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Asthma complicates 4–8% of pregnancies. Mild and well-controlled moderate asthma can be associated with excellent maternal and perinatal pregnancy outcomes. Severe and poorly controlled asthma may be associated with increased prematurity, need for cesarean delivery, preeclampsia, growth restriction, other perinatal complications, as well as maternal morbidity and mortality. Optimal management of asthma during pregnancy includes objective monitoring of lung function, avoiding or controlling asthma triggers, patient education, and individualized pharmacologic therapy. Those with persistent asthma should be monitored by peak expiratory flow rate, spirometry to measure the forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or both. Step-care therapeutic approach uses the least amount of drug intervention necessary to control a patient's severity of asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for the management of all levels of persistent asthma during pregnancy. It is safer for pregnant women with asthma to be treated with asthma medications than it is for them to have asthma symptoms and exacerbations. The ultimate goal of asthma therapy is maintaining adequate oxygenation of the fetus by prevention of hypoxic episodes in the mother. Asthma exacerbations should be aggressively managed, with a goal of alleviating asthma symptoms and attaining peak expiratory flow rate or forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 70% predicted or more. Pregnancies complicated by moderate or severe asthma may benefit from ultrasound for fetal growth and accurate dating and antenatal assessment of fetal well-being. Asthma medications should be continued during labor, and parturients should be encouraged to breastfeed.

### Asthma: versatile treatment for a variable disease [^116wYEY1]. The Journal of Asthma (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This review describes factors contributing to the variable nature of asthma and the versatile treatment strategies required for the clinical management of the disease.

Data Sources

A comprehensive review of the literature using MEDLINE was conducted.

Study Selection

Included articles were selected for their relevance to variability or severity of asthma. Bibliographies of selected articles served as additional sources of considered publications.

Results

Asthma severity can vary substantially among patients and within individual patients because of physiologic, environmental, or behavioral factors. Inhaled corticosteroids are an effective and versatile treatment option for special populations with asthma and for patients with varying degrees of asthma severity. Inhaled corticosteroids are now the preferred treatment for all three severity levels of persistent asthma, especially in young children and pregnant women. Treatment regimens may be adjusted up or adjusted down when appropriate to maintain optimal symptom control and limit potential adverse systemic effects.

Conclusions

The clinical management of asthma is challenging given the day-to-day variability of the disease. Variability in pulmonary function and asthma symptoms may be minimized through increased awareness of the factors contributing to asthma variability as well as the effective use of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Flexible treatment strategies that consider the different severities of asthma and account for variability within individual patients may be particularly useful in improving adherence and patient outcomes.

### Chronic asthma treatment: common questions and answers [^113azxef]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma affects more than 25 million people in the United States, and 62% of adults with asthma do not have adequately controlled symptoms. Asthma severity and level of control should be assessed at diagnosis and evaluated at subsequent visits using validated tools such as the Asthma Control Test or the asthma APGAR (activities, persistent, triggers, asthma medications, response to therapy) tools. Short-acting beta2 agonists are preferred asthma reliever medications. Controller medications consist of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonists, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. Treatment typically begins with inhaled corticosteroids, and additional medications or dosage increases should be added in a stepwise fashion according to guideline-directed therapy recommendations from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program or the Global Initiative for Asthma when symptoms are inadequately controlled. Single maintenance and reliever therapy combines an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2 agonist for controller and reliever treatments. This therapy is preferred for adults and adolescents because of its effectiveness in reducing severe exacerbations. Subcutaneous immunotherapy may be considered for those five years and older with mild to moderate allergic asthma; however, sublingual immunotherapy is not recommended. Patients with severe uncontrolled asthma despite appropriate treatment should be reassessed and considered for specialty referral. Biologic agents may be considered for patients with severe allergic and eosinophilic asthma.

Confirming the diagnosis of asthma in patients already taking ICS‑containing treatment — In primary care, the presence of asthma cannot be confirmed in many patients (25–35%) who have previously received this diagnosis, and Box 1‑5 describes how to step‑down ICS‑containing treatment to help confirm the diagnosis of asthma. If the patient has risk factors for asthma exacerbations, step down treatment only with close supervision, choose a suitable time (e.g., no respiratory infection, not going away on vacation, not pregnant), and provide a written asthma action plan ensuring enough medication to resume the previous dose if asthma worsens after stepping down. Show the patient/caregiver how to reduce their ICS dose by 25–50%, or stop other maintenance medication (e.g. LABA) if being used, and schedule a review visit for 2–4 weeks. Repeat assessment of asthma control and lung function tests in 2–4 weeks. If symptoms increase and variable expiratory airflow limitation is confirmed after stepping down treatment, the diagnosis of asthma is confirmed and the patient should be returned to their lowest previous effective treatment. If, after stepping down to a low‑dose ICS‑containing treatment, symptoms do not worsen and there is still no evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation to confirm the diagnosis of asthma, consider ceasing ICS‑containing treatment and repeating asthma control assessment and lung function tests in 2–3 weeks, but follow the patient for at least 12 months.

### Asthma in pregnancy and its pharmacologic treatment [^112uLBSN]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is among the most common serious medical problems in pregnancy, and its prevalence may be increasing. Management is problematic because asthma may harm the fetus, yet little is known about fetal risks of asthma medications.

Objective

To examine the prevalence, symptom control, and pharmacologic treatment of asthma in pregnancy.

Methods

Study participants were a random sample of 3,609 mothers of nonmalformed infants born in Massachusetts between 1998 and 2006. Interviewed within 6 months of delivery, participants were asked specific asthma-related questions and classified as having physician-diagnosed, possible, past, or no asthma; those with physician-diagnosed asthma were classified as having well-controlled, not well-controlled, or poorly controlled asthma. Drug treatments were grouped into corticosteroids, beta(2)-agonists, leukotriene modifiers, combination products, and others.

Results

Physician-diagnosed asthma was present in 502 women (13.9%) and possible asthma in an additional 578(16.0%). Higher rates of asthma were observed among women who were younger, white, obese, and less well educated, had lower income, and smoked during pregnancy. Secular changes were unremarkable: leukotriene modifiers were used by only 3.4% of asthmatic women; inhaled steroid use increased only from 19.0% during 1997–1999 to 23.3% in 2003–2005, whereas use of inhaled beta(2)-agonists exceeded 50% in both periods. Less than 40% of women with poorly controlled asthma symptoms reported use of a controller medication.

Conclusions

High rates of asthma and asthma symptoms, together with the low rates of use of controller medications, underscore the need to better understand the risks and safety of asthma medications during pregnancy.

### Women's experiences of personalised support for asthma care during pregnancy: a systematic review of the literature [^112og1zc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnancy can be a worrying time for women, and it is common that prospective mothers are anxious about the health of their child and about the birth itself; these worries are quite distinct from generalised anxiety and can manifest in prolonged mood disturbances which do not simply resolve after delivery. In addition to these fears about pregnancy itself, pregnant women with asthma have an additional substantial health issue to worry about in their asthma. It is known that psychological morbidity including depression is in itself a predisposing factor for asthma exacerbations, and more specifically that anxiety is a cause of exacerbations in pregnant women. This is compounded by the fact that during pregnancy, one third of pregnant asthma suffers' asthma will worsen, one third's will stay the same, and one third's will improve and there seems to be little or no way of predicting accurately which individuals will be adversely affected.

Pregnant women with asthma are more likely to suffer pre-eclampsia than women without asthma, but if asthma is left uncontrolled, pregnancy complications can include hyperemesis, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, vaginal haemorrhage, complicated labour, fetal growth restriction, pre-term birth, increased perinatal mortality, neonatal hypoxia, and possibly increased Caesarean section risk. United Kingdom guidance regarding the management of asthma and pregnancy is that pregnant women with more than mild asthma should be monitored closely to make sure that their asthma is well controlled, which significantly reduces the risks of these pregnancy-related complications. As well as potential risks to their own health, pregnant women are likely to worry about the risks of their asthma and its treatments to their unborn baby, and to their new-born when breastfeeding. Guidance indicates that women should receive advice about maintaining good control of their asthma during pregnancy to avoid risks for mother and baby, and that B2 agonists, and oral and inhaled corticosteroids and other medications should be maintained where necessary during pregnancy. European prescribing practice is reasonably consistent with uniform peaks in prescribing for pregnant asthmatics in the second trimester (when exacerbations are likely to occur) and then a decline in the three months after birth. However, analysing the rates of prescribing and dispensing of medications says nothing about whether the women to whom they are prescribed understood what they were taking and why, or how worried they might have been when ingesting them.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^1136hzs7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma management — Recommendation 13 for individuals aged 12 years and older conditionally recommends inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)–formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy compared with higher-dose ICS–long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) as daily controller therapy and short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) for quick relief, with high certainty of evidence; for Step 4, the preferred therapy is single-inhaler ICS-formoterol used both daily and as needed, and the maximum total daily dose of formoterol should not exceed 12 puffs (54 μg) for those aged 12 years and older. This recommendation applies to all individuals with asthma aged 12 years and older. Individuals with asthma should use ICS-formoterol as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once or twice daily, with an additional 1 to 2 puffs as needed for symptoms up to a maximum of 12 puffs (54 μg formoterol) per day, and clinicians should advise individuals to contact their clinician if they need to use more than these amounts. The calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation, clinicians managing asthma should regularly assess individuals using this therapy, and this therapy is appropriate for Step 4. Individuals with asthma should not use ICS-formoterol as reliever therapy if they are taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy, and SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled with alternate treatments such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy. If maintenance ICS-LABA plus SABA provides adequate control, it does not need to be changed; however, if uncontrolled, individuals should receive the preferred SMART if possible before stepping up to a higher step of therapy.

### The effectiveness of non-pharmacological healthcare interventions for asthma management during pregnancy: a systematic review [^117KiFyC]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is one of the most serious health problems affecting people of all ages throughout the world. In the United States of America the prevalence of self-reported asthma among pregnant women was between 8.4% and 8.8% during the period 1997 to 2001, and 4.1% of all pregnant women had experienced an asthma attack in the previous year. In Australia, asthma is the most common chronic disease affecting pregnant women, complicating one in eight pregnancies.

A prospective study conducted by Schatz et al. of 366 pregnancies in 330 women with asthma, showed that during pregnancy, asthma improved in slightly more than a quarter of patients (28%), worsened in slightly more than a third of patients (35%) and remained unchanged in a third of patients (33%). More than half of women with asthma do not take their asthma preventer medications on a regular basis before and during pregnancy, leading to asthma exacerbations. Good asthma control during pregnancy is important to reduce risks for both mother (e.g. pre-eclampsia, perinatal mortality, and need for cesarean delivery) and infant (e.g. low birth weight and prematurity). Therefore, pregnant women with asthma warrant additional support comprising education, ongoing monitoring and review of treatment.

### The safety of asthma medications during pregnancy and lactation: clinical management and research priorities [^116kyo78]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma is one of the most common underlying diseases in women of reproductive age that can lead to potentially serious medical problems during pregnancy and lactation. A group of key stakeholders across multiple relevant disciplines was invited to take part in an effort to prioritize, strategize, and mobilize action steps to fill important gaps in knowledge regarding asthma medication safety in pregnancy and lactation. The stakeholders identified substantial gaps in the literature on the safety of asthma medications used during pregnancy and lactation and prioritized strategies to fill those gaps. Short-term action steps included linking data from existing complementary study designs (US and international claims data, single drug pregnancy registries, case-control studies, and coordinated systematic data systems). Long-term action steps included creating an asthma disease registry, incorporating the disease registry into electronic health record systems, and coordinating care across disciplines. The stakeholders also prioritized establishing new infrastructures/collaborations to perform research in pregnant and lactating women and to include patient perspectives throughout the process. To address the evidence gaps, and aid in populating product labels with data that inform clinical decision making, the consortium developed a plan to systematically obtain necessary data in the most efficient and timely manner.

### Bringing asthma care into the twenty-first century [^114mpYau]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The GINA 2019 update

GINA describes this update as the biggest change to asthma management proposed in over 30 years. Single inhaler ICS/formoterol is now recommended as the preferred reliever in place of SABA alone across the full spectrum of asthma severity (only for patients already on ICS/formoterol maintenance at GINA steps 3–5)(Fig. 3). Recommending use of an anti-inflammatory combination reliever for this inflammatory disease, rather than SABA alone, which can worsen inflammation, resolves a major paradox in most previous guidelines. The new approach proposed by GINA 2019 had already been suggested by a consortium of international experts on asthma management in the Lancet Commission 2017. A large body of data already exists on the efficacy and safety of the budesonide/formoterol combination when used as an as-needed reliever medication in moderate-to-severe asthma –. There is also a study showing that symptom-driven use of beclometasone/salbutamol as reliever was as effective as regular use of beclometasone, with a lower cumulative ICS dose. There are currently no data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of combining ICS/formoterol with maintenance ICS/LABA treatment that does not contain formoterol.

### Asthma in pregnancy: a review of recent literature [^112AQXjY]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma remains the most common respiratory disease in pregnancy. Identifying risk factors for asthma exacerbations during pregnancy is critical, as uncontrolled asthma can have detrimental effects for both mother and baby. In this review, we discuss recent literature exploring risk factors, fetal and maternal effects, and treatment options for asthma during pregnancy.

Recent Findings

Recent literature suggests that optimizing asthma during pregnancy improves outcomes for both mother and baby, as well as later in childhood. Current research affirms that the benefit of asthma medication use outweighs any potential risks related to the medications themselves. Limited information is available regarding the use of newer therapies such as biologics during pregnancy.

Summary

Identifying risk factors for asthma exacerbations during pregnancy is critical to prevent adverse outcomes for both mother and baby. Recent evidence continues to affirm the safety of asthma medication use; more studies are needed regarding the use of new therapies during pregnancy.

Ages 5–11 years quick-relief medications — Use inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) as needed for symptoms; the intensity of treatment depends on severity of symptoms, up to 3 treatments at 20-minute intervals as needed. In Steps 3 and 4, the preferred option includes ICS-formoterol 1 to 2 puffs as needed up to a maximum total daily maintenance and rescue dose of 8 puffs (36 mcg). Caution: Increasing use of SABA or use > 2 days a week for symptom relief (not prevention of EIB) generally indicates inadequate control and may require a step up in treatment.

### Maternal beliefs and asthma medication adherence during pregnancy [^116XeVnC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2026). Medium credibility.

Table IV
Maternal beliefs about asthma medication and reported asthma medication adherence: Adjusted analysis

With respect to outcomes, less adherence was not associated with preterm delivery (OR = 0.54 [95% CI = 0.12–2.38]), SGA from the standpoint of birth weight (aOR = 0.31 [95% CI = 0.06–1.76]), or SGA from the standpoint of birth length (aOR = 0.45 [95% CI = 0.05 = 4.43]). However, SGA from the standpoint of head circumference (≤ 10th percentile) was associated with less adherence (aOR = 2.82 [95% CI = 1.08–7.39]) (see Table E1 in the Online Repository at).

In this study, participants' concern for the safety of asthma medication use during pregnancy aligns with previous research demonstrating apprehension about utilizing asthma medication during pregnancy, particularly among patients who are nonadherent with asthma medication.

However, specific aspects of patients' concern about asthma medication safety during pregnancy are less well understood. Our findings suggest that perceived risk of asthma medication may vary for different asthma medication classes and that these views may be associated with underlying medication compliance, as participants with less medication adherence were significantly more concerned about the safety of preventive/maintenance inhalers (P = .002) but not about the safety of rescue inhalers (P = .436). Furthermore, participants with less adherence were nearly 3 times more likely to express concern that preventive/maintenance inhalers would harm their baby (OR = 2.86 [95% CI = 1.46–5.58]). Although the established literature has suggested that pregnant patients significantly overestimated the teratogenicity of oral and inhaled corticosteroids during pregnancy, these views have not been previously examined in the context of reported medication adherence.

### The management of asthma and rhinitis during pregnancy [^1116CUdY]. Journal of Women's Health (2005). Low credibility.

Asthma and rhinitis frequently complicate pregnancy. The course of asthma may be adversely altered by gestation, placing the mother and fetus at risk. Therefore, pregnant patients with persistent asthma require an aggressive asthma management plan that includes environmental control measures and the use of long-term controller medications. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the preferred long-term controller medication for persistent asthma, based on efficacy. However, safety concerns regarding corticosteroids may cause physicians or patients to seek an alternate, less effective treatment during pregnancy. The Food and Drug Administration's pregnancy category ratings are based on animal and human safety data. Because ICSs were previously rated pregnancy category C (i.e., with human studies lacking and animal studies either lacking or positive for fetal risk), other asthma controllers, such as cromolyn and nedocromil, that carry a pregnancy category B rating (i.e., showing no evidence of fetal risk in humans or animal studies negative for fetal risk) appeared to be more desirable for use during pregnancy. One ICS, budesonide, was reclassified as pregnancy category B based on human data supporting its use during pregnancy. In moderate and severe persistent asthma, add-on therapy may be considered, including long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and theophylline. Because rhinitis may adversely affect quality of life and the course of asthma, recommendations for aggressive management also apply.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116dzaAS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Goal of asthma management in young children — aims and care cycle are specified: as with other age groups, the goal is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the child, including to achieve and maintain good long-term control of symptoms and maintain normal activity levels, and to minimize future risk; that is to reduce the risk of flare-ups, maintain lung function and lung development as close to normal as possible, and minimize medication side-effects. The long-term goals are achieved through a partnership between the parent/caregiver and the health professional team, with a cycle of Assess (diagnosis, symptom control, risk factors, inhaler technique, adherence, parent preference), Adjust treatment (medications, non-pharmacological strategies, and treatment of modifiable risk factors), and Review response including medication effectiveness and side-effects.

### The breathing for life trial: a randomised controlled trial of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)-based management of asthma during pregnancy and its impact on perinatal outcomes and infant and childhood respiratory health [^1139yiut]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Regular monitoring of asthma during pregnancy is recommended for two main reasons: (i) typically, one third of women experience an improvement, one third have no change, and one third have a subjective worsening of their asthma while pregnant; and (ii) these changes are not easily predicted, which can complicate management. Current practice is to adjust asthma therapy following an assessment of symptoms and lung function; however, these measures are not always reflective of airway inflammation, which is the target of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy, suggesting that treatment decisions may be inappropriate when based on clinical assessment alone. Inflammation-guided therapy, known as 'inflammometry', is a novel alternative. This strategy has resulted in a significant reduction in exacerbations in non-pregnant adults with asthma, where the adjustment of ICS doses was informed by a marker (or a surrogate marker) of inflammation, such as sputum eosinophils or fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO). Although FENO measurement is supported by the American Thoracic Society for clinical use to identify the need for ICS treatment, predict the response to ICS, and to adjust ICS doses in non-pregnant asthma, data is lacking to support its use in pregnancy, with only one 'inflammometry' trial in pregnancy published to date.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^113cb6mr]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD asthma guideline — considerations for stepping down therapy detail patient selection, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) tapering, long-acting beta agonist (LABA) discontinuation, and action planning. Do not reduce ICS dose in patients who cannot be closely monitored, such as those who are planning to travel or have inconsistent follow-up appointments, and avoid stepping down in individuals at high risk of severe exacerbations, such as pregnant individuals or those with recent acute illnesses. For tapering, decrease the ICS dose gradually by 25–50% every 3 months with the goal to reach the lowest effective maintenance dose that continues to control asthma symptoms, and assess asthma symptoms regularly throughout the tapering process to ensure stable control. LABAs can generally be discontinued without a taper, as they do not require a gradual reduction like ICS. Patients should have a written action plan to monitor for any signs of worsening asthma; ensure that the patient has a written asthma action plan that includes instructions for recognizing early signs of worsening asthma and steps to take, including medication adjustments and when to seek medical attention, and make sure they have access to adequate medication and know what actions to take if symptoms return or worsen after discontinuing LABA or stepping down the ICS.

### Asthma and pregnancy [^113sdXjT]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is probably the most common serious medical disorder that may complicate pregnancy. A third of pregnant women with asthma will experience worsening of their symptoms, a third will see improvement of their symptoms and a third will see no change. The primary goal is to maintain optimal control of asthma for maternal health and well-being as well as fetal maturation. Vital patient education should cover the use of controller medication, avoidance of asthma triggers and early treatment of asthma exacerbations. Proper asthma management should ideally be started in the preconception period. Since smoking is probably the most modifiable risk factor of asthma, pregnant woman should avoid active and passive smoking. Acute asthma exacerbation during the first trimester is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations. Poorly controlled asthma is associated with low birth weight, preeclampsia, and preterm birth. Medications used for asthma control in the non-pregnant population are generally the same in pregnancy with a few exceptions. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the preferred controller therapy. Budesonide is the preferred ICS. Long-acting B-agonists (LABA) are the preferred add-on therapy to medium to high dose ICS. Major triggers for asthma exacerbations during pregnancy are viral infections and ICS nonadherence.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^113at2R4]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD asthma CPG — step-down therapy is presented as: "stepping down (not discontinuing) inhaled corticosteroids dose or discontinuing long-acting beta agonists. (Weak for | Not reviewed, Not changed)". It is standard practice to make decisions about stepping down therapy after a patient has maintained asthma control on a regimen for at least three months, and even when a patient is on a stable regimen for three or more months, stepping down is avoided during pregnancy, times of stress, recent acute illness, planned travel, peak allergen seasons, and/or for patients who cannot be closely monitored. The recommendation is based on four SRs and two RCTs, with the strongest evidence to avoid complete discontinuation of ICS in adults due to increased exacerbations and asthma symptoms; an SR showed asthma exacerbations were statistically no more likely among patients who reduced the ICS dose compared to those who maintained their ICS dose, another SR found that lowering ICS dose versus continuing a stable dose resulted in inconclusive evidence for exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life, while the same SR reported that stepping down the ICS component of a ICS/LABA versus continuing a stable dose ICS/LABA resulted in equivalent levels of asthma control and asthma-related quality of life. For patients on ICS/LABA, stepping down to ICS alone versus continued stable dose ICS/LABA was examined in both an SR and an RCT; the SR found statistically significant differences favoring continued ICS/LABA therapy with respect to asthma control and asthma-related quality of life, although the authors noted the evidence was insufficient to show effects on important outcomes such as exacerbations requiring hospital admission and serious adverse events.

### Summary of the Dutch multidisciplinary practice guideline on asthma and pregnancy [^1153RKnu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease in women of childbearing age and during pregnancy. This paper presents a summary of the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline on asthma and pregnancy. The aim of this guideline is to provide structured, where possible, evidence-based recommendations to optimize the management of asthma during pregnancy. The main topics covered in this guideline are preconception counseling, the safety of asthma medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding and risk assessment and monitoring of asthma during pregnancy. Because many caregivers are involved and a uniform approach is desirable, this guideline has been developed in collaboration with all relevant health care providers and patient representatives.

### Acute asthma during pregnancy [^115jMVZr]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

In addition to preventing maternal and fetal hypoxia, the goals of treating acute asthma exacerbation during pregnancy mirror those in the nongravid patient: rapid reversal of airflow obstruction with aerosolized bronchodilators, reduction of likelihood of recurrence by the addition of corticosteroids, and ongoing assessment of mother and fetus. Disposition decisions are multifaceted and must take into account the health and well-being of the pregnant patient and that of her fetus. Discharge planning includes prescription of scheduled 3–2 agonist treatments until symptoms resolve, intensification of daily treatment as needed, prescriptions for systemic and ICSs, as well provision of patient education, a personalized action plan, and close follow-up.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1118amuB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma step-up therapy — uncontrolled despite good adherence and inhaler technique: Before stepping up, first confirm symptoms are due to asthma and address common problems, then in adults and adolescents the preferred Step 3 is Track 1 with low-dose inhaled corticosteroid–formoterol as maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART), which reduces severe exacerbations versus maintenance inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus long-acting beta agonist (LABA) with as-needed short-acting beta agonist (SABA); if needed, increase to medium dose (Step 4) by increasing maintenance inhalations. MART is also a preferred option at Steps 3 and 4 for children 6–11 years with a lower dose ICS-formoterol inhaler. ICS-formoterol should not be used as the reliever for patients taking a different ICS-LABA maintenance treatment. Other Step 3 options (Track 2 and in children) include maintenance ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA or ICS-SABA; for children 6–11 years, medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA, and try other controller options at the same step before stepping up.

### Inhaled corticosteroids during pregnancy: a review of methodologic issues [^114YajJF]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

There is evidence in the literature that inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are safe for pregnant women with asthma and their infants. Although this is useful information about ICS use during pregnancy, some articles must be viewed cautiously because of lack of power and adjustment for potentially important confounding variables.

Objective

To summarize evidence on the potential effects of ICSs to treat asthma in pregnant mothers and their children with particular focus on study power.

Methods

Studies published before September 1, 2007, and focusing mainly on ICS use for asthma treatment during pregnancy were researched in Pubmed and the Cochrane Library. Post hoc power calculations were completed using data reported in the published articles.

Results

Twenty-three studies that evaluated the associations between ICS use during pregnancy and maternal and/or perinatal outcomes were retained. Only six studies on the association between ICS use and maternal outcomes reported significant results; five studies found significant associations between ICS use and perinatal outcomes. Regarding non-significant results, two studies on maternal outcomes and seven studies on perinatal outcomes had a power higher than 80% to detect a relative risk of 1.5 or a mean birth weight difference of 500 g.

Conclusion

While there currently is some degree of evidence to support the safety of ICS use during pregnancy, this review highlights the limited statistical power of several studies published in this area.

### Asthma outcomes and management during Pregnancy [^117TQPE4]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma during pregnancy poses a common, increasingly prevalent threat to the health of women and their children. The present article reviews recent insights gained from the epidemiology of asthma during pregnancy, demonstrating the many short- and long-term risks to mother and fetus incurred by poorly controlled maternal asthma. We further discuss emerging evidence that active management of asthma during pregnancy can positively influence and perhaps completely mitigate these poor outcomes. Recent high-quality trials examining best methods for asthma treatment are reviewed and synthesized to offer an evidence-based pathway for comprehensive treatment of asthma in the outpatient setting. Safe and effective medications, as well as nonpharmacologic interventions, for asthma during pregnancy are discussed, and treatment options for related conditions of pregnancy, including depression, rhinitis, and gastroesophageal reflux, are presented. Throughout, we emphasize that an effective treatment strategy relies on a detailed patient evaluation, patient education, objective measurement of asthma control, and frequent and supportive follow-up. The cardiovascular and respiratory physiology of pregnancy is reviewed, as well as its implications for the management of patients with asthma, including patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. For the situation when outpatient asthma management has failed, an approach to the critically ill pregnant patient with status asthmaticus is detailed. Multidisciplinary teams that include pulmonary specialists, obstetricians, primary care providers, nurses, pharmacists, and asthma educators improve the care of pregnant women with asthma.

### Factors associated with nonadherence to inhaled corticosteroids for asthma during pregnancy [^112e7hY5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonadherence is common among pregnant women prescribed inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for asthma and may have serious consequences for mother and baby. Factors associated with ICS nonadherence have not been determined in this population.

Objectives

To determine factors associated with {1} nonadherence to ICS in early-mid pregnancy (cross-sectional) and {2} persistent nonadherence to ICS during pregnancy (longitudinal).

Methods

Data used come from 3 prospective studies (2004–2019) involving women with asthma recruited by 23 weeks' gestation (N = 1614). Demographics, asthma history, and current symptoms were assessed, and spirometry was performed at baseline and throughout pregnancy. Women self-reported current medication use and number of ICS doses missed in the past week. Nonadherence was defined as ≥ 20% of prescribed dosages missed in the past week (baseline) and on at least 2 occasions during follow-up (persistent). Factors associated with ICS nonadherence were examined using backward stepwise logistic regression.

Results

Of 610 (38%) women prescribed ICS at baseline, 236 (39%) were classified as nonadherent. Of 612 (38%) women prescribed ICS during at least 2 follow-up visits, 149 (24%) were classified as persistent nonadherent. Factors associated with nonadherence at baseline were current or ex-smoking, non-Caucasian/non-Indigenous ethnicity, adult diagnosis of asthma, and lower lung function. Factors associated with persistent nonadherence to ICS were lower maternal age, higher parity, and no prescribed ICS at baseline.

Conclusion

Young multiparous non-Caucasian/non-Indigenous mothers are at increased risk of being nonadherent to ICS during pregnancy. Strategies to improve ICS nonadherence should address maternal smoking and target women who (re-)initiate ICS use in pregnancy.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114MPmjv]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Pregnancy — management and medication safety — Although there is a general concern about any medication use in pregnancy, the advantages of actively treating asthma in pregnancy markedly outweigh any potential risks of usual asthma medications (Evidence A), and use of ICS, beta agonists, montelukast or theophylline is not associated with an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities. Women with asthma who are pregnant or planning pregnancy should be advised not to stop ICS-containing therapy; ICS reduce the risk of exacerbations of asthma during pregnancy (Evidence A), and cessation of ICS during pregnancy is a significant risk factor for exacerbations (Evidence A). One study reported that a treatment algorithm in non-smoking pregnant women based on monthly measurement of fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and symptoms using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) was associated with significantly fewer exacerbations and better fetal outcomes than an algorithm based only on ACQ; however, the ACQ-only algorithm allowed ICS to be stopped and 58% of women in the ACQ-only group were being treated without ICS by the end of pregnancy, and in a subsequent large randomized controlled trial in pregnant women, there was no reduction in exacerbations with FeNO-guided treatment compared with usual care. On balance, a low priority should be placed on stepping down treatment (regardless of the method used to assess control) until after delivery (Evidence D), and ICS should not be stopped in preparation for pregnancy or during pregnancy (Evidence C). Pregnant patients with asthma should be advised that poorly controlled asthma, and exacerbations, provide a much greater risk to their baby than do current asthma treatments, and during pregnancy, monitoring of asthma every 4–6 weeks is recommended; if it is feasible for this to be achieved by pharmacist-clinician collaboration, with monthly telephone monitoring of asthma symptom control. An intervention study with follow-up for 4–6 years reported the prevalence of asthma was over 50% lower in children of women with asthma who took ICS during pregnancy, with the largest reduction when ICS was being taken in early pregnancy (before weeks 12–20).

### BTS / NICE / SIGN guideline for asthma 2024: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management. how does this compare to GINA 2024? [^1164XxT9]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Preferred pharmacological management.

Preferred pharmacological management of asthma in adults and adolescents (12 and over GINA)and adults and young people (12 and over BTS/NICE/SIGN).

They both emphasise the need for checking factors such as adherence, inhaler technique, trigger factors and diagnosis before escalating therapy and also considering of stepping -down therapy when a patient is "stable' (after 3 months-GINA).

However, there are some differences:

GINA recommends an alternative treatment pathway ("Track 2") to AIR and MART therapies, based on the traditional maintenance ICS and SABA relief therapy. However there is no Track 2 in the NICE/BTS/SIGN guidance for people with asthma age 12 and over.

GINA does not recommend adding LTRA or LAMA to moderate-dose MART (≤ 800 mcg per day of Beclometasone or equivalentvia DPI or standard-particle MDI before specialist referral. However, BTS/NICE/BTS suggest trying these options before referral unless FeNO is raised. (suggesting poor adherence with ICS or a need for additional anti-eosinophilic inflammatory drugs)

Overall the NICE/BTS/SIGN Guideline for management of asthma in people age 12 and over gives support for the GINA approach of single ICS/formoterol AIR and MART therapy as the core asthma treatment for chronic asthma management. However, this may not be applicable in lower economy countries where availability and cost of combination ICS/LABA inhalers may be problematic. In these case GINA's alternative treatment pathway centred around maintenance ICS and relief SABA use may be more relevant.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114f4vVh]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma — initial treatment for symptoms on most days or with daily symptoms and low lung function specifies that for "Asthma symptoms most days (e.g., 4–5 days/week or more); or waking due to asthma once a week or more, or low lung function", the preferred initial treatment (Track 1) is "Low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) (Evidence A)", with alternatives "Low-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A) or plus as-needed ICS-SABA (Evidence B), OR Medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A) or plus as-needed ICS-SABA (Evidence B). Consider likely adherence with daily maintenance treatment". For "Daily asthma symptoms, waking at night with asthma once a week or more, with low lung function", the preferred is "Medium-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) (Evidence D)", with alternatives "Medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA (Evidence D) plus as-needed SABA or plus as-needed ICS-SABA. Consider likely adherence with daily maintenance treatment. High-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA is another option (Evidence A) but adherence is worse than with combination ICS-LABA".

### Asthma in pregnancy [^115uuDTu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma affects up to 10% of pregnancies and confers risk to both mother and child. Adverse maternal outcomes associated with asthma include preeclampsia, preterm labor, and increased risk of cesarean delivery. Maternal asthma also increases risks of low birth weight and small-for-gestational-age birth weight, as well as pediatric respiratory disease, including neonatal respiratory distress and early-onset asthma. Despite these risks, evidence suggests that both chronic asthma and acute asthma exacerbations remain undertreated in pregnancy. Recent landmark clinical trials in nonpregnant individuals have shown that, even for patients with mild disease, using as-needed inhaled corticosteroids combined with long-acting bronchodilators as rescue therapy dramatically reduces exacerbations. Inhaled corticosteroids are considered safe in pregnancy and are effective in reducing symptoms, preventing exacerbations, and mitigating some adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, inhaled corticosteroids should be included as a mainstay in the treatment regimens of all pregnant women with asthma, preferably with an inhaled corticosteroid and rapid-onset bronchodilator combination inhaler for as-needed use and for daily maintenance use in those with more persistent asthma symptoms or risk factors for complications. Clinicians should actively discourage discontinuation or de-escalation of asthma therapies during pregnancy and educate women on the safety and importance of these medications for both themselves and their offspring. Asthma exacerbations during pregnancy confer additional risk, so they must be promptly recognized and treated with systemic corticosteroids and bronchodilators. This Clinical Expert Series article provides an overview of asthma in pregnancy, with a focus on its potential adverse health effects and the core principles of asthma evaluation and treatment in pregnancy.

Managing Asthma with Comorbidities and in Specific Populations

Identify and manage comorbidities such as rhinosinusitis, obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Multimorbidity contributes to respiratory symptoms and impaired quality of life, and some comorbidities contribute to poor symptom control or exacerbations.

Despite general concerns about medication use in pregnancy, the advantages of actively treating asthma in pregnancy to avoid exacerbations markedly outweigh any potential adverse effects of usual controller and reliever medications.

### An international consensus on the use of asthma biologics in pregnancy [^1161qsKk]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Uncontrolled asthma is associated with an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Asthma biologics reduce exacerbation frequency, are steroid sparing, and improve quality of life in people with severe asthma. However, evidence for the use and safety of asthma biologics during pregnancy is scarce, largely because pregnant women were excluded from clinical trials. To help to support clinical teams, we conducted an international modified Delphi study. 141 panellists from 32 countries who were involved in the care of people with severe asthma completed two rounds of online surveys covering key areas surrounding the use of asthma biologics in pregnancy. The results from this international Delphi study emphasise risk versus benefit discussions and shared clinical decision making, with consensus among panellists that asthma biologics can be used during conception and throughout pregnancy, initiated during pregnancy in line with prescribing criteria for non-pregnant people, and initiated or continued during breastfeeding. Collating data through international registries remains essential to inform clinical guidelines.

### FDA recommends avoiding use of NSAIDs in pregnancy at 20… [^115YuzAh]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

For prescription NSAIDS, we are requiring changes to the prescribing information to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. We are recommending avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy rather than the 30 weeks currently described in NSAID prescribing information. At around 30 weeks, NSAIDs can cause a problem that may result in heart issues in the unborn baby. If deemed necessary by a health care professional, use of NSAIDs between 20 and 30 weeks of pregnancy should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration. The changes to the prescribing information also indicate that health care professionals should consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if NSAID treatment extends beyond 48 hours. We will also update the Drug Facts labels of OTC NSAIDs intended for use in adults.

These labels already warn to avoid using NSAIDs during the last 3 months of pregnancy because the medicines may cause problems in the unborn child or complications during delivery. The Drug Facts labels already advise pregnant and breastfeeding women to ask a health care professional before using these medicines. Other medicines, such as acetaminophen, are available to treat pain and fever during pregnancy. Talk to your pharmacist or health care professional for help deciding which might be best. We recommend that health care professionals should limit prescribing NSAIDs between 20 to 30 weeks of pregnancy and avoid prescribing them after 30 weeks of pregnancy. If NSAID treatment is determined necessary, limit use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if NSAID treatment extends beyond 48 hours and discontinue the NSAID if oligohydramnios is found.

The low amniotic fluid levels started as early as 20 weeks of pregnancy. In 11 cases where low amniotic fluid levels were detected during pregnancy, the fluid volume returned to normal after the NSAID was stopped. The information from the cases was similar to what was found in the medical literature. In these publications, low amniotic fluid levels were detected with use of NSAIDs for varying amounts of time, ranging from 48 hours to multiple weeks. In most cases, the condition was reversible within 3 to 6 days after stopping the NSAID. In many reports, the condition was reversed when the NSAID was stopped, and it reappeared when the same NSAID was started again. *The cases were reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database.

Asthma — asthma is more likely to worsen in the second trimester, third trimester or postpartum than in the first trimester. Women with a history of asthma without current symptoms may undergo usual care. Women with current well-controlled asthma should be encouraged to use usual medications and to bring an inhaler with them for their abortion visit, and prophylactic use of an inhaler with nebulized albuterol or metaproterenol before the procedure may be prudent. The facility must be equipped to manage the rare acute asthma exacerbations, and concurrent respiratory infection or inadequately controlled asthma may require delaying the abortion until treatment achieves better control.

### Inhaled glucocorticoids during pregnancy and offspring pediatric diseases: a national cohort study [^112ibZ6z]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Glucocorticoid inhalation is the preferred asthma treatment during pregnancy. Previous studies on its safety focused on obstetric outcomes and offspring malformations.

Objectives

To determine whether glucocorticoid inhalation during pregnancy is a risk factor for offspring pediatric diseases.

Methods

We studied offspring (live singletons) of pregnant women suffering from asthma during pregnancy (prevalence = 6.3%; n = 4,083 mother-child pairs) from the Danish National Birth Cohort (births, 1996–2002; prospective data). We estimated the associations between use of inhaled glucocorticoids for asthma treatment during pregnancy (n = 1231; 79.9% budesonide, 17.6% fluticasone, 5.4% beclomethasone, and 0.9% other or unspecified glucocorticoids) and offspring diseases (International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision, diagnoses) during childhood. We conducted Cox or logistic regression analyses for each International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision category, controlling for use of non-glucocorticoid-containing inhalants, and confirmed results by addressing confounding by treatment indication using propensity score.

Measurements and Main Results

Offspring median age at end of follow-up was 6.1 (range, 3.6–8.9) years. Glucocorticoid inhalation was not associated with offspring disease risk in most categories, except for offspring endocrine, metabolic, and nutritional disorders (hazard ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–2.99). When repeating analyses with the major subgroup that used budesonide only, association estimates were of similar magnitude.

Conclusions

Regarding most disease categories, data are reassuring, supporting the use of inhaled glucocorticoids during pregnancy. In line with animal data, glucocorticoid inhalation during pregnancy may be a risk factor for offspring endocrine and metabolic disturbances, which should be considered further.

### Treating asthma and comorbid allergic rhinitis in pregnancy [^117Dijwu]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Women with severe or uncontrolled asthma are at higher risk for pregnancy complications and adverse fetal outcomes than women with well-controlled asthma. Recent evidence-based guidelines have concluded that it is safer for pregnant women with asthma to be treated pharmacologically than to continue to have asthma symptoms and exacerbations. According to the Asthma and Pregnancy Working Group (APWG) of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program, optimal treatment of asthma during pregnancy includes treatment of comorbid allergic rhinitis (AR), which can trigger or aggravate asthma symptoms. In general, treatment of both asthma and AR during pregnancy should follow the same stepwise approach that is used in the general population. This article presents the specific recommendations from the most recent APWG report and from other systematic reviews about which asthma and allergic rhinitis drugs should be preferred during pregnancy. Of the corticosteroids, budesonide has the most data and is listed as Pregnancy Category B (no evidence of risk in humans). Other inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids have less data and are listed as Pregnancy Category C but may be continued during pregnancy if the patient's asthma was well controlled with the medication before pregnancy. Family physicians should help their patients control allergic rhinitis and asthma during pregnancy, encouraging adherence to needed medications.

### Addressing gaps in asthma management during childbearing age and pregnancy: insights from a survey of Italian physicians and patients [^111n1jo1]. The Journal of Asthma (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common condition among women of childbearing age, requiring careful management, particularly during pregnancy. Despite existing guidelines, significant gaps remain in asthma management during pregnancy, notably for women with moderate-to-severe asthma.

Aim

This study aimed to explore the awareness, limitations, and challenges of asthma management during childbearing age and pregnancy from both asthmatic women (AW) and physician perspectives in Italy. Additionally, it sought to identify unmet needs and collect real-life experiences from Italian centers specialized in severe asthma care.

Methods

An anonymous online survey was disseminated through scientific networks and patient associations. Separate questionnaires were developed for doctors and AW by a task force of specialists.

Results

76 doctors and 54 AW completed the survey, with 70% of AW reporting moderate-to-severe asthma. While most physicians had experience managing asthma in pregnancy, 40% lacked systematic collaboration with gynecologists recognizing the need for integrated care. Despite guidelines supporting asthma medication continuity, 60% of doctors reported discontinuing treatments due to perceived risks. However, surveyed AW generally expressed greater confidence in medication safety. Physicians and AW highlighted the lack of pre-pregnancy counseling, with 55% of AW reporting they had never discussed pregnancy plans when starting asthma treatment. Both groups emphasized the need for improved interdisciplinary collaboration and structured asthma care pathways during pregnancy.

Conclusions

This study reveals significant gaps in asthma management for women of childbearing age and during pregnancy, especially those with moderate-to-severe asthma. Improving outcomes requires better education for patients and healthcare providers, along with a structured multidisciplinary network.

### Interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy [^116XGnxo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is the most common respiratory disorder complicating pregnancy, and is associated with a range of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. There is strong evidence however, that the adequate control of asthma can improve health outcomes for mothers and their babies. Despite known risks of poorly controlled asthma during pregnancy, a large proportion of women have sub-optimal asthma control, due to concerns surrounding risks of pharmacological agents, and uncertainties regarding the effectiveness and safety of different management strategies.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic) for managing women's asthma in pregnancy on maternal and fetal/infant outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 June 2014) and the Cochrane Airways Group's Trials Register (4 June 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any intervention used to manage asthma in pregnancy, with placebo, no intervention, or an alternative intervention. We included pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (including combined interventions). Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion (but none were identified). Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion. We included multi-armed trials along with two-armed trials. We also included studies published as abstracts only.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

We included eight trials in this review, involving 1181 women and their babies. Overall we judged two trials to be at low risk of bias, two to be of unclear risk of bias, and four to be at moderate risk of bias. Five trials assessed pharmacological agents, including inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone or budesonide), inhaled magnesium sulphate, intravenous theophylline, and inhaled beclomethasone verus oral theophylline. Three trials assessed non-pharmacological interventions, including a fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)-based algorithm versus a clinical guideline-based algorithm to adjust inhaled corticosteroid therapy, a pharmacist-led multi-disciplinary approach to management versus standard care, and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) versus sham training. The eight included trials were assessed under seven separate comparisons. Pharmacological interventionsPrimary outcomes: one trial suggested that inhaled magnesium sulphate in addition to usual treatment could reduce exacerbation frequency in acute asthma (mean difference (MD) -2.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.21 to -2.39; 60 women). One trial assessing the addition of intravenous theophylline to standard care in acute asthma did not report on exacerbations (65 women). No clear difference was shown in the risk of exacerbations with the use of inhaled beclomethasone in addition to usual treatment for maintenance therapy in one trial (risk ratio (RR) 0.36; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.05; 60 women); a second trial also showed no difference, however data were not clearly reported to allow inclusion in a meta-analysis. No difference was shown when inhaled beclomethasone was compared with oral theophylline for maintenance therapy (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.33; one trial, 385 women). None of these trials reported on neonatal intensive care admissions.

Secondary Outcomes

inhaled magnesium sulphate in acute asthma was shown to improve lung function measures (one trial, 60 women); intravenous theophylline in acute asthma was not associated with benefits (one trial, 65 women). No clear differences were seen with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to routine treatment in three trials (374 women). While inhaled beclomethasone, compared with oral theophylline, significantly reduced treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects in one trial (384 women), no other differences were observed, except for higher treatment adherence with theophylline. Four of the five trials did not report on adverse effects. Non-pharmacological interventionsPrimary outcomes: in one trial, the use of a FENO-based algorithm was shown to significantly reduce asthma exacerbations (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.90; 220 women); and a trend towards fewer neonatal hospitalisations was observed (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.02; 214 infants). No exacerbations occurred in one trial assessing pharmacist-led management; this approach did not reduce neonatal intensive care admissions (RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.27 to 8.32; 58 infants). One trial (64 women) assessing PMR did not report on exacerbations or neonatal intensive care admissions.

Secondary Outcomes

the use of a FENO-based algorithm to adjust therapy led to some improvements in quality of life scores, as well as more frequent use of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists, and less frequent use of short-acting β-agonists (one trial, 220 women). The FENO-based algorithm was associated with fewer infants with recurrent episodes of bronchiolitis in their first year of life, and a trend towards fewer episodes of croup for infants. Pharmacist-led management improved asthma control scores at six months (one trial, 60 women); PMR improved lung function and quality of life measures (one trial, 64 women). No other differences between comparisons were observed.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on eight included trials, of moderate quality overall, no firm conclusions about optimal interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy can be made. Five trials assessing pharmacological interventions did not provide clear evidence of benefits or harms to support or refute current practice. While inhaled magnesium sulphate for acute asthma was shown to reduce exacerbations, this was in one small trial of unclear quality, and thus this finding should be interpreted with caution. Three trials assessing non-pharmacological interventions provided some support for the use of such strategies, however were not powered to detect differences in important maternal and infant outcomes. While a FENO-based algorithm reduced exacerbations, the effects on perinatal outcomes were less certain, and thus widespread implementation is not yet appropriate. Similarly, though positive effects on asthma control were shown with PMR and pharmacist-led management, the evidence to date is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In view of the limited evidence base, further randomised trials are required to determine the most effective and safe interventions for asthma in pregnancy. Future trials must be sufficiently powered, and well-designed, to allow differences in important outcomes for mothers and babies to be detected. The impact on health services requires evaluation. Any further trials assessing pharmacological interventions should assess novel agents or those used in current practice. Encouragingly, at least five trials have been identified as planned or underway.

### Outcome of pregnancy in a randomized controlled study of patients with asthma exposed to budesonide [^1133SiV3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Budesonide is the only inhaled corticosteroid to be given a category B pregnancy rating by the US Food and Drug Administration, based on observational data from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry. However, data from large randomized controlled trials are lacking.

Objective

To compare pregnancy outcomes among patients with recent-onset mild-to-moderate persistent asthma receiving low-dose budesonide vs placebo.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 7241 patients aged 5 to 66 years with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma for less than 2 years and no previous regular corticosteroid therapy received once-daily budesonide or placebo via dry powder inhaler in addition to their usual asthma medication for 3 years. This trial was followed by a 2-year open-label treatment period. The daily dose of budesonide was 400 microg for adults. The study included 2473 females aged 15 to 50 years at randomization. Pregnancy was not an exclusion criterion (except for U.S. patients).

Results

Of 319 pregnancies reported, 313 were analyzed. Healthy children were delivered in 81% and 77% of all pregnancies in the budesonide and placebo groups, respectively. Of the 196 pregnancies reported by participants taking budesonide, 38 (19%) had adverse outcomes: 23 (12%) had miscarriages, 3 (2%) had congenital malformations, and 12 (6%) had other outcomes. Of the 117 pregnancies reported in the placebo group, 27 (23%) had adverse outcomes: 11 (9%) had miscarriages, 4 (3%) had congenital malformations, and 12 (10%) had other outcomes.

Conclusions

Treatment with low-dose inhaled budesonide in females with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma does not seem to affect the outcome of pregnancy.

### The effectiveness of non-pharmacological healthcare interventions for asthma management during pregnancy: a systematic review [^111LpLWv]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Many national and international bodies have developed guidelines for asthma management in pregnancy. They include the British Thoracic Society, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American College of Asthma and Allergy (ACAAI), National Asthma Council of Australia (NAC), and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). All these guidelines have emphasized the need to provide optimal therapy to maintain control of asthma throughout gestation for maternal health and quality of life as well as for normal fetal maturation. The Expert Panel Report of the Working Group on Asthma and Pregnancy – Updates in National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) – has recommended four critical components for managing asthma during pregnancy: (1) assessment and monitoring of asthma including objective measures of pulmonary function, (2) control of factors contributing to asthma severity, (3) patient education, and (4) a stepwise approach to pharmacological therapy. Asthma management during pregnancy requires close collaboration among obstetricians, primary care physicians, and asthma-care specialists. Better asthma control can be achieved if patients are involved in self-management, including self-monitoring of either symptoms or peak expiratory flow rates, maintaining regular contact with medical practitioners and following written asthma action plans.

While there are many published reviews of pharmacological asthma management in pregnant women, none has assessed the effectiveness of non-pharmacological healthcare interventions for optimizing asthma management in pregnant women. Most of the interventions in pregnant women have focused on the safety and efficacy of asthma medications in pregnant women. General practitioners (family physicians) have reported a lack of confidence and/or knowledge in managing deteriorating asthma in pregnancy, although having a good understanding of the safety of asthma medications during pregnancy. Despite being concerned about health outcomes, women are not well supported in managing asthma during pregnancy. Empirical evidence on interventions to optimize asthma management during pregnancy, targeting both pregnant women with asthma and their health professionals, is needed. The aim of this review was to identify non-pharmacological healthcare interventions for optimizing asthma management during pregnancy and examine their effects on maternal asthma symptoms and neonatal outcomes.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111AgSVM]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Pregnant women — pregnant women and women planning a pregnancy should be asked whether they have asthma so that appropriate advice about asthma management and medications can be given; if the clinical history is consistent with asthma and other diagnoses appear unlikely but the diagnosis of asthma is not confirmed on initial bronchodilator responsiveness testing, manage as asthma with ICS-containing treatment and postpone other diagnostic investigations until after delivery; during pregnancy, bronchial provocation testing is contraindicated, and it is not advisable to step down ICS-containing treatment.

### The effectiveness of non-pharmacological healthcare interventions for asthma management during pregnancy: a systematic review [^116oL5W7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Practice and research implications

A clinical algorithm for asthma management based on objective measures and asthma symptoms could potentially reduce asthma exacerbations during pregnancy. The goals of asthma management in pregnant women are the same as in non-pregnant patients, which are to control asthma symptoms, maximize lung function, minimize medication side effects and prevent asthma exacerbations. These goals need to be considered when designing interventions, in addition to pharmacological treatment, to improve health outcomes in pregnant women with asthma. The cost-effectiveness of interventions and satisfaction of patients and health professionals also need to be assessed before implementation of such interventions in clinical practice. Further evidence is needed from well-designed prospective controlled studies in pregnant women with asthma investigating the effectiveness of interventions that incorporate patient education, patient self-management and periodic follow-up with health professionals.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111QekpL]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Children 6–11 years Step 3 — preferred options, after checking inhaler technique and adherence and treating modifiable risk factors, are: increase ICS to medium dose plus as-needed SABA reliever (Evidence A); change to combination low-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA reliever (Evidence A); or switch to maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with a very low dose of ICS-formoterol (Evidence B). Evidence cited includes a large study of children aged 4–11 years in which combination ICS-LABA was non-inferior to the same dose of ICS alone for severe exacerbations with no difference in symptom control or reliever use, and a single study of MART with very low-dose budesonide-formoterol (100/6 metered dose, 80/4.5 mcg delivered dose for both maintenance and reliever) that showed a large reduction in exacerbations compared with the same dose of budesonide-formoterol plus SABA reliever or compared with higher-dose ICS; because individual children's responses vary, clinicians are advised to "try the other controller options above before considering Step 4 treatment".

### Psychosocial outcomes are related to asthma control and quality of life in pregnant women with asthma [^113eGF2b]. The Journal of Asthma (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the psychosocial impact and perceived teratogenic (fetal harm due to medication) risks of asthma treatment (inhaled/oral corticosteroids and β-agonist) during pregnancy.

Aims

To assess the perception of asthma control, quality of life (QoL), and perceived risks of therapy in pregnant women with asthma.

Methods

Pregnant women with asthma (n = 125) were recruited between 12 and 20 weeks gestation. QoL (generic: Short Form-12 Health Survey v1, and asthma specific: Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire-Marks (AQLQ-M)) and psychological variables were assessed using the Perceived Control of Asthma Questionnaire (PCAQ), the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, and the Six-Item Short-Form State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6). Women's perceptions of the teratogenic risks of asthma therapy were also assessed and analyzed for adherence to maintenance inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), poor asthma control, and QoL.

Results

Women reported good QoL (median AQLQ-M total score/maximum score = 0.88/10), moderate ability to deal with asthma symptoms (mean PCAQ score = 42.6/55), positive beliefs about their asthma and low anxiety (median STAI score = 26.7/80). Perceived teratogenic risks for asthma drugs were excessive and class dependent. Women perceived there was a 42% teratogenic risk for oral corticosteroid, a 12% risk for ICSs, and a 5% risk with short-acting β-agonist. Illness beliefs, emotional response to illness (p = .030), age ≥ 30 years (p = .046), and maintenance ICS use (p = .045) were significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma, while maintenance ICS use (p = .023), illness beliefs, consequences (p = .044), timeline (p = .016), and emotional response (p = .015) and anxiety (p ≤ .0001) were significantly associated with reduced QoL.

Conclusions

In pregnancy, women with asthma experience good QoL but overestimate teratogenic risks of asthma medication. Maintenance ICS use, illness beliefs, and anxiety are associated with impaired QoL and asthma control.

### Exacerbations of asthma following step-up and step-down inhaled corticosteroid and long acting beta agonist therapy in the managing asthma in pregnancy study [^111jo8n5]. The Journal of Asthma (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Guidelines for asthma management contain a consensus recommendation that inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose should not be stepped down in pregnancy. However, this is not consistent with consumer preferences and pharmacological principles to minimize medication exposure during pregnancy. We investigated exacerbations after changes to ICS and long acting beta agonist (LABA) therapy in pregnant women with asthma.

Methods

Pregnant women (n = 220) were recruited to a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where maintenance treatment was adjusted monthly based on either symptoms (control group), or fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO, to alter ICS) and symptoms (to alter LABA, FeNO group). Exacerbations were monitored prospectively.

Results

ICS were used by 137 (62.3%) women at some time during pregnancy. ICS dose remained unchanged in 16 women (11.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 7–18%), increased in 37 women (27%, 95%CI 20–35%), decreased in 34 women (24.8%, 95%CI 18%-33%), or both increased and decreased in 50 women (36.5%, 95%CI 29–45%). Exacerbations occurred within 14days of ICS step-down in 11 women (13%, 95%CI 7.5%-22%). This was not significantly different from exacerbations occurring within 14days of step-up, in 7 women (8.1%, 95%CI 4%-16%, P = 0.294). There were no differences between management groups. Exacerbations occurred within 14days of step-down in 14.7% (95%CI 7%-30%) of women in the control group, and in 12% (95%CI 6%-24%) of women in the FENO group.

Conclusions

ICS step-down could be considered when eosinophilic inflammation or symptoms are low, and may be a useful management approach for women, doctors, and midwives wishing to minimize ICS exposure during pregnancy.

Regarding the use of levalbuterol tartrate INH (also known as Xopenex HFA) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. The use of β-2 agonists during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of fetal abnormalities. The 2025 GINA guidelines recommend treating acute exacerbations of asthma during pregnancy aggressively with a short-acting β-agonist, oxygen, and early administration of systemic corticosteroids.

### The breathing for life trial: a randomised controlled trial of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)-based management of asthma during pregnancy and its impact on perinatal outcomes and infant and childhood respiratory health [^116Gt7eq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment

Women randomised to the FENO-based management intervention will receive usual best care (as described above) plus monthly follow-up (three to six weekly) with the research nurse or midwife coinciding with their regular antenatal appointments, until delivery. Women without a written asthma action plan will be provided with one. At each visit, FENO will be measured using the portable NIOX MINO or NIOX VERO analyser (Aerocrine, Solna, Sweden), along with ECO measurement and spirometry. Asthma assessments will be conducted, including completion of the ACQ, a 7-item validated questionnaire which covers symptoms (6 items) and lung function (1 item), with scores > 1.5 indicating uncontrolled asthma. Results from the ACQ and FENO measurement will be entered into a predetermined algorithm (using an excel spreadsheet and/or specially-designed application for personal mobile devices), which will be used to assign any pharmaceutical treatment changes (Table 1). Starting at the first visit and every second visit thereafter, maintenance treatment changes will be made based on the results of this algorithm. When women are taking additional treatment for an exacerbation, no alterations will be made until they return to their maintenance dose. Women who self-report cigarette smoking in the previous week, or have ECO ≥ 10 ppm, will be considered current smokers for the purposes of applying the treatment algorithm. Required medication will be supplied by the hospital pharmacy at no cost to the participant. Asthma medications will be altered in a two-stage process: (i) assess FENO (eosinophilic inflammation) and adjust anti-inflammatory ICS; and (ii) assess symptoms and lung function (using the ACQ) and adjust long acting β 2 -agonists (LABA) (Table 1). When FENO is elevated (> 29 ppb in non-smokers), the ICS dose will be increased by one dose step. When FENO is low (< 19 ppb in non-smokers), the ICS dose will be decreased by one dose step. When FENO is in the mid-range (19–29 ppb for non-smokers), the ICS dose will not be changed. If the ACQ score is > 1.5, that is, uncontrolled asthma, LABA will be added. Women using ICS or ICS/LABA combinations will have a treatment recommendation provided as an equivalent dose of budesonide (Pulmicort) or budesonide/e-formoterol (Symbicort). Budesonide has a category A safety rating for use in pregnancy. Women will use salbutamol (category A), as needed, for reliever medication. Exacerbation management will not be part of the trial. However, subjects will be provided with the phone contact details of the study nurse or midwife, and, if requesting advice during exacerbations, will be recommended to attend their primary care practitioner, or attend an emergency department.

### Asthma medication regimens in pregnancy: longitudinal changes in asthma status [^111pR9gj]. American Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the impact of common asthma medication regimens on asthma symptoms, exacerbations, lung function, and inflammation during pregnancy.

Study Design

A total of 311 women with asthma were enrolled in a prospective pregnancy cohort. Asthma medication regimen was categorized into short-acting β agonist (SABA) alone, SABA+inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), SABA+ICS+long-acting β agonist (LABA), and no asthma medications (reference). We evaluated asthma control at enrollment (< 15 weeks' gestation) and its change into trimesters 2 and 3, including per cent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1second (%FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (%PEF), pulse oximetry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), asthma symptoms (asthma attacks/month, night symptoms/week), and severe exacerbations. Linear mixed models adjusted for site, age, race, annual income, gestational age, body mass index, and smoking, and propensity scores accounted for asthma control status at baseline.

Results

Women taking SABA+ICS and SABA+ICS+LABA had better first trimester %PEF (83.5% [75.7–91.3] and 84.6% [76.9–92.3], respectively) compared with women taking no asthma medications (72.7% [66.0–79.3]). Women taking SABA+ICS+LABA also experienced improvements in %FEV1 (+11.1%, p < 0.01) in the third trimester and FeNO in the second (-12.3 parts per billion [ppb], p < 0.01) and third (-11.0 ppb, p < 0.01) trimesters as compared with the trajectory of women taking no medications. SABA+ICS use was associated with increased odds of severe exacerbations in the first (odds ratio [OR]: 2.22 [1.10–4.46]) and second (OR: 3.15 [1.11–8.96]) trimesters, and SABA+ICS+LABA use in the second trimester (OR: 7.89 [2.75–21.47]). Women taking SABA alone were similar to those taking no medication.

Conclusion

Pregnant women taking SABA+ICS and SABA+ICS+LABA had better lung function in the first trimester. SABA+ICS+LABA was associated with improvements in lung function and inflammation across gestation. However, both the SABA+ICS and SABA+ICS+LABA groups had a higher risk of severe exacerbation during early to mid-pregnancy.

Key Points

· Medication regimens may affect perinatal asthma control. · Intensive regimens improved lung function/inflammation. · Women on intensive regimens had more acute asthma events.

### Relative perinatal safety of salmeterol vs formoterol and fluticasone vs budesonide use during pregnancy [^1113g7zB]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Recent asthma guidelines endorse the safety of long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) and of mild and moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) when required to control asthma during pregnancy, yet do not state a preferred medication within each class.

Objective

To estimate the relative perinatal safety with the use of salmeterol and formoterol (LABAs) and that of fluticasone and budesonide (ICSs) during pregnancy.

Methods

A subcohort of pregnancies from asthmatic women was selected from health care administrative databases of Quebec, Canada. Low birth weight (LBW) was defined as weight less than 2,500 g, preterm birth (PB) as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, and small for gestational age (SGA) as a birth weight below the 10th percentile. The effect of treatment with salmeterol vs formoterol and fluticasone vs budesonide on the outcomes was determined with generalized estimating equation models.

Results

The LABA and ICS subcohorts were composed of 547 (385 salmeterol and 162 formoterol users) and 3,798 (3,190 fluticasone and 608 budesonide users) pregnancies, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed for LBW (odds ratio [OR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44–1.88), PB (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.56–2.23), and SGA (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.67–2.02) newborns between women exposed to salmeterol vs formoterol or between women exposed to fluticasone vs budesonide (LBW: OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.76–1.52; PB: OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.78–1.49; and SGA, OR: 1.10; 95% CI, 0.85–1.44).

Conclusion

This study does not provide evidence of greater perinatal safety for one LABA or one ICS over the other.

### Evidence-based selection of inhaled corticosteroid for treatment of chronic asthma [^113T3HQ2]. The Journal of Asthma (2007). Low credibility.

Published literature relevant to comparison of various inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) was reviewed. Marked heterogeneity was found in the reported results. The efficacy and side effects of ICSs depend on their formulation, dosing and device used, and the subjects' age, severity of asthma, and inhaler technique. All these factors have not been included uniformly in most study designs. Notwithstanding this limitation, it appears that fluticasone is generally very effective and safe in low-to-medium doses and may be used for most patients. Budesonide is the only Pregnancy Category B ICSs, all others being Category C, and it is available as nebulizer suspension suitable for use in children over 6 months of age. Budesonide, also available as dry powder inhaler, and beclomethasone, available as metered-dose inhaler, are equal in efficacy, and side effects and may be chosen according to the patient's ability to handle the device. Flunisolide causes fewer side effects but is also relatively less effective. Triamcinolone is generally less effective and causes more side effects than most of the other ICSs. Mometasone may be preferred if once-daily dosing is desired. Ciclesonide has been found highly effective in once-daily dose and without side effects even in high doses. Further studies comparing it with other ICSs over longer periods of use will determine its place in treatment of chronic asthma.

Asthma in pregnancy and breastfeeding

For recommendations on intrapartum care, see the.

Pregnancy

People with asthma should have an asthma review during early pregnancy and in the postpartum period. Emphasise the importance and safety of maintaining good control of asthma during pregnancy and of continuing asthma medicines to avoid problems for themselves and their baby. [BTS/SIGN 2019]

Advise anyone who is pregnant and who smokes about the dangers for themselves and their babies and give appropriate support to stop smoking. See thefor more information. [BTS/SIGN 2019]

Advise using the following medicines as normal during pregnancy:

short-acting and long-acting beta 2 agonists
inhaled corticosteroids
oral theophyllines. [BTS/SIGN 2019]

Offer oral corticosteroids during pregnancy if needed to treat exacerbations of asthma. Advise that the benefits of treatment with oral corticosteroids outweigh the risks. [BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

If leukotriene receptor antagonists or long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists are needed to achieve asthma control, they should not be stopped during pregnancy. [BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^114hLwH7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Adolescents and adults with mild persistent asthma (age 12 years and older) — the Expert Panel conditionally recommends two Step 2 options: either daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for quick relief or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly, with a conditional recommendation and moderate certainty of evidence. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly; the recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years, and the Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence. For implementation, individuals aged 12 years and older with a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy and regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred; one studied approach is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed, administered sequentially in two separate inhalers. Individuals can initiate intermittent therapy at home but should receive regular follow-up, and clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations, with side effects equally infrequent; shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

### Management of critical asthma syndrome during pregnancy [^113CPtAu]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

One-third of pregnant asthmatics experience a worsening of their asthma that may progress to a critical asthma syndrome (CAS) that includes status asthmaticus (SA) and near-fatal asthma (NFA). Patients with severe asthma before pregnancy may experience more exacerbations, especially during late pregnancy. Prevention of the CAS includes excellent asthma control involving targeted early and regular medical care of the pregnant asthmatic, together with medication compliance. Spontaneous abortion risk is higher in pregnant women with uncontrolled asthma than in non-asthmatics. Should CAS occur during pregnancy, aggressive bronchodilator therapy, montelukast, and systemic corticosteroids can be used in the context of respiratory monitoring, preferably in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Systemic epinephrine should be avoided due to potential teratogenic side-effects and placental/uterine vasoconstriction. Non-invasive ventilation has been used in some cases. Intratracheal intubation can be hazardous and rapid-sequence intubation by an experienced physician is recommended. Mechanical ventilation parameters are adjusted based on changes to respiratory mechanics in the pregnant patient. An inhaled helium-oxygen gas admixture may promote laminar airflow and improve gas exchange. Permissive hypercapnea is controversial, but may be unavoidable. Sedation with propofol which itself has bronchodilating properties is preferred to benzodiazepines. Case reports delineating good outcomes for both mother and fetus despite intubation for SA suggest that multidisciplinary ICU care of the pregnant asthmatic with critical asthma are feasible especially if hypoxemia is avoided.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114nrzF9]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to adjustment of treatment, stepping up, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to step up treatment with the following adjustment options when asthma remains uncontrolled despite good adherence and inhaler technique:

|Situation|Guidance|
|-|-|
|Day-to-day adjustment using an anti-inflammatory reliever|- Adjusting the number of as-needed doses of ICS-formoterol from day to day according to symptoms (by the patient), if the reliever inhaler is budesonide-formoterol or beclometasone-formoterol (with or without maintenance ICS-formoterol)|
|Short-term step up (for 1–2 weeks)|- Increasing the dose of maintenance ICS for 1–2 weeks (by the patient according to the written asthma action plan or by the healthcare provider), for example, during viral infections or seasonal allergen exposure|
|Sustained step up (for at least 2–3 months)|- Increasing the low dose of maintenance ICS to medium when the symptoms are confirmed to be due to asthma, inhaler technique and adherence are satisfactory, and modifiable risk factors such as smoking have been addressed. Reduce the dose to the previous level if there is no response after 2–3 months, and consider offering alternative treatments or referring to a specialist center.|

Managing asthma symptoms during labor and delivery is also important, and guidelines advise women to continue with their usual asthma medications during this time. Asthma symptoms occur in ~10% of deliveries, and a cesarean section may be required if an acute exacerbation occurs. Neonatal hypoglycemia is also a risk, especially if the woman takes high doses of beta-agonists in the 48 h before birth or if the baby is premature. Oxytocin is the preferred drug to induce labor where necessary. However, although this is a rare event, there is evidence from a small number of case studies that oxytocin can cause anaphylaxis in women with asthma.

Author guidance:
Inform pregnant patients of the detrimental effects of poorly controlled maternal asthma for their baby, both during pregnancy and after.
Validate concerns using motivational communication and encourage pregnant patients to keep taking their asthma medication(s) as usual. The benefits of good symptom control outweigh the risks.
As asthma symptoms may worsen or improve during pregnancy, instruct pregnant women on how to adjust their medication(s) appropriately and have an action plan for the management of exacerbations during pregnancy and labor.
Inform pregnant women that although exacerbations during labor are rare, a cesarean section may be required in some instances if an exacerbation occurs.
Aspects of pregnancy can mimic asthma symptoms (e.g. breathlessness). Understanding differential diagnosis and how to assess it (e.g. using spirometry), could be useful when treating pregnant women with asthma.

### Trends in asthma self-management skills and inhaled corticosteroid use during pregnancy and postpartum from 2004 to 2017 [^113icu64]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Asthma exacerbations and medication non-adherence are significant clinical problems during pregnancy. While asthma self-management education is effective, the number of education sessions required to maximise asthma management knowledge and inhaler technique and whether improvements persist postpartum, are unknown. This paper describes how asthma knowledge, skills, and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use have changed over time.

Methods

Data were obtained from 3 cohorts of pregnant women with asthma recruited in Newcastle, Australia between 2004 and 2017 (N = 895). Medication use, adherence, knowledge, and inhaler technique were compared between cohorts. Changes in self-management knowledge/skills and women's perception of medication risk to the fetus were assessed in 685 women with 5 assessments during pregnancy, and 95 women who had a postpartum assessment.

Results

At study entry, 41%, 29%, and 38% of participants used ICS in the 2004, 2007, and 2013 cohorts, respectively (p = 0.017), with 40% non-adherence in each cohort. Self-management skills of pregnant women with asthma did not improve between 2004 and 2017 and possession of a written action plan remained low. Maximum improvements were reached by 3 sessions for medications knowledge and one session for inhaler technique, and were maintained postpartum. ICS adherence was maximally improved after one session, but not maintained postpartum. Perceived risk of asthma medications on the fetus was highest for corticosteroid-containing medication; and was significantly reduced following education.

Conclusions

There was a high prevalence of non-adherence and poor self-management skills in all cohorts. More awareness of the importance of optimal asthma management during pregnancy is warranted, since no improvements were observed over the past decade.

### Update in the treatment of asthma during pregnancy [^1131cU48]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most common potentially serious medical problem to complicate pregnancy. Recent reports suggest that 7 of every 100 pregnant women suffer from asthma during pregnancy. Asthmatic women have been shown to be at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy. This may be secondary to inadequately controlled asthma or perhaps the result of the effects of certain asthma medications taken during pregnancy. The choice to use a specific medication during pregnancy is based on available human and animal data. Much of the information currently available regarding the safety of various asthma medications during pregnancy comes from several large cohort studies. This article reviews the specific aspects of pharmacological therapy during pregnancy as provided in the recommendations of the joint ad hoc committee of the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. This article presents practical strategies for the management of asthma in our pregnant patients.

### The role of budesonide in adults and children with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma [^116Q37xX]. The Journal of Asthma (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma, a chronic and potentially life-threatening disease of the airways, affects patients of all ages. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the recommended first-line therapy for patients with persistent asthma. To review the clinical efficacy and tolerability data available on budesonide in the treatment of mild-to-moderate persistent asthma, a MEDLINE database search was performed for 1996–2003 using the following key words: budesonide, inhaled corticosteroid, efficacy, safety, systemic. When administered once or twice daily, budesonide effectively controls asthma in children, adolescents, and adults with mild-to-moderate asthma. Budesonide can be delivered effectively via a dry powder inhaler (Pulmicort Turbuhaler) in patients aged ≥ 6 years or as an inhalation suspension (Pulmicort Respules) in children as young as 12 months. With over 20 years' clinical exposure, budesonide has been demonstrated to be well tolerated in the treatment of chronic asthma in patients as young as 12 months. Specifically, at doses required to treat mild or moderate persistent asthma, budesonide does not affect hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, bone mineral density, cataract formation, or final adult height. As Pulmicort Turbuhaler, budesonide is the only ICS to achieve a Food and Drug Administration pregnancy category B rating. Early intervention with budesonide is recommended in asthma management: maximum benefit from therapy is reported in patients treated within 2 years of disease recognition. Budesonide is effective and well tolerated in the control of mild-to-moderate persistent asthma in patients aged 12 months and older. There is no evidence for variation in efficacy in population subgroups.

### Asthma controller therapy during pregnancy [^113RWTop]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to educate physicians on the safety of asthma controller use during pregnancy.

Study Design

A comprehensive literature search using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, and selected bibliographies identified human gestational studies of asthma controller medications from which maternal and fetal outcomes were obtained. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy category ratings were identified from product package inserts.

Results

Human gestational studies were identified for the inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) beclomethasone, budesonide, and triamcinolone and for cromolyn sodium, theophylline, and salmeterol. Human pregnancy data support an FDA Pregnancy Category B rating for budesonide. Pregnancy Category B ratings for cromolyn, nedocromil, montelukast, and zafirlukast are based primarily on safety in animal reproduction studies. ICSs other than budesonide, theophylline, zileuton, and long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists are Pregnancy Category C.

Conclusion

Human pregnancy data for many asthma controllers are lacking; nonetheless, data support a range of choices among medications rated Pregnancy Category B.
