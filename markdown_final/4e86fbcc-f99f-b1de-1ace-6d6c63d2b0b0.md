## Question

Sinus pressure, nonproductive cough and post nasal drip

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage sinus pressure, nonproductive cough, and postnasal drip. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and the differential. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology linking upper airway disease to cough. Next, I will review the diagnostic approach, including what to test and when to treat empirically. After that, I need to outline evidence-based treatment strategies and expected response. Finally, I should consider special populations, red flags, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking areas where evidence is weak or conflicting.

> Let me first confirm the leading diagnosis. The combination of sinus pressure, nonproductive cough, and postnasal drip is classic for upper airway cough syndrome, formerly called postnasal drip syndrome, which is one of the most common causes of chronic cough in adults and often coexists with rhinitis or rhinosinusitis, including allergic and nonallergic phenotypes [^a0f190c6] [^f33311ef] [^e0616d5c].

> Wait, let me verify the differential so I don't anchor prematurely. I need to consider allergic rhinitis, nonallergic rhinitis, acute or chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma or cough-variant asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and postinfectious cough, because these entities frequently overlap and can present with similar symptoms; importantly, UACS is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion and often lacks a single definitive test, so I should keep multiple pathways in mind [^e0616d5c] [^80e1563d] [^2a068fec].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology linking upper airway disease to cough. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that mucus dripping causes cough; direct irritation of upper airway cough receptors and neurogenic sensitization of the cough reflex are key mechanisms, with trigeminal and vagal afferents lowering the cough threshold, so even minimal lower airway stimuli can trigger coughing in susceptible patients with upper airway inflammation [^3fa018ca] [^a4d69c7d].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. Let me think about timing and severity: if symptoms are acute and mild, I can treat empirically; if chronic or refractory, I should confirm with targeted evaluation. I need to check for allergic features, sinus tenderness, dental pain, and red flags such as fever, weight loss, hemoptysis, or focal neurologic signs; in children, I should remember that UACS is less likely to be the sole driver of chronic cough and that pediatric-specific algorithms apply [^d6fd089c] [^f3a71de3].

> For chronic symptoms, I should confirm the basics: chest radiograph to exclude parenchymal disease, spirometry with bronchodilator response to screen for asthma, and consideration of FeNO or methacholine challenge if cough-variant asthma is suspected; I need to ensure I do not over-order sinus imaging, as it has low specificity in isolated chronic cough and should be reserved for refractory cases or when complications are suspected [^80e1563d] [^4a4e3e17].

> Let me consider empiric therapy as a diagnostic test. In adults with suspected UACS, a therapeutic trial of intranasal corticosteroids plus a second-generation antihistamine is reasonable; if cough improves, that supports UACS, and if not, I should pivot to asthma, GERD, or other causes. I should double-check that I'm not masking another diagnosis by using combination therapy too broadly, but this approach is guideline-supported for common causes of chronic cough [^80e1563d] [^f33311ef].

> Now, I should outline treatment by phenotype. For allergic rhinitis, intranasal corticosteroids are first-line and can be combined with a second-generation oral antihistamine or an intranasal antihistamine; allergen avoidance and, when appropriate, immunotherapy can be added. For nonallergic rhinitis, intranasal antihistamines or intranasal corticosteroids are options, and I should avoid first-generation antihistamines due to anticholinergic effects. For acute viral rhinosinusitis, supportive care with saline irrigation, analgesics, and short-term decongestants is appropriate, and antibiotics are not indicated unless bacterial criteria are met. For chronic rhinosinusitis, saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids are foundational, with macrolides or surgery reserved for selected cases [^f823565d] [^e9da02ca] [^1d7920a8] [^bf0c65fe].

> But wait, what if GERD is contributing? I should confirm that isolated PPI therapy is unlikely to help reflux-cough; instead, lifestyle measures, weight loss, head-of-bed elevation, and, in refractory cases, esophageal testing or surgical consultation are more aligned with evidence-based care, so I need to avoid reflex PPI prescriptions without a comprehensive reflux plan [^e1cddf51] [^20b8d513].

> I should double-check expected response to guide counseling. Many patients with UACS show cough improvement within 2 to 4 weeks of appropriate nasal therapy, and open-label data suggest that targeted rhinosinusitis treatment can reduce cough burden even when objective cough sensitivity does not change; this reinforces that symptom response is a valid clinical endpoint in this syndrome [^c79c16f1].

> Next, I should review special populations. In children, I need to ensure I do not over-attribute cough to postnasal drip; pediatric chronic cough algorithms emphasize wet versus dry cough and specific diagnoses, and UACS is less often the sole cause. In older adults, I should be cautious with decongestants and first-generation antihistamines due to cardiovascular and cognitive risks. In patients with Sjögren's or other autoimmune disease, I should actively consider UACS, GERD, and asthma after excluding parenchymal lung disease [^d6fd089c] [^f3a71de3] [^e9da02ca] [^82f82ea6].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags and when to escalate. Unilateral symptoms, severe facial pain, visual changes, proptosis, focal neurologic deficits, or persistent symptoms despite appropriate therapy warrant imaging and ENT referral; likewise, hemoptysis, weight loss, or night sweats should prompt chest imaging and evaluation for alternative diagnoses rather than persisting with empiric UACS therapy [^65d2b5d4] [^80e1563d].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Start with history and exam to classify likely phenotype, treat acute viral symptoms supportively, and for chronic cough pursue chest radiograph and spirometry; if UACS is suspected, trial intranasal corticosteroids with or without a second-generation antihistamine for 2 to 4 weeks, and if cough persists, evaluate for asthma, GERD, and other causes using guideline-directed pathways; reserve sinus imaging for refractory cases or suspected complications, and coordinate ENT or allergy referral when indicated [^80e1563d] [^e0616d5c] [^1d7920a8].

> Finally, I need to ensure the patient understands that UACS is common, treatable, and often overlapping with other causes of cough; I should set expectations for a gradual response, reinforce adherence to nasal therapy and environmental controls, and plan follow-up to reassess symptom trajectory and adjust the diagnostic and therapeutic approach accordingly [^f33311ef] [^a0f190c6].

The most likely cause of sinus pressure, nonproductive cough, and postnasal drip is **upper airway cough syndrome (UACS)** [^a0f190c6] due to rhinitis or rhinosinusitis, often allergic or nonallergic, and sometimes postinfectious [^52c5ac32]. UACS is the **most common cause of chronic cough** [^e0616d5c] and is diagnosed clinically by symptom response to targeted therapy [^f33311ef]. First-line treatment is **intranasal corticosteroids** [^f823565d] with or without a second-generation antihistamine [^f823565d]; saline irrigation can help [^e9da02ca]. If cough persists, evaluate for asthma, GERD, or other causes [^80e1563d] [^e1cddf51].

---

## Pathophysiology

UACS arises from **upper airway inflammation** (allergic or nonallergic rhinitis, acute or chronic rhinosinusitis) that triggers cough via:

- **Direct irritation**: mucus contacting pharyngeal cough receptors [^a4d69c7d].
- **Neurogenic sensitization**: upper airway afferents lower the cough threshold, amplifying lower airway stimuli [^3fa018ca].
- **Postinfectious inflammation**: persistent upper airway inflammation after viral URIs [^52c5ac32].

---

## Clinical features

Typical features include:

| **Symptom** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Sinus pressure | Facial pain/pressure, often with nasal congestion [^7621a19e] |
| Nonproductive cough | Dry, irritating, worse at night or with positional changes [^notfound] |
| Postnasal drip | Sensation of mucus in throat, frequent throat clearing [^7e21cba7] |
| Associated symptoms | Nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, itchy nose/eyes, halitosis, reduced smell [^4436ca09] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

UACS is a **clinical diagnosis of exclusion** [^f33311ef]; no single test confirms it. Diagnosis is supported by:

- **History and exam**: consistent symptoms and signs (clear or mucopurulent discharge, cobblestone throat, nasal mucosal edema) [^b7a338c7].
- **Response to therapy**: cough improves with intranasal corticosteroids ± antihistamine [^c79c16f1].
- **Exclusion of other causes**: asthma, GERD, ACE inhibitor cough, malignancy [^80e1563d].

Routine sinus imaging is **not indicated** unless refractory or complicated disease is suspected [^4a4e3e17].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Other common causes of chronic cough to consider:

- **Asthma/cough-variant asthma**: wheeze, bronchodilator response, airway hyperresponsiveness [^2a068fec].
- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: heartburn, regurgitation, sour taste [^26286e11].
- **Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis**: sputum eosinophils, normal spirometry [^a3c05a99].
- **ACE inhibitor cough**: dry cough on ACE inhibitor [^2a068fec].
- **Malignancy**: red flags (hemoptysis, weight loss, smoking) [^b90c5202].

---

## Management

### First-line therapy

- **Intranasal corticosteroids**: fluticasone, mometasone, budesonide, or triamcinolone [^f823565d].
- **Second-generation antihistamines**: cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine, desloratadine [^f823565d].
- **Saline irrigation**: nasal saline rinses for symptom relief [^e9da02ca].

---

### Adjunctive measures

- **Allergen avoidance**: environmental controls for allergens [^f823565d].
- **Decongestants**: short-term topical oxymetazoline or oral pseudoephedrine (use cautiously) [^e9da02ca].
- **Treat underlying rhinosinusitis**: antibiotics only if bacterial infection is confirmed or strongly suspected [^1d7920a8].

---

## Prognosis

UACS-related cough typically **responds within 2–4 weeks** of appropriate therapy; persistent cough warrants re-evaluation for alternative or additional causes (asthma, GERD, ACE inhibitor use) [^80e1563d].

---

Sinus pressure, nonproductive cough, and postnasal drip most often reflect **UACS** from rhinitis/rhinosinusitis; confirm with symptom response to intranasal therapy and exclude other common causes if cough persists [^a0f190c6].

---

## References

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^3fa018ca]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Nasal afferent nerve regulation of the cough reflex — upper airway disease and trigeminal mechanisms — notes that rhinosinusitis and other upper airway conditions are common comorbidities in chronic cough, yet the reason is unclear and direct stimulation of the nasal mucosa does not initiate cough. Speculation that postnasal drip is responsible is tempered by considerable variance in its prevalence among chronic cough patients. An alternative explanation is a sensitizing effect of upper airway afferent nerves leading to enhanced cough responsiveness and coughing in a subset of individuals. This hypothetical mechanism assumes trigeminal afferent pathways lower the threshold of the central cough pattern generator to subsequent vagal afferent input so even innocuous or physiologic lower airway stimuli could promote coughing. Thus, cough reflex sensitivity is enhanced by upper airways disease and an additional lower airway trigger produces a presentation responsive to aggressive medical therapy targeting upper airway disease, and there is precedent in animals and in patients for enhanced cough sensitivity evoked by upper airway irritation.

### Cough and the common cold: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^52c5ac32]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature on cough and the common cold.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched through May 2004 for studies published in the English language since 1980 on human subjects using the medical subject heading terms "cough" and "common cold". Selected case series and prospective descriptive clinical trials were reviewed. Additional references from these studies that were pertinent to the topic were also reviewed.

Results

Based on extrapolation from epidemiologic data, the common cold is believed to be the single most common cause of acute cough. The most likely mechanism is the direct irritation of upper airway structures. It is also clear that viral infections of the upper respiratory tract that produce the common cold syndrome frequently produce a rhinosinusitis. In the setting of a cold, the presence of abnormalities seen on sinus roentgenograms or sinus CT scans are frequently due to the viral infection and are not diagnostic of bacterial sinus infection.

Conclusion

Cough due to the common cold is probably the most common cause of acute cough. In a significant subset of patients with "postinfectious" cough, the etiology is probably an inflammatory response triggered by a viral upper respiratory infection (ie, the common cold). The resultant subacute or chronic cough can be considered to be due to an upper airway cough syndrome, previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome. This process can be self-perpetuating unless interrupted with active treatment.

### Chronic upper airway cough syndrome secondary to rhinosinus diseases (previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome): ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^a0f190c6]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature on postnasal drip syndrome (PNDS)-induced cough and the various causes of PNDS. Hereafter, PNDS will be referred to as upper airway cough syndrome (UACS).

Methods

MEDLINE search (through May 2004) for studies published in the English language since 1980 on human subjects using the medical subject heading terms "cough", "causes of cough", "etiology of cough", "postnasal drip", "allergic rhinitis", "vasomotor rhinitis", and "chronic sinusitis". Case series and prospective descriptive clinical trials were selected for review. Also, any references from these studies that were pertinent to the topic were obtained.

Results

In multiple prospective, descriptive studies of adults, PNDS due to a variety of upper respiratory conditions has been shown either singly or in combination with other conditions, to be the most common cause of chronic cough. The symptoms and signs of PNDS are nonspecific, and a definitive diagnosis of PND-induced cough cannot be made from the medical history and physical examination findings alone. Furthermore, the absence of any of the usual clinical findings does not rule out a response to treatment that is usually effective for PND-induced cough. The differential diagnosis of PNDS-induced cough includes allergic rhinitis, perennial nonallergic rhinitis, postinfectious rhinitis, bacterial sinusitis, allergic fungal sinusitis, rhinitis due to anatomic abnormalities, rhinitis due to physical or chemical irritants, occupational rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa, and rhinitis of pregnancy. Because of a high prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), GERD may occasionally mimic PNDS. A crucial unanswered question is whether the conditions listed above actually produce cough through a final common pathway of PND or whether, in fact, in some circumstances they cause irritation or inflammation of upper airway structures that directly stimulate cough receptors and produce cough independently of or in addition to any associated PND.

Conclusion

PNDS (ie, UACS) secondary to a variety of rhinosinus conditions is the most common cause of chronic cough. Because it is unclear whether the mechanisms of cough are the PND itself or the direct irritation or inflammation of the cough receptors located in the upper airway, the guideline committee has decided that, pending further data that address this difficult question, the committee unanimously recommends that the term upper airway cough syndrome be used in preference to postnasal drip syndrome when discussing cough associated with upper airway conditions.

### Postnasal drip [^2f6fb7e5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Postnasal drip (PND) is a common symptom encountered when evaluating subjects with sinonasal disease; it may be present without sinonasal disease or as a symptom of laryngopharyngeal reflux. It is postulated that PND stems from dysfunction of normal mucus clearance mechanisms; however, there is no definitive evidence elucidating an exact pathophysiology. Compounding the uncertainties surrounding PND is the lack of an objective assessment tool. Instead, treating physicians must rely on subjective complaints and investigators utilize validated patient-reported outcome instruments, such as the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test, to determine treatment efficacy. This review seeks to discuss the current understanding of PND and evidence regarding effective treatment strategies.

### Upper airway cough syndrome [^f33311ef]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), formerly known as postnasal drip syndrome, is one of the most common causes of chronic cough. UACS, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux make up 90% of the cause of chronic cough. UACS is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion with no diagnostic testing or objective findings. UACS can be present with or without associated rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis. Treatment includes dual therapy with H1 receptor antihistamines and decongestants. Diagnosis is confirmed when therapeutic intervention results in symptom resolution.

### Overview of common causes of chronic cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^e0616d5c]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature on the most common causes of chronic cough.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched (through May 2004) for studies published in the English language since 1980 on human subjects using the medical subject heading terms "cough", "causes of cough", and "etiology of cough". Case series and prospective descriptive clinical trials were selected for review. Also obtained were any references from these studies that were pertinent to the topic

Results

Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) due to a variety of rhinosinus conditions, previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome, asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are the most common causes of chronic cough. Each of these diagnoses may be present alone or in combination and may be clinically silent apart from the cough itself.

Conclusion

In the absence of evidence for the presence of another disorder, an approach focused on detecting the presence of UACS, asthma, NAEB, or GERD, alone or in combination, is likely to have a far higher yield than routinely searching for relatively uncommon or obscure diagnoses.

### Acute and chronic cough [^d6fd089c]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Cough is a normal protective mechanism which occurs many times every day. Cough with a viral infection lasts up to 2 weeks in 70–80% of children. Cough present for more than 4 weeks may be due to a recognized specific cause or non specific and considered protracted bronchitis. Chronic cough in children is different to that in adults and rarely due to GE reflux, postnasal drip or asthma. Treatment addresses the specific cause and symptomatic treatment is rarely needed or effective.

---

### Taming chronic cough [^13e9ac5e]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the available evidence on treating chronic cough to relay a thoughtful, evidence-based approach for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched using the following keywords: cough, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, sinusitis, rhinitis (allergic, seasonal), postnasal drip, vocal cord dysfunction, lung disease (interstitial), bronchiectasis, and bronchoscopy.

Study Selection

Studies were selected based on their relevance to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough. Because of a lack of randomized prospective studies, nonrandomized and retrospective studies were considered, with their strengths and limitations noted.

Results

Few randomized controlled trials have addressed the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough. There are several prospective noncontrolled trials for adults with chronic cough that found a high percentage of cough resolution when using an approach that focused on the diagnosis and treatment of the most common causes: asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and upper airway cough syndrome. Preliminary studies in children support an approach that distinguishes between a wet and dry cough, as well as an in-depth investigation of any specific symptoms that point to an underlying chronic illness.

Conclusion

Allergists, as experts in treating upper airway and lower airway disorders, are uniquely poised to diagnose and treat chronic cough.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^2a068fec]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

How to make the diagnosis of asthma in other contexts — Patients presenting with persistent cough as the only respiratory symptom may have cough‑variant or cough predominant asthma, but common causes of an isolated non‑productive cough also include chronic upper airway cough syndrome (often called 'postnasal drip'), cough induced by angiotensin‑converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, gastroesophageal reflux, chronic sinusitis, post‑infectious cough, inducible laryngeal obstruction, and eosinophilic bronchitis. In cough variant asthma, a persistent cough is the only symptom, or, in cough predominant asthma, the most prominent symptom, and the cough may be worse at night or with exercise, and in some patients it is productive. Spirometry is usually normal, and the only abnormality in lung function may be airway hyperresponsiveness.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^914b0444]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting > 3 weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no > 8 weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, thus ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

Methods

Recommendations for this section of the guideline were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

Results

The pathogenesis of the postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to the extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, this is often associated with the accumulation of an excessive amount of mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known. Except for bacterial sinusitis or early on in a B pertussis infection, therapy with antibiotics has no role, as the cause is not bacterial infection. The use of inhaled ipratropium may be helpful. Other causes of postinfectious cough are persistent inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses, which leads to an upper airway cough syndrome (previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome), and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which may be a complication of the vigorous coughing. One type of postinfectious cough that is particularly virulent is that caused by B pertussis infection. When the cough is accompanied by paroxysms of coughing, posttussive vomiting, and/or an inspiratory whooping sound, the diagnosis of a B pertussis infection should be made unless another diagnosis is proven. This infection is highly contagious but responds to antibiotic coverage with an oral macrolide when administered early in the course of the disease. A safe and effective vaccine to prevent B pertussis is now available for adults as well as children. It is recommended according to CDC guidelines.

Conclusions

In patients who have a cough lasting from 3 to 8 weeks with normal chest radiograph findings, consider the diagnosis of postinfectious cough. In most patients, a specific etiologic agent will not be identified, and empiric therapy may be helpful. A high degree of suspicion for cough due to B pertussis infection will lead to earlier diagnosis, patient isolation, and antibiotic treatment.

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^accc7003]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Case description features for unexplained chronic cough — UCC was identified as either refractory to empiric treatment trials or as unable to be assigned an etiology, with example descriptions including chronic cough that had persisted despite medical treatment according to the anatomic diagnostic protocol; cough and symptoms suggesting asthma but with normal lung function; a history consistent with postviral vagal neuropathy with a daily, dry, nonproductive cough of 6 months' duration precipitated by a throat tickle, dry sensation, laughter, or speaking (with most patients having a readily identifiable antecedent upper respiratory tract infection); and chronic cough for which GERD and postnasal drip syndrome (PNDS) had been excluded.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^a4d69c7d]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Cough initiated from the pharynx — human studies show that fluid infusion or air-puff stimulation of the pharynx in awake or anesthetized subjects can initiate coughing or the urge to cough under certain circumstances, mediated by afferents of vagal, glossopharyngeal, or trigeminal origin; mechanical stimuli (including postnasal drip or a water bolus) can evoke vigorous cough, whereas capsaicin applied selectively to the pharynx may be unable to initiate coughing.

### Postnasal drip and chronic cough: an open interventional study [^c79c16f1]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The postnasal drip (PND) syndrome is often linked as a cause of chronic cough although this is disputed.

Objectives

We examined the effect of specific topical treatment of rhinosinusitis on cough in patients presenting with a chronic cough associated with a postnasal drip or 'nasal catarrh'.

Methods

Patients presenting with a chronic cough and who complained of PND were enrolled and symptoms of PND and cough were assessed by questionnaire and by a capsaicin cough response. Rhinosinusitis was assessed by questionnaires, direct examination of the nose and by high-resolution computed tomography. In an open study, they were treated with fluticasone nasules, ipratropium bromide and azelastine nasal sprays for 28 days, after which they were re-assessed.

Results

Eighteen out of 21 patients completed the study. All patients reported having the presence of mucus in the throat. Mean cough score improved post-treatment (p < 0.05), but there was no significant change in capsaicin cough sensitivity or nasal catarrh questionnaire score. There was improvement in anterior nasal discharge symptom scores (p = 0.005) and in endoscopic nasal scores post-treatment (p < 0.01), with a tendency to improved PND scores.

Conclusion

In a pilot open 'real-life' study treatment targeted towards rhinosinusitis accompanying PND syndrome and chronic cough led to an improvement in cough. A randomised controlled study is now needed to confirm or refute these findings.

### A 65-year-old woman with intractable cough [^3ee2b698]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 65-year-old woman was referred for a second opinion regarding a 7-month history of a persistent, progressive, nonproductive cough. Her cough occurred several times a minute, causing a significant impact on her daily activities. She denied fever, chills, weight loss, chest pain, wheezing, symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, or postnasal drip. She was a never smoker with no history of asthma, allergies, sinus disease, or dermatitis. She had never taken an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Her medical history included rheumatoid arthritis, for which she was treated with methotrexate for 3 years. She denied any occupational or environmental exposures. She was previously treated with a short-acting β-agonist, inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β-agonist, montelukast, nasal steroids, a proton pump inhibitor, gabapentin, and azithromycin without relief. She also received codeine, which provided mild relief.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^2ea9a89c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) — history and physical examination for initial clinical diagnosis emphasizes that Key elements of the history in patients presenting with AR include seasonal, perennial or episodic, exposure-associated itching of the nose, palate, or eyes, sneezing, nasal congestion, sniffing, clear rhinorrhea, and postnasal drip. Children may only complain of malaise or fatigue, often associated with a cough, and the history must include specific questions about rhinorrhea and nasal and ocular itch in order to elicit these complaints. Symptoms of other sinonasal diseases such as sinusitis, vasomotor rhinitis, and granulomatous diseases can overlap with AR symptoms and should be differentiated from AR, and Less typical symptoms such as epistaxis, unilateral rhinorrhea, unilateral nasal blockage, severe headache, or anosmia suggest alternative diagnoses and should be investigated further. Viral upper respiratory infections may produce similar symptoms but tend to be of a shorter duration and often include other symptoms such as fever and myalgia. A family history of AR, asthma, or atopic dermatitis strengthens the diagnosis of AR in patients with compatible symptoms. Findings on physical examination that support the diagnosis of AR include several classic findings, such as clear rhinorrhea and pale pink or bluish swelling of the nasal turbinate mucosa, and Frequent throat clearing is often present as well, reflecting postnasal drip. Although definitive diagnosis depends on the finding of an IgE-mediated response to a specific allergen, detected through cutaneous or blood testing in most patients, it is reasonable to make an initial diagnosis and begin therapy based on the history and physical examination, and A good response to avoidance of suspected allergens or appropriate empiric therapy supports the diagnosis of AR and may preclude the need for further testing.

### Does post-nasal drip cause cough in childhood? [^f3a71de3]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

The proposition that post-nasal drip (PND) is a common cause of cough in childhood is controversial. The concept of PND as a common cause of cough is derived primarily from the adult literature. The definition of what constitutes PND is variable and it is unclear whether it is a symptom, a sign or both. Examination of the specificity of symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of PND syndrome further confuses the issue. A definitive diagnosis of cough induced by PND cannot be made from history and physical examination alone. The concept is inconsistent both with the meaning of the word 'drip' and the science of rheology. The most plausible explanation for the occurrence of cough in children identified with increased post-nasal secretions is that both reflect co-existent airways pathologies. In considering causes of chronic cough in childhood, it is now time to abandon the concept of PND and the associated PND syndrome.

### Occupational and environmental contributions to chronic cough in adults: chest expert panel report [^3bf4cfa5]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Allergy and chronic cough — two of the most common causes may both have an allergic nidus, including upper airway cough syndrome due to a variety of rhinosinus conditions (previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome) and asthma, and in a study by Irwin et al that prospectively examined the prevalence of the causes of cough in a group of 122 consecutive patients in a tertiary care center, 41% were diagnosed with postnasal drip syndrome and 24% were due to asthma, with stratified analysis showing that 23% were due to allergic rhinitis. Symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis include nasal obstruction, clear to yellow rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, and nasal pruritus with paroxysms of sneeze, with pertinent physical examination findings including pale, boggy nasal mucosa with clear to yellow rhinorrhea; symptoms may occur only seasonally or may occur perennially.

### Chronic cough and a normal chest X-ray-a simple systematic approach to exclude common causes before referral to secondary care: a retrospective cohort study [^b10fcf19]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Sixteen of the 17 patients with a diagnosis of upper airway-related cough (94%) had associated symptoms, although only four reported post-nasal drip. Other symptoms included nasal congestion, irritation and discharge, sneezing and hyposmia. Thirteen of the 17 were referred to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) clinic, of whom five subsequently had sinus computed tomography (CT). The diagnosis in four patients was made primarily on a response to nasal corticosteroids.

Two patients had subsequent diagnoses of malignancy: cancer of unknown primary involving the mediastinum, and metastatic prostate cancer. Both reported potentially concerning features on the first clinic visit (weight loss and previous prostate cancer, respectively) but had normal chest X-rays.

Of the 31 patients with UCC, 23 (74.2%) were female and the median age was 56 years (47–63), with symptoms for 12 (7–39) months at the first visit. This duration of symptoms was greater than in those given another diagnosis (6 (3–12) months, P < 0.001). The median number of clinic visits in UCC was 3 (2–5). There was significant improvement in 16 of these 31 patients between visits despite not taking trials of treatment and having had the cough for a median of 12 (7–24) months at the first visit (compared with 12 (5–14) months in non-improving UCC; P = 0.422). Symptoms were cyclical in six patients, of varying duration with no obvious underlying pattern.

### Chronic cough due to gastroesophageal reflux in adults: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^e1cddf51]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

We updated the 2006 ACCP clinical practice guidelines for management of reflux-cough syndrome.

Methods

Two population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) questions were addressed by systematic review: (1) Can therapy for gastroesophageal reflux improve or eliminate cough in adults with chronic and persistently troublesome cough? and (2) Are there minimal clinical criteria to guide practice in determining that chronic cough is likely to respond to therapy for gastroesophageal reflux?

Results

We found no high-quality studies pertinent to either question. From available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) addressing question #1, we concluded that (1) there was a strong placebo effect for cough improvement; (2) studies including diet modification and weight loss had better cough outcomes; (3) although lifestyle modifications and weight reduction may be beneficial in suspected reflux-cough syndrome, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) demonstrated no benefit when used in isolation; and (4) because of potential carryover effect, crossover studies using PPIs should be avoided. For question #2, we concluded from the available observational trials that (1) an algorithmic approach to management resolved chronic cough in 82% to 100% of instances; (2) cough variant asthma and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) (previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome) from rhinosinus conditions were the most commonly reported causes; and (3) the reported prevalence of reflux-cough syndrome varied widely.

Conclusions

The panelists (1) endorsed the use of a diagnostic/therapeutic algorithm addressing causes of common cough, including symptomatic reflux; (2) advised that although lifestyle modifications and weight reduction may be beneficial in suspected reflux-cough syndrome, PPIs demonstrated no benefit when used in isolation; and (3) suggested that physiological testing be reserved for refractory patients being considered for antireflux surgery or for those in whom there is strong clinical suspicion warranting diagnostic testing.

### An intranasal adjuvanted, recombinant influenza A / H5 vaccine primes against diverse H5N1 clades: a phase I trial [^d7af938b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 6
Solicited symptoms through 7 days after each intranasal vaccination.

All solicited events were mild or moderate. No reports of nosebleed, hearing difficulty, double vision, joint pain, ear ringing, slurred speech, eye swelling, chest tightness, or wheezing. Figure colors: immediate mild (light gray), immediate moderate (black), 7-day mild (pink), 7-day moderate (red).

Five related unsolicited adverse events within 1 h of vaccination were mild, including elevated diastolic blood pressure, toothache, sinus pain, and nasal discomfort (2 participants) (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). Two solicited events (mild cough and postnasal drip) began during the 7-day post-vaccination period and extended beyond it, qualifying as unsolicited events. All adverse events were self-limited. There were two other related unsolicited adverse events (cough and upper-airway cough) within the 28-day post-vaccination period, and none of the related unsolicited adverse events was medically attended. No adverse events after either intranasal vaccination were of severe or higher severity.

Laboratory abnormalities within seven days post-dose 1- and 14-days post-dose 2 were mostly mild (Grade 1) (Supplementary Tables 8 and 10). Two moderate abnormalities (Grade 2) occurred after the first intranasal vaccination with no severe or higher severity events. There were no moderate or greater severity adverse events after the second intranasal vaccination.

The licensed H5N1 IIV was also well tolerated with few solicited adverse events and no related unsolicited events. Two participants had unrelated Grade 3 low hemoglobin after H5N1 IIV vaccination, assessed as due to study phlebotomy. No other moderate or greater severity events occurred after H5N1 IIV vaccination (Supplementary Tables 10 and 11).

Throughout the trial there were no potentially immune-mediated medical conditions, new onset chronic medical conditions, or serious adverse events (Supplementary Table 12).

### The predicative clinical features associated with chronic cough that has a single underlying cause [^26286e11]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Few studies have investigated the usefulness of the clinical characteristics of cough in the diagnosis of chronic cough.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic value of clinical characteristics and concomitant symptoms of chronic cough in predicting its cause.

Methods

We recruited adult patients with chronic cough as a primary presenting symptom and identified those with a single underlying cause. Clinical features of cough were recorded with a custom-designed questionnaire and the relationships between clinical features and cause of cough were analyzed.

Results

A total of 1162 patients with a single underlying cause were enrolled. Nocturnal cough alone was a predictor of cough variant asthma (odds ratio [OR], 2.037; 95% CI, 1.003–4.139) with high specificity (97.6%) and low sensitivity (8.1%). Heartburn (OR, 2.671; 95% CI, 1.544–4.620), belching (OR, 2.536; 95% CI, 1.620–3.971), and acid regurgitation (OR, 2.043; 95% CI, 1.299–3.212) indicated gastroesophageal reflux-related cough with high specificity (85.5%-94.9%) and low sensitivity (22.8%-40.7%). Cough after meals had a high specificity (91.2%) and a low sensitivity (24.8%) for gastroesophageal reflux-related cough. Postnasal dripping (OR, 2.317; 95% CI, 1.425–3.767) and history of sinusitis (OR, 4.137; 95% CI, 2.483–6.892) were indicators for upper airway cough syndrome with high specificity (80.8% and 90.2%, respectively). Rhinitis/sinusitis-related symptoms showed moderate sensitivity (72.9%); however, they showed mild specificity (46.1%) for upper airway cough syndrome.

Conclusions

Cough timing, several concomitant symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux or rhinitis/sinusitis, and medical history are useful to indicate common causes of chronic cough.

### An uncommon etiological factor for aspiration pneumonitis caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea: a case report [^c7a78b28]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Meningoencephalocele occurs mainly in infants with a very low incidence and is extremely rare in adults. Zada et al. first reported a case about chronic aspiration-induced pneumonitis caused by spontaneous ethmoid sinus meningocele with CSF rhinorrhea, and indicated that increased diagnostic complexity associated with pulmonary complications led to unnecessary intervention and treatment delays. CSF rhinorrhea can be considered as a cause of chronic pneumonitis despite the lack of direct evidence. A controlled clinical trial has shown that sinonasal secretions can be transferred to the lungs whether in patients with cystic fibrosis or healthy subjects. In this case, meningoencephalocele is located in the lateral wall of sphenoidal sinus and leads to persistent CSF rhinorrhea. Endoscopic surgery can be an effective and a safe treatment option for resection of meningoencephalocele and skull base reconstruction. A rapid improvement of symptoms, abnormal imaging findings and inflammation markers caused by pneumonitis after endoscopic surgery also proves that spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with CSF rhinorrhea is a key factor to induce aspiration pneumonitis. However, the lesion could still progress further in the early postoperative period due to the persistence of the local inflammatory response caused by residence of components of CSF and the bacteria of nasal cavity and oropharynx along with CSF in the lungs. Continuous dry cough gives rise to raised intracranial pressure, which further increases flow of CSF and persistent aspiration. In addition, persistent cough caused by postnasal drip of CSF in the supine position may also cause reflux of gastric contents and increase the chance of aspiration. However, the direct evidence of aspiration pneumonitis caused by CSF rhinorrhea needs further clinical investigation.

Although uncommon, spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with CSF rhinorrhea is an etiological factor for macroaspiration. Timely endoscopic lesion resection and repair of skull base defect can effectively avoid large-volume aspiration and make aspiration pneumonitis less likely to occur.

Patient-reported symptoms and likely diagnosis — Allergic rhinitis (AR), nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), acute upper respiratory tract infection, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyps, and CRS with nasal polyps — are contrasted by frequency descriptors. Rhinorrhea/sniffing in AR is described as very common with clear watery discharge, whereas NAR is common but less than AR overall; in acute infection it is common and may be clear to purulent and watery to mucoid with crusts; and in CRS (with or without nasal polyps) it is common and clear to mucoid. Ocular pruritus/watery discharge/red eyes is very common in AR but uncommon in NAR and acute infection and very uncommon in CRS. Nasal congestion or blocked nose/mouth breathing is very common and persistent in AR and very common, chronic, almost universal in CRS with nasal polyps. Facial or sinus pain/pressure is very uncommon in AR yet common in acute infection and in CRS without nasal polyps. Postnasal drip is uncommon and persistent in AR but very common in NAR and common in acute infection and CRS without nasal polyps. Nasal/palate/ear itching is common in AR and very uncommon in NAR, acute infection, and CRS with or without nasal polyps. Snoring is uncommon and persistent in AR but common in the other listed conditions, and sleep disturbance/sleep apnea is common across all listed conditions. Frequencies are based on expert evidence and opinion and the table was developed based predominantly on expert opinion.

### Pediatric allergic rhinitis and comorbid disorders [^30d0f5bf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is rarely found in isolation and needs to be considered in the context of systemic allergic disease associated with numerous comorbid disorders, including asthma, chronic middle ear effusions, sinusitis, lymphoid hypertrophy with obstructive sleep apnea, disordered sleep, and consequent behavioral and educational effects. The coexistence of AR and asthma is complex. First, the diagnosis of asthma may be confounded by symptoms of cough caused by rhinitis and postnasal drip. This may lead to either inaccurate diagnosis of asthma or inappropriate assessment of asthma severity with over treatment of the patient. The term "cough variant rhinitis" is therefore proposed to describe rhinitis that manifests itself primarily as cough that results from postnasal drip. AR, however, also has a causal role in asthma; it appears both to be responsible for exacerbating asthma and to have a role in its pathogenesis. Postnasal drip with nasopharyngeal inflammation leads to a number of other conditions. Thus sinusitis is a frequent extension of rhinitis and is one of the most frequently missed diagnoses in children. Allergen exposure in the nasopharynx with release of histamine and other mediators can cause Eustachian tube obstruction possibly leading to middle ear effusions. Chronic allergic inflammation of the upper airway causes lymphoid hypertrophy with prominence of adenoidal and tonsillar tissue. This may be associated with poor appetite, poor growth, and obstructive sleep apnea. AR is therefore part of a spectrum of allergic disorders that can profoundly affect the well being and quality of life of a child. Prospective cohort studies are required to assess the disease burden caused by AR in childhood and to further assess the potential educational impairment that may result. Because AR is part of a systemic disease process, its management requires a coordinated approach rather than a fragmented, organ-based approach.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^11cd368d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

GERD-related cough

Beside asthma and postnasal drip, GERD has been confirmed to be one of the main three causes of chronic cough, accounting around 20% of cases. Chronic cough is defined as cough that persists for longer than 8 weeks. GERD should be investigated in patients who are not taking any cough-inducing medications, who are non-smokers or exposed to other environmental irritants and who have normal x-ray and no evidence of asthma or postnasal drip. The American College of Chest Physicians suggest that GERD-related cough typically occurs during daytime, in the upright position and is non-productive.

Irritation of the upper respiratory tract with or without microaspiration is reported as a possible mechanism, but this hypothesis remains controversial. Microaspiration may occur due to impairment of the protective reflexes or due to excessive challenges of pharyngeal reflexes. Several studies have reported ineffective esophageal peristalsis in patients with chronic cough with or without acid reflux, suggesting that poor esophageal clearance might be related to cough episodes. On the other hand, infusion of acid into the distal esophagus increases the frequency of coughing and cough reflex sensitivity. In a recent study, it was found that the proximal extent of reflux events is not important for provocation of cough. Both central and local reflexes are considered to induce cough. In addition, cough itself may promote reflux events. An increase in intra-abdominal pressure during cough episodes may provoke reflux events by overcoming lower esophageal sphincter basal pressure.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^29c44215]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis — history of rhinosinusitis identifies that acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is suspected in patients whose upper respiratory infection (URI) has persisted beyond 7 to 10 days or is worsening after initial improvement, and symptoms lasting 5 to 10 days are the most difficult to assess because they may reflect an ongoing viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or the beginning of a bacterial infection. In adults, prominent symptoms include nasal congestion, obstruction, anterior and/or posterior purulent rhinorrhea, and facial pain or pressure, and a history of persistent purulent rhinorrhea and facial pain appear to have some correlation with increased likelihood of bacterial disease; in children, symptoms often also include increased irritability, even more prolonged cough, and vomiting that occurs in association with gagging on mucus. In contrast to ABRS, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone and can be subdivided into CRSsNP and CRSwNP; patients with CRSwNP generally present with periodic exacerbations with increased facial pain or pressure and increased drainage, and fever is absent or low grade with persistence of some sinonasal symptoms between episodes that distinguishes CRS from recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS), in which the patient is asymptomatic between ABRS episodes.

Adult acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) — clinical diagnosis requires duration and symptom pattern: ARS is a clinical diagnosis made when a patient presents with more than 10 days and up to 4 weeks of a combination of 3 cardinal symptoms: purulent (not clear) nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both. Nasal obstruction without purulent nasal drainage is inconsistent with ARS, and similarly facial pain without purulent nasal drainage is inconsistent with ARS; the rationale for these 3 cardinal symptoms includes considering persistence for 10 days or longer or symptoms worsening after 5 days.

The following constitutes key background information on acute bacterial rhinosinusitis:

- **Definition**: ABRS, also known as acute sinusitis, is an inflammation of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses that lasts up to 4 weeks.
- **Pathophysiology**: ABRS is mostly caused by S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, and M. catarrhalis.
- **Disease course**: Nasal and paranasal infection results in ABRS, which causes clinical manifestations of nasal congestion and obstruction, purulent nasal discharge, facial pain or pressure, fever, fatigue, cough, hyposmia, ear pressure, headache, and halitosis. Disease progression may result in orbital and CNS complications.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: ABRS with ocular complications is associated with a 3.17% mortality rate.

5 CHRONIC COUGH

Accounting for an estimated 30 million clinical visits per year, chronic cough is a difficult diagnosis to elucidate. Etiologies for chronic cough range from upper airway disease, non‐asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, drug side effects, postnasal drip, and GERD. 31 The clinical question is whether in a specific patient the symptoms of chronic cough are induced by reflux. The presence of excessive reflux on pH monitoring or endoscopic signs of reflux esophagitis does not prove that reflux is a causative factor. To investigate causality, analysis of the temporal relationship between cough and reflux is required. Ambulatory manometry makes this possible as cough can be clearly identified on the tracing, allowing an assessment of the reflux‐cough sequence during prolonged reflux monitoring. Of course, this can also be done with acoustic cough markers, but correct and precise interpretation of the timing of cough episodes and reflux events is essential. For example, if a cough is immediately followed by reflux, cough is likely leading to the reflux (Figure 2). On the other hand, if the cough occurs a few seconds following the onset of the reflux event, the suggestion is that reflux induces the cough. That being said, the question lingers whether there truly is a need to record the cough events objectively if a patient already reports cough symptoms in a diary? Many argue yes, as symptom reports are a reflection of patient compliance and can be subject to bias and there can easily be a delay of 30 seconds to a minute between symptom occurrence and noting this in the diary. 32 For example, studies have demonstrated that pressure monitoring detects 70%‐90% more coughs than standard symptom report. 33, 34 In order to improve cough detection, therefore, ambulatory manometry has been incorporated with reflux testing to detect acute pressure changes associated with cough, eliminating the possible bias of patient self‐reporting and therefore improving accuracy. 35

### Postoperative exacerbated cough hypersensitivity syndrome induces dramatic respiratory alkalosis, lactatemia, and electrolyte imbalance [^4916f23a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cough, as a non-specific symptom of various pulmonary and extrapulmonary diseases, fulfills an important cleaning function of the airways in addition to mucociliary clearance, especially of macroscopic foreign bodies. According to international consensus, if symptoms persist longer than 8 weeks, the cough is considered chronic. The global prevalence lies around 10% but with noticeable regional differences (2–18%). In addition to known risk factors as continued nicotine consumption, female sex, or low socioeconomic status, the cause of chronic cough has often an underlying disease such as asthma, COPD, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, upper airway cough syndrome (formerly postnasal-drip) or eosinophilic bronchitis. If the etiology is unclear, the literature speaks of "chronic idiopathic cough" or "unexplained chronic cough". Nevertheless, it is imperative to differentiate cough hypersensitivity syndrome from these categories since its triggers are generally identifiable. In the context of a viral respiratory infection, sensitization and low-threshold activation of the cough reflex occur following harmless thermal, chemical, or physical irritation.

### Postnasal drip syndrome: a new definition and successful oral gargling treatment [^55d87512]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Many patients visit the rhinology clinic with complaints of postnasal drip (PND), a condition initially termed postnasal drip syndrome (PNDS) but today is known as upper airway cough syndrome (UACS). However, some patients complain only of discomfort caused by PND without cough and exhibit no definite endoscopic evidence of nasal secretions or PND. We investigated the correlation between endoscopic findings and symptoms and evaluate the effectiveness of oral gargling for PND patients without cough.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of PND patients who underwent oral gargling. Patients with PND as their only nasal symptom were included. Oral gargling was prescribed for all patients. Objective endoscopic examinations were also conducted. Discomfort caused by PND was assessed using questionnaires, specifically the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test22 (SNOT-22) score and the scores on the post-nasal drip symptom sheet (PNDSS).

Results

Oral gargling with normal saline for 12 weeks led to significant improvements in PNDS patients. The mean SNOT-22 score and the PNDSS score decreased significantly. However, no correlation was found between the endoscopic findings and either the SNOT-22 or PNDSS score. No severe complications were reported.

Conclusions

Oral gargling may be a safe and potentially effective treatment for PNDS. It could help dilute and remove mucus from the nasopharynx and oropharynx. We propose a new definition for PNDS: a sensation of PND without cough in the absence of any sinonasal disease, irrespective of endoscopic findings.

417. doi:
10. 1001/jamaoto.
2024. 5136 Postnasal drip is when mucus drips down from the back of the nose into the throat. Many things can cause postnasal drip, including allergies, pollution, certain foods, or changes in temperature. The mucus can have different colors and thicknesses. This depends on what is causing it. A common cause of postnasal drip is swelling of the inner lining of the nose. This is called rhinitis. Sometimes, this is caused by allergies. Discolored, bad-smelling postnasal drip can be caused by disease in the sinuses, called sinusitis. This is sometimes caused by an infection with a virus or bacteria. Sinusitis can be short term or long term. It can cause you to have a stuffy nose, thick mucus, facial pressure, and trouble smelling. Reflux of stomach acid can also cause swelling and mucus in the nose and throat. This adds to the feeling of postnasal drip.

Postnasal drip may also have other causes or be a result of a combination of issues. Mucus is normally made by the inner lining of the nose, sinuses, and throat. It protects these areas by keeping them wet and filtering the air we breathe. However, too much mucus or very thick mucus can feel uncomfortable. Sometimes, it can make it hard to swallow or make you feel like you need to swallow more frequently. Thick mucus in the throat can cause you to cough and clear your throat. When this happens at night, it can affect sleep. Postnasal drip can also cause sore throat. There are many treatments for postnasal drip. The choice of treatment depends on the cause. Flushing the nose with salt water or using medicated nasal sprays, such as steroid, antihistamine, or anticholinergic sprays, can make you feel better. There are also procedures that can be done in the doctor's office or in the operating room that can help.

These procedures work by shrinking some of the lining of nose or by removing nerves that increase mucus production. Allergy treatment with medication or allergy shots can be added if you have allergies.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis associated with chronic bronchitis in a five-year follow-up: the telemark study [^b37b8005]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

Chronic bronchitis was defined as the positive answer to all three questions, 1, "Do you usually cough up phlegm or have mucus in the lungs that is hard to get up? 2. Do you cough up or bring up phlegm in this way nearly every day for at least 3 months each year? 3. Have you had periods with similar symptoms for at least two consecutive years?.

EPOS guideline is a widely accepted consensus document. The EPOS guidelines have a validated definition of CRS for epidemiological studies used in this study. CRS was defined as the presence of two or more CRS cardinal symptoms for ≥ 12 weeks, of which one must be either nasal blockage/obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip), called "major symptom", and/or additional symptoms, such as facial pain/pressure and/or a reduction in or the loss of smell, called "minor symptom". All subjects giving a positive answer to at least two major symptoms and/or one major and one minor symptom were defined as having CRS. Clinical studies of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) recommend the performance of a clinical examination by a physician, including an endoscopic examination of the nose and a CT scan of the nose and sinuses. The specific questions defining CRS is seen in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2
Questions defining chronic rhinosinusitis

In a sub-analysis, we explored whether there was a relationship between the number of CRS cardinal symptoms reported and the likelihood of developing CB during the five-year observation period. Subjects who reported CRS cardinal symptoms without complying with the definition of CRS according to the EPOS criteria were categorised as "CRS-related symptoms" (for example, one or two minor symptoms). Subjects fulfilling the minimum criteria for CRS were categorised as " CRS " and, finally, subjects who reported more cardinal symptoms than the minimum criteria for CRS were categorised as "CRS+" (for example, two major and two minor symptoms).

Asthma was defined as a positive answer to the question "Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma by a physician?"

Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) definitions — diagnostic thresholds and subtypes are specified as follows: ARS involves up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal drainage with nasal obstruction, facial pain–pressure–fullness, or both, with discharge described as cloudy or colored and typical features of obstruction and facial pain detailed. A clinician should diagnose viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) when symptoms or signs are present less than 10 days and are not worsening. A clinician should diagnose acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) when symptoms or signs fail to improve within 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). Facial pain–pressure–fullness without purulent nasal discharge is insufficient to establish ARS.

### Assessment of intervention fidelity and recommendations for researchers conducting studies on the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough in the adult: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^68b1a1dc]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough — enactment of treatment and nonadherence/side effects data were limited: The average scores for patient ability to engage ranged from 0.00 to 1.00, and no study of any design specifically reported systematically assessing for or measuring patient ability to engage in interventions in daily life; among prospective observational studies, one noted a 23% relapse rate due to nonadherence, and another reported relapse of symptoms in six patients with postnasal drip syndrome and in one patient secondary to stopping GERD treatment, plus a patient who could not tolerate a proton pump inhibitor secondary to side effects; two studies reported systematically assessing for side effects, including one that reported 10% of patients having side effects with no patients dropping out, and one randomized controlled trial noting the occurrence of 57 adverse events with their modified protocol and 74 similar adverse events with their cited standard.

### Extraoesophageal manifestations of gastro-oesophageal reflux [^b6f5330d]. Gut (2005). Low credibility.

A variety of pulmonary and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) symptoms and disorders are considered to be extraoesophageal manifestations of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). These extraoesophageal manifestations include asthma, chronic cough, laryngeal disorders, and various ENT symptoms. Recent studies have established that GORD underlies or contributes to chronic sinusitis, chronic otitis media, paroxysmal laryngospasm, excessive throat phlegm, and postnasal drip. Traditionally, management of extraoesophageal GORD manifestations relies on prolonged empiric therapy with high doses of proton pump inhibitors (PPI), followed by pH monitoring under PPI in refractory cases. Recent studies found no benefit of empiric long term high dose PPI therapy. The diagnostic yield of endoscopy in extraoesophageal GORD manifestations seems higher than previously appreciated while pH monitoring under PPI therapy has a low yield. Based on these new findings, a new management algorithm can be proposed that uses short term empiric PPI therapy and GORD investigations off PPI. Well designed controlled studies evaluating the proposed management algorithms and treatment approaches in this area are urgently needed.

### Renal cell carcinoma metastases to the maxillary sinus [^62d65151]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to the head and neck region is rare. We report the case of a 65-year-old man with history of RCC, presented 7 years after nephrectomy, adrenalectomy and lung metastasectomy for his primary tumour, with symptoms of nasal obstruction, postnasal drip, productive cough and pressure sensation in the left maxillary sinus. CT revealed a unilateral, irregular opacification in the left maxillary sinus with bony erosion of the infraorbital canal wall. A yellow cystic lesion was completely removed from the maxillary sinus during functional endoscopic sinus surgery and histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of a metastatic RCC. Patient continued to be managed with his pre-existing treatment for advanced RCC.

### Allergic rhinitis: a review [^f823565d]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Allergic rhinitis affects an estimated 15% of the US population (approximately 50 million individuals) and is associated with the presence of asthma, eczema, chronic or recurrent sinusitis, cough, and both tension and migraine headaches.

Observations

Allergic rhinitis occurs when disruption of the epithelial barrier allows allergens to penetrate the mucosal epithelium of nasal passages, inducing a T-helper type 2 inflammatory response and production of allergen-specific IgE. Allergic rhinitis typically presents with symptoms of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, postnasal drainage, sneezing, and itching of the eyes, nose, and throat. In an international study, the most common symptoms of allergic rhinitis were rhinorrhea (90.38%) and nasal congestion (94.23%). Patients with nonallergic rhinitis present primarily with nasal congestion and postnasal drainage frequently associated with sinus pressure, ear plugging, muffled sounds and pain, and eustachian tube dysfunction that is less responsive to nasal corticosteroids. Patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis typically have physical examination findings of edematous and pale turbinates. Patients with perennial allergic rhinitis typically have erythematous and inflamed turbinates with serous secretions that appear similar to other forms of chronic rhinitis at physical examination. Patients with nonallergic rhinitis have negative test results for specific IgE aeroallergens. Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as symptoms occurring less than 4 consecutive days/week or less than 4 consecutive weeks/year. Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as symptoms occurring more often than 4 consecutive days/week and for more than 4 consecutive weeks/year. Patients with allergic rhinitis should avoid inciting allergens. In addition, first-line treatment for mild intermittent or mild persistent allergic rhinitis may include a second-generation H1 antihistamine (eg, cetirizine, fexofenadine, desloratadine, loratadine) or an intranasal antihistamine (eg, azelastine, olopatadine), whereas patients with persistent moderate to severe allergic rhinitis should be treated initially with an intranasal corticosteroid (eg, fluticasone, triamcinolone, budesonide, mometasone) either alone or in combination with an intranasal antihistamine. In contrast, first-line therapy for patients with nonallergic rhinitis consists of an intranasal antihistamine as monotherapy or in combination with an intranasal corticosteroid.

Conclusions and Relevance

Allergic rhinitis is associated with symptoms of nasal congestion, sneezing, and itching of the eyes, nose, and throat. Patients with allergic rhinitis should be instructed to avoid inciting allergens. Therapies include second-generation H1 antihistamines (eg, cetirizine, fexofenadine, desloratadine, loratadine), intranasal antihistamines (eg, azelastine, olopatadine), and intranasal corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone, triamcinolone, budesonide, mometasone) and should be selected based on the severity and frequency of symptoms and patient preference.

### Airway inflammation as an assessment of chronic nonproductive cough [^a3c05a99]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

The possibility that a bronchial inflammatory process could be involved with a chronic nonproductive cough without other potential causes such as postnasal drip syndrome, bronchial asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, or the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has not been clearly described. We investigated the possibility that a chronic nonproductive cough without other potential causes is associated with airway inflammation, and if this is so, what the relationship might be between this inflammation and the possible etiology of the cough.

Subjects

Twenty-five adults with chronic nonproductive cough as an isolated symptom over a 3-week period, and 5 healthy control subjects were studied.

Measurements and Results

Clinical assessments, cough scores, methacholine challenges, allergy skin prick tests, and bronchoscopies for bronchial biopsies were performed. In the bronchial biopsies, the patients were divided into the following two subgroups: 21 patients who were infiltrated with eosinophils vs the healthy control group (median, 12.0 vs. 0.0 cells/mm(2), respectively; p < 0.01); and 4 patients who were infiltrated with lymphocytes vs the healthy control group (median, 84.5 vs. 22.0 cells/mm(2), respectively; p < 0.01). With the methacholine challenge test, 5 of the 21 eosinophil-infiltrated patients received diagnoses of cough-variant asthma, and the other 16 patients received diagnoses of eosinophilic bronchitis. In the lymphocyte-infiltrated group, all four patients received diagnoses of lymphocytic bronchitis.

Conclusions

These results suggest that a chronic nonproductive cough as an isolated symptom is associated with airway inflammation due to eosinophil and lymphocyte infiltration. The causes of the chronic nonproductive cough were eosinophilic bronchitis, cough-variant asthma, and lymphocytic bronchitis.

### The challenge of objective confirmation of asthma diagnosis in primary care [^814da295]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

A 48-year-old woman with no smoking history reported cough and feeling short of breath with exertion beginning several months before her clinic visit. It was not clear whether she experienced any episodes of wheezing or chest tightness in association with her shortness of breath. She also reported longstanding nasal congestion and throat irritation, which are symptoms consistent with postnasal drip syndrome. She did not complain of chest pain or respiratory symptoms associated with nocturnal or early-morning awakening.

Her past medical history included eczema and a single episode of generalised hives. She reported sensitivities to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole as well as to metronidazole. Skin prick testing revealed positive responses to house dust mites. There was no family history of atopy or asthma. She did not report a history of cardiovascular illness. On physical examination, the blood pressure was 130/90 bilaterally, heart rate was 76 beats/min and regular, with a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min. Her body mass index was 32 kg/m 2. Air entry was equal bilaterally with no audible wheeze. There was mild nasal mucosal oedema and erythema without evidence of nasal polyps. Simple spirometry was carried out in the clinic for further assessment according to the American Thoracic Society Criteria. A chest X-ray and 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained at the initial visit were both normal.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^cb4b7b3d]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

URTI Symptoms

Sore throat associated with acute URTI is often accompanied by other troublesome upper respiratory tract symptoms, for example cough, post-nasal drip, swollen or tender neck glands, tickly throat, achiness and lack of energy. These can be assessed using the URTI questionnaire (Table 2). Schachtel et alobserved that significant numbers of patients treated with flurbiprofen lozenges, but not placebo, reported an absence of several URTI symptoms (achiness, pressure around the eyes, mouth breathing, lack of energy, tender neck glands, headache, loss of appetite, sinus pressure, coughing, chest tightness, or sinus pain) at 3 h post-dose compared to pretreatment (all p < 0.05). In particular, among patients reporting cough at baseline, 46% (11/24 patients) reported no coughing at 3 h (p = 0.01).

Burova et alalso demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of patients experiencing URTI symptoms with both flurbiprofen spray and lozenges. At 2 h post-dose, the number of patients experiencing URTI symptoms that can be attributed to or associated with sore throat (coughing, post-nasal drip, swollen neck glands, tender neck glands, throat tickle, and throat clearing) decreased relative to baseline. These decreases were statistically significant for every symptom, except tender neck glands (lozenge only; p = 0.0881) and throat tickle (both formulations; p = 0.3113 for spray and p = 0.2249 for lozenge). There was an 85% and 54% reduction in the number of patients with cough from baseline to 2 h with spray and lozenge, respectively.

### Risk factors for morbidity and death in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of CT diagnosed bronchiectatic patients [^e8c085df]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

The chest CT scan images of all these patients were re-assessed to confirm/exclude the presence of BX. CT scans were performed by one of the UZ Leuven respiratory radiologists or at other centers. Images obtained using 1 mm collimation at full inspiration were reviewed and BX was deemed to be present if there was one or more of the following criteria: a bronchoarterial ratio greater than 1, lack of tapering of the bronchi and visualization of bronchi within 1 cm of costal or paravertebral pleura or abutting the mediastinal pleura.

In the patients with BX confirmed on chest CT scan, clinical records were retrospectively reviewed and the following characteristics were noted: age, sex, weight, age at diagnosis, smoking history, BX diagnostic investigations that were performed and/or final diagnosis listed, current respiratory symptoms at diagnosis and outside an exacerbation (presence/absence of chronic cough, sternal pain, wheezing, hemoptysis or shortness of breath; total number of respiratory symptoms (1 to 5)), the number of exacerbations the first year after CT based diagnosis of BX (defined as the need for antibiotic treatment due to increased respiratory symptoms), presence of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD)(defined as presence of esophagitis on gastroscopy and/or an abnormal 24 hour pH monitoring), presence of sinusitis (defined as an abnormal sinus CT scan and/or suggestive symptoms such as postnasal drip, chronic (purulent) discharge from the nose or symptoms of pain or tenderness over one of the sinuses) and the presence of pulmonary hypertension (PH)(defined as a systolic pulmonary arterial pressure of ≥ 36 mmHg on echocardiography assuming normal right atrial pressure of 5 mmHg). All sputum culture results obtained during the study period were reviewed and bacteria found since the diagnosis of BX were registered even during an exacerbation. All patients underwent spirometry according to ATS criteria and the best results at diagnosis and outside an exacerbation were noted. Follow-up was by the different outpatient pulmonary clinics and depended on severity and stage of the underlying etiology and disease with a minimum of once per year. Standard follow-up at the NCFB outpatient clinic is once every three to four months.

### Clinical characteristics and drug utilisation patterns in patients with chronic cough: a retrospective cohort study using a Japanese claims database [^244c0579]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Variables of interest extracted from the Medi-scope® database

At the index month, information on the age and gender of participants and the size of the medical faculty where they were treated was extracted from the database. Since chronic cough can persist for many years despite appropriate treatments for underlying diseases, we investigated changes over time in documentation of diagnostic cough codes, underlying diseases potentially associated with the cough (henceforward called 'cough-related diseases') and medications potentially used for the management of chronic cough or cough-related diseases. In order to understand what types of medication could be provided to patients actively seeking treatments for cough, we determined the proportion of patients receiving cough-specific medications or medications for cough-related diseases and evaluated how these proportions varied across the post-index period.

Diagnostic cough codes were documented throughout the pre-index and post-index periods in order to evaluate their persistence over time using the same definitions as for the patient selection algorithm.

Information on cough-related diseases, such as emphysema, chronic rhinitis or GERD, were identified in the Medi-Scope® database from the relevant ICD-10 diagnostic codes. These codes are listed in Additional file 1: Table 1. The choice of cough-related disease codes was based on the most frequent types of cough-related disease/comorbidity identified in several Japanese observational studies and in the JRS practice guidelines. These were allergic rhinitis/nasal inflammation, GERD, paranasal sinusitis, chronic airway inflammatory disease, chronic rhinitis, postnasal drip, vocal cord dysfunction, emphysema and nasal polyps. Since participants could have more than one cough-related disease, these categories were not mutually exclusive. Information on cough-related diseases was extracted for three periods, namely the index month, during the entire 6-month pre-index period (including the index month) and during Months 10 to 12 of the post-index period. A 3-month time window (Months 10–12) was considered the minimum necessary to capture all disease-specific medical claims in insurance claims databases, as previously reported.

### Somatic cough syndrome (previously referred to as psychogenic cough) and tic cough (previously referred to as habit cough) in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^a8a9bf20]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Somatic cough syndrome and tic cough — diagnostic value of cough characteristics and psychiatric comorbidity is limited: these cough-associated presentations are "not sensitive screening findings for psychogenic or habit cough" and "these three findings lack specificity for the diagnoses of psychogenic or habit cough." Barking cough is "reported in other childhood conditions, such as tracheomalacia" and "a barking or honking cough can be due to a variety of diseases, such as bronchiectasis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and postnasal drip syndrome (ie, now referred to as upper airway cough syndrome)." For sleep-related features, cough from other diseases "is unlikely to occur once patients fall asleep," likely due to "the observed suppression effect that sleep has on cough." Regarding psychiatric symptoms, adult literature states "the mere presence of depression and/or anxiety in patients with chronic unexplained cough not be used to make a definitive diagnosis of a psychologic condition," and overall "based upon low-quality studies, little evidence exists to support how to define or diagnose psychogenic or habit cough."

### Hospital-acquired sinusitis is a common cause of fever of unknown origin in orotracheally intubated critically ill patients [^755d173c]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Bacteraemia with the same microorganism as that cultured from the sinus occurred in 12 patients; in five patients the microorganism causing bacteraemia was cultured only from the blood and the sinus, making sinusitis the most likely cause of bacteraemia. However, no definite conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn because bacteraemia can also lead to sinusitis, with bacterial colonisation of sinus fluids following bacteraemia.

Various mechanisms might explain the high incidence of sinusitis in ICU patients. The first is anatomical. The paranasal sinuses secrete mucus that flows to the natural ostia located posteriorly towards the nasopharynx; this flow can be blocked by infection, inflammation, anatomic abnormalities or the presence of foreign material such as nasotracheal intubation tubes. Even tubes with smaller diameters (such as nasogastric feeding and suction tubes) can cause significant obstruction in the normal flow of sinus fluids, leading to an increased risk of bacterial colonisation and development of hospital-acquired sinusitis. The presence of nasogastric tubes has been linked to a significant increase in the risk for sinusitis in mechanically ventilated patients (odds ratio 14.1, 95% confidence interval 1.7 to 117). Another important risk factor is the use of sedatives (odds ratio 15.9, 95% confidence interval 1.9 to 133.5). Underlying mechanisms may include the suppression of normal cleansing mechanisms such as coughing, sneezing and nose-blowing, because of sedation and analgesia; in addition, immobility precludes positional changes that improve mucous drainage under normal circumstances. Remaining in a recumbent position can increase nasal congestion and obstruction of the ostia of the maxillary sinuses. This problem may be compounded by the positive inspiratory and end-expiratory pressure in ventilated patients, which also induces an increase in central venous pressure. In addition, critically ill patients recovering from earlier episodes of sepsis may develop relative immune suppression, so-called immunoparalysis.

### Expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in chronic idiopathic cough [^c6874fb3]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Methods

Subjects

We studied patients with chronic cough of at least 8 weeks' duration referred to our cough clinic and excluded patients who had a diagnosis of asthma as a cause of their cough (Table 1). As a control group, we recruited normal volunteers through local advertisement; these normal volunteers had no previous history of cough or asthma, and were not suffering from any intercurrent illness.

Table 1
Patient characteristics

FEV 1: Forced expiratory volume in one second; FVC: Forced vital capacity; GORD: gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; NA: Not applicable; ND: Not done. Data shown as mean ± SEM. ✱ p < 0.05; p < 0.01.

Patients with chronic cough underwent diagnostic evaluation that included chest radiograph, pulmonary function test, methacholine challenge, 24-hour oesophageal pH-monitoring, and chest and sinus computed tomography. Patients with airway hyperresponsiveness (provocative concentration of methacholine that induced a > 20% decrease of forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV 1) [PC 20 - FEV 1] < 4 mg/ml), diurnal variation of peak expiratory flow (> 20%), or > 15% increase of FEV 1 after β-agonist, and also response of coughing to inhaled bronchodilator and corticosteroid therapy were diagnosed as having asthma responsible for chronic cough, and they were excluded from the study. The patients with chronic cough recruited to this study had a PC 20 FEV 1 > 8 mg/ml. Chronic cough due to gastro-oesophageal reflux was diagnosed by 24-hour oesophageal pH-monitoring and efficacy of 12-week course of proton-pump inhibitor, and dietary changes. Chronic cough was attributed to post-nasal drip/rhinosinusitis when symptoms and objective diagnosis of postnasal drip and/or rhinosinusitis were present and nasal corticosteroids and/or nasal anticholinergics were effective against cough. Some patients had no identifiable cause(s) of cough despite additional investigations including bronchoscopy and intensive therapeutic trials for asthma, gastro-esophageal reflux and postnasal drip/rhinosinusitis, and were labelled as 'idiopathic'. Only ex-smokers who have ceased smoking more than 12 months of enrolled were recruited.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our institution and all subjects gave informed consent to participate in the study.

### An uncommon etiological factor for aspiration pneumonitis caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea: a case report [^cb1eb5af]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 62-year-old female presented with 4 weeks of right-sided watery rhinorrhea. She reported spontaneous clear, salty nasal drainage without a history of trauma. Two weeks later, she developed a frequent dry cough caused by postnasal drip and gradually worsened especially when lying down, which prevented her from falling asleep. The patient underwent nasal cavity examination and computed tomography (CT) scan of sinuses after visiting department of otolaryngology, and we found a continuous flow of clear fluid to posterior pharyngeal wall (Fig. 1 a) and sinus CT showed the lesion tissue extending from the right middle cranial fossa into sphenoid sinus through a local bone defect in the lateral wall of the right sphenoid sinus (Fig. 1 b). Combined with measurement of glucose level in nasal secretions (4.4 mmol/L), the patient was initially diagnosed with spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele accompanied by CSF rhinorrhea, and she was admitted to department of otolaryngology -head and neck surgery on June 29, 2020.

### Retreatment of symptomatic chronic bronchitis with bronchial rheoplasty [^b285548b]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Case presentation

3 years ago, a male patient presented to our department with debilitating symptoms of CB. These were characterised by increased phlegm production (typically more than one tablespoon per day) and worsening of cough, restricting his daily activities and sleep.

He was a former smoker (10 pack-years), who stopped smoking about 30 years before. His medical history included prostatic hyperplasia, coxarthrosis, atopic dermatitis and ain youth.

The patient had suffered from recurrent episodes of bronchitis since childhood. Repeated antibiotic therapy and inhalation therapy were attempted but were not consistently effective to alleviate symptoms. Various consultations with a lung specialist and treatment trials with inhalers (ICS, BDs) were not successful at reduce the burden of disease. The patient did not have a diagnosis of COPD and no history of hospitalisations for acute respiratory diseases in the past. There was no history of gastro-oesophageal reflux, chronic rhinosinusitis, no asthma, no allergies and no evidence of postnasal drip syndrome. Furthermore, there was no evidence of wheezing, eosinophilia or seasonality of symptoms. Previous CT scans of the paranasal sinuses and a chest CT scan proved to be without pathological findings.

His medications included only doxazosine 4 mg two times per day. Moreover, he was vaccinated against influenza and pneumococci, but unvaccinated for COVID-19, as the vaccine was unavailable at the time of first presentation.

His initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 133/91 mm Hg, pulse rate of 63 beats/min, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 94% on ambient air and temperature of 37.8°C. His body mass index was 29.4 kg/m 2. His physical examination was unremarkable. An ECG showed regular sinus rhythm with no other abnormalities. Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas demonstrated the following results: pH of 7.47, pCO2 of 30 mm Hg, pO2 80 mm Hg. A current CT scan revealed unremarkable visualisation of the lung parenchyma, except for a small (2 mm), most likely postinflammatory round lesion in the right lung midfield.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^e9da02ca]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) supportive care and natural history note that acute VRS is estimated to occur from 2 to 5 times per year in the average adult, secondary bacterial infection is believed to complicate only 0.5% to 2.0% of these events, and symptoms typically peak within 3 days then decline and resolve within 10 to 14 days. Management is symptomatic: antibiotics are not recommended for treating VRS as antibiotics are ineffective for viral illness and do not provide direct symptom relief, and palliative medications — non-narcotic analgesics (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, acetaminophen), nasal saline, decongestants, antihistamines, mucolytics, cough suppressants, and topical or oral corticosteroids — may be used alone or in varying combinations for symptom relief. Acetaminophen may help relieve nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea but does not alleviate other viral symptoms, whereas nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents do not improve nasal discharge but improve malaise, sneezing, headache, and otalgia, and should be used with caution in older adults. Nasal saline may be palliative and cleansing with low risk of adverse reactions, with minor improvements in nasal symptom scores reported and a meta-analysis indicating that higher volume irrigations may be superior. For decongestants, in 2023 the FDA advisory committee discouraged the use of oral phenylephrine as a nasal decongestant; use of up to 3 to 5 days of topical oxymetazoline may be beneficial but clinicians should warn patients against paradoxical rebound congestion with use greater than 3 days; pseudoephedrine could be considered beyond this, although recent evidence is lacking and the patient should be counseled regarding contraindications of elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Commonly used antihistamines show no clinically significant effect on nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea or sneezing, and first-generation varieties should be avoided in older adults. While not supported by a large body of evidence, topical corticosteroids in VRS is an option for symptomatic relief, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 13 and greater effect with longer courses and higher doses. Diagnostic caveats include that nasal purulence alone does not indicate a bacterial infection.

Experts don't know how long it takes for symptoms to appear for other types of pneumococcal disease. Keep Reading: Types of pneumococcal disease Symptoms of pneumococcal disease depend on the part of the body that's infected. Generally, the symptoms are similar to other bacterial infections in that part of the body. Serious infections Pneumonia Symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia, a lung infection, include:

- Chest pain
- Cough
- Fever and chills
- Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing Older adults may experience confusion or low alertness, rather than the more common symptoms listed above.

Meningitis Symptoms of pneumococcal meningitis, an infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord, include:

- Confusion
- Fever
- Headache
- Photophobia
- Stiff neck In babies, meningitis may cause poor eating and drinking, low alertness, and vomiting. Bacteremia Symptoms of pneumococcal bacteremia, a bloodstream infection, include:

- Chills
- Fever
- Low alertness. Mild infections Ear infection Symptoms of ear infections include:

- A red, swollen ear drum
- Ear pain
- Fever
- **Sleepiness Sinus infection Symptoms of sinus infections include**:
- Bad breath
- Cough
- Facial pain or pressure
- Headache
- Post-nasal drip
- Runny or stuffy nose
- Sore throat. Complications When to seek medical care Serious infections can result in sepsis, long-term problems, or death.

Sepsis is a life-threatening emergency resulting from the body's extreme response to infection. Pneumonia Pneumonia can cause:

- Airway blockage, collapsed lungs, and lung abscesses
- Empyema
- Pericarditis Pneumococcal pneumonia kills about 1 in 20 people who get it. Minor infections Complications are rare and not usually severe for mild infections like ear and sinus infections.

### A 51-year-old woman with acute onset of facial pressure, rhinorrhea, and Tooth pain: review of acute rhinosinusitis [^dc209451]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is a common ailment accounting for millions of office visits annually, including that of Mrs D, a 51-year-old woman presenting with 5 days of upper respiratory illness and facial pain. Her case is used to review the diagnosis and treatment of acute rhinosinusitis. Acute viral rhinosinusitis can be difficult to distinguish from acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, especially during the first 10 days of symptoms. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines developed to guide diagnosis and treatment of acute viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis recommend that the diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis be based on the presence of "cardinal symptoms" of purulent rhinorrhea and either facial pressure or nasal obstruction of less than 4 weeks' duration. Antibiotic treatment generally can be withheld during the first 10 days of symptoms for mild to moderate cases, given the likelihood of acute viral rhinosinusitis or of spontaneously resolving acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. After 10 days, the likelihood of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis increases, and initiation of antibiotic therapy is supported by practice guidelines. Complications of sinusitis, though rare, can be serious and require early recognition and treatment.

### Roads to remission: evolving treatment concepts in type 2 inflammatory diseases [^29818aff]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps

Around 1–2% of adults have chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). This subgroup of CRS differs from the more common CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) by the presence of polyps (which are determined endoscopically). Although type 2 inflammation is present in most patients with CRSwNP, there is no association with allergies.CRSwNP is often associated with adult-onset eosinophilic asthma, and sometimes with NSAID-exacerbated airway disease (N-ERD) and/or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Typical symptoms of CRSwNP are nasal obstruction, reduction in (or even loss of) sense of smell, nasal discharge, and sleep disturbances. Disease burden of CRSwNP is high, given the major impairment in quality of life and high recurrence rates despite surgical treatment.

Disease control

Symptom control was the aim of CRSwNP treatment over decades, using intranasal and/or systemic corticosteroids and (often recurrent) endoscopic sinus surgery. Symptoms (such as rhinorrhoea, sneezing, nasal obstruction, reduction in sense of smell, headache, postnasal drip, fatigue, facial pain and pressure) are assessed using VAS scores (scales from 0, indicating total absence of symptoms, to 10, indicating worst symptoms). In addition, the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) is used in clinical practice, a validated 22-item questionnaire measuring disease-specific, health-related quality of life in patients with rhinosinusitis. In 2021, the European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy (EUFOREA) defined severe CRSwNP as bilateral CRSwNP with a nasal polyp score of at least 4 of 8 points and persistent symptoms, including loss of smell and/or taste, nasal obstruction, secretion and/or postnasal drip, and facial pain or pressure, with the need for add-on treatment to supplement intranasal corticosteroids. Uncontrolled CRSwNP was defined as persistent or recurring CRSwNP despite long-term treatment with intranasal corticosteroids and having received at least 1 course of systemic corticosteroids in the preceding 2 years and/or previous sino-nasal surgery(Table 2). A recent international consensus defined CRSwNP control as patient-reported disease control and the absence of clinically relevant sino-nasal symptoms (determined by VAS ≤ 5 cm for overall symptom severity, nasal obstruction, and loss of smell) within the last month.

To investigate the levels of neuropeptides found in nasal mucus of subjects with and without the complaint of chronic cough.

Methods

Preformed nasal mucus from 26 subjects complaining of postnasal drip with chronic cough and 17 without self-reported chronic cough was collected at the time of presentation. The nasal secretions were assayed for 3 neuropeptides-substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and Neurokinin A (NKA)-that have been previously linked to chronic cough.

Results

Coughing subjects with postnasal drip have significantly higher levels of CGRP and SP than noncoughing subjects with postnasal drip (69.0 ng vs 4.6 ng, P < .001 and 4.5 ng vs 3.4 ng, P = 0.004). The differences in NKA levels in nasal secretions between coughing and noncoughing subjects did not reach statistical significance (16.3 ng vs 3.4 ng, P = 0.067).

Conclusions

Both CGRP and SP levels are elevated in preformed nasal secretions of coughing subjects when compared with noncoughing subjects. Additional studies are needed to clarify whether CGRP and SP levels in preformed nasal secretions may assist in diagnosis or predicting treatment response in patients presenting with chronic cough.

### Chronic cough and a normal chest X-ray-a simple systematic approach to exclude common causes before referral to secondary care: a retrospective cohort study [^4a4e3e17]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The proportion of chronic cough attributed to rhinosinusitis in other series is highly variable, and the importance of ENT disease in chronic cough has been questioned. In keeping with this, our findings suggest that upper airway pathology is unlikely to be contributory in the absence of relevant symptoms. Imaging of the sinuses is likely to have low specificity in chronic coughand was not performed in our clinic.

Malignancy was the diagnosis in only two cases of chronic cough and normal chest X-ray, but assessment in the clinic led to early confirmatory investigations, prompted by features other than cough. This suggests that lung cancer is a rare diagnosis in patients with cough as the only symptom, a normal chest X-ray and no additional concerning features including smoking. Hence, CT is recommended in isolated chronic cough only after failure of other interventions.

True habit or psychogenic cough exists but appears to be rare in adults. Correspondingly, we encountered this diagnosis in only 1.1%. Post-infective coughs generally resolve in < 8 weeksbut can potentially last longer. We made this diagnosis where symptoms were self-limiting, particularly with a history of acute upper respiratory tract symptoms. The longest duration of post-infective cough was 5 months, although it could have perhaps been better classed as UCC. As seen here, chronic cough can resolve spontaneously, and it may have done so more frequently if no treatment had been given, again indicating the difficulty in making diagnoses for chronic cough based on responses to medication.

Ojoo et al. have also shown that the majority with chronic cough (72%) can be managed with minimum investigation. However, unlike in the current study, at least some of the treating physicians were experienced cough specialists, and patients were referred from secondary as well as primary care. Our findings therefore complement this other study, but they are more relevant to general practice. We are not aware of any other work that has attempted to identify baseline clinical characteristics of isolated chronic cough associated with a failure to respond to sequential empirical treatment trials.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as a chronic inflammatory disorder of the nose and paranasal sinuses. 1, 2 The clinical presentation consists of an impaired sense of smell, facial pain or pressure, postnasal drip, rhinorrhoea and/or nasal congestion for a consecutive period of at least 12 weeks. 1 CRS affects 10.9% of the European citizens according to population‐bases studies and is associated with a significant socioeconomic burden. 3, 4 CRS can be divided into two major subtypes: with (CRSwNP) or without (CRSsNP) nasal polyps. 5 Sinonasal type 2 inflammation is found in the majority of European CRSwNP patients. 6 Although CRS patients frequently report co‐morbidities such as asthma and allergic rhinitis, it is unclear if a causal relationship between atopy and CRS truly exists. 7, 8 In a study of almost 600 patients, more severe asthma was found to be associated with a more severe CRS with allergic sensitization and/or nasal polyps. 9

The cornerstone of CRS treatment includes saline rinsing and anti‐inflammatory treatment with prolonged topical or short‐course oral corticosteroids. 1 Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is recommended in case of failure of maximal pharmaceutical treatment. Nonetheless, a substantial percentage of CRS patients still experiences bothersome symptoms interfering with daily life despite standard pharmaceutical and surgical therapy. 10 According to EPOS guidelines, uncontrolled disease is defined by the presence of three or more of the following features: nasal blockage, anterior or posterior nasal secretions, facial pain, impaired sense of smell and sleep disturbance or fatigue; in addition to signs of diseased sinonasal mucosa and/or need of long‐term antibiotics or systemic corticosteroids in the past 1‐3 months. 1 Forty per cent of patients were found to be uncontrolled despite pharmaceutical and surgical treatment in a tertiary referral centre. 11

### Acute rhinosinusitis: rapid evidence review [^1d7920a8]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis causes more than 30 million patients to seek health care per year in the United States. Respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and sinusitis, account for 75% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. Sinusitis is a clinical diagnosis; the challenge lies in distinguishing between the symptoms of bacterial and viral sinusitis. Cardinal features of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are unilateral facial pain or pressure, fever greater than 102°F (39°C), and purulent nasal discharge with obstruction of the nasal passages. Antibiotics should be considered for patients with 3 or more days of severe symptoms, significant worsening after 3 to 5 days of symptoms, or 7 or more days of symptoms. Diagnostic testing for acute rhinosinusitis with antral puncture is impractical because of its invasiveness. Point-of-care testing for elevated C-reactive protein may be helpful, but it is not widely available. Studies have shown that amoxicillin is as effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for those without a beta-lactam allergy. For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, appropriate antibiotics include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone; clindamycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin is an option for children with non-type I hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics. Supportive care for rhinosinusitis, including use of saline irrigation, nasal steroids or antihistamines, and decongestants, may help reduce the severity of symptoms. Most episodes of rhinosinusitis are self-limited, lasting 7 to 10 days. Complications of rhinosinusitis are rare but may include orbital cellulitis, meningitis, and abscess. Computed tomography and referral to an otolaryngologist should be considered for patients with recurrent rhinosinusitis or concern about complications.

### Combating cough [^cee48904]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Thursday afternoon cough clinic is the highlight of my working week. There is always something unique and previously unrecognised, by me at least, even after running one for 30 years. In that time, cough has been transformed from a mere symptom of other diseases into a condition in its own right, a view recently endorsed by the European Respiratory Society who have accepted the definition of cough hypersensitivity as a 'clinical syndrome characterised by troublesome coughing, often triggered by low levels of thermal, mechanical or chemical exposure'. Virtually all chronic cough occurs because of this hypersensitivity of the afferent nerves of the vagus. Patients are frequently amazed that you can predict that they have bouts precipitated by phenomena such as change in atmospheric temperature, strong smells and perfumes (it is always cheap perfume), and exposure to smoke and dust. The typical patient is a middle-aged woman. Women seem to have a heightened cough sensitivity, perhaps to protect them against aspiration during pregnancy. Associated conditions are irritable bowel syndrome and obesity. The relief the patient feels that someone understands the 'sensitive throat' from which they are suffering is palpable. The distress caused by chronic persistent coughing causes a decrement in quality of life greater than that seen in severe COPD or cancer.

Over the years, our understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough has also undergone radical change. Previously, chronic cough was thought to be because of three causes: asthma, GORD and postnasal drip. However, very few patients fit neatly into these boxes, and those who do show many atypical features from the classic diseases. Thus, patients who clearly had an asthmatic-type cough, which responded to inhaled corticosteroids, frequently had no wheeze or airflow obstruction, and thus the term cough variant asthma was invented. In others, there was not even bronchial hyper-responsiveness, and thus the definition was stretched further to include eosinophilic bronchitis. For those who did not fit into any of the boxes, we had to develop a term — idiopathic cough. The cough hypersensitivity syndrome does away with all of this confusion and gives the patient a reassuring and common diagnosis. However, what is the cause of the hypersensitivity?

### Cough: occupational and environmental considerations: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^0357183f]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

This section of the guideline aims to review the role of occupational and environmental factors in causing and contributing to cough. It also aims to indicate when such causes should be considered in a clinical setting, and a general approach to assessment and management.

Methods

A review was performed of published data between 1985 and 2004 using PubMed. The search terms used included "air pollution", "sick building syndrome", "occupational asthma", "occupational lung disease", "hypersensitivity pneumonitis" (HP), "cigarette smoke", and "asthma". Selected articles were chosen when meeting the objectives, but the extent of articles available and the limited space for this section does not permit a fully comprehensive review of all of these areas, for which the reader is referred to other sections of this clinical practice guideline, the published literature, textbooks of occupational lung disease, or more specific review articles.

Results/Conclusions

Almost any patient presenting with cough may have an occupational or environmental cause of or contribution to their cough. The importance of this is that recognition and intervention may result in full or partial improvement of the cough, may limit the need for medication/symptomatic treatment, and may improve the long-term prognosis. Nonoccupational environmental contributing factors for upper and lower airway causes of cough include indoor irritant and allergenic agents such as cigarette smoke, cooking fumes, animals, dust mites, fungi, and cockroaches. Causes of HP indoors include birds and fungal antigens. Outdoor pollutants and allergens also contribute to upper and lower airway causes of cough. Occupational exposures can cause hypersensitivity responses leading to rhinitis and upper airway cough syndrome, previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome, as well as asthma, HP, chronic beryllium disease, and hard metal disease, as well as irritant or toxic responses. The diagnosis is only reached by initially considering possible occupational and environmental factors, and by obtaining an appropriate medical history to determine relevant exposures, followed by objective investigations. This may require referral to a center of expertise.

### Cost burden and resource utilization in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps [^8331986c]. The Laryngoscope (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by nasal mucosa and paranasal sinus inflammation. 1 Clinical symptoms include nasal congestion, postnasal drip, loss of sense of smell, facial pain/pressure, and headache. 2 Using nasal endoscopy and/or radiological examinations, CRS can be divided into CRS without nasal polyposis (NP) and CRS with NP (CRSwNP). 3 Nasal polyps originate in the sinuses and can obstruct the sinuses and nasal passages. 4

In 2007 in the United States (US), ~11.1 (± 0.48) million adults had CRS (4.9% ± 0.2% of US population). 5 The prevalence of NP among patients with diagnosed CRS in the US varies from 25% to 30%. 6 Additionally, CRS and asthma are strongly associated 7, 8 with a 50% asthma prevalence in patients with CRSwNP. 9

### Expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in chronic idiopathic cough [^6bbcbaaf]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic cough is a common clinical problem. Asthma, postnasal drip or rhino-sinusitis, and gastro-oesophageal reflux have been recognized as being the most common causes of chronic cough. In some patients, no cause can be identified despite thorough investigations and empiric treatment, a group recently denoted as 'idiopathic'. Patients with chronic cough very often demonstrate an increased tussive response to inhalation of tussive agents such as capsaicin indicates that there is a sensitisation of the cough reflex. Both peripheral and central causes of this sensitisation have been put forward; however, changes observed in the airways of patients with chronic cough indicate that peripheral changes could be involved in the sensitisation of the cough reflex. Thus, there is an increase in mediator expression as measured by increased levels of histamine in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and levels of cys-leukotrienes, leukotriene B4, myeloperoxidase and TNFα in induced sputum samples from patients with persistent cough. Examination of bronchial biopsies from non-asthmatic chronic cough patients reveal an increase in mast cells in the submucosa, with also marked changes in airway wall remodelling such as subepithelial fibrosis, goblet cell hyperplasia and blood vessels, similar to that observed in patients with asthma, together with an increase in airway smooth muscle cells. Perhaps of greater relevance to the enhanced cough reflex are abnormalities in the epithelial nerve profiles which could represent cough receptors. Although there are no increases in nerve profiles, the expression of the neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and of the ion channel, transient receptor potential vanniloid 1 (TRPV1), has been reported to be increased in these epithelial nerves.

To explore further the role of airway wall remodelling and of peripheral neural plasticity in chronic cough, we have measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid the levels of growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), which may be involved in subepithelial fibrosis, and of the neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophin (BDNF) which may elicit sensitisation of nociceptors, and angiogenesis and microvascular remodelling. We also examined the expression of TGFβ in airways submucosa of chronic idiopathic cough patients.

What AR patients want from treatment

Living with symptomatic AR means coping with any or all of the symptoms of nasal congestion, headache, postnasal drip, repeated sneezing, runny nose and other symptoms on a near-daily basis. AR patients have high expectations from their treatment, but also a high degree of dissatisfaction with AR treatment, for reasons that include: symptom breakthrough, lack of 24-hour coverage, lack of coverage of both nasal and ocular symptoms, and unwanted side effects. Patients want faster and more complete symptom control. Insufficient symptom control with INCS and oral AH is a major concern, and a situation, which has not improved over time. Many physicians underestimate AR severity and consequently fail to issue adequate treatment, a situation which appears to have changed little in a decade.

### Cluster analysis in 975 patients with current cough identifies a phenotype with several cough triggers, many background disorders, and low quality of life [^6fe9548f]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Definitions of variables that were formed on the basis of the raw data in the first questionnaire

Current asthma was defined as doctor's diagnosis of asthma at any age and wheezing during the last 12 months. Chronic rhinosinusitis was present if there was either nasal blockage or nasal discharge (anterior or posterior nasal drip) and either facial pain/pressure or reduction/loss of smell for more than 3 months. Gastroesophageal reflux disease was present if there was heartburn and/or regurgitation on at least 1 day per week during the last 3 months. The number of cough background disorders was calculated by summing up these disorders, giving a value from zero to three. Idiopathic cough was defined as absence of any of these disorders. Autoimmune disorder was defined as presence of a doctor's diagnosis of hypothyreosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or other autoimmune disorders. Presence of depressive symptoms was defined as a Patient Health Questionnaire-2 score of three or more. Symptom sum was calculated by summing all reported symptoms except those associated with airway disorders, giving a value from zero to 14. Trigger sum was calculated by summing all reported cough triggers. There were 11 triggers to be chosen. In addition, the LCQ question number 18 was utilized for speaking as a cough trigger, giving the maximal number of potential triggers 12. Allergy was defined as a self-reported allergy to pollens, animals or food. A family history of chronic cough was defined as the presence (now or in the past) of chronic (duration more than 8 weeks) cough in parents, sisters or brothers.

### An uncommon etiological factor for aspiration pneumonitis caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea: a case report [^e863363b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Aspiration pneumonitis is an inflammatory disease of the lungs which is difficult to diagnose accurately. Large-volume aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents is essential for the development of aspiration pneumonitis. The role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is often underestimated as a rare etiological factor for aspiration in the diagnosis process of aspiration pneumonitis.

Case Presentation

We present a case of a patient with 4 weeks of right-sided watery rhinorrhea accompanied by intermittent postnasal drip and dry cough as the main symptoms. Combined with clinical symptoms, imaging examination of the sinuses, and laboratory examination of nasal secretions, she was initially diagnosed as spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with CSF rhinorrhea, and intraoperative endoscopic findings and postoperative pathology also confirmed this diagnosis. Her chest computed tomography showed multiple flocculent ground glass density shadows in both lungs on admission. The patient underwent endoscopic resection of meningoencephalocele and repair of skull base defect after she was ruled out of viral pneumonitis. Symptoms of rhinorrhea and dry cough disappeared, and pneumonitis was improved 1 week after surgery and cured 2 months after surgery. Persistent CSF rhinorrhea caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele was eventually found to be a major etiology for aspiration pneumonitis although the absence of typical symptoms and well-defined risk factors for aspiration, such as dysphagia, impaired cough reflex and reflux diseases.

Conclusions

We report a rare case of aspiration pneumonitis caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with CSF rhinorrhea, which can bring more attention and understanding to the uncommon etiology for aspiration, so as to make more accurate diagnosis of the disease and early surgical treatment.

### Chronic cough and a normal chest X-ray-a simple systematic approach to exclude common causes before referral to secondary care: a retrospective cohort study [^b90c5202]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cough is common in primary care. Although most coughs are short-lived and self-limiting, those that persist have an impact on the quality of life. By definition, isolated chronic cough lasts > 8 weeks and is unexplained by chest X-ray findings. Smoking, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) medication, asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and upper airway pathology (chronic rhinosinusitis or post-nasal drip) are considered common contributing causes, but the relative frequency of each probably depends on the clinical setting. Primary-care referrals are under-represented in the literature, as most reports come from tertiary-referral cough clinics.

There are benefits to the patient and the wider health system from treatment in primary rather than secondary care. For the management of chronic cough, UK and international guidelines exist, with suggestions that much could be done in the primary-care setting without the need for complex investigation. Indeed, an explicit management pathway for chronic cough involving minimal investigation has been advocated, although it has only been tested in a well-established tertiary-referral cough clinic.

There is evidence that referral to secondary care for chronic cough occurs prematurely. One survey from Northumberland reported that only 31% of general practitioners (GPs) were aware of published guidelines for chronic cough, and studies from two regions of England reported that, contrary to the UK guidance, < 75% of patients had a chest X-ray and < 40% underwent spirometry or a trial of corticosteroid treatment to help exclude asthma in primary care before onward referral.

The aims of the current study were to review general practice management of chronic cough in patients later referred to secondary care, and to describe outcomes (final diagnoses and resolution of symptoms) from managing chronic cough with an approach based on simple investigation and empirical treatment trials in a district general hospital.

### Important clinical symptoms in patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis [^2266f3ef]. The Laryngoscope (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence and severity of individual Rhinosinusitis Task Force (RSTF) symptoms in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).

Methods

Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in 201 patients treated with FESS. The prevalence and severity of individual RSTF major and minor symptom scores graded on a visual analogue scale (VAS) were compared. Correlation between absolute improvement in individual symptom scores at 1-year postoperative was performed.

Results

One-hundred fifty-eight of 201 patients met inclusion criteria giving a response rate of 78%. The average age was 49.4 (range 18–80) with a male-to-female ratio of 1.1:1. The preoperative leading mean symptom scores were postnasal drip (5.8 ± 0.3), nasal obstruction (5.7 ± 0.3), and facial congestion (5.1 ± 0.3). These symptoms were also the most prevalent with 82%, 84%, and 79% of patients reporting these symptoms, respectively. Postoperative symptom improvements were significant (P < .0001) across all RSTF domains except fever. The highest percentage improvement was seen with facial congestion (93%), nasal obstruction (92%), and postnasal drip (85%). Multivariate analysis revealed significant (P < .0001) high correlation between improvements of facial pain/pressure with facial congestion (R = 0.72), facial congestion with nasal obstruction (R = 0.65), and facial pain/pressure with headache (R = 0.72).

Conclusion

The top three RSTF symptoms were postnasal drip, nasal obstruction, and facial congestion in terms of prevalence and severity. Symptom scores improved after FESS. Of these symptoms, the degree of improvement of facial pain/pressure, facial congestion, nasal obstruction, and headache are highly correlated.

### Association between allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis and chronic respiratory diseases: a mendelian randomization study [^730cae72]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic respiratory diseases impose a significant burden on global health, affecting millions worldwide and often leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Among the multifactorial contributors to chronic respiratory ailments, the interconnectedness between nasal polyps, allergic rhinitis, and chronic sinusitis has garnered increasing attention in recent years. These conditions not only afflict individuals independently but also intertwine in a complex web of pathophysiological mechanisms, potentially exacerbating chronic respiratory diseases. Inflammatory or obstructive conditions affecting the upper airways can trigger disorders in the lower airway. This phenomenon, known as United Airways Disorder (UAD), describes a condition where the upper and lower respiratory systems form a unified entity, often presenting simultaneous ailments.

Epidemiological investigations provide considerable evidence supporting the coexistence of upper airway ailments with lower airway disorders. Studies indicate a significant overlap between allergic rhinitis and asthma, with 20–50% of allergic rhinitis patients also experiencing asthma, and up to 80% of asthma patients presenting with allergic rhinitis. The heightened prevalence of nasal symptoms among people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been underscored in numerous epidemiological studies. In comparison to healthy controls, both COPD and asthma patients show increased likelihoods of paranasal sinus opacification, with COPD patients exhibiting a six-fold increase and asthma patients showing a two-fold increase. Extensive research indicates that chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) adversely affects sleep quality and increases the incidence of sleep-related difficulties. Patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis often exhibit upper airway disease, characterized by severe daily symptoms like nasal congestion, anterior rhinorrhea, and postnasal drip, affecting up to 75% of cases. Moreover, previous research has established that nasal polyps are more prevalent in individuals diagnosed with severe, late-onset asthma.

### Ethmoidal silent sinus syndrome after nasal swab test [^93667179]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

This study reported the case of a healthy male in his 40s who presented with a 3-month history of frontal headache and post-nasal drip, which did not improve with oral antibiotics. One month prior to the onset of the symptoms, he underwent a nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 (which yielded a negative result) for a history of malaise and cough. The patient claimed that the swab insertion into the nasal cavity was particularly painful on the left side. Sinus computed tomography (CT) scan showed deformity of the left middle nasal turbinate with occlusion of the osteomeatal complex, resulting in ethmoid silent sinus syndrome. This study makes a significant contribution to the literature because nasopharyngeal, midturbinate and anterior nasal swabs have been recommended as initial diagnostic specimen collection methods by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the coronavirus disease 2019. These methods require introducing an instrument into the nasal cavity, potentially leading to adverse effects due to the delicate and complex nasal anatomy. However, complications related to swab testing for respiratory pathogens have not yet been fully discussed in the literature.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^2dfd0c86]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

α-Adrenergic decongestants — Summary Statement 31: Neither oral nor topical decongestants are beneficial for maintenance treatment of CRS (Opt, B). Long-term use of oral decongestants is generally not recommended for maintenance treatment because of concerns about increasing blood pressure and lack of supportive clinical evidence. Topical decongestants can be considered for short-term and possibly intermittent or episodic therapy of nasal congestion but are inappropriate for regular daily use because of the risk of rhinitis medicamentosa.

### Somatically evoked cough responses help to identify patients with difficult-to-treat chronic cough: a six-month observational cohort study [^6bf0e2ba]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The association between chronic cough and its commonest causeswas established clinically and by using the results of recommended tests., Thus, classic asthma was suspected when patients reported wheezing or chest tightness or both, with and without reversible airway obstruction. Gastro-oesophageal reflux was suspected when at least one oesophageal symptom was reported, with or without one or more of the commonest extra-oesophageal manifestations., Finally, an upper airway cough syndrome was suspected when patients reported nasal obstruction and/or post-nasal drip episodes with or without throat clearing., In all instances, pharmacological treatments (Supplementary Table S1) were recommended according to current guidelines,; furthermore, patients received personalised lifestyle suggestions when appropriate. In brief, treatments also included acid-suppressing drugs (proton pump inhibitors and antacid drugs often associated with prokinetic drugs, n = 95), inhaled/oral steroids associated with long-acting bronchodilators (n = 38), nasal lavages, and steroids and/or antihistamines (n = 21). Combinations of drugs were prescribed in the remaining 151/317 patients due to the detection of multiple, putative cough-accompanying symptoms. In twelve patients (7 SPC+), cough was the sole clinically apparent disturbance and they were treated with cough suppressants such as Gabapentin, central (Codeine) or peripheral (Levodropropizine) antitussive medicines. For each patient, three follow-up visits were scheduled approximately 2 months apart; however, it was possible to anticipate the end of follow-up when the cough score was 1 (i.e. "cough bothers me very little") or less.

### Standardization of spirometry 2019 update. An official American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society technical statement [^658eae28]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Standardization of spirometry — relative contraindications are grouped by physiologic risk and infection control. Due to increases in myocardial demand or changes in blood pressure: Acute myocardial infarction within 1 wk, symptomatic hypotension or severe hypertension, significant atrial/ventricular arrhythmia, decompensated heart failure, uncontrolled pulmonary hypertension, acute cor pulmonale, clinically unstable pulmonary embolism, and history of syncope related to forced expiration/cough. Due to increases in intracranial/intraocular pressure: Cerebral aneurysm, brain surgery within 4 wk, recent concussion with continuing symptoms, and eye surgery within 1 wk. Due to increases in sinus and middle ear pressures: Sinus surgery or middle ear surgery or infection within 1 wk. Due to increases in intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressure: Presence of pneumothorax, thoracic surgery within 4 wk, abdominal surgery within 4 wk, and late-term pregnancy. Infection control issues include active or suspected transmissible respiratory or systemic infection, including tuberculosis, and physical conditions predisposing to transmission of infections, such as hemoptysis, significant secretions, or oral lesions or oral bleeding. Spirometry should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain during the maneuver, and relative contraindications do not preclude spirometry but should be considered when ordering spirometry; potential contraindications should be included in the request form for spirometry.

### Rhinitis, sinusitis and asthma: one linked airway disease [^2966a423]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Understanding the relationship between upper and lower airways has greatly increased through epidemiological and pharmacological studies. Scientific evidence supports the concept that rhinosinusitis and asthma may be the expression of an inflammatory process which appears in different sites of the respiratory tract at different times. The implications are not only academic but are important for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

### Allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis: their impact on lower airways [^61c2aec3]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Anatomy, pathophysiology, epidemiology, and disease characteristics link the upper and lower airways. Nonspecific symptoms such as cough, congestion, shortness of breath, and recurrent infection may be related to the upper airway, lower airway, or both. Patients with the most severe disease often exhibit symptoms and findings of inflammation at both sites. Recent literature suggests that medical treatment and, when appropriate, surgical therapy directed at the upper airway can yield improvements in the lower airway. An understanding of the diagnosis and management of diseases at both sites will afford patients the best possible outcomes.

### Granulomatosis with polyangiitis presenting as axial proptosis and corneal perforation-a case report [^b44123a1]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 32-year-old female presented to our outpatient department with complaints of proptosis of the left eye, which was sudden in onset, painful, and progressive for the past 20 days. Proptosis was accompanied by conjunctival congestion, excessive purulent discharge, and diminished vision in the affected eye over the past 20 days, which progressed to complete vision loss in the last week. The patient also reported foreign body sensation, photophobia, and tearing, all of which progressively worsened during this period.

On further evaluation, she had a history of recurrent episodes of bilateral congestion and pain over the past two years, which temporarily subsided with the use of topical medications (unknown) prescribed by a local practitioner. Additionally, she reported intermittent episodes of haematuria, generalized weakness, and frequent respiratory infections, including chronic cough and nasal congestion.

On general physical examination, the patient was conscious, alert, and well-oriented to time, place, and person. Her vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg, a pulse rate of 76 beats/min (regular in rhythm and volume), a respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Pallor was present, with no icterus, cyanosis, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, or pedal edema. Skin and mucous membranes were healthy, with no rashes, petechiae, or ulcers noted.

Examination of the paranasal sinuses revealed no tenderness over the frontal, maxillary, or ethmoidal sinuses bilaterally, and there was no associated swelling, nasal discharge, or postnasal drip. Respiratory system examination demonstrated bilateral crepitations, more pronounced in the right infraclavicular and axillary regions, as well as in the left mammary and infraclavicular areas. Breath sounds were vesicular without added wheeze, and percussion was resonant throughout. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal first and second heart sounds, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen was soft and non-tender, with no organomegaly, masses, or free fluid, and bowel sounds were normal. Neurological examination showed intact higher mental functions.
