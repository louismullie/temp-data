## Question

Unilateral eye pain. Redness itching

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate unilateral eye pain with redness and itching. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the red flags that mandate urgent ophthalmology referral. Then, I should verify the key history elements that narrow the differential. Next, I will examine the core bedside tests and what each result implies. After that, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and map it to initial management. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, safety netting, and when to escalate care, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence-based tools.

> Let me first confirm the red flags that require same-day ophthalmology referral, because missing these risks vision loss. Moderate to severe pain, true photophobia with pupillary constriction, reduced visual acuity, anisocoria, corneal involvement on fluorescein, contact lens wear with painful red eye, severe purulent discharge, recent ocular surgery or trauma, and unilateral marked redness all warrant urgent referral. I should double-check that I'm not under-calling any of these, as delays in keratitis, anterior uveitis, scleritis, or acute angle-closure glaucoma can be catastrophic [^113X36wt] [^1128PMbG] [^115y7vo5].

> Wait, let me verify the history elements that most efficiently separate benign from serious disease. I need to check laterality, onset and tempo, pain severity and character, photophobia, visual changes, discharge type, itching intensity, contact lens use, trauma or foreign body, systemic atopy, recent URI or COVID-19 exposure, and medication use including topiramate or anticoagulants. Unilateral painful red eyes are more worrisome than bilateral, itching favors allergy, mucopurulent discharge favors bacterial infection, and contact lens wear raises concern for keratitis, so I should confirm each of these carefully before proceeding [^113X36wt] [^1138Wf4y] [^117SCu5M] [^115uvDcV].

> Hold on, I should verify the core bedside tests and what they tell me. Visual acuity is mandatory; photophobia testing with direct and indirect illumination or near synkinesis increases the likelihood of serious disease; fluorescein staining identifies corneal epithelial defects; relief of pain with topical anesthetic suggests corneal surface disease rather than deep inflammation; and pupillary status helps exclude angle closure and uveitis; if I skip these, I risk misclassifying keratitis or uveitis as conjunctivitis [^111Kvxas] [^117VvuBZ] [^117V2TyT].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis now, but I should avoid jumping to conclusions. Allergic conjunctivitis is plausible given itching, but its usual bilaterality and mild discomfort make isolated unilateral pain less likely; viral conjunctivitis can start unilaterally and cause watery discharge and photophobia; bacterial conjunctivitis tends to be mucopurulent and may glue lids; keratitis or corneal abrasion can present with unilateral pain, photophobia, and foreign body sensation; anterior uveitis causes aching pain and photophobia; scleritis produces severe boring pain; acute angle-closure glaucoma brings severe pain with halos and nausea; blepharitis contributes to irritation and can coexist; dry eye can mimic or coexist with allergic disease; and trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias can mimic ocular pain with autonomic signs, so I need to keep these in play while I test [^1138Wf4y] [^113X36wt] [^111xCzpx] [^114jidML] [^113RiWBU].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the combination of unilateral pain, redness, and itching might be pathognomonic for allergic conjunctivitis, but that would be a mistake. I should correct that assumption because allergic conjunctivitis is typically bilateral with prominent itching and minimal pain, whereas unilateral pain with photophobia pushes me toward corneal disease or anterior uveitis, so I must not anchor on allergy here [^112Q6fN6] [^113X36wt].

> Next, I should review the bedside exam sequence to avoid missing key findings. I will now examine visual acuity, perform a penlight external exam for discharge character, lid edema, vesicles, follicles versus papillae, and corneal clarity, then instill fluorescein and inspect with a cobalt blue light for epithelial defects or dendrites, check pupils for size and reactivity, and assess for photophobia with direct and indirect light. If pain markedly improves after a topical anesthetic, that supports a surface process, whereas persistent pain suggests deeper inflammation or elevated intraocular pressure [^117VvuBZ] [^111Kvxas] [^117V2TyT].

> I should confirm the management pathways aligned to likely diagnoses. If fluorescein is positive for an abrasion or ulcer, I need urgent ophthalmology within 24 hours, especially with contact lens wear or severe pain; if fluorescein is negative and pain improves with anesthetic, supportive care for conjunctivitis or blepharitis is reasonable, but I must avoid topical steroids unless an ophthalmologist confirms the diagnosis; for suspected allergic conjunctivitis, cool compresses, artificial tears, and a topical antihistamine are appropriate; for suspected anterior uveitis, scleritis, keratitis, or acute angle closure, I should not delay same-day ophthalmology referral [^113X36wt] [^1128PMbG] [^117GNZc6] [^111xCzpx].

> But wait, what if the patient is a contact lens wearer with unilateral pain and photophobia; I should double-check my threshold for referral. Contact lens–associated keratitis is a sight-threatening emergency and warrants urgent ophthalmology within 24 hours even if the cornea looks clear initially, so I must not reassure and send home in that scenario [^113X36wt] [^115y7vo5].

> I need to ensure I document and communicate clearly. I should record laterality, pain severity, photophobia, visual acuity, discharge character, corneal findings on fluorescein, pupillary status, and any red flags; I should also provide safety-netting instructions for worsening pain, vision decline, new photophobia, or severe headache, and arrange follow-up within 24 to 48 hours if not referred urgently, because early rechecks reduce missed serious disease [^112LfBMB] [^113X36wt].

> Let me reconsider medication contributors before concluding. Topiramate can precipitate acute angle-closure physiology even without classic pain, so a medication history is essential; if there is any suggestion of angle closure or shallow anterior chamber, I should arrange emergent ophthalmology and avoid mydriatics outside specialist care, as delays can cause permanent vision loss [^115uvDcV] [^117HrPk6].

> Finally, I should confirm that my referral threshold remains low for any diagnostic uncertainty. Given that primary care diagnostic accuracy for red eye is modest and misdiagnosis rates are nontrivial, any unilateral painful red eye with red flags or atypical features deserves same-day ophthalmology input rather than empiric antibiotics or steroids, which can mask serious disease and worsen outcomes [^112LfBMB] [^1153hGZJ] [^113X36wt].

Unilateral eye pain with redness and itching most commonly reflects **allergic conjunctivitis** [^115y7vo5] or **blepharitis** [^115y7vo5], but the combination of pain and redness raises concern for sight-threatening conditions such as keratitis, anterior uveitis, or acute angle-closure glaucoma [^113X36wt] [^111xCzpx]. Immediate evaluation is required if there is **vision change, photophobia, corneal opacity, or severe pain** [^1128PMbG] [^115y7vo5]. Initial workup should include visual acuity, slit-lamp exam, fluorescein staining, and intraocular pressure measurement [^115uvDcV]. Management is cause-specific: topical antihistamines/mast-cell stabilizers for allergy [^112Q6fN6], lid hygiene/antibiotics for blepharitis [^114Ge4aP], and urgent ophthalmology referral for keratitis, uveitis, or glaucoma [^115y7vo5].

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Characterize pain (sharp, dull, burning, severity) and its **onset and duration** (sudden vs gradual; acute vs chronic) [^113X36wt]. Assess associated symptoms — photophobia, discharge, foreign body sensation, headache, nausea, and visual changes — and screen for **allergies**, **contact lens use**, recent trauma, and systemic conditions (autoimmune, infectious) [^117SCu5M]. Review medications, including anticoagulants, topiramate, and recent vaccinations [^115uvDcV] [^112CbpB1].

---

### Physical examination

- **Visual acuity**: Essential baseline [^112LfBMB].
- **External examination**: Lid edema, conjunctival injection, discharge, proptosis, ptosis [^114HHXTZ].
- **Slit-lamp examination**: Corneal clarity, epithelial defect, cells/flare, anterior chamber depth [^115uvDcV].
- **Fluorescein staining**: Corneal epithelial defects, ulcers [^117V2TyT].
- **Intraocular pressure**: Elevated in glaucoma [^117HrPk6].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Allergic conjunctivitis**: Clinical diagnosis; papillary reaction, no pain/vision loss [^115uvDcV].
- **Blepharitis**: Slit-lamp findings of lid margin disease, collarettes [^112kwzjM].
- **Keratitis**: Corneal opacity, epithelial defect, positive fluorescein staining [^117V2TyT].
- **Anterior uveitis**: Cells/flare in anterior chamber, ciliary injection [^112QzFVa].
- **Acute angle-closure glaucoma**: Elevated IOP, shallow anterior chamber, mid-dilated fixed pupil [^115uvDcV].
- **Dry eye syndrome**: Reduced tear meniscus, corneal staining [^116ksX5y].

---

## Management strategies

- **Allergic conjunctivitis**: Topical antihistamines, mast-cell stabilizers, cold compresses, allergen avoidance [^117GNZc6].
- **Blepharitis**: Lid hygiene, warm compresses, topical antibiotics, omega-3 supplements [^114Ge4aP].
- **Keratitis**: Urgent ophthalmology referral, topical antibiotics (bacterial), antivirals (HSV), corticosteroids (non-infectious) [^112QzFVa].
- **Anterior uveitis**: Urgent ophthalmology referral, topical corticosteroids, cycloplegics [^115QKa8g].
- **Acute angle-closure glaucoma**: Emergency ophthalmology referral, topical beta-blockers, alpha-agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, osmotic agents, laser iridotomy [^113GG6zN].
- **Dry eye syndrome**: Artificial tears, lifestyle modifications, punctal plugs, topical cyclosporine [^notfound].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate ophthalmology referral

- **Vision loss or significant change** [^1128PMbG].
- **Severe pain unresponsive to analgesics** [^notfound].
- **Photophobia** [^111Kvxas].
- **Corneal opacity or infiltrate** [^115uvDcV].
- **Elevated intraocular pressure** [^117HrPk6].
- **Severe purulent discharge** [^115uvDcV].
- **Recent ocular surgery or trauma** [^115y7vo5].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

- **Corneal scarring and vision loss** (keratitis, uveitis) [^112QzFVa].
- **Permanent vision loss** (glaucoma, severe keratitis) [^112hVoBu].
- **Chronic ocular surface disease** (blepharitis, dry eye) [^112MAxKs].
- **Secondary infections** (cellulitis, endophthalmitis) [^notfound].

---

Unilateral eye pain with redness and itching spans benign and sight-threatening causes; **prompt, structured evaluation** with targeted testing enables accurate diagnosis and timely therapy, preventing vision loss.

### Diagnosis and treatment… [^114Ge4aP]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS Allergic conjunctivitis is often associated with atopic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, eczema, and asthma. 27 Ocular allergies affect an estimated 25 percent of the population in the United States. 28 Itching of the eyes is the most apparent feature of allergic conjunctivitis. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is the most common form of the condition, and symptoms are related to season-specific aeroallergens. Perennial allergic conjunctivitis persists throughout the year. Allergic conjunctivitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis. Avoiding exposure to allergens and using artificial tears are effective methods to alleviate symptoms. Over-the-counter antihistamine/vasoconstrictor agents are effective in treating mild allergic conjunctivitis. Another, more effective, option is a second-generation topical histamine H₁ receptor antagonist. 15 Table 4 presents ophthalmic therapies for allergic conjunctivitis.

BLEPHARITIS Blepharitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the eyelid margins and is diagnosed clinically. Patients should be examined for scalp or facial skin flaking, facial flushing, and redness and swelling on the nose or cheeks. Treatment involves eyelid hygiene, gentle lid massage, and warm compresses. This regimen should continue indefinitely. Topical erythromycin or bacitracin ophthalmic ointment applied to eyelids may be used in patients who do not respond to eyelid hygiene. Azithromycin eye drops may also be used in the treatment of blepharitis. In severe cases, prolonged use of oral antibiotics may be beneficial. 33 Topical steroids may also be useful for severe cases.
30.

Treatment includes supportive care, cycloplegics, and pain control. The need for topical antibiotics for uncomplicated abrasions has not been proven. Topical aminoglycosides should be avoided because they are toxic to corneal epi-thelium. 36 Topical steroids may be useful for severe cases. Ophthalmology referral is required for recurrent episodes, an unclear diagnosis, and worsening symptoms.

### Systemic vasculitis and headache [^116DUPbn]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cogan syndrome

Mogan and Baumgartner described a 26-year-old man with recurrent headache-like pain, spasm, and redness of the left eye with photophobia, excessive tearing, and marked conjunctival injection, followed by severe attack of dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, profuse perspiration, and deafness. A diagnosis of recurrent interstitial keratitis (IK) and explosive Menière disease was made. In retrospect, this was probably the first reported patient with Cogan Syndrome of nonsyphilitic IK with vestibuloauditory symptoms. Symptoms of IK develop abruptly and gradually resolve, associated with photophobia, lacrimation, and eye pain (which may be unilateral or bilateral), and tend to recur periodically for years, before becoming quiescent. Vestibuloauditory dysfunction is manifested by sudden onset of Menière-like attacks of nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, vertigo, and frequently, progressive hearing loss, which characteristically occurs before or after the onset of IK.

With probably fewer than 100 reported patients with this rare childhood disorder, most reported patients with typical Cogan syndrome have appeared as single case reports or patient series, often without pathologic confirmation or evidence of systemic vasculitis in a biopsy or at postmortem examination. Headache was described by Norton and Cogan during the acute illness or at onset in a patient with atypical Cogan syndrome, who manifested a superior central retinal artery branch occlusion and orbital edema, as well as by Cody and Cody and Williams among three of 5 patients with typical Cogan syndrome and one of two patients with atypical Cogan Syndrome.

More recently, Gluth et al. noted headache in 24 of 60 (40%) patients with Cogan syndrome of mean age 38 years (range 9–70 years), whereas Pagnini et al. noted headache at onset in 17% of children of mean age 11 years (range 4–18 years) and in association with other systemic features, including fever, arthralgia, myalgia, arthritis, and weight loss in up to 48% of children. Haynes et al. found headache less common in typical Cogan syndrome in 17% of patients at onset, compared with 27% with atypical Cogan syndrome, a finding that correlated with CNS involvement identified in 4% of patients with typical Cogan syndrome compared with 15% with atypical Cogan syndrome, respectively.

### Managing cluster headache with sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation: a review [^112Bxy4V]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Cluster headache

Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache and is the most common form of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias that are grouped in the third section of the International Headache Society Classification (ICHD-III).CH is considered to be one of the worst pains known to man. Individuals often describe the pain like having a "red hot poker" penetrating one eye. They report that the intensity is so extreme it is unlike anything they have ever experienced, and female patients describe each attack as being worse than childbirth. The intensity of pain is so high that it can induce suicidal thoughts, and so CH has been named as "suicidal headache". Such severity justifies greater attention to this disease.

CH is characterized by recurrent attacks of very severe unilateral pain, usually located in and around the orbit. During an attack, ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms (lacrimation, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, ptosis, edema of the eyelid or the face, sweating of the forehead or the face, miosis) accompany the pain, and behavior is characterized by a marked sense of agitation and necessity to move. Attacks generally last 15 minutes to 3 hours and occur from once every day to eight times daily, sometimes with a striking circadian rhythmicity, with some patients reporting a predictability of onset during the day or, more frequently, during the night, waking from sleep. The term CH is related to the tendency of attacks to cluster together into bouts that last several weeks or months. In the episodic CH, the bouts occur at certain times of year and are separated by periods of remission, which last at least a month. Frequently, episodic CH has a striking circannual periodicity, with the bouts occurring in the same month of the year. However, about 10%–20% of individuals have the chronic form of CH and have continuous attacks with no respite or remission periods lasting less than 1 month.

### Chronic unilateral chemosis following the use of amlodipine besylate [^114smzeq]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This case report describes a patient with chronic unilateral chemosis, likely due to treatment with amlodipine besylate.

Case presentation

A 52-year-old man visited the clinic with symptoms of foreign body sensation and puffiness in his right eye, which had persisted for 4 months. There were no other symptoms, such as itching and pain, in his right eye and no specific symptoms in his left eye. He had been treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the previous 5 months with once daily amlodipine besylate/atorvastatin (Caduet) and candesartan cilexetil (Atacand). Examination revealed marked swelling of the inferior bulbar conjunctiva in the right eye. Evaluation revealed no specific causes for the longstanding chemosis. A change of medication to telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Micardis Plus) without amlodipine besylate resulted in significant improvements in his symptoms after 1 month and complete remission after 8 months.

Conclusion

Prior to invasive evaluation including biopsy, specific drugs should be considered as possible causes of idiopathic longstanding conjunctival chemosis.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness: 2024 update [^112dFymp]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis — common features and field care: Among fluorescein‑negative medical eye conditions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and ultraviolet keratitis can usually be treated in the field and are typically not serious, and conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye. Common etiologies include allergies, viruses, and bacteria; conjunctivitis always involves the palpebral conjunctiva and the examiner must look under the lid to evaluate for this inflammation. The hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis is itching; bacterial conjunctivitis gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge. Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics.

### Brown-mcLean syndrome secondary keratoconus [^1168wr3D]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Brown-McLean Syndrome is a rare ocular clinical condition, typically characterized by edema in the peripheral 2 to 3 millimeters of the cornea, usually starting inferiorly and spreading peripherally, while the central cornea remains unaffected. Previous literature has mostly reported cases in patients with surgical complications and multiple intraocular surgeries. However, this report details a patient with unilateral Brown-McLean Syndrome without a history of surgery, trauma, and families, suggesting a possible congenital gene mutation or genetic susceptibility. Besides, the patient's personal medical history also lacks apparent triggers. The patient has not experienced any episodes of red eyes, eye pain, or other ophthalmic conditions, nor does the patient have a history of allergic diseases. This suggests that no known chronic or acute conditions affect the patient's eye health. Additionally, the patient has consistently worn glasses for vision correction but has no history of contact lens wear or physical exercise, which potentially eliminates complications related to corneal contact lens usage and high-intensity exercise.

In addition, previous literature has described a case of unilateral Brown-McLean Syndrome combined with bilateral keratoconus. Observing the presence of Brown-McLean Syndrome with keratoconus again in this report suggests a potential causal relationship between the two conditions. It is hypothesized that long-term edema and degeneration of the superior and inferior peripheral cornea could alter the biomechanical properties of the corneal tissue, leading to deformation under the pressure of the upper and lower eyelids, resulting in central protrusion and the formation of keratoconus.

In terms of differential diagnosis, it is important to distinguish this case from Terrien's Marginal Degeneration, corneal endotheliatis, and endotheliopathy. Based on the case's manifestations, Terrien's Marginal Degeneration was ruled out as the patient did not exhibit bilateral peripheral corneal thinning with superficial neovascularization. The localized circumferential edema of the peripheral cornea without any episodes of red eyes, eye pain, or other ophthalmic conditions and anterior chamber reaction also excluded corneal endotheliitis. Furthermore, the patient's central cornea is clear, and specular microscopy shows that the morphology of the corneal endothelial cells is normal. There is no history of systemic disease or infectious diseases, thus ruling out endotheliopathy.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^114oucGV]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal edema and opacification — diagnosis and history emphasize that initial evaluation of the patient with symptoms and signs of corneal edema or opacification should include the relevant aspects of the comprehensive medical eye evaluation, the diagnosis is usually based on a typical patient history and characteristic findings, and ancillary testing may be helpful. History features include signs and symptoms such as blurred or variable vision with a diurnal character (worse upon waking and clearer later in the day), photophobia, redness, tearing, intermittent foreign-body sensation, and intense, disabling, or task-disrupting pain, as well as a recent history of other ocular surgery/complications.

### The review of ophthalmic symptoms in COVID-19 [^113WZffG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ophthalmological Symptoms in the Course of COVID-19

The latest studies and meta-analyses have confirmed a more frequent occurrence of ophthalmological symptoms in COVID-19 patients, ranging from 2 to 32%. The most common ophthalmological symptoms reported by patients were conjunctivitis, eye pain, swelling and redness. Often, the first visible ophthalmological symptom of COVID-19 infection was conjunctivitis. In a 2020 study of 2347 patients with confirmed infection, 11.64% had ophthalmological symptoms related to the ocular surface, including eye pain and redness with discharge. The majority of patients (31.2%) reported eye pain. In another study from 2021, the analysis of 7300 patients revealed the occurrence of ocular symptoms during COVID-19 infection in 11.03% of patients, including symptoms such as: dry eye or foreign body sensation (16%), redness (13.3%), tearing (12.8%), itching (12.6%), eye pain (9.6%) and discharge (8.8%). Conjunctivitis was the most frequently reported ophthalmological complaint in COVID-19 patients and occurred in 88.8% of respondents. Much less common ophthalmic pathologies have also been described, such as keratoconjunctivitis (2.2%), episcleritis (2.2%), scleritis (2.2%), posterior ischemic optic neuropathy and neuropathy (1.1%) (Figure 1).

### Pain in the quiet (not red) eye [^113GG6zN]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although eye pain is often accompanied by redness or injection, pain can also occur with a quiet eye. Pain in a quiet eye can be the first sign of a vision-threatening condition, a more benign ophthalmologic condition, or a nonophthalmologic condition. Acute narrow-angle glaucoma is an emergent vision-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment and referral to an ophthalmologist. Although most nonophthalmologic conditions that cause eye pain do not need immediate treatment, giant cell (temporal) arteritis requires urgent treatment with corticosteroids. Other vascular conditions, such as carotid artery disease, thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, and transient ischemic attack or stroke, rarely cause eye pain but must be considered. Pain may also be referred from the sinuses or from neurologic conditions, such as trigeminal neuralgia, migraine and cluster headaches, and increased intracranial pressure. The differential diagnosis of eye pain in the quiet eye is extensive, necessitating a systematic and thorough approach.

### Differential diagnosis of facial pain and guidelines for management [^111LZfvf]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of facial pain below the eye can be very different dependant on whether the patient visits a dentist or medical practitioner. A structure for accurate diagnosis is proposed beginning with a very careful history. The commonest acute causes of pain are dental and these are well managed by dentists. Chronic facial pain can be unilateral or bilateral and continuous or episodic. The commonest non-dental pains are temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), especially musculoskeletal involving the muscles of mastication either unilaterally or bilaterally; they may be associated with other chronic pains. A very wide range of treatments are used but early diagnosis, reassurance and some simple physiotherapy is often effective in those with good coping strategies. Dentists will often make splints to wear at night. Neuropathic pain is usually unilateral and of the episodic type; the most easily recognized is trigeminal neuralgia. This severe electric shock like pain, provoked by light touch, responds best to carbamazepine, and neurosurgery in poorly controlled patients. Trauma, either major or because of dental procedures, results in neuropathic pain and these are then managed as for any other neuropathic pain. Red flags include giant cell arteritis which much be distinguished from temporomandibular disorders (TMD), especially in > 50 yr olds, and cancer which can present as a progressive neuropathic pain. Burning mouth syndrome is rarely recognized as a neuropathic pain as it occurs principally in peri-menopausal women and is thought to be psychological.

### Acute myopia and angle closure glaucoma from topiramate in a seven-year-old: a case report and review of the literature [^113KPMAP]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Case presentation

History of present illness and review of systems

A 7-year-old female with a history of seizures and headaches presented to the pediatric emergency room (ER) with acute onset of blurry vision. The morning of presentation, she awoke with blurry vision. She presented to her pediatrician, who referred her to an optometrist, where she was refracted to a visual acuity (VA) of 20/20 with a myopic refraction. Visual acuity had been 20/20 at distance previously. Acute myopia is not an altogether unusual presentation to an optometrist and generally a new myopia patient does not cause alarm. She continued to experience worsening vision accompanied with red eyes, swollen eyelids, excessive tearing and photophobia. She denied pain, burning, itching, mucus discharge, or pain with extraocular movements. She denied systemic symptoms including dizziness, nausea, vomiting, malaise, neck stiffness, fever, or any focal neurological complaints. Her last dose of topiramate was 25 mg, 20 hours prior to presentation.

Past medical, surgical, ocular, medication, social and allergic history

She had had 3 focal seizures from age 3–4, and had been treated with levetiracetam until 3 months prior to presentation, having been seizure free for three years. Her headaches returned, and she had one seizure while in school, which consisted of dysconjugate eye movements and brief unresponsiveness. After consultation with her primary pediatrician and her neurologist, topiramate 25 mg at bedtime was started 2 weeks prior to presentation. Her only other medication was cyproheptadine 5 mL at bedtime, as needed. She had no other medical or surgical history. Social, allergic and family history was noncontributory. She was developing normally.

### Unilateral gustatory facial flushing in a child [^1129RqeL]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

A 2-year old boy presented with episodic right-sided facial flushing occurring immediately after eating. He had a history of an ipsilateral facial hematoma following forceps delivery which had healed without scarring. The flushing was first noted after the introduction of solid foods at 6 months of age. During mastication, right-sided linear erythema and warmth develops in the skin overlying the distribution of the auriculotemporal nerve (Fig 1), lasting approximately 1 hour. It occurs with all food-types and is not associated with sweating, pain, or pruritis. He is otherwise well with no developmental concerns.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Harlequin syndrome
B. Mastocytosis
C. Frey syndrome
D. Food allergy
E. Trigeminal neuralgia

Answers:
A. Harlequin syndrome – Incorrect. Harlequin syndrome is hemi-facial flushing and hyperhidrosis which results from direct injury to the sympathetic fibers of the face. Symptoms are usually triggered by heat, exercise or strong emotions.
B. Mastocytosis – Incorrect. Mastocytosis is a rare condition of uncontrolled mast cell proliferation, with the clinical presentation ranging from maculopapular skin rash to anaphylactic-like reactions.
C. Frey syndrome – Correct. Frey syndrome (Auriculotemporal nerve syndrome) is a rare condition that usually results from direct injury to the auriculotemporal nerve, leading to gustatory flushing and/ or hyperhidrosis. It occurs due to aberrant regeneration of postganglionic parasympathetic neurons to the adjacent sweat glands and cutaneous blood vessels following injury. Frey syndrome is most commonly seen in adults, particularly following parotid surgery. In infants, Frey syndrome can occur following traumatic instrumental delivery, though familial cases have also been reported. Infantile Frey syndrome tends to present with gustatory flushing rather than hyperhidrosis.
D. Food allergy – Incorrect. There are a few key features in this case that are inconsistent with the typical presentation of food allergy. Those include absence of a specific food trigger, as symptoms occur with all food types, absence of IgE-mediated systemic symptoms, and the spontaneous resolution of symptoms. Frey syndrome can often be falsely attributed to food allergy.
E. Trigeminal neuralgia – Incorrect. While trigeminal neuralgia may cause unilateral flushing, it more commonly presents with episodic neuropathic pain that is triggered by physical contact. Absence of facial pain in this case makes the diagnosis less likely.

### Ocular rosacea: an updated review [^116Xd4kJ]. Cornea (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Ocular rosacea, classified as subtype IV, is defined by the National Rosacea Expert Committee as the presence of 1 or more of the following signs or symptoms: watery or bloodshot appearance, foreign body sensation, burning or stinging, dryness, itching, light sensitivity, blurred vision, conjunctival and eyelid margin telangiectasias, or eyelid and periocular erythema. Additional signs include blepharitis, conjunctivitis, and irregular eyelid margins; chalazia and styes are also frequent indicators (Figs. 1, 2). Nonetheless, rosacea is primarily diagnosed clinically and lacks specific diagnostic criteria (Table 1).

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^112Q6fN6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chlamydia is the cause of 1.8–5.6% of all acute conjunctivitis cases. Chlamydial conjunctivitis primarily has a unilateral presentation with concurrent genital infectionand presents with conjunctival redness, lymphoid follicle formation, or mild purulent discharge. A distinctive sign of this infection in adults is bulbar conjunctival follicles, which are absent in neonates/infants. Chlamydial conjunctivitis is typically spread through sexual contact. Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with 1,708,569 cases reported in 2017. From 2013 to 2017, the number of reported cases of chlamydia in the United States increased by 22%. In neonates, the eyes can be infected after vaginal delivery by infected mothers. Treatment includes oral azithromycin or oral doxycycline in adults, and erythromycin in neonates.

Allergic Conjunctivitis

Most cases of allergic conjunctivitis are attributable to seasonal allergies and present with bilateral symptoms. Mild to severe itching and redness are the key symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, which can present with a watery or mucoid discharge. Treatment includes supportive measures (cold compress, artificial tears), topical or oral antihistamines, and mast cell inhibitors. A short course of topical corticosteroids can be used in select cases in which corneal involvement and herpetic infection have been ruled out; both conditions could worsen with steroid use.

Differential Diagnosis

To satisfy the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines that treatment of conjunctivitis is directed at the root cause, physicians should manage patients by taking a systematic approach (Figure 2), considering the epidemiologic spectrum of infectious conjunctivitis, patient history, clinical exam, and — if needed — diagnostic tests.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^115mUmpB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) initial evaluation and lesion characterization — The initial patient evaluation should be focused to determine (through history and physical examination) whether the lesions that patients describe are consistent with CU (D). Lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals with surrounding erythema, are generally pruritic, and individual lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours; painful or burning dysesthesia suggests cutaneous vasculitis, and angioedema is nonpruritic, brawny, nonpitting edema without erythema affecting the lips, tongue, eyelids, and genitalia. The clinician should obtain objective assessments of body surface area covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial and each subsequent visit, and photographic documentation might assist in determining consistency with urticaria or angioedema. The medical work-up should be done while keeping in mind that CU is of undetermined cause in the majority of cases (C).

### Sore eyes as the most significant ocular symptom experienced by people with COVID-19: a comparison between pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 States [^115YAgMW]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Early in the pandemic, ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not thought to be a possibility. However, a study investigating a previous coronavirus outbreak (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) suggests that people who wore full protective wear, including eye protection, showed no evidence of serum antibodies. In contrast, people who wore full personal protective equipment but no eye protection were infected with SARS-CoV-2.

It would be important to ascertain which ocular conjunctival symptoms are reported most frequently. Conjunctivitis manifests with different aetiologies and ocular symptoms, including mucopurulent discharge and itchy eyes associated with bacterial and viral conjunctivitis, respectively. In addition, it would be useful to know how these ocular manifestations compare with other known COVID-19-like symptoms (such as fever and dry cough), how long they last for and when do they manifest when compared with the other COVID-19 symptoms. In addition, as a number of people are known to suffer from other chronic ocular symptoms, it would be useful to compare ocular symptoms before and during COVID-19 state. The aims of the study were to examine the above points.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^117GNZc6]. Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on allergic conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva caused by an allergic reaction.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of allergic conjunctivitis involves exposure to allergens triggering an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, leading to mucosal inflammation and associated ocular symptoms.
- **Epidemiology**: Allergic conjunctivitis is estimated to affect 6–30% of the general population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for allergic conjunctivitis include a personal or familial predisposition to allergies, along with environmental elements that augment exposure to allergens. These allergens may include pollen, dust mites, animal dander, pollutants, and fungal allergens.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, allergic conjunctivitis presents with symptoms such as redness, itching, eye discharge, foreign body sensation, and swollen eyelids. Some patients may also experience burning and stinging, which can be attributed to chronic neuropathic pain.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of allergic conjunctivitis is generally good. While it is a chronic condition, it can be effectively managed with treatment, including allergen avoidance, the use of antihistamines, and in some cases, specific immunotherapy.

### Topiramate induced bilateral myopia: a potential precursor to acute angle closure glaucoma [^117HrPk6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute angle closure glaucoma is a well-described vision-threatening emergency that must be promptly identified and addressed by the emergency medicine clinician. The classic presentation of unilateral eye pain, vision changes, and increased intraocular pressure is a description of a primary angle closure. This process can also occur secondarily to structural changes, systemic diseases, and certain medications.

Case Report

We present a case of acute onset of myopia in the setting of topiramate use. Initial ocular examination revealed no abnormalities in intraocular pressure or slit lamp examinat, however, prompt ophthalmological evaluation revealed narrowed angles bilaterally, resulting in surgical fixation to prevent progression into angle closure glaucoma. WhyShould anEmergencyPhysicianBeAware ofThis? Acute angle closure secondary to extra-ocular etiologies is a less well-known presentation. In contrast to primary acute angle closure in which patients classically have unilateral pain and redness, these patients may present with painless, bilateral vision changes. Emergency providers must maintain a high clinical suspicion to recognize this condition that can progress to angle closure glaucoma if untreated.

### Long-term follow-up and complications after cardiac transplantation [^114js9bc]. NMDP (1993). Medium credibility.

Eyes — evaluation and clinical manifestations in chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) include patient symptoms (dry, burning, gritty eyes; itching; orbital pain; difficulty opening eyes in the morning; sensitivity to light and wind; excessive tearing; and diminished visual acuity and/or blurring), examination (visual inspection of the conjunctivae and sclerae; ophthalmologic exam), and diagnostic testing (Schirmer's tear test; slit-lamp examination). New ocular sicca is documented by low Schirmer's test values with a mean value of both eyes ≤ 5 mm of wetting at 5 minutes and these values are not useful for follow-up of ocular GVHD; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) is described as inflammation of cornea and conjunctivae with dryness, grittiness and/or orbital pain, with mean Schirmer's test values of 6 to 10 mm not due to other causes. Additional listed manifestations include cicatricial conjunctivitis with fibrous tissue scaring and inflammation, photophobia with increased sensitivity to light, periorbital hyperpigmentation with excess pigmentation in the tissues surrounding or lining the orbit of the eye, and blepharitis with erythema and edema of the eyelids and telangiectasia of lid margin. Asterisks denote feature categories: "Distinctive but insufficient alone to establish an unequivocal diagnosis of chronic GVHD without further testing or additional organ involvement", "Rare, controversial, or non-specific features of chronic GVHD", and "Common in both acute and chronic GVHD".

Blepharitis history assessment — questions that may help elucidate information include symptoms and signs such as redness, irritation, burning, tearing, itching, crusting of eyelashes, loss of eyelashes, eyelid sticking, blurring or fluctuating vision, contact lens intolerance, photophobia, increased frequency of blinking, and recurrent hordeolum; time of day when symptoms are worse, with morning worsening typical of blepharitis and later-day worsening typical of aqueous deficient dry eye; duration of symptoms; unilateral or bilateral presentation; exacerbating conditions such as smoke, allergens, wind, contact lenses, low humidity, retinoids, diet and alcohol consumption, eye makeup, and aqueous tear deficiency; symptoms and signs related to systemic diseases such as rosacea, atopy, psoriasis, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); current and previous systemic and topical medications including antihistamines or drugs with anticholinergic effects and past drugs such as isotretinoin that might affect the ocular surface; and recent exposure to an infected individual such as pediculosis palpebrarum (P. pubis). The ocular history may include previous intraocular and eyelid surgery and local trauma (mechanical, thermal, chemical, radiation); a history of cosmetic blepharoplasty is important because increased surface exposure may increase tear evaporation; and a history of hordeola and/or chalazia is common in patients with posterior blepharitis.

### Posterior migration of ahmed glaucoma valve tube in a patient with reiger anomaly: a case report [^114kFiVo]. BMC Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

A 9 year old child presented to the out patient services of our eye department with chief complaints of gradual, progressive loss of vision in both eyes, left more than right, over a period of two years. The patient also had primary complaint of intolerance to bright light, particularly in the right eye. His school teacher also complained of the child not taking adequate interest in class work with special obstinacy to outdoor sports. There is associated history of off and on redness in both the eyes, episodes being associated with ocular pain. The episodes often waned with or without topical medication acquired from local chemists, with pain free periods dominating the natural course.

On eliciting a detailed history, there was fleeting evidence of glare since childhood, with the child often closing his eyes in response to bright light, especially at night. There is no history of ocular irritation, itching, foreign body sensation, ocular deviation, eyelid droop, double vision or development of opacity in the cornea. There was no evidence of incidental trauma, febrile illness, dehydration, malnutrition, prolonged oral drug intake or any other cardio-renal anomaly or illness.

### Reproxalap improves ocular redness, tear production, and symptoms in a pivotal dry eye disease chamber trial [^116YtMT1]. Ophthalmology Science (2026). Medium credibility.

Although it is unlikely that dry eye disease patients are concerned with Schirmer test scores on a day-to-day basis, patients are persistently disturbed by increased ocular redness in conjunction with elevated levels of the standardly assessed dry eye symptoms of discomfort, dryness, grittiness, burning, and stinging. Relative to vehicle, the improvement in all symptoms measured in the dry eye chamber after reproxalap treatment was similar (Fig S1). Although the interpretation of symptom terminology may differ from patient to patient, and patients may not reliably distinguish certain symptoms from others, the results suggest that reproxalap could broadly diminish the development of all symptoms in the chamber. Additionally, increases in ocular itching scores observed after the 90-minute exposure to the dry eye chamber were lower after reproxalap treatment than with vehicle treatment, suggesting that itching, which is classically considered a symptom of allergic conjunctivitis, may also be characteristic of dry eye diseaseand that reproxalap may prevent the exacerbation of itching in dry eye patients, consistent with that observed in allergic conjunctivitis.,

The broad activity of reproxalap in preventing escalation of symptoms, including discomfort, in the dry eye chamber is seemingly inconsistent with the 92% of subjects that described instillation site irritation, all of which was mild in severity and most commonly lasted ≤ 1 minute. However, as has been speculated elsewhere, activation of transient receptor potential and other RASP-sensitive sensory receptors may explain both phenomena. The transient receptor potential M8 agonist, menthol, for example, induces both hot and icy sensations that may be coded as irritation upon instillation. Had irritation persisted after chamber entry, redness and symptom scores would likely have been higher after reproxalap administration than with vehicle administration, in contrast to the results, which indicated durable reduction in redness and symptoms throughout the chamber that favored reproxalap over vehicle.

### How can we best diagnose severity levels of dry eye disease: current perspectives [^111tpszA]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Symptoms by themselves are often inadequate for the differential diagnosis of ocular surface disease (OSD), because a wide variety of ocular surface and tear film disorders such as DED, OA, blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) and bacterial or viral infections can produce the same symptoms. Signs and symptoms of DED do not often correlate. Only about two-thirds of patients with dry eye symptoms test positive for DED with traditional confirmatory tests. Despite some patients having minimal objective signs such as punctate corneal fluorescein staining, they complain of severe ocular irritation, whereas others present with severe staining and have minimal symptomatology. The ability to practically examine tear biomarkers reveals that specific biomarkers correlate to the signs and symptoms in all forms of dry eye.

Typical ocular surface-related symptoms include eye irritation, burning, tearing, stinging, a gritty or foreign body sensation, photophobia, fluctuating vision, redness, intermittent sharp pain, and transient blurred vision. Environments that generate desiccating stress including high temperature, low humidity, air conditioning, and activities that lead to reduced blinking such as driving, computer use, reading, and watching television can worsen dry eye symptoms. Ocular itching, frequently referenced as the hallmark OA symptom, is not just an allergic issue, just as tear film instability is not just related to DED.DED symptoms have features of neuropathic ocular pain, including spontaneous pain, hyperalgesia and dysesthesias. Initial ocular surface damage or inflammation may cause central and/or peripheral sensitization, producing hypersensitivity and persistent DED symptoms despite the source of inflammation and/or damage being removed.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^112CBRBR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) — history and physical examination for initial clinical diagnosis emphasizes that Key elements of the history in patients presenting with AR include seasonal, perennial or episodic, exposure-associated itching of the nose, palate, or eyes, sneezing, nasal congestion, sniffing, clear rhinorrhea, and postnasal drip. Children may only complain of malaise or fatigue, often associated with a cough, and the history must include specific questions about rhinorrhea and nasal and ocular itch in order to elicit these complaints. Symptoms of other sinonasal diseases such as sinusitis, vasomotor rhinitis, and granulomatous diseases can overlap with AR symptoms and should be differentiated from AR, and Less typical symptoms such as epistaxis, unilateral rhinorrhea, unilateral nasal blockage, severe headache, or anosmia suggest alternative diagnoses and should be investigated further. Viral upper respiratory infections may produce similar symptoms but tend to be of a shorter duration and often include other symptoms such as fever and myalgia. A family history of AR, asthma, or atopic dermatitis strengthens the diagnosis of AR in patients with compatible symptoms. Findings on physical examination that support the diagnosis of AR include several classic findings, such as clear rhinorrhea and pale pink or bluish swelling of the nasal turbinate mucosa, and Frequent throat clearing is often present as well, reflecting postnasal drip. Although definitive diagnosis depends on the finding of an IgE-mediated response to a specific allergen, detected through cutaneous or blood testing in most patients, it is reasonable to make an initial diagnosis and begin therapy based on the history and physical examination, and A good response to avoidance of suspected allergens or appropriate empiric therapy supports the diagnosis of AR and may preclude the need for further testing.

### Hemicrania continua: a clinical study of 39 patients with diagnostic implications [^111bFvsR]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Hemicrania continua is an uncommon primary headache disorder, characterized by continuous unilateral pain, where pain exacerbations are associated with cranial autonomic features. The hallmark of this condition is the absolute response to indometacin. We describe the phenotype of this condition in a large series of patients. Thirty-six (92%) patients had side-locked pain and 3 (8%) had side-alternating pain. The majority (82%) of the patients had the chronic (unremitting) form and the severity range of background pain was 1–10 out of 10 on verbal rating scale, with a mean of 6.5. Thirty-eight (97%) of the patients rated the painful exacerbations between 6.5 and 10 with a mean of 9 and 28 (71%) described their severe pain as excruciating. Of the cohort, 97% had at least one cranial autonomic feature during exacerbations: 73% had lacrimation, 51% nasal congestion, 46% conjunctival injection and 40% ptosis and facial flushing. Other cranial autonomic features included rhinorrhoea, forehead/facial sweating, itching eye, eyelid oedema, sense of aural fullness and periaural swelling, miosis, mydriasis and swelling of the cheek and face. Thirty-one (79%) had phonophobia, which was unilateral in 14 (48%); 29 (74%) had photophobia, which was unilateral in 14 (48%); and 27 (69%) had motion sensitivity. In addition, about two-thirds were agitated or restless, or both, and about one-quarter were aggressive, mainly verbally, with severe pain. All patients had a positive placebo-controlled indometacin test (100–200 mg intramuscularly) or a positive oral indometacin trial, or both. We suggest the International Headache Society criteria be revised to remove the absence of side-shift pain as a criterion. Furthermore, revised criteria should encompass a more extensive range of cranial autonomic features and consider pain as fluctuating with moderate, severe and very severe intensity. Currently the sine qua non for hemicrania continua is a response to indometacin. Since there is no reliable clinical marker of that response, we recommend an indometacin test, either orally or by injection, for any patient with unilateral pain, with or without cranial autonomic symptoms.

### Thelaziasis in an urban woman in beijing: a case report and literature review [^116Ho1F5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Thelaziasis is a zoonotic disease mainly caused by Thelazia callipaeda (Spirurida, Thelaziidae, Thelazia), which can cause mild to severe signs and lesions, such as foreign body sensation, itching, tearing, eye pain, conjunctival bleeding, conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, and even blindness. Thelaziasis cases have been reported mainly in agricultural areas and areas with high potential for contact with domestic animals.

Case presentation

We report a case of Thelazia callipaeda infection in the right eye of a 41-year-old woman working in an office. The patient presented with persistent foreign body sensation, pruritus, and redness despite initial treatment with polyethylene glycol and levofloxacin eye drops. Subsequent examination revealed the presence of multiple Thelazia callipaeda worms, which were successfully removed. Postoperative treatment with gatifloxacin eye ointment resulted in significant symptom relief with no recurrence over two months.

Conclusions

This case highlights the thelaziasis in urban settings, emphasizing the need for ophthalmologists to consider parasitic infections in differential diagnosis even in well-maintained environments. Then, we provided an overview of human thelaziasis in China by mining publicly available databases from 2014 to 2023, suggesting a difference in regional distribution that warrants further epidemiological studies.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^115a6bxm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Patient-reported symptoms and likely diagnosis — Allergic rhinitis (AR), nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), acute upper respiratory tract infection, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyps, and CRS with nasal polyps — are contrasted by frequency descriptors. Rhinorrhea/sniffing in AR is described as very common with clear watery discharge, whereas NAR is common but less than AR overall; in acute infection it is common and may be clear to purulent and watery to mucoid with crusts; and in CRS (with or without nasal polyps) it is common and clear to mucoid. Ocular pruritus/watery discharge/red eyes is very common in AR but uncommon in NAR and acute infection and very uncommon in CRS. Nasal congestion or blocked nose/mouth breathing is very common and persistent in AR and very common, chronic, almost universal in CRS with nasal polyps. Facial or sinus pain/pressure is very uncommon in AR yet common in acute infection and in CRS without nasal polyps. Postnasal drip is uncommon and persistent in AR but very common in NAR and common in acute infection and CRS without nasal polyps. Nasal/palate/ear itching is common in AR and very uncommon in NAR, acute infection, and CRS with or without nasal polyps. Snoring is uncommon and persistent in AR but common in the other listed conditions, and sleep disturbance/sleep apnea is common across all listed conditions. Frequencies are based on expert evidence and opinion and the table was developed based predominantly on expert opinion.

### Allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye syndrome [^116sfzrW]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) and dry eye syndrome (DES) are 2 of the most common anterior inflammatory disorders of the ocular surface and one does not preclude the coexistence of the other.

Objectives

To examine the potential overlap between AC and DES as comorbidities.

Methods

Using the validated questionnaire known as Subjective Evaluation of Symptom of Dryness, we studied self-reported itchiness, dryness, and redness. In an outpatient optometric setting, 689 patients treated from January 1, 2007, to January 1, 2011, were surveyed for their ocular history and categorized according to their reported level of discomfort of itchiness, dryness, and redness.

Results

Patients ranged in age from 5 to 90 years (median age, 25 years; 39.5% male; 60.5% female). In the studied 689 patients, clinically significant itchiness was found in 194 (28.2%), dry eyes in 247 (35.8%), and redness in 194 (28.2%). Symptom overlap was demonstrated in many of the patients. Of the 194 patients with itchiness, 112 (57.7%) had clinically significant dryness. In the 247 patients with dry eyes, 112 (45.3%) had clinically significant itch. Redness was apparent in 120 of the 194 patients with itch (61.9%) and 122 of the 247 patients with dryness (49.4%). Statistical analysis demonstrated that self-reported itchiness, dryness, and redness were not independent of each other (P < .001; Pearson χ² test). The odds of patients with "itchy eyes" also experiencing dry eyes were 2.11 times and the odds of these patients also experiencing redness were 7.34 times that of patients with nonitchy eyes.

Conclusions

Most patients with "itchy eyes" consistent with AC also have dry eyes and redness. These results suggest that some symptomatic patients concomitantly have features of AC and DES.

### Ocular myiasis caused by chrysomya bezziana-a case report [^114aadG8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Ophthalmomyiasis is mainly manifested as orbital myiasis, ophthalmomyiasis externa (external ocular structure), and ophthalmomyiasis interna (internal ocular structures). Ophthalmomyiasis externa is characterized by superficial infestation of the ocular tissue and mimics allergic or viral conjunctivitis. Patients complain of pain, burning, itching, redness, and watering in the affected eye, with an abrupt onset, accompanied by sensations of larvae moving in the eye. If timely management is not done, the larvae penetrate the sclera and reach the vitreous and subretinal space, causing ophthalmomyiasis interna as a complication. This manifests as pigmented and atrophic retinal pigment epithelial tracts in multiple crisscross patterns, in conjunction with fibrovascular proliferation, hemorrhage, and exudative detachment of the retina leading to blindness. Maggots can also infiltrate the lacrimal sac and can migrate through the lacrimal canal to the nasal cavity. Extension to the cranial cavity is a possibility, due to the close proximity to the base of the skull.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^113UUrR3]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Classification of dry eye syndrome — mild, moderate, and severe — is summarized as follows: Dry eye is generally classified according to a combination of symptoms and signs. In this Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP), dry eye is classified as mild, moderate, and severe based on both symptoms and signs, but with an emphasis on symptoms over signs, and owing to the nature of dry eye syndrome, this classification is imprecise because characteristics at each level overlap. Patients with mild dry eye syndrome may have symptoms of irritation, itching, soreness, ocular discomfort, burning, or intermittent blurred vision.

### Diagnosis and management of red eye in primary care [^115y7vo5]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Red eye is the cardinal sign of ocular inflammation. The condition is usually benign and can be managed by primary care physicians. Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye. Other common causes include blepharitis, corneal abrasion, foreign body, subconjunctival hemorrhage, keratitis, iritis, glaucoma, chemical burn, and scleritis. Signs and symptoms of red eye include eye discharge, redness, pain, photophobia, itching, and visual changes. Generally, viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limiting conditions, and serious complications are rare. Because there is no specific diagnostic test to differentiate viral from bacterial conjunctivitis, most cases are treated using broad-spectrum antibiotics. Allergies or irritants also may cause conjunctivitis. The cause of red eye can be diagnosed through a detailed patient history and careful eye examination, and treatment is based on the underlying etiology. Recognizing the need for emergent referral to an ophthalmologist is key in the primary care management of red eye. Referral is necessary when severe pain is not relieved with topical anesthetics; topical steroids are needed; or the patient has vision loss, copious purulent discharge, corneal involvement, traumatic eye injury, recent ocular surgery, distorted pupil, herpes infection, or recurrent infections.

### The mydriatic red eye as the initial presentation of syphilis [^114d2c44]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that has been increasing in prevalence since the early 2000s. Ocular involvement occurs in a minority of patients and must be in the differential diagnosis for patients who present with red eye and uveitis.

Case Report

A 29-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a painful, mydriatic red eye. Review of systems revealed a rash as well as a recent genital lesion and, on further questioning, she admitted to a history of intravenous drug use and high-risk sexual activity. Ophthalmology was consulted and the patient was diagnosed with bilateral uveitis. Serologic testing was positive for syphilis, and she was admitted and treated with intravenous penicillin, with resolution of her uveitis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Red eye is a common ocular symptom in patients presenting to the emergency department. The differential diagnosis of the red eye is broad and can range from benign etiologies, such as conjunctivitis, to life- and sight-threatening conditions, such as endogenous endophthalmitis. Systemic diseases such as syphilis may present with primarily ocular symptoms, and ocular syphilis must be identified and managed appropriately to prevent devastating sequelae.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^115uvDcV]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Medication history will also be informative. For example, anticoagulants are associated with subconjunctival hemorrhage, and topiramate is associated with angle-closure glaucoma. Patients requiring steroids may be at risk of more severe disease or other pathology, and referral to an eye care provider is recommended. The clinical examination should also include an assessment of the lymph nodes (swollen submandibular and preauricular lymph nodes). Lymphadenopathy, such as an enlarged, tender preauricular lymph node, is more common in viral versus bacterial conjunctivitis.

The physical eye examination should inspect for visual acuity, discharge type, corneal opacity, abnormal pupil size or shape, eyelid swelling, and orbit protrusion or asymmetry. Referral to an ophthalmologist or eye care professional should be performed immediately for cases that involve visual loss, moderate to severe pain, severe purulent discharge, or any corneal involvement. Useful information can be obtained with a simple penlight in the absence of a slit lamp, especially as it pertains to measurement of the anterior chamber depth and the ruling out of angle closure. Viral conjunctivitis can vary in presentation, but tearing, clear to white discharge, redness, and bilaterality are very common. Viral conjunctivitis usually starts with one eye, with the second eye to follow within a few days. Bacterial conjunctivitis is strongly suggested by glued eyelids, lack of itching, and lack of history of conjunctivitis. A diagnostic index for bacterial conjunctivitis by van Weert et al suggests that younger adult patients with conjunctivitis who present without glued eyelids at awakening are less likely to have conjunctivitis with a bacterial origin; this risk increases with age and presentation of two glued eyes.

A slit lamp provides a more detailed appearance of the conjunctival epithelium that enables differentiation between various types of conjunctival inflammation (follicular, mainly infectious; papillary, mainly allergic; pseudomembranous, severe EKC; eosinophilic, allergic). Fluorescein staining in conjunction with slit lamp examination, highlights patterns of corneal fluorescein uptake and exposes anterior chamber inflammation.HSV infection typically appears as branching lesions with intensely stained end bulbs, while highly branched lesions without end bulbs are typical of VZV infection.

### Fluorometholone [^116bnWzr]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions include, in decreasing order of frequency, elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma and infrequent optic nerve damage, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, and delayed wound healing.

Although systemic effects are extremely uncommon, there have been rare occurrences of systemic hypercorticoidism after use of topical dermatologic steroids applied to the skin.

Corticosteroid-containing preparations have also been reported to cause acute anterior uveitis and perforation of the globe. Keratitis, conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, mydriasis, conjunctival hyperemia, loss of accommodation and ptosis have occasionally been reported following local use of corticosteroids.

The development of secondary ocular infection (bacterial, fungal and viral) has occurred. Fungal and viral infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion should be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used (see WARNINGS).

Transient burning and stinging upon instillation and other minor symptoms of ocular irritation have been reported with the use of fluorometholone suspension.

Other adverse events reported with the use of fluorometholone include: allergic reactions; foreign body sensation; erythema of eyelid; eyelid edema/eye swelling; eye discharge; eye pain; eye pruritus; lacrimation increased; rash; taste perversion; visual disturbance (blurry vision); and visual field defect.

### Does this patient with acute infectious conjunctivitis have a bacterial infection? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^112ByJSW]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute infectious conjunctivitis is characterized by ocular redness and discharge, and is a common clinical entity. Evidence-based tools to aid the clinical diagnosis of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis are lacking and may contribute to overprescribing of topical antibiotics.

Objective

To determine the relative prevalence of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children, and to determine which symptoms or signs are suggestive of a viral vs bacterial etiology.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (January 1946-March 2022) yielded 1891 articles. Included articles were rated using a quality score based on a modified Rational Clinical Examination grading system. Methodological quality levels 1 through 4 required a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis, whereas quality level 5 (the lowest quality) used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Study Selection

Consecutive series of patients presenting with acute infectious conjunctivitis and case series of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis alone. Thirty-two studies were included in a meta-analysis to determine prevalence and diagnostic accuracy measures; 27 used a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis and 5 used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Results

In studies involving children (5 studies; 881 patients; mean age, 4.7 years [age range, 1 month-18 years]), the prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis was higher than viral conjunctivitis (71% vs 16%, respectively, P = 0.01). In the only study of adults (n = 207 patients; mean age, 25.7 years), the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis was higher than bacterial conjunctivitis (78% vs 16%, respectively, P < .001). For the primary analysis of level 1 (n = 6) and level 2 (n = 5) studies (1725 patients total), the clinical findings that best distinguished a viral etiology for conjunctivitis from a bacterial etiology included pharyngitis (sensitivity range, 0.55–0.58; specificity range, 0.89–0.94; positive likelihood ratio [LR] range, 5.4–9.9), preauricular lymphadenopathy (sensitivity range, 0.17–0.31; specificity range, 0.93–0.94; positive LR range, 2.5–5.6), and contact with another person with red eye (sensitivity, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.14–0.22]; specificity, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90–0.95]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.7]). Mucopurulent ocular discharge (sensitivity, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60–0.87); specificity, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58–0.73]; positive LR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.7–2.6]) and otitis media (sensitivity, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.20–0.29]; specificity, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.85–0.94]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.5–4.4]) were associated with the presence of bacterial conjunctivitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this review, bacterial conjunctivitis was more common than viral conjunctivitis in children and viral conjunctivitis was more common than bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, although the prevalence estimates were based on limited evidence. Symptoms and signs associated with a higher likelihood of viral conjunctivitis in adults and children included concomitant pharyngitis, an enlarged preauricular node, and contact with another person with red eye, and signs associated with a higher likelihood of bacterial conjunctivitis included the presence of mucopurulent discharge and otitis media, but no single symptom or sign differentiated the 2 conditions with high certainty.

### Clinical reasoning: a 62-year-old woman with transient vision loss [^112hVoBu]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Transient visual loss (TVL) is a common complaint in the emergency department, with numerous possible etiologies. Prompt evaluation and management of TVL can potentially prevent progression to permanent visual loss. In this case, a 62-year-old woman presented with acute, painless, unilateral TVL. Two weeks before presentation, the patient reported bitemporal headaches and paresthesia of the distal extremities. A review of systems revealed chronic fatigue, cough, diffuse arthralgias, and decreased appetite for the previous 6 months. This case highlights the diagnostic approach to patients with TVL. Some common and rare causes associated with this clinical manifestation are briefly reviewed.

### Chronic unilateral chemosis following the use of amlodipine besylate [^114b4wdL]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This case report describes a patient with chronic unilateral chemosis, likely due to treatment with amlodipine besylate.

Case Presentation

A 52-year-old man visited the clinic with symptoms of foreign body sensation and puffiness in his right eye, which had persisted for 4 months. There were no other symptoms, such as itching and pain, in his right eye and no specific symptoms in his left eye. He had been treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the previous 5 months with once daily amlodipine besylate/atorvastatin (Caduet) and candesartan cilexetil (Atacand). Examination revealed marked swelling of the inferior bulbar conjunctiva in the right eye. Evaluation revealed no specific causes for the longstanding chemosis. A change of medication to telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Micardis Plus) without amlodipine besylate resulted in significant improvements in his symptoms after 1 month and complete remission after 8 months.

Conclusion

Prior to invasive evaluation including biopsy, specific drugs should be considered as possible causes of idiopathic longstanding conjunctival chemosis.

### Bedside diagnosis of the 'red eye': a systematic review [^111Kvxas]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with red eye, traditional teachings suggest that photophobia, visual blurring, and eye pain indicate serious eye disease; in patients with presumed conjunctivitis, the finding of purulent drainage traditionally indicates a bacterial cause. The accuracy of these teachings is unknown.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was performed to retrieve articles published between 1966 and April 2014 relevant to the bedside diagnosis of serious eye disease and bacterial conjunctivitis.

Results

In patients with red eye, the most useful findings indicating serious eye disease are anisocoria (with the smaller pupil in the red eye and difference between pupil diameters > 1 mm; likelihood ratio [LR], 6.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6–16.3) and photophobia, elicited by direct illumination (LR, 8.3; 95% CI, 2.7–25.9), indirect illumination (LR, 28.8; 95% CI, 1.8–459), or near synkinesis test ("finger-to-nose convergence test", LR, 21.4; 95% CI, 12–38.2). In patients with presumed conjunctivitis, complete redness of the conjunctival membrane obscuring tarsal vessels (LR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.2–17.1), observed purulent discharge (LR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.7–9.1), and matting of both eyes in the morning (LR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.9–6.5) increase the probability of a bacterial cause; failure to observe a red eye at 20 feet (LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0–0.8) and absence of morning gluing of either eye (LR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.8) decrease the probability of a bacterial cause.

Conclusions

Several bedside findings accurately distinguish serious from benign eye disease in patients with red eye and, in patients with presumed conjunctivitis, distinguish bacterial from viral or allergic causes.

### Red eyes and red-flags: improving ophthalmic assessment and referral in primary care [^112LfBMB]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Problem

Between two and five percent of all presentations to general practice are ophthalmic in nature. Red eye is the descriptive term representing inflammation of the anterior segment resulting in vasodilation of the superficial blood vessels, and is the most common ocular presentation in general practice. In most cases, the cause is benign. However, sometimes a red eye may indicate a sight-threatening, or in extreme cases, a life-threatening condition. According to the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE), the benign conditions include bacterial, viral, and allergic conjunctivitis, episcleritis, and subconjunctival haemorrhage. These make up about 70% of the primary care red eye consultations, and are subsequently over-diagnosed. The more common sight-threatening causes of a red eye include keratitis, scleritis, acute glaucoma, foreign body trauma, chemical burns, and orbital cellulitis. Studies have demonstrated that accurate diagnosis of eye conditions is achieved between 16% and 36% of the time, and up to 12% of those misdiagnosed experience adverse outcomes as a result.

In order to ensure that patients attending primary care services with a red eye are managed appropriately and safely, the NICE 'Red Eye' Clinical Knowledge Summary (CKS) specifies that the doctor must 'always document the history and findings of an eye examination (including negative findings). Pain, photophobia, visual acuity, and whether the condition is unilateral or bilateral, are the essential elements to be documented'. The clinician should refer the patient for same-day specialist assessment by an ophthalmologist if any red flag features are present.

The aim of this project was to ensure that an assessment for red-flag features was performed in every patient presenting to their GP with a red eye, and those with red-flag features were appropriately referred to same-day ophthalmology services, as recommended by NICE in the 'Red Eye' CKS. The timeframe within which improvement was to be demonstrated was initially set at eight weeks.

### Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^1138Wf4y]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infectious conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Infectious conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.
- **Pathophysiology**: Viruses account for 80% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis, with most cases caused by adenoviruses. Other viral causes include HSV, VZV, EBV, influenza, enterovirus, and coxsackievirus. Bacterial conjunctivitis is commonly caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Ophthalmia neonatorum is typically caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. Fungal conjunctivitis is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients.
- **Epidemiology**: It is estimated that approximately 6 million cases of acute conjunctivitis occur annually in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include close contact with infected individuals, poor hand hygiene, use of contaminated contact lenses, and exposure to contaminated water.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, infectious conjunctivitis presents with redness, itching, tearing, discharge, and crusting. Bacterial conjunctivitis often presents with purulent discharge, while viral conjunctivitis usually has a watery discharge and may be associated with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Fungal conjunctivitis may present with chronic, indolent symptoms.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most cases of infectious conjunctivitis are self-limiting, lasting 1–2 weeks. Mild bacterial conjunctivitis typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### Virtual consultation for red eye [^113X36wt]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Virtual examination

After a detailed history (box 2), a subsequent video consultation is desirable but may not always be necessary, for example, if a diagnosis can be made confidently (such as conjunctivitis) or if the patient warrants a face-to-face ophthalmic examination (such as corneal infection with severe painful red eye and visual loss).

Box 2
Pointers for history taking in a patient with red eye(s)

Is it painful? Red eye with no pain or only mild discomfort is usually self limiting (fig 1). Painful red eye usually points towards more serious causes such as corneal infection, anterior uveitis, acute angle-closure glaucoma, or scleritis. In the presence of ocular pain, explore the onset, duration, progression, laterality, and severity of the pain. Ask about red flag symptoms that indicate serious conditions (box 1). Photophobia is suggestive of corneal pathologies or anterior uveitis. Pain on eye movements suggests orbital pathology.
Is it unilateral or bilateral? Acute painful red eye conditions — including corneal infection, acute angle-closure glaucoma, and scleritis — often present unilaterally. These are potentially sight threatening. Anterior uveitis may present unilaterally or bilaterally. Unilateral conjunctivitis should be a diagnosis of exclusion, after ruling out any red flag symptoms and signs.
Is there any discharge? Ocular discharge and itching are commonly associated with conjunctivitis. Viral conjunctivitis usually produces watery mucous discharge, whereas bacterial conjunctivitis produces mucopurulent discharge with crusting of the eyelashes.
Is the vision affected? Loss of vision in red eye suggests a more serious cause, particularly when the loss of vision is sudden, severe, or progressive. Reduced visual acuity with painful red eye, halos, and headache are indicative of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Serious red eye conditions such as anterior uveitis and anterior scleritis may not present with visual loss during the initial stage. New onset of double vision with red eye is suggestive of orbital pathologies, including orbital cellulitis and thyroid eye disease.
Any contact lens wear? A painful red eye in contact lens wearers should raise the suspicion of contact lens-related corneal infection. This requires an urgent ophthalmic assessment within 24 hours.

### Diagnosis and management of the acute red eye [^111cZfao]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The red eye is one of the most frequent presenting complaints in the emergency department setting. A wide spectrum of disease processes may present as a red eye, ranging from benign self-limiting etiologies to serious vision-threatening ones. The emergency physician must be adept at recognizing "red flags" from the history and physical examination that necessitate immediate treatment and referral. In addition, it is imperative for the emergency physician to recognize the need for immediate versus elective ophthalmologist consultation for the various conditions. This article includes a discussion of the key historical features, clinical presentations, physical examination findings, and management of the more common causes of the red eye.

### History of facial pain diagnosis [^113qTxRz]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias

The trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) are a group of headache disorders that are characterised by unilateral pain within the trigeminal innervation territory and are associated with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms and signs. These conditions include cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT). These conditions are all characterised by short-lasting pain, some localised in the facial region and some in the head, and accompanied by different autonomic features.

Cluster headache

The best known TAC condition is cluster headache. The first descriptions are variously accredited to van Swieten in 1745, Tulp in 1641 (22), and Harris in 1926 (5), but it was Horton who provided the first description of what was called Horton's histamine headache. Horton described a specific form characterised by headache, facial pain, tearing and running nose and swelling around the eye that could be induced by subcutaneous injection of histamine. A wide variety of names were subsequently used, probably for the same diagnosis, which included among others "ciliary neuralgia", "erythromelalgia of the head", "Sluder's neuralgia", "sphenopalatine neuralgia", and "migrainous neuralgia", but it was Kunkle et al. in 1952 who referred to it as a cluster headache.

SUNCT/SUNA

The first cases of SUNCT were described by Sjaastad in the late 1970s in a local journal, and three cases are described in 1989 by Sjaastad et al. Another condition termed SUNA, short neuralgiform headache with autonomic features, has been added as sometimes autonomic features other than conjunctival injection and tearing are noted. Interestingly, in 1903 Moore already wrote when describing the features of TN that "it may cause the eyes to water and the nose to discharge as well as result in redness in "the track" of the nerve".

Paroxysmal hemicrania

The fourth condition in this group is paroxysmal hemicrania, described as a chronic paroxysmal hemicrania responsive to indomethacin by Sjaastad and Dale in 1974. The condition of hemicrania continua was later described by Sjaastad and Spierings in 1984, in which the headache is continuous.

### Ocular rosacea: an updated review [^115S8XjJ]. Cornea (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies emphasize the importance of considering ocular rosacea as a potential cause of persistent eye redness and relapsing conjunctivitis-blepharitis, particularly in elderly patients. The association between cutaneous rosacea and ocular rosacea can vary, with facial changes as the primary feature in 53% of cases, concurrent skin and ocular changes in 27%, and ocular changes as the primary feature in up to 20% of cases. The severity of ocular symptoms may not correlate with the severity of cutaneous findings, in which symptoms may show periods of exacerbation or remission; however, the disease usually progresses over time.

The 2019 Global ROSacea COnsensus (ROSCO) panel guidelines advocate a comprehensive diagnostic approach for ocular rosacea, encompassing slit-lamp examination, eyelid and meibomian gland assessment, tear film evaluation, and corneal examination. Although ocular symptoms may be nonspecific and subtypes can overlap, a thorough history taking and physical examination are crucial for timely disease recognition and management. Furthermore, recognizing dermatological findings of rosacea in patients with darker skin may be more challenging.

ROSCO provides essential insights into the features and severity assessment of ocular rosaceaand describes various ocular rosacea features, including lid margin telangiectasia, blepharitis, keratitis, conjunctivitis, and anterior uveitis. The consensus also outlines considerations for assessing the severity of these ocular rosacea features. For lid margin telangiectasia, considerations include the degree of vascularization, density, meibomian gland dysfunction, and the presence of evaporative tear dysfunction. In the case of blepharitis, factors such as the degree of eyelid inflammation, pain, and swelling are essential. For keratitis, the assessment includes the location and degree of inflammation, defects in staining (eg, ulceration), foreign body sensation, and pain. Conjunctivitis severity is evaluated based on interpalpebral congestion, the degree of conjunctival injection, and foreign body sensation. Anterior chamber cell count and flare assess anterior uveitis. These considerations are recommendations rather than a consensus due to the limited number of ophthalmologists involved, both of whom either agreed or strongly agreed with the descriptions.

### Kimura's disease successively affecting multiple body parts: a case-based literature review [^116XStyK]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 31-year-old male presented to our institute because of exophthalmos affecting the left eye for 1.5 years; this symptom was accompanied by eye redness, eye swelling and prurigo present on the whole body, but there was no eye pain, diplopia, blurred vision, or other symptoms. The patient used to take small doses of corticosteroids irregularly, which relieved the symptoms, but the symptoms recurred after stopping the drug. The patient stopped taking corticosteroids nearly 1 month before his initial visit. Masses in the cubital fossas and groin had been surgically removed at the local hospital 10 years prior, and the pathology result demonstrated "lymphoproliferative disease". One year later, masses reappeared adjacent to the surgical sites; the masses were slow growing and shrank after the administration of corticosteroids.

The eye examination on admission showed the following: the best-corrected visual acuity of both eyes was 1.0 (international standard visual acuity chart: right eye, -6.50 Spherical Diopter (DS); left eye, -6.00 DS); the non-contact intraocular pressure of both eyes was 17 mmHg; and the exophthalmos values (as measured by a Hertel exophthalmometer) were 14 mm in the right eye and 19 mm in the left eye. The movement of both eyeballs in all directions was normal. Conjunctival congestion and chemosis were observed in the left eye, while no other abnormalities were observed in either eyeball. The general physical examination revealed the following: the masses in the bilateral cubital fossas and groin were palpable, slightly textured, but had distinct borders.

### Eye pain in children [^116zC69Y]. Pediatrics in Review (2016). Low credibility.

Primary care physicians are often the first to see a child with the complaint of eye pain. The eye examination in children is not easy, and the entities that can cause pain in children range from a foreign body in the cornea to the most serious amblyogenic (inducing decreased vision) and life-threatening conditions. Eye pain is a red flag for ocular and systemic conditions, either in a "quiet eye" or "red eye". A detailed history of present illness; pertinent review of systems; close attention to the past medical, family, and social histories; and meticulous physical examination can help to determine the cause, establish the correct treatment, and serve as the basis for referral to a pediatric ophthalmologist if necessary.

### Functional assessment… [^112QzFVa]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Anatomic Assessment EXTERNAL STRUCTURES Clinicians should look for inflammation and erythema of the eyelids, making note of any lesions or abnormalities. A hordeolum is a tender, inflamed nodule and can be observed with careful inspection of the external or internal eyelid. The upper lid should be everted if a corneal abrasion is suspected to look for a foreign body. Orbital cellulitis presents as unilateral erythema, swelling, and ptosis of the eyelid, with associated pain with eye movement and decreased visual acuity. 8 The eyelid and surrounding region should also be inspected for rashes or vesicles. Conjunctival or eyelid vesicles occur in about one-half of patients with HSV keratitis, 30 whereas herpes zoster ophthalmicus leads to associated pain and vesicular lesions appearing in a larger dermatome pattern on the forehead, nose, and upper eyelid.

9, 29 Figure 4 shows slit lamp findings in a patient with herpes zoster ophthalmicus.
31. 20 Episcleritis causes engorgement of the more superficial vessels, which are often sectoral and easily blanched with topical application of phenylephrine.
3. ANTERIOR UVEA The iris and ciliary body make up the anterior uvea. Inflammation of one or both of these structures is considered anterior uveitis. Although hypopyon can often be seen without magnification, a slit lamp is necessary for adequate evaluation. 3 The hallmark of acute anterior uveitis is the presence of white blood cells floating in the aqueous humor of the anterior chamber and a cloudy appearance consistent with a proteinaceous flare. Symptoms include achy eye pain, photophobia, and blurred vision in the involved eye. 25, 32. Optic neuritis warrants neurology and ophthalmology consultation.

Acute management of optic neuritis includes administration of high-dose corticosteroids, which improves short-term recovery and expedites resolution of vision loss. 40 Infectious keratitis necessitates ophthalmologic referral. Recurrent HSV keratitis increases risk of visual loss from corneal damage, 7 and herpes zoster ophthalmicus can cause chronic ocular inflammation, vision loss, and disabling pain. 9.

### Improving acute eye consultations in general practice: a practical approach [^115ZAcN2]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Some indication of whether the symptoms were unilateral or bilateral was recorded in 88% of the consultations. This included consultations that mentioned if the symptoms were in the left or right eye, or in both eyes. Only a small proportion of the consultations actually stated the words "unilateral or bilateral". This means that in 12% of the consultations there was no indication whether the word "eye" meant the left or right eye, or both eyes. See figure 1 and 2 for a visual representation of these results.

Among the cases audited, one patient suffered an adverse event (prolonged pain and delayed treatment) due to being initially misdiagnosed as conjunctivitis. The patient presented with symptoms of a unilateral painful red eye. The attending doctor, a Foundation Year 2 trainee, came to a diagnosis of conjunctivitis and prescribed chloramphenicol eye drops. Three days later, the patient re-presented to another doctor who screened for pain, reduced visual acuity and photophobia. It was noted also that the symptoms were unilateral. It was also found that the patient was in fact, sensitive to light. The doctor carried out fluorescein staining and found a corneal abrasion. This patient was then referred to ophthalmology and started on ofloxacin eye drops. This missed case of a potentially sight-threatening condition highlights the importance of screening for the red flag symptoms and excluding possible differentials before coming to a diagnosis.

All the general practitioners admitted to infrequent use of the Snellen chart, with 40% of the GPs stating that this was simply because there was no Snellen chart in their consultation room. Of the GPs that did have a Snellen chart, 80% did not have the correct distance marked out. The survey of ophthalmoscopes indicated that all GPs had a working ophthalmoscope, which was reassuring.

### Evaluation of a community-based participatory farmworker eye health intervention in the "black dirt" region of New York state [^114afgLC]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Eye irritation is a constant hazard for migrant and seasonal farmworkers, but there are few studies of the problem or how to address it. Researchers evaluated the effect of a community-based participatory eye health intervention on farmworker eye symptoms in the Hudson Valley, NY.

Methods

A randomized pre-post intervention with 2, 4-week follow-up periods was implemented with a sample of 97 farmworkers. Five eye symptoms were measured, along with utilization of protective eyewear and eye drops.

Results

Leading baseline eye symptoms were redness (49%), blurred vision (43%), itching (43%), and eye pain (29%). Significant reductions in eye pain (P = 0.009), and non-significant reductions in redness were observed for the intervention group while controls experienced increases in both.

Conclusions

The intervention was effective in significantly reducing eye pain, and to a lesser extent, redness. Future eyewear promotion programs should offer a range of eye wear, tailor offerings to local climate and tasks, evaluate eyewear durability, and include eye drops.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^117SCu5M]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis diagnosis — initial evaluation and history should include the relevant aspects of the comprehensive medical eye evaluation, but some elements may be deferred in patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of infectious conjunctivitis; questions about the patient history may elicit helpful information on symptoms and signs (e.g., conjunctival injection, mattering and adherence of eyelids, itching, tearing, discharge, irritation, pain, photophobia, blurred vision), duration of symptoms and time course, exacerbating factors, unilateral or bilateral presentation, character of discharge, recent exposure to an infected individual, trauma (mechanical, chemical, ultraviolet), recent surgery, mucus fishing behavior, contact lens wear (lens type, hygiene, and use regimen), symptoms and signs potentially related to systemic diseases, allergy, asthma, eczema, and use of topical and systemic medications; the ocular history includes details about previous episodes of conjunctivitis, concomitant ocular surface diseases, and previous ophthalmic surgery; the medical history considers compromised immune status (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], chemotherapy, immunosuppressants) and current or prior systemic diseases (e.g., atopy, SJS /TEN, carcinoma, leukemia, chicken pox, GVHD), vaccination history; the social history should include smoking habits, exposure to second-hand smoke, occupation and hobbies, exposure to air pollutants, travel, exercise habits, diet, sexual activity, and use of illicit drugs.

A 64-year old Mexican fisherman with previously treated syphilis presented with six weeks of unilateral blurry vision, redness, and pain in his right eye. He endorsed night sweats, but denied cough, purulent eye discharge, headache, trauma, chemical exposures, weight loss, GI symptoms, or rash. A right-eye exam revealed visual acuity to movement only, conjunctival injection, mild photophobia, and inflammation obscuring the retina. The patient was diagnosed with panuveitis in the right eye based on dilated slit lamp (see Fig. 1) and retinal exam findings (not shown). A PPD was 35 × 30 mm, and chest X-ray suggested tuberculosis. The patient's pain and vision improved with 4-drug anti-tuberculous therapy, topical steroids, and cycloplegic eye drops.

### Chronic eyelid and ocular itch [^11634Jr5]. Clinics in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic eyelid and ocular itch affect many patients seeking dermatologic or ophthalmologic care and have a high burden on patient quality of life. Clinicians should consider the broad range of possible diagnoses when approaching the patient with itch of the eyes or eyelids lasting more than 6 weeks. Allergic conjunctivitis and allergic contact dermatitis are the most common causes of chronic itch of the eyes and eyelids, respectively. Other diagnoses to consider include atopic dermatitis, xerosis, neurogenic itch, dry eye syndrome, seborrheic dermatitis, blepharitis, rosacea, lichen simplex chronicus, and papulosquamous disorders. If no organic cause can be elucidated, diagnoses of psychogenic pruritus or chronic pruritus of unknown origin may be considered. Herein, we discuss the possible etiologies of chronic eyelid and ocular itch inclusive of clinical presentation, diagnostic considerations, and current therapies.

### Quality of life during occlusion therapy for amblyopia from the perspective of the children and from that of their parents, as proxy [^114uYeWQ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Amblyopia (lazy eye) has a prevalence of approximately 3.25%. It is defined by best-corrected visual acuity ≥ 0.3 logMAR in the affected eye with a 2 logMAR line difference between the two eyes and with the presence of an amblyogenic factor while there is no underlying structural abnormality of the eye. Amblyopia is treated before the age of eight years by glasses and by occluding the better eye for several hours per day with an occlusion patch. Patching the better eye for several hours may cause complaints of sweating, itching, pain and allergic reaction. The removal of the patch might cause pain and redness around the eye patch. Due to occluding the better eye, the patch could also prohibit daily functioning like writing, seeing on a schoolboard, colouring, drawing and painting, playing on the computer and perceiving obstacles. At a social level the child might feel annoyed and be bullied by other children due to wearing a patch. These aspects may impair the child's health-related quality of life (QoL) during occlusion therapy.

The child's QoL during the occlusion therapy, in addition to the decrease in QoL due to the amblyopia itself, is critical for the cost-effectiveness of population-wide screening and treatment for amblyopia, because so many children get occlusion therapy. Hence, even a minor decrease in the child's quality of life during the amblyopia treatment by occlusion can decrease the overall cost-effectiveness of amblyopia screening and treatment. For the calculation of the cost-effectiveness of screening and treatment of amblyopia, evidence has been collected regarding the effectiveness of the amblyopia screening, the costs of its treatment, the loss in quantified QoL from unilateral visual impairment caused by unsuccessfully treated amblyopia, the increased risk of bilateral visual impairment in unsuccessfully treated amblyopia patients and the loss in quantified QoL when bilateral visual impairment occurs. It has been suggested that the child's quality of life may be decreased so much during occlusion therapy and so many children receive occlusion therapy that screening for amblyopia might not be cost-effective.

### Red eyes and red-flags: improving ophthalmic assessment and referral in primary care [^1153hGZJ]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Up to five percent of primary care consultations are eye-related, yet 96% of General Practitioners (GPs) do not undergo postgraduate ophthalmology training. Most do not feel assured performing eye assessments. Some red eye conditions can become sight threatening, and often exhibit red-flag features. These features include moderate pain, photophobia, reduced visual acuity (VA), eye-trauma, or unilateral marked redness. The aim of this project was to improve primary care assessment and referral of patients presenting with red-flag features based on the NICE 'Red Eye' Clinical Knowledge Summary recommendations.

Data was collected retrospectively from 139 red eye consultations. A practice meeting highlighted poor awareness of red-flag features, low confidence levels in eye assessments, and time-constraints during appointments. Interventions were based on feedback from staff. These included a primary care teaching session on red-flag features, a VA measurement tutorial, and provision of a red eye toolkit, including VA equipment, to each consultation room.

At baseline, each patient had on average 0.9 red-flag features assessed. Only 36.0% (9/25) of patients with red-flag features were appropriately referred to same-day ophthalmology services. Following two improvement cycles, a significant improvement was seen in almost every parameter. On average, each patient had 2.7 red-flag features assessed (vs 0.9, p < 0.001). VA was assessed in 55.6% of consultations (vs 7.9%, p < 0.001), pain was quantified in 81.5% (vs 20.9%, p = 0.005), eye-trauma or foreign-body (51.8% vs 8.6%, p < 0.001), extent of redness was documented in 66.7% (vs 14.4%, p < 0.001). Only photophobia remained poorly assessed (18.5% vs 14.4%, p = 0.75). Following this, 75.0% (6/8) of patients were appropriately referred.

This project reflected the literature regarding low confidence and inexperience amongst GPs when faced with ophthalmic conditions. Improvements in education are required to ensure accurate assessments can be undertaken in a time-constrained environment.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^115HvnCi]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Examination

Some initial diagnosis is necessary to exclude any potentially serious cause of acute red eye. Historical features for evaluation include pain or photophobia, which can be signs of bacterial keratitis, anterior uveitis, or acute angle-closure glaucoma. Associated symptoms such as upper respiratory tract infection, or known exposure to others who have presented with this, suggest a viral form of conjunctivitis. Patient history of ocular trauma should be considered as a potential alternative cause of inflammation. A corneal abrasion resulting from a foreign body or exposure to the sun or ultraviolet light can present as red eye. Red, painful and watery eyes due to corneal or conjunctival foreign bodies can masquerade as acute and chronic forms of conjunctivitis. Presence of a foreign body is elucidated via history, and by careful biomicroscopic exam. In those who wear contact lenses, the risk of corneal involvement and bacterial keratitis is high; therefore, these individuals should be referred to an eye care provider. Some signs and symptoms of acute infectious conjunctivitis are mimicked by dry eye disease such as hyperemia, grittiness and stinging. Adhering to the triage questions and risk factor analysis recommended by the Tear Film & Ocular Surface Society Dry Eye Workshop II (TFOS DEWS II)aids the exclusion of dry eye disease, although it may coexist with acute infectious conjunctivitis owing to the high prevalence of both conditions. Of the immune-mediated forms of conjunctivitis (eg, ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid, graft-versus-host disease, Stevens-Johnson syndrome), generally early and milder manifestations of immune-mediated conjunctivopathy may share symptomatology with acute infectious conjunctivitis because of the presence of nonspecific complaints (eg, redness, tearing, clear discharge) and conjunctival injection. However, these types of conjunctivitis often differ from viral conjunctivitis in their time course; they are generally protracted and more easily confused with a chronic process rather than an acute episode.

### Ophthalmological and biological features of the oculorespiratory syndrome after influenza vaccination [^112CbpB1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

We report the ophthalmological and laboratory findings of 6 patients who, after influenza vaccination, were affected by oculorespiratory syndrome (ORS), complaining of red eyes, photophobia, blurred vision, palpebral edema, ocular pain and itching, and conjunctival secretions. The conjunctivae were mildly hyperemic with few follicles, but the ophthalmological examination findings were otherwise normal. Patients had lymphopenia and decreased levels of the total hemolytic complement and the third and fourth component of the complement. We conclude that ORS causes conjunctivitis and seems to involve the complement.

### Recurrent nodular episcleritis as a manifestation of long COVID [^112RRA9K]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A woman in her 50s presented with redness, eye pain, watering and photophobia of the left eye starting 1week after she tested positive for COVID-19. She was diagnosed with left eye episcleritis and started on topical steroids. As the steroids were being gradually tapered, she developed a recurrence. The cycle of treatment-tapering-recurrence repeated itself such that nine episodes were noted within a span of 3 years. An exhaustive diagnostic work-up including infective and autoimmune blood tests, rheumatology assessment and COVID-19 conjunctival swabs and tear samples were done, and no underlying conditions or triggers could be identified, attributing 'long COVID' as the likely causative. Long COVID is the continuation or development of new symptoms after the initial COVID-19 infection, with no other explanation. It is estimated to affect nearly 65million people worldwide, with > 200 symptoms, involving different organ systems. The ocular manifestations of long COVID are less well-known.

Uveal tract

Uveitis

Uveitis is a type of intraocular inflammation affecting the middle layer of the eye known as the uveal tract. Typically, uveitis is suspected if one presents with ocular redness, pain, photophobia, deteriorating vision or floaters. The ocular sign is commonly seen in patients with sarcoidosis (figure 2H), and may be accompanied by conjunctiva nodules (small, yellowish, millet seed-sized nodules primarily located in the palpebral conjunctiva or on the lacrimal gland). Identifying the presence of cardiac involvements in these patients remains challenging yet essential as it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Cardiac sarcoidosis is a diagnosis of exclusion that relies heavily on effective clinical history and examination to support the use of appropriate investigations. Cardinal features of cardiac sarcoidosis include AV blocks, ventricular arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy. The presence of uveitis and conduction system disease such as high-degree AV block should be considered sarcoidosis until proven otherwise. Patients may also present with other rarer cardiac manifestations such as pericardial effusion, mitral regurgitation and atrial arrhythmias. 25

Retina

The microvasculature found in the retina is prone to be affected by a wide range of diseases. Occlusion of the blood vessels results in retinal artery occlusion or retinal vein occlusion. In both, patients generally present with unilateral painless visual loss. Ophthalmoscopy is useful to help differentiate the two conditions. In retinal artery occlusion, an opaque fundus with red fovea (cherry-red spot) is typically seen (figure 2I). Often, an embolus such as Hollenhorst plaque (a cholesterol embolus) may be visible. A relative afferent pupillary defect can also be elicited. Echocardiography should be performed to identify an embolic source. In contrast, widespread haemorrhages and tortuous veins accompanied by retinal oedema are seen in retinal vein occlusion (figure 2J). These patients may also present with hypertension, which is a major risk factor for the condition. While they should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a thorough evaluation, cardiologists should be aware that they are at significantly increased risk of cardiovascular complications including CAD, AF and valvular heart diseases. Roth spots (white centred retinal haemorrhage) (figure 2K) are seen with multiple pathologies including endocarditis, pre-eclampsia, hypertension, myeloma and carbon monoxide poisoning. Awareness of variability in retinal and general funduscopy appearance between ethnicities should be factored with evaluation.

### Thygeson's superficial punctate keratitis (TSPK): a paediatric case report and review of the literature [^1176c9g5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and differential diagnoses

The clinical symptoms and signs are the diagnostic basis for TSPK. According to Thygeson's summary, the diagnostic features of TSPK are as follows: (1) the presence of bilateral punctate epithelial keratitis; (2) a chronic course with exacerbations and remissions; (3) healing without scar formation; (4) no response to antibiotics; and (5) a striking symptomatic response to topical corticosteroids. No definitive diagnostic criteria have been proposed to date.

TSPK needs to be carefully differentiated from other types of keratitis, especially bacterial and viral keratitis. In TSPK, there is no obvious conjunctival hyperaemia or increased secretion, and bacterial culture is negative, distinguishing TSPK from bacterial infection. However, TSPK is often misdiagnosed as viral keratitis because the lesions associated with TSPK are similar to the corneal infiltrates of viral keratitis, especially during the early stage. In patients with viral keratitis, there is generally a history of weakened immunity, presenting as chills, fatigue, etc. Without intervention, the lesions in the corneal epithelium may aggravate to subepithelial oedema and subepithelial infiltration. In addition, unilateral viral keratitis is more common than unilateral TSPK.

Microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis presents with corneal lesions similar to that of TSPK. However, it is accompanied by mild non-suppurative papillary or follicular conjunctivitis, and it is mostly unilateral. Moreover, a positive smear for microsporidial spores is the criterion for diagnosing microsporidial keratitis.

Notably, children with TSPK have an obvious foreign body sensation and rub their eyes frequently, which may lead to other secondary infectious ocular surface diseases. In the current case, during the second visit, the child was misdiagnosed with BKC because of the presence of blepharitis. Blepharokeratoconjunctivitis (BKC), which is usually caused by gram-positive organisms, is an infectious disease that is manifested by inflammation of the eyelids and the front of the eye. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are the common pathogenic organisms. The symptoms of children with BKC include tearing, itching and red eyes. Cornea scars can develop if not treated effectively for a long time, causing the loss of vision.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patient education — Educate patients about the prognosis and potential value of treatment as appropriate for their visual and functional status; encourage patients with early AMD or a family history of AMD to assess their own visual acuity using monocular vision testing and to have regular dilated eye exams for early detection of intermediate AMD; educate patients with a high-risk AMD phenotype about detecting new symptoms of MNV and the need for prompt notification to an ophthalmologist; instruct patients with unilateral disease to monitor the fellow eye and to return periodically even without symptoms, but promptly after onset of new or significant visual symptoms; instruct patients to report symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, including eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or decreased vision, increased sensitivity to light, or increased number of floaters promptly; and strongly recommend to patients who are currently smoking to stop because there are observational data that support a causal relationship between smoking and AMD and other considerable health benefits of smoking cessation.

A 64-year-old Mexican fisherman with a history of syphilis is diagnosed with panuveitis of the right eye after presenting with unilateral blurry vision, redness, and pain. A PPD was 35 × 30 mm, and chest X-ray suggested tuberculosis. The patient's pain and vision improved with 4-drug anti-tuberculous therapy, topical steroids, and cycloplegic eye drops.
