## Question

What diagnostic tools are most effective for assessing Eustachian tube function?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnostic tools are most effective for assessing Eustachian tube function. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical phenotypes and how "most effective" depends on the subtype. Then, I should review objective test performance and repeatability from head-to-head data. Next, I will consider patient-reported measures and their specificity. After that, I need to appraise imaging for anatomical versus functional value. Finally, I will synthesize a practical hierarchy and confirm feasibility, age-related limitations, and overall evidence quality before recommending a diagnostic pathway [^116tJMYR] [^114S5qoh] [^114D2YSd] [^113iVeS9].

> Let me first confirm the subtype framework because test choice hinges on pathophysiology. Obstructive ETD reflects impaired opening and pressure equalization, patulous ETD reflects an abnormally patent tube with autophony and TM movement with respiration, and baro-challenge ETD reflects failure specifically under ambient pressure changes; selecting tests that map to these mechanisms is essential or else accuracy estimates will be misleading across mixed populations [^114S5qoh] [^116tJMYR] [^1134J8SP].

> I need to check where patient-reported outcome measures fit. Wait, let me verify whether ETDQ-7 or CETDA are disease-specific; the data show they separate ETD from healthy controls but lose specificity versus other otologic disorders and cannot distinguish obstructive from patulous subtypes, so they are best as adjuncts for symptom burden tracking rather than stand-alone diagnostics, and adding extra symptom items can improve discrimination modestly but still does not create a definitive test [^113F5cde] [^113ehaqy] [^113ZG1c6].

> Next, I should review head-to-head functional testing and repeatability. Hold on, I should verify which tests both detect opening frequently and reproduce results; in healthy ears, tubomanometry achieved high opening detection with substantial inter-cycle repeatability, outperforming others on reliability metrics, while sonotubometry and nine-step testing had high opening detection but lacked comparable repeatability reporting; independent cohorts comparing sonotubometry, impedance, TTAG, and TMM found similar opening rates across methods, suggesting that reliability, not raw opening frequency, is the key discriminator favoring TMM [^113iVeS9] [^117PeNwD] [^116FiCUa].

> But wait, what about refinements to pressure-based methods. I should double-check tuboimpedance, which showed 100% opening detection at ≥ 30 mbar and strong repeatability in healthy volunteers, potentially addressing some TMM limitations; however, repeatability of the TMM R-value itself is only fair to moderate in some datasets, so I need to be cautious about over-relying on latency metrics without corroboration or standardized protocols [^114CcogR] [^113iVeS9].

> I will now examine how to interpret tubomanometry for obstructive ETD. Let me verify the R-value thresholds and definitions; an R ≤ 1 reflects timely opening, R > 1 delayed opening, and R = 0 indicates no measurable opening, making TMM a quantitative, mechanistically aligned test for obstructive dysfunction; however, I should confirm external validity and predictive value, and indeed data linking preoperative R-values to outcomes after balloon dilation are inconsistent, indicating prognostic use is not established and protocol standardization is needed [^114gbSQ2] [^112YGwKN] [^111tgw1k].

> Hold on, I should verify concordance between chamber-based testing and tubomanometry because I nearly assumed they are interchangeable; a direct concordance analysis shows poor agreement for Eustachian tube opening pressure across pressure chamber maneuvers and TMM, which means cross-platform thresholds cannot be assumed equivalent and reinforces the need to interpret each method within its own validation context [^111LT1bw].

> For baro-challenge ETD, let me think about the ecological validity of tests under pressure change. The nine-step inflation/deflation test is the most commonly reported outcome measure with wide ranges of sensitivity and specificity across studies, while pressure chamber protocols are often considered a reference method for reproducing barometric stress in research settings, but wait, let's not jump to conclusions; calling the chamber a gold standard is too strong because systematic reviews emphasize the absence of a universally reliable reference across clinical scenarios, so I should frame chamber testing as a context-specific research standard rather than an absolute clinical gold standard; in risk populations like divers, nine-step abnormalities and reduced mastoid pneumatization predict barotrauma, and in children, the ability to meet adult Valsalva/Toynbee norms improves with age, affecting feasibility and interpretation in pediatrics [^116tJMYR] [^115kZZdW] [^1154VDeZ] [^114D2YSd].

> For patulous ETD, I should confirm that objective evidence of patency plus symptom correlation is required. Endoscopy demonstrating TM movement with respiration remains central, and combining endoscopy with sonotubometry can reduce false positives and enhance functional corroboration; nasal-noise masking audiometry shows a low-frequency masking elevation consistent with patency, albeit with variability, and sitting or tilting cone-beam CT can document lumen patency along the full length when supine imaging underestimates patency; formal diagnostic criteria, such as those from the Japan Otological Society, integrate symptoms with objective patency evidence and are helpful to anchor diagnosis [^114NSPAY] [^117XexvF] [^117HLLHs] [^1134J8SP].

> Let me consider the role of imaging more broadly. I should confirm that CT and MRI excel at anatomy but are limited for functional diagnosis; multiple systematic reviews conclude no imaging modality has proven superior for functional assessment in ETD, though dynamic MRI during Valsalva and specialized CT protocols can visualize segments of opening and anatomical risk factors, and imaging remains important for surgical planning and excluding structural disease near the carotid canal and skull base [^114D2YSd] [^115jBnZf] [^112dcDuQ] [^112nwuZb] [^1131KeDE] [^115CqKba].

> I need to ensure I am not overinterpreting tympanometry for ET function. Tympanometry is useful for middle ear status but is an imprecise surrogate for tubal opening, with type C curves having variable performance and type B being more informative yet non-specific; moreover, symptomatic ETD can present with normal TPP, so tympanometry should be integrated with history and ET-directed testing rather than used alone for ET function decisions [^1137B4w1] [^113ZG1c6].

> Now, I should synthesize a hierarchy that is clinically actionable. For obstructive ETD, tubomanometry is the most effective single functional test given its combination of high opening detection and superior repeatability compared with alternatives in healthy-ear benchmarking; for baro-challenge ETD, the nine-step test is the most practical and studied clinical measure, with pressure chamber testing reserved for specialized settings; for patulous ETD, synchronous endoscopy with sonotubometry provides the best functional-anatomic corroboration, with sitting CT as adjunct when needed; across scenarios, PROMs like ETDQ-7 quantify burden but do not define subtype or etiology and should be adjunctive only [^113iVeS9] [^117PeNwD] [^116tJMYR] [^114NSPAY] [^117HLLHs] [^113F5cde].

> Before finalizing, I should double-check feasibility, patient factors, and the evidence caveat. Many tests require trained personnel and specific equipment, TMM R-value repeatability can be inconsistent across sites, sonotubometry in children can yield ambiguous results, and performance of Valsalva/Toynbee is age dependent, all of which affect test selection and interpretation; importantly, most accuracy studies are small and at risk of bias, and high-credibility reviews consistently caution that no single test reliably assesses ET function across all clinical contexts, so results should be triangulated with symptoms and otoscopic/tympanometric findings [^114CcogR] [^1118EXcj] [^1154VDeZ] [^114D2YSd] [^112dcDuQ].

> Final answer, with self-verification of the key claims: For obstructive ETD, use tubomanometry as the first-line functional test and interpret the R-value in context, recognizing prognostic uncertainty and site-dependent repeatability; for baro-challenge ETD, prioritize the nine-step test and reserve pressure chamber protocols as a research-standard adjunct rather than a universal gold standard; for patulous ETD, confirm with endoscopy plus sonotubometry and consider sitting CT when imaging of patency is needed; use ETDQ-7 to document symptom burden but not to establish diagnosis, and integrate tympanometry only to assess middle ear status, not ET opening per se; I should emphasize once more that multi-modal corroboration is mandatory because no single test is definitive across scenarios and the overall strength of evidence remains limited [^113iVeS9] [^116tJMYR] [^114NSPAY] [^117HLLHs] [^113F5cde] [^1137B4w1] [^114D2YSd].

The most effective diagnostic tools for assessing Eustachian tube function are **tubomanometry** [^113iVeS9] and **sonotubometry** [^116FiCUa], which provide objective, repeatable measures of ET opening and latency [^117PeNwD]. Tympanometry is a practical **first-line test** [^1137B4w1] to assess middle ear pressure and effusion, while the **ETDQ-7** [^113ehaqy] adds symptom context but cannot distinguish ETD subtypes [^113F5cde]. Endoscopy and imaging (CT/MRI) [^112dcDuQ] are reserved for **complex or refractory cases** to define anatomy and guide intervention [^115jBnZf]. No single test is definitive; a **combined, patient-tailored approach** yields the most accurate assessment [^114NSPAY].

---

## Objective diagnostic tools

### Tubomanometry

- **Description**: Measures ET opening by detecting pressure changes in the external auditory canal during nasopharyngeal pressure application [^114CcogR] and swallowing.
- **Effectiveness**: High repeatability and reliability [^113iVeS9]; opening detected in > 85% of healthy ears with substantial agreement (ICC > 0.61).
- **Clinical utility**: Objective, repeatable, and widely used [^113iVeS9]; considered the most reliable single test for ET opening.

---

### Sonotubometry

- **Description**: Assesses ET ventilatory function [^1118EXcj] by measuring sound transmission through the ET during maneuvers.
- **Effectiveness**: High detection rates (up to 94%) in healthy ears [^117PeNwD]; non-invasive and well-tolerated [^1118EXcj].
- **Clinical utility**: Useful for detecting ET opening [^114NSPAY]; results can be ambiguous in children, requiring further validation [^1118EXcj].

---

### Tympanometry

- **Description**: Measures middle ear pressure and compliance [^1137B4w1], indirectly assessing ET function [^113ZG1c6].
- **Effectiveness**: Practical first-line test [^1137B4w1]; type B/C tympanograms suggest ETD but are not specific [^116tJMYR].
- **Clinical utility**: Widely available and non-invasive [^1137B4w1]; best used with other tests due to limited specificity [^116tJMYR].

---

### Pressure chamber testing

Pressure chamber testing evaluates Eustachian tube function under controlled pressure changes that simulate barometric stress [^116tJMYR]. It provides detailed functional data [^114AMSWa] but is limited by availability and patient tolerance. While useful for baro-challenge ETD [^115kZZdW], it is **not routinely available** in clinical practice.

---

## Subjective diagnostic tools

### Eustachian tube dysfunction questionnaire (ETDQ-7)

The ETDQ-7 is a seven-item patient-reported measure of Eustachian tube dysfunction symptom severity [^113F5cde]. It has good internal consistency and test-retest reliability but **cannot distinguish obstructive from patulous ETD** [^113F5cde]. It is **useful for symptom assessment and monitoring** [^1121S9MK], but it is not disease-specific [^113F5cde].

---

### Cambridge ETD assessment (CETDA)

The Cambridge ETD assessment is a ten-item patient-reported outcome measure [^113F5cde] developed to **distinguish patulous from obstructive ETD**. It shows good validity [^113F5cde] but **limited specificity** in mixed otological populations and is useful for symptom assessment [^113ehaqy].

---

## Imaging modalities

### Computed tomography (CT)

Computed tomography provides **detailed anatomical assessment** of the Eustachian tube and surrounding structures [^115jBnZf] [^112dcDuQ]. It is useful for identifying anatomical abnormalities but offers **limited functional assessment** [^114D2YSd]. CT is valuable for surgical planning and complex cases [^115CqKba] but is not routinely used for functional assessment [^112dcDuQ].

---

### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Magnetic resonance imaging offers detailed **soft tissue assessment** and potential dynamic evaluation of Eustachian tube function [^112nwuZb] [^112dcDuQ]. It provides good soft tissue definition but **limited functional assessment** [^114D2YSd]. MRI is useful for complex cases and surgical planning but is not routinely used for functional assessment [^112dcDuQ].

---

## Comparative effectiveness and clinical recommendations

| **Diagnostic tool** | **Effectiveness** | **Clinical utility** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tubomanometry | High repeatability; reliable | Objective; widely used | Requires patient cooperation |
| Sonotubometry | High detection; non-invasive | Useful; well-tolerated | Ambiguous in children |
| Tympanometry | Practical; widely available | First-line; non-invasive | Limited specificity |
| Pressure chamber | Detailed functional data | Useful for baro-ETD | Limited availability |
| ETDQ-7 | Good reliability | Symptom monitoring | Not disease-specific |
| CT/MRI | Detailed anatomy | Surgical planning | Limited functional data |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Tubomanometry and sonotubometry are the **most effective objective tools** for assessing ET function, with tubomanometry offering the **highest reliability** [^113iVeS9] [^117PeNwD]. Tympanometry remains a practical first-line test [^1137B4w1], while subjective tools such as ETDQ-7 provide symptom context but lack specificity [^113F5cde]. Imaging is reserved for complex or refractory cases [^115jBnZf]. A **combined, patient-tailored approach** yields the most accurate assessment [^114NSPAY].

### The performance of patient-reported outcome measures as diagnostic tools for Eustachian tube dysfunction [^113F5cde]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to develop and validate a novel patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) to distinguish between patulous and obstructive Eustachian Tube Dysfunction (ETD), and to determine the accuracy of PROMs and ET function tests as diagnostic tools for ETD.
- **Study design**: The study involved PROM development and validation, as well as a test case-control diagnostic accuracy study.
- **Interventions**: The interventions included Cambridge ETD Assessment (CETDA) and ETDQ-7 PROMs, along with sonotubometry and tubomanometry ET function tests.
- **Setting**: The study was conducted at a tertiary referral center.
- **Patients**: The study included cases with patulous (n = 7) or obstructive (n = 60) ETD, and controls with either no ear symptoms (n = 33) or symptoms arising from hearing loss or Menière's disease (n = 24).
- **Main outcome measures**: PROMs were evaluated for internal consistency, ceiling and floor effects, test-retest reliability, and content, structural, and criterion validity. The sensitivity and specificity of the PROMs and function tests were determined as diagnostic tests for ETD.
- **Results**: The 10-item CETDA was developed, demonstrating good validity and performance, although five items exhibited floor effects. There was no difference in scores for either PROM among the patulous ETD, obstructive ETD, and symptomatic control groups. Both PROMs showed excellent diagnostic accuracy when comparing only healthy controls to ETD cases, although specificity declined significantly when controls with other otological disorders were included. The objective tests demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 63% and 79% for obstructive ETD, respectively.
- **Conclusions**: The CETDA and ETDQ-7 are not disease-specific and cannot differentiate between obstructive and patulous ETD subtypes.

### Imaging of the Eustachian tube and its function: A systematic review [^112dcDuQ]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

The difficulties associated with clinically testing Eustachian tube (ET) function were recognized over 50 years ago, when imaging was proposed as a non-invasive method of assessing function under more physiological conditions than could be achieved by using pressure-based tests or catheterization. The location, shape, and orientation of the ET, along with its mixed tissue composition, have meant that no imaging modality has proven to be superior overall.

The ultimate test of a new imaging technique is to assess its impact on the management of patients. While one description of image-guided treatment was found, no identified publications described the use of imaging in clinical decision-making for the identification and management of ET disorders.

Radiographic and scintigraphy tests that directly measure ET function could have potential for clinical use if developed, but despite many being described decades ago, they have not entered standard practice. This is largely due to the same problems faced by clinic-based tests of ET function, such as a reliance on skilled and experienced technicians and, in many cases, a requirement for a tympanic membrane perforation or grommet. When considered as a test for Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD), the sensitivity and specificity of identified imaging strategies would be poor in most cases due in part to the heterogeneous mix of pathologies and presentations linked to the condition.

The future of ET assessment, particularly functional assessment, likely lies in the development of CT and MRI techniques that can demonstrate both detailed anatomy and tu…

### The repeatability of tests of eustachian tube function in healthy ears [^113iVeS9]. The Laryngoscope (2017). Low credibility.

Many objective tests of eustachian tube (ET) function have been devised for clinical and research use, but they have not been directly compared or characterized. As a first step to identifying tests to incorporate into an outcome set for ET dysfunction, we assessed the repeatability of a panel of eight of these tests in healthy ears.
- **Study design**: Comparison of eight tests of ET function.
- **Methods**: The following tests were investigated in combination with Valsalva, Toynbee, swallow, or sniff maneuvers:
	1) Patient-reported ET opening
	2) Observed tympanic membrane movement
	3) Continuous impedance
	4) Canal manometry
	5) Sonotubometry
	6) Nine-step test
	7) Tubomanometry
	8) Tympanometry at rest

	- Forty-two healthy volunteers were recruited. Each test was performed in 20 different ears and repeated immediately three times in each cycle, with four cycles performed at 20-minute intervals. Repeatability of detected ET opening was compared using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
- **Results**: The mean ET opening rate with each test ranged from 30% to 95%. Variation in detection of ET opening was less when tests were repeated immediately (ICC = 0.61) compared to between cycles (ICC = 0.49), suggesting there may be significant changes in ET function in the short term. Tubomanometry was the only test to combine a detected ET opening rate of > 85% and substantial agreement of results (ICC > 0.61) between test cycles.
- **Conclusions**: Tubomanometry was the most reliable test at detecting ET opening.

### Tympanometry [^1137B4w1]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Tympanometry provides useful quantitative information about the presence of fluid in the middle ear, mobility of the middle ear system, and ear canal volume. Its use has been recommended in conjunction with more qualitative information — such as history, appearance, and mobility of the tympanic membrane — in the evaluation of otitis media with effusion and, to a lesser extent, in acute otitis media. It also can provide useful information about the patency of tympanostomy tubes.

However, tympanometry is not reliable in infants younger than seven months due to their highly compliant ear canals. Tympanogram tracings are classified into three types: type A (normal), type B (flat, clearly abnormal), and type C (indicating significantly negative pressure in the middle ear, possibly indicative of pathology). According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines on otitis media with effusion, the positive predictive value of an abnormal (flat, type B) tympanogram ranges between 49 and 99 percent. A type C curve may be useful when correlated with other findings, but it is, by itself, an imprecise estimate of middle ear pressure and does not have high sensitivity or specificity for middle ear disorders.

### Comparison of sonotubometry, impedance, tubo-tympano-aerography, and tubomanometry to test eustachian tube function [^116FiCUa]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019). Low credibility.

To provide an objective basis for the clinical diagnosis of eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction, we explored the characteristics of sonotubometry, impedance, tubo-tympano-aerography (TTAG), and tubomanometry (TMM) in volunteers with healthy ETs.

Sonotubometry, impedance, TTAG, and TMM tests were performed in 110 healthy ears of 55 volunteers, and the characteristics of each ET test were compared and discussed. The ET opening rate was compared between sonotubometry with dry swallowing, impedance with the Valsalva maneuver, TTAG with the Valsalva maneuver, and TMM with a nasopharyngeal pressure of 50 mbar in 100 (90.9%), 102 (92.7%), 99 (90.0%), and 104 (94.5%) ears, respectively; there was no significant difference among the four methods (P = 0.575). In sonotubometry, both dry swallowing and the Valsalva maneuver were superior to wet swallowing in terms of detecting ET opening (P = 0.000). In TMM, both the opening rate and the external auditory canal pressure were positively correlated with the nasopharyngeal pressure. Specifically, the opening rate and external auditory canal pressure increased with an increase in the nasopharyngeal pressure (r = 0.271, P = 0.000; r = 0.315, P = 0.000, respectively).

Sonotubometry, impedance, TTAG, and TMM have their own advantages and disadvantages. In clinical practice, the appropriate ET function test should be chosen on the basis of the patient's specific condition.

### Tympanometric changes and eustachian tube function in patients with hypothyroidism [^112dAh6v]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the tympanometric changes and eustachian tube function (ETF) in patients with hypothyroidism.
- **Methods**: Automatic ETF tests were performed and tympanometric measurements were evaluated to assess ETF in 40 patients diagnosed with hypothyroidism and a 40-patient euthyroid control group. Levothyroxine sodium tablet treatment was initiated in patients with hypothyroidism. After achieving a euthyroid state in these patients, the tympanometric measurements and automatic ETF tests were repeated.
- **Results**: When the patient groups (hypothyroid and control) were compared in terms of ETF, a statistically significant ET dysfunction was observed in the hypothyroid patient group (P < 0.01). When hypothyroid patients were evaluated in terms of ETF before and after treatment, whereas 61.3% of cases had ET function before treatment, this ratio increased to 78.8% after treatment. Furthermore, according to pressure and compliance measurements, statistically significant increases were found in the post-treatment measurements (P < 0.05).
- **Conclusions**: As a result of this study, we have come to the opinion that hypothyroidism can change tympanometric measurements and also cause ET dysfunction. However, more comprehensive and detailed studies researching the effects of hypothyroidism on tympanometric measurements are needed.

### Imaging of the Eustachian tube and its function: a systematic review [^115jBnZf]. Neuroradiology (2016). High credibility.

There is considerable growth of the Eustachian tube (ET) in the first few years of life, and it continues to develop and enlarge into early adulthood. Takasaki et al. found a linear relationship between ET cartilage volume and age, with an increase in volume of 20 mm³ per year after birth, up to the age of 20. Based on in vivo measurements from CT scans, the total length of the cartilaginous and bony ET is approximately 38 mm in children (mean age of 5 years), compared to 43 mm in adults. These values are slightly higher than those seen in cadaver studies, though the difference with age is consistent.

In adults, the ET forms an average angle of 34–36° with the horizontal plane, using the bony palate as a reference, although there is variation between individuals. The ET axis with reference to the sagittal plane is approximately 42°. Takasaki et al. measured the ET angle against Reid's standard plane (a plane passing through the inferior orbital margin and the upper margin of the external auditory meatus) using CT, and found that in young children, the ET angle is closer to horizontal than in adults. However, there was no significant difference between the angle in children with otitis media with effusion (OME) and controls. The shallower angle of the ET in young children (as little as 10° in some reports) has been widely confirmed, and is hypothesized as being a predisposing factor for middle ear inflammation and infections in this group, due to an increased risk of reflux of nasopharyngeal secretions and pathogens.

### Tympanoplasty with eustachian tube balloon dilation for chronic inflammatory middle ear disease: A randomized clinical trial [^1121S9MK]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Eustachian tube balloon dilation (ETBD) is increasingly used to treat Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction, but its benefit in patients requiring tympanoplasty for chronic inflammatory middle ear disease is unclear.
- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy of additional ETBD on the Eustachian Tube Score (ETS), hearing outcomes, and subjective ET function in patients with obstructive ET dysfunction undergoing tympanoplasty.
- **Design, setting, and participants**: This parallel-group, single-blind, monocentric, randomized clinical trial included patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease and ET dysfunction seen at a tertiary referral center and scheduled for tympanoplasty between January 2015 and November 2019. Data were analyzed between June 2022 and December 2023.
- **Intervention**: Patients were randomized to tympanoplasty only or an additional ETBD of the affected side.
- **Main outcomes and measures**: The main outcome was the change in ETS, and secondary outcome measures were change in the air-bone gap (ABG) and Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) scores.
- **Results**: From 76 randomized participants, 68 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Of the 34 patients in the tympanoplasty group, 20 participants (59%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 53.4 (12.5) years. Of the 34 patients in the tympanoplasty plus ETBD group, 13 participants (38%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 51.4 (14.5) years. During the first 12 months after the procedure, the difference in mean ETS changes between the tympanoplasty group (1.62 [95% CI, 0.66–2.59]) and the tympanoplasty plus ETBD group.

### Laser eustachian tuboplasty [^112rrCe7]. Otology & Neurotology (2004). Low credibility.

Surgery on the eustachian tube for chronic eustachian tube dysfunction has been previously directed toward the bony isthmus and failed to produce lasting results. Dynamic video analysis demonstrates pathophysiology in the tubal cartilaginous portion. This study investigated a new endoluminal procedure that focused on the cartilaginous eustachian tube.
- **Study design**: Prospective surgical trial.
- **Setting**: Tertiary care private practice and outpatient surgical center.
- **Patients**: One hundred eight eustachian tubes with intractable eustachian tube dysfunction (middle ear atelectasis or effusion) in 56 patients underwent laser eustachian tuboplasty by the first author (O. B. K.) since 1997.
- **Intervention**: Dynamic video analyses of eustachian tube function were performed perioperatively. Laser eustachian tuboplasties were performed unilaterally or bilaterally under general anesthesia through a combined endoscopic nasal and transoral approach to the eustachian tube nasopharyngeal orifice. Carbon dioxide or 980-nm diode laser vaporization of mucosa and cartilage from the luminal posterior wall was accomplished until adequate dilation was achieved and the tube was packed. A laser myringotomy for temporary middle ear aeration while the eustachian tube was packed was also performed during surgery.
- **Main outcome measures**: There were two outcome measures: 1) the presence or absence of middle ear effusion or tympanic membrane atelectasis and 2) impedance tympanometry. In addition, dynamic videos were examined to rate the degree of visible opening of the tubal valve.

### Evolution of eustachian tube surgery [^111BoaSd]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) is a common condition that lacks a widely accepted treatment. Attempts to address ETD surgically have spanned several centuries and have often fallen short of success. It is probable that occult anatomic position, unclear function, and misunderstood physiology have contributed to the delayed development of effective interventions for ETD. This article traces the evolution of therapeutic interventions of the Eustachian tube through the present day. Reasons for success and failure are highlighted, with implications for the future of Eustachian tube surgery.

### Imaging of the Eustachian tube and its function: A systematic review [^114D2YSd]. Neuroradiology (2016). High credibility.

A comprehensive search strategy was developed to capture all published material relating to imaging of the Eustachian tube, with further details available in supplementary material. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched on February 11, 2015. Reference lists of relevant studies, as well as citation searches, were conducted.

To be considered a viable clinical technique, studies must have described test results in both Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) cases and healthy controls. Anatomical descriptions, techniques in development, and non-controlled series were considered separately. Publications from 1970 onwards were deemed relevant to contemporary practice. Isolated case reports, animal studies, and descriptions related to cancer were excluded.

Publications were evaluated in the context of the questions stated earlier, and where possible, quantitative data were extracted for comparison. Quality assessment included evaluating sample size, risk of bias, generalizability, and clinical relevance. The aims of this review required a qualitative data analysis through a narrative approach.

### Synchronous endoscopy and sonotubometry of the eustachian tube: a pilot study [^114NSPAY]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

To describe for the first time a method of recording Eustachian tube (ET) function by simultaneous and synchronous endoscopy and sonotubometry, and explore its advantages compared with performing these tests independently.
- **Study design**: Observational study.
- **Setting**: Academic tertiary medical center.
- **Patients**: Eighteen healthy subjects.
- **Intervention**: Endoscopic nasopharyngoscopy with simultaneous, synchronous sonotubometry. Each subject performed three maneuvers: pronouncing the constant "k", swallowing, and yawning.
- **Main outcome measures**: The number of ET openings as a fraction of all efforts to open the tube, the duration of each opening, and the sound intensity recorded by sonotubometry.

Results indicated that six (35.3%) of the 17 subjects used for data analysis did not open their ET during swallowing. Excluding non-openers, the ET opened in 3 of 4 swallows. The average duration of opening of the ET during swallowing was 0.44 seconds. Notably, the ET does not open every time the endoscopic view notes dilation. A negative sound pressure wave was recorded in a number of instances, immediately preceding a swallow-related opening. Contraction of the tensor veli palatini muscle was essential for ET opening.

Simultaneous synchronous endoscopy and sonotubometry may improve the accuracy of either method when performed separately as an ET function measurement tool. Sonotubometry may prevent a false-positive endoscopy (ET viewed as open but no functional patency achieved). Endoscopy can lower the threshold considered positive for sonotubometry. A negative pressure wave recorded immediately preceding a swallow-related opening highlights the value of this combined approach in assessing ET function.

### Imaging of the Eustachian tube and its function: a systematic review [^114S5qoh]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

A normally functioning Eustachian tube (ET) is essential for maintaining a healthy middle ear and normal hearing. The failure of the ET to function correctly is a common cause of morbidity in both adults and children. However, the anatomy, function, and imaging options relating to the tube are still poorly understood by otolaryngologists and radiologists alike. Due to recent developments in the surgical management of Eustachian tube disorders, particularly with the introduction of balloon dilation of the ET, it is timely to review this important structure again and assess what imaging can add in terms of both our understanding and diagnosis of Eustachian tube pathology.

The ET is a narrow, epithelial-lined tube extending from the middle ear to the nasopharynx. It is passively closed but normally opens under the control of paratubal muscles during actions such as swallowing. The ET fulfills three main roles, which together facilitate middle ear health and the transmission of sound from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea.
- **Equalisation of middle ear pressure**: It equalizes middle ear pressure to the ambient atmospheric pressure, a necessity due to external pressure fluctuations and mucosal gas exchange.
- **Mucociliary clearance**: It permits the mucociliary clearance of middle ear secretions.
- **Prevention of retrograde travel**: It prevents the retrograde travel of speech sounds and pathogen-laden secretions up the ET from the nasopharynx.

Failure of the above-mentioned actions is considered ET dysfunction (ETD), which is usually classified as either obstructive or patulous. Obstructive ETD results…

### Tubomanometry-score as predictor of outcome for balloon Eustachian tuboplasty in patients with Eustachian tube dysfunction [^111tgw1k]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The predictive value of pre-operative R values is crucial in assessing the outcomes of balloon Eustachian tuboplasty (BET). The prevalence of normal R values was significantly higher after BET than before the procedure. Notably, the prevalence of R = 0 values dropped by almost 50% at 30, 40, and 50 mbar. These objective findings support the anatomical effect of BET on the Eustachian tube (ET), as R = 0 indicates no opening of the ET.

However, stratifying pre-operative R values into three groups, as defined by Estéve et al, did not show any statistically significant differences between the groups regarding the likelihood of achieving a satisfactory effect with BET. The evaluation of R values remains a largely unexplored topic, and an alternative stratification could reveal unknown potential. Notably, other points on the pressure curves, such as C3, C4, P3, and P4, are not included in the R value, necessitating further exploration into their usefulness.

Several studies have examined the diagnostic value of tubomanometry (TMM); however, none have assessed its predictive value in determining the effect of BET. As BET is often the preferred treatment for long-lasting ET dysfunction, understanding this tool's predictive aspect is crucial, emphasizing the need for additional studies in this area.

### Balloon eustachian tuboplasty: A systematic review [^111uQbJN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the evidence on balloon Eustachian tuboplasty (BET) as a treatment for Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) by following the PRISMA guideline and registering with PROSPERO No. CRD42014009461.

Data was sourced from 12 databases, including PubMed and Embase, covering studies from January 1, 2010, to April 7, 2014, on BET. Endpoints included changes in symptoms, middle ear pathology, eardrum status, Eustachian tube function tests, hearing, adverse events, complications, and health-related quality of life.

Study quality was assessed using the modified Delphi technique quality appraisal tool for case series studies, while the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Nine case series studies, including 443 patients (642 tubes) with population sizes ranging from 4 (7 tubes) to 210 (320 tubes), were included. All studies were of poor quality and featured a high risk of bias.

The review observed a reduction of patient symptoms in the ETD questionnaire (p < 0.001), postoperative normalization of the tympanic membrane, conversion of type B or type C into type A tympanograms, reduced mucosal inflammation, increased positive Valsalva and swallowing test results, improvement in Eustachian tube score, reduction in the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT)-22 score (P = 0.001), and increased quality of life (P = 0.001). No serious adverse events were found.

The conclusion is that the evidence for BET is poor and carries a high risk of bias. Therefore, no firm conclusions can be made to identify patients who will benefit from the procedure or to accurately predict successful outcomes.

### Tensor tenopexy: A clinical study to assess its effectiveness in improving Eustachian tube function and preventing hearing loss in patients with cleft palate [^113u2egE]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2013). High credibility.

There is a consensus about the occurrence of otitis media in children with cleft palate before repair. However, controversy continues regarding the recovery of Eustachian tube function and the level of hearing loss in patients after cleft palate repair. Levator sling palatoplasty is an important component of the cleft repair. Most surgeons routinely transect the tensor tendon (tensor tenotomy) during palatoplasty. However, this procedure may pose a risk to Eustachian tube function. Some authorities believe that the addition of tensor tenopexy during palatoplasty could maintain the Eustachian tube in an open conformation, thereby improving middle ear ventilation.

The present study assesses the effectiveness of tensor tenopexy in improving Eustachian tube function and preventing hearing loss in cleft palate patients treated with palatoplasty. A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Department of Plastic Surgery at a tertiary care institute in India. A total of 17 children, aged 9–24 months, were assigned to one of two groups: palatoplasty with either tensor tenotomy (n = 8) or tensor tenotomy with tensor tenopexy (n = 9).

All patients underwent tympanometry, otoscopy, and brainstem evoked response audiometry before surgery and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery. Of these, 52.9% of patients already had hearing loss at the time of presentation. Hearing loss and middle ear effusion persisted even after palatoplasty. There was no significant difference in hearing loss and middle ear effusion between the two groups.

### Sonotubometry: Eustachian tube ventilatory function test: A state-of-the-art review [^1118EXcj]. Otology & Neurotology (2005). Low credibility.

The disturbance of any function of the Eustachian tube (ET) may contribute to the development of otitis media. Sonotubometry measures the ventilatory function using sound. Various investigators have studied the qualities of sonotubometry as a test for Eustachian tube ventilatory function. The review describes the development of the method and provides a summary of study results to estimate the diagnostic potential of this Eustachian tube function test.
- **Data sources**: The English-language literature on the topic was searched systematically using Medline and PubMed with the following keywords: ventilatory function, Eustachian tube, sonotubometry, and function test. There were no limits on the year of publication.
- **Study selection**: Articles that described the method itself, focusing on validity, reproducibility, and diagnostic value, were studied in detail.
- **Data extraction**: All the articles described in study selection were used for this review.
- **Conclusions**: The technique of sonotubometry has been gradually improved over the years. The results of sonotubometry are at least as good as those of other function tests. However, because the results still tend to be ambiguous in children — and otitis media is most common in this population — the reproducibility and application of sonotubometry must be evaluated further. Sonotubometry has significant advantages over other function tests, but it is not routinely used to assess Eustachian tube ventilatory function because its value for clinical practice has not yet been adequately demonstrated.

### Screening for eustachian tube dysfunction in clinical practice using the Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire-7 [^113ehaqy]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the ability of the Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire-7 (ETDQ-7) to differentiate between patients with Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) and those with non-ETD diagnoses. It also sought to identify symptom information that could enhance this discrimination.

This was a cohort study involving a pilot retrospective approach with adult patients from otology clinics and one general otolaryngology clinic in an academic health system. Patients were administered the ETDQ-7 along with eight additional symptom items. Their electronic health records provided demographic and diagnostic data. Patients were divided into three diagnostic categories: true ETD, ear fullness (EF) not due to ETD, and control patients without ETD-related disorders or EF. ETDQ-7 and symptom item scores were compared across these diagnostic groups. Receiver-operative characteristics curves and area under the curve (AUC) were generated for each ETD diagnosis group based on ETDQ-7 and symptom scores.

Among the 108 patients in the study, 74 (68.5%) were diagnosed with ETD. These patients had higher ETDQ-7 scores, indicating a worse symptom burden, compared to the control group (Median [Q1, Q3] 3.0 [1.7, 4.1] versus 1.5 [1.0, 3.4], P = 0.008). There was no statistically significant difference in ETDQ-7 scores between ETD and non-ETD EF patients (P = 0.389). The AUC for ETDQ-7 in differentiating ETD from other EF-causing conditions was 0.569; the inclusion of the eight symptom questions improved the AUC to 0.801.

### Outcome measures for baro-challenge-induced Eustachian tube dysfunction: A systematic review [^116tJMYR]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Baro-challenge-induced Eustachian tube dysfunction (baro-induced ETD) is characterized by the failure of the Eustachian tube (ET) to open adequately to permit middle-ear pressure regulation during ambient pressure changes. There are no well-characterized tests for identifying the condition, which makes both patient diagnosis and research into treatment efficacy challenging. This systematic review evaluates ET function tests as potential outcome measures for baro-induced ETD.
- **Data sources**: MEDLINE and CENTRAL were searched (database inception to March 2017), and reference lists were reviewed for all relevant English language articles.
- **Study selection**: Tests in included studies were required to measure ET function in patients reporting baro-induced ear symptoms or barotrauma.
- **Data extraction**: Data were extracted in a standardized manner, and studies were assessed according to Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) criteria. The primary outcome of interest was the accuracy of ET function tests.
- **Data synthesis**: Heterogeneity of subject demographics, ET function test methodology, and reference standards only permitted narrative systematic review.
- **Conclusion**: Sixteen studies involving seven different types of ET function tests were identified. The nine-step test was the most commonly used outcome measure, with overall test sensitivity and specificity ranges of 37 to 100% and 57 to 100%, respectively. Tympanometry test sensitivity was consistently poor (0–50%), while specificity was higher (52–97%). Published accuracy data for other ET function tests were incomplete.

### Morphologic measurements of 3d eustachian tube model and their diagnostic value regarding eustachian tube dysfunction - A cross-sectional observational study [^111z9Mn2]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

To investigate the diagnostic value of three-dimensional morphologic measurements of the Eustachian tube on computed tomography in Eustachian tube dysfunction, this prospective cross-sectional observational study included forty patients with unilateral Eustachian tube dysfunction.

The clinical diagnosis was verified using the Eustachian tube score-7 and the Eustachian tube dysfunction questionnaire-7. Computed tomography scans of the temporal bone were acquired while performing a Valsalva maneuver to improve the visualization of the air-filled Eustachian tube lumen. The Eustachian tubes were delineated on curved planar reconstructions, and three-dimensional models were constructed. Seven morphological parameters were measured for each Eustachian tube: the cross-sectional size of the tympanic and pharyngeal orifice, the visualization length, the inclination angles, and the curvature angles. Morphological measurements and Eustachian tube scores were correlated.

The mean value of the visualization length of the complete Eustachian tube and in its bony segment was significantly higher in healthy sides than in pathological sides (p = 0.034 and p = 0.029, respectively). There was a significant correlation between the Eustachian tube score-7 and the cross-sectional size of the tympanic orifice (r = 0.361; p = 0.022). The Eustachian tube score-7 also correlated significantly with the visualization length of the complete Eustachian tube (r = 0.436; p = 0.005) and its bony segment (r = 0.598; p < 0.0001), respectively.

### Oral steroid usage for otitis media with effusion, eustachian tube dysfunction, and tympanic membrane retraction [^113nE16z]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Avoiding oral steroids for otitis media with effusion (OME) is endorsed as a performance measure by the National Quality Foundation, but data regarding gaps and practice patterns are lacking. Our objectives were to evaluate oral steroid use for OME and the related diagnoses of eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) and tympanic membrane retraction (TMR), to assess variations by visit setting, and to identify opportunities for measurable performance improvement.
- **Study design**: Cross-sectional analysis of a national database.
- **Setting**: Ambulatory visits in the United States.
- **Subjects**: Children and adults in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2005–2010).
- **Methods**: Data were coded for patient demographic information, potential confounders (e.g. conditions managed by oral steroids), and diagnosis of OME, ETD, or TMR (OME/ETD/TMR). The latter two diagnoses were included to meet minimum numbers for the reliability of weighted estimates, but OME constituted the majority of cases. Multivariate regression was used to determine the variables associated with oral steroid use.
- **Results**: Among 590,772 observations representing 7,191,711,480 visits for OME/ETD/TMR, 3.2% resulted in a new prescription for oral steroid medication (2.3% for children, 7.0% for adults). Adults were more likely to receive steroids (odds ratio = 3.50, P < .001) than those with other diagnoses, but a similar association was not found for children. Patients seen by an otolaryngologist or in the emergency department were less likely to receive a prescription.

### Does palatoplasty technique impact resolution of Eustachian tube dysfunction [^115gUXE2]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Two primary outcomes were considered: (1) rates of ear tube sets required following palate repair and (2) rates of secondary velopharyngeal surgery. Postpalatoplasty ear tube requirements were defined as the number of myringotomies with tympanostomy tube placements performed after the primary palatoplasty. During this study's time period, there was not an audiologic protocol for the patient cohort, leading to inconsistent documentation and assessment of hearing tests. As the audiologic information was inconsistent and not a primary outcome or evaluation for the study, further details on this topic were not analyzed. Our institution has since developed and authored an audiologic protocol for our patients with CP.
- **Statistical analysis**: Patients were stratified by palatoplasty technique into two repair groups: Furlow and IVV. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and proportions, while continuous variables were reported as medians with interquartile ranges. The Pearson χ² test was performed to compare categorical variables between groups, and the Wilcoxon test was used to compare continuous variables between groups. A negative binomial generalized linear regression model analyzed the association between the primary outcome and other variables. Independent variables were selected based on variables of interest to this study (repair type, Veau classification, age at repair, fistula repair, and speech surgery) and demographics with statistical significance on our univariate analysis.

### Interpretation of normal and abnormal tympanogram findings in eustachian tube dysfunction [^113ZG1c6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

To characterize the relationship between objective tympanogram values and patient-reported symptoms and their associations with common comorbid conditions, a cross-sectional study with prospective data collection was conducted at a tertiary medical center.

Patients undergoing routine audiometric evaluation between October 2018 and June 2019 were included. Participants with temporomandibular joint dysfunction, inner ear hydrops, and similar conditions were excluded. Symptoms were assessed with the 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire. Demographics and medical comorbidities were recorded from the medical record. An analysis of tympanometric peak pressure (TPP), demographics, and comorbidities was performed to determine associations with clinically significant eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) symptoms.

A total of 250 patients were included with similar demographics: 101 (40.4%) in the asymptomatic group and 149 (59.6%) in the symptomatic group. The median (interquartile range) TPP was -10 (20) daPa and -25 (100) daPa in the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups, respectively. A diagnosis of rhinitis was more likely to be associated with significant ETD symptoms (adjusted odds ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.23–5.63). A subgroup analysis revealed that symptomatic patients with normal TPP values were negatively skewed compared with asymptomatic patients. This symptomatic group had a higher prevalence of rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis than the asymptomatic group.

Patients with symptoms of ETD may have a TPP within a range typically associated with normal findings, suggesting that subjective symptoms could provide valuable diagnostic information in cases where objective measurements are inconclusive.

### Imaging of the Eustachian tube and its function: A systematic review [^112nwuZb]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

The radiological features of obstructive Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) have not been extensively described, with only six published papers identified as describing features detectable on imaging that are suggestive of ETD. All except one are based on CT findings.
- **Features of obstructive ETD on imaging**: Two groups found that the bony channel for the Eustachian tube within the temporal bone was of reduced cross-sectional size in individuals with obstructive ETD. Additionally, one group found that the tube ran at a shallower angle in diseased ears.

Kanzaki et al. highlight one of the weaknesses of using CT to assess soft tissues. By scanning pre- and post-grommet insertion, they demonstrated that mucus and fluid cannot easily be distinguished from soft tissue obstructing the lumen. After grommet insertion, they could localize what appeared to be mucosal thickening in some patients with ETD, a finding shared with Liang et al, who found that these mucosal changes correlated well with tympanometry results. Tympanometry measures middle ear pressure, which is close to atmospheric pressure if the Eustachian tube is functioning normally.

In the only study to use MRI, Lukens et al. found good soft tissue definition and were able to analyze ET opening with real-time turbo-gradient echo sequences during a Valsalva maneuver. Although all patients had ETD, the results emphasized the potential of MRI in analyzing soft tissue characteristics that are difficult to assess with CT alone.

### Usefulness of the saccharin test for assessment of eustachian tube function in patients with chronic otitis media with perforation [^113tXZ82]. Otology & Neurotology (2017). Low credibility.

The eustachian tube (ET) has two important functions: ventilation and clearance of the middle ear. We evaluated the ET ventilator function using sonotubometry and the inflation-deflation test, which are widely used today, and the ET clearance function using the saccharin test. Results of both tests were compared with surgical outcomes to assess which test was more closely related to the surgical outcomes.
- **Study design**: Prospective case series.
- **Setting**: A single university hospital.
- **Patients and intervention**: One hundred four ears of 95 patients with chronic otitis media with perforation underwent type I tympanoplasty.
- **Main outcomes and measures**: Based on sonotubometry and the inflation-deflation test, the patients were categorized into normal, stenosis, and patulous types. Based on the saccharin test, they were divided into a normal function group and a partial/gross dysfunction group. Surgical outcomes regarding hearing results and the condition of the eardrum were assessed one year postoperatively. Preoperative evaluation of ET function was compared with these surgical outcomes.

Results showed that neither sonotubometry nor inflation-deflation tests revealed a significant difference among the groups concerning hearing improvement and surgical success rate. However, the saccharin test demonstrated that the rate of hearing improvement was significantly lower in the gross dysfunction group, and the success rate of Type I tympanoplasty was significantly higher in the normal group than in the dysfunction group.

This study indicates a relationship between the saccharin test results and the surgical outcomes, underscoring the usefulness of the saccharin test in assessing ET function in these patients.

### "Physiological" ear clicking: its origin and potential usability as a test tool for the Eustachian tube function [^115bqGPK]. Otology & Neurotology (2016). Low credibility.

To explore the origin of "physiological" ear clicks during deglutition or other pharyngeal movements, the study highlights that these clicks, in contrast to the disturbing frequent clicks under pathological conditions, mostly remain unnoticed by the patient.
- **Study design**: Clinical experimental study at a tertiary referral center.

- **Methods**: Ear clicks were recorded by a microphone sealing the external ear canal, parallel to endoscopic or manometric evaluations of the Eustachian tube function.
- **Results**: The acoustic signals (clicks) appear when the tube opens. The clicks might be explained by a disruption of fluid or mucus films covering the mucosa. As clicks could be recorded regularly in our tests, they might potentially be used as indicators in a new tube function test, which has to be elaborated.

### Eustachian tube function in 6-year-old children with and without a history of middle ear disease [^114AMSWa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that eustachian tube opening efficiency, measured as the fractional gradient equilibrated (FGE), is lower in 6-year-old children with no middle ear disease but a well-documented history of recurrent acute otitis media compared with children with a negative disease history (control), a cross-sectional study was conducted.

The study was set in a tertiary care pediatric hospital. Bilateral eustachian tube function was evaluated in 44 healthy 6-year-old children (19 boys, 29 white). None had middle ear disease at the time of testing, but 23 had a history of recurrent acute otitis media, while 21 had no significant past otitis media. Eustachian tube function was measured with a pressure chamber protocol that established negative middle ear gauge pressures (referenced to the chamber pressure) and recorded that pressure before and after swallowing. FGE was calculated as the change in middle ear gauge pressure with swallowing divided by the preswallow pressure. Between-group comparisons of the preswallow pressures and FGEs were made with a two-tailed Student's t-test.

FGE was independent of the preswallow middle ear gauge pressure. For the 39 and 44 evaluable ears in the control and recurrent acute otitis media groups, the mean preswallow pressures were -194 daPa (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = -211 to -177) versus -203 daPa (95% CI = -216 to -190; P > .40), and FGEs were 0.32 (95% CI = 0.21–0.43) vs 0.16 (95% CI = 0.08–0.24; p = 0.016), respectively.

In children with past recurrent acute otitis media, residual eustachian tube dysfunction was observed.

### Imaging of the Eustachian tube and its function: A systematic review [^117HLLHs]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

Oblique CT images of the Eustachian tube (ET) and its surrounding tissues in patients with severe symptoms of patulous Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) show the ET as patent along its entire length. These images were reconstructed 1-mm thick, parallel and perpendicular to the long axis of the ET, and are taken from Yoshida et al, 2004, with permission.

A drawback to using CT for imaging patulous Eustachian tubes is the tendency for patient symptoms to resolve when lying flat, suggesting the patent tube closes. Standard CT scanning is performed in the supine position, leading to under-diagnosis of patulous ET with this technique. This issue has been addressed by using either horizontal cone beam CT scanning with a seated patient or a tilting scanner with a reclining chair, which facilitates positioning the patient at 45° in a standard scanner.

Although the soft tissue contrast resolution of cone beam CT is inferior to standard CT, Yoshida et al. were able to measure the Eustachian tube lumen's long axis, short axis, cross-sectional area, and total volume. Interestingly, by using both cone beam and standard CT scanning techniques, the group was able to visualize the closure of the abnormally patent lumen when the patient was in the supine position.

Rodrigues et al. further advanced CT scanning in one patient by using it for image-guided placement of a silicone elastomer suspension implant in the lateral wall of the ET to narrow the ET lumen. Symptomatic improvement of patulous ET symptoms was reported.

### Tuboimpedance: A new test of eustachian tube function [^114CcogR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction is most frequently caused by a failure of the ET to adequately open; however, there is currently no reliable method of assessing this. Tubomanometry has recently shown good interindividual repeatability as a measure of ET function by measuring middle ear pressure after the application of regulated nasopharyngeal pressures during swallowing. We present the first reports of a novel test: middle ear impedance measurements during standard nasopharyngeal pressure application, known as tuboimpedance.

We assess repeatability in healthy ears and any advantages over tubomanometry.
- **Study design**: Exploratory cohort diagnosis study.
- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center.
- **Subjects**: Twenty screened, healthy ears (10 volunteers).
- **Methods**: Tubomanometry and tuboimpedance tests were performed while individuals swallowed with applied nasopharyngeal pressures of 20, 30, 40, and 50 mbar. Eustachian tube opening detection rate and test repeatability (measured by intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) for immediate and delayed repeats at each pressure were compared.
- **Results**: ET opening was detected more frequently using tuboimpedance, with a 100% detection rate using a nasopharyngeal pressure of 30 mbar or more, compared to 88% to 96% with tubomanometry. Detection of ET opening at 20 mbar was possible with tuboimpedance. Repeatability of both tests was mostly strong (ICC > 0.7) for both immediate and delayed repeats. Repeatability for the tubomanometry R value was only fair to moderate.
- **Conclusion**: Tuboimpedance may provide a repeatable measure of ET opening that is easy to perform.

### Eustachian tube function following total laryngectomy [^1118WoQf]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The function of the Eustachian tube has been investigated under various conditions. However, its status has not been evaluated in total laryngectomized patients. This study was designed to investigate the short-term and long-term changes of the Eustachian tube that occur following total laryngectomy.
- **Method**: We enrolled a total of 53 patients who had undergone total laryngectomy in a tertiary referral center. These patients were divided into two groups: those within the last two years after surgery (group 1) and those more than two years after surgery (group 2). Additionally, 51 healthy volunteers were studied as a control group (group 3). Eustachian tube function was tested using P1, P2, and P3 criteria. P1 is the tympanometric measurement while resting; P2 is the tympanometric measurement after the Toynbee maneuver; and P3 is the tympanometric testing after the Valsalva maneuver. To evaluate the functionality of the Eustachian tube, the P1-P2 > 10 daPa or Pmax - Pmin > 15 daPa criteria were used.
- **Results**: A statistically significant difference was not detected between Pmax - Pmin, P2, and P1-P2 values among the groups. Moreover, a statistically significant difference was also not detected between the right and left sides through the Pmax - Pmin values when assessing the groups among themselves.
- **Conclusions**: We determined that the functions of Eustachian tubes were not different between the patients who underwent total laryngectomy and the healthy volunteers of nearly the same age. The lack of active airflow in the upper respiratory tract following total laryngectomy has no effect on the Eustachian tube function.

### Tubomanometry-score as predictor of outcome for balloon eustachian tuboplasty in patients with eustachian tube dysfunction [^114gbSQ2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

- **Tubomanometry**: The probes are inserted in the nasal vestibule and outer ear canal while the patient sips a small amount of water.
- **Tubomanometry measurement**: The yellow curve represents pressure in the nasopharynx, and the blue curve represents pressure in the outer ear canal. The latency index, called the R value, is the ratio of time from the onset of pressure increase in the nasopharynx and the outer ear canal and was defined by Estéve et al. It is calculated using the equation R = (P1 − C1/C2 − C1) and represents the opening of the eustachian tube (ET). By definition, R values are dimensionless and cannot be negative. R values were stratified into three groups: an R value ≤ 1 was considered a normal ET opening, an R value > 1 was defined as a delayed ET opening, while an unmeasurable R value (R = 0) indicated no detectable opening of the ET.
- **Statistics**: Statistics were performed using STATA (MP 18.0). Comparison of categorical variables between asymptomatic and ETD ears, as well as ETD ears before and after balloon eustachian tuboplasty (BET), were performed using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Correlations between preoperative measurements and postoperative subjective outcomes were compared using odds ratios. The significance level for all conclusions was set at P ≤ .05.

### A systematic review of Eustachian tube procedures for baro-challenge Eustachian tube dysfunction [^113zWbCq]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Low credibility.

To examine the effectiveness of Eustachian tube procedures for the treatment of baro-challenge Eustachian tube dysfunction, a systematic review was conducted. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, databases including PubMed (National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health), Scopus (Elsevier), and CINAHL (EBSCO) were searched for articles. The articles focused on the effectiveness of Eustachian tube procedures for baro-challenge Eustachian tube dysfunction. Outcome measures included symptom resolution, ability to return to work, equalization problems (EP) scores, Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) scores, and pressure chamber testing parameters. A pooled meta-analysis was performed for dichotomous measures and ETDQ-7 scores.

Eleven articles involving 81 patients were included in this review. Seventy-two patients from ten articles underwent balloon Eustachian tube dilation, while nine patients in one study underwent laser Eustachian tuboplasty (LET). All 81 patients were preoperatively symptomatic with barometric pressure changes, and 26 out of 30 (86.7%) were unable to work due to symptoms. In the meta-analysis, after balloon dilation Eustachian tuboplasty (BDET), 82.5% (n = 30 [95% confidence interval: 42%-100%]) of patients showed improvement in their ability to perform the Valsalva maneuver, 79.1% (n = 16 [57.9%-94.1%]) improved in their ability to return to work, and 84.3% (n = 69 [69.8%-94.7%]) showed improvement in any symptom. Of the 25 patients with individual ETDQ-7 scores, 79.1% [51.4, 96.9] experienced improvements after BDET. For four case series with 36 patients, ETDQ-7 scores decreased by 1.2 [0.7, 1.7] (p < 0.00001).

### Middle ear pressure regulation — complementary active actions of the mastoid and the Eustachian tube [^112CjrqE]. Otology & Neurotology (2010). Low credibility.

Middle ear pressure (MEP) is actively regulated by both the Eustachian tube and the mastoid air cell system.
- **Background**: MEP is a highly significant factor involved in many clinical conditions related to otitis media. Although basic knowledge on its overall regulation remains insufficient, the Eustachian tube and mastoid gas exchange are important factors. The main focus has traditionally been on the tube; however, evidence indicates the mastoid is equally important. More detailed methods are required to study their complementary functions.
- **Methods**: A catheter was inserted into the mastoid of 12 human volunteers undergoing parotidectomy. This enabled direct monitoring of MEP. Experiments were performed with volume displacements of ± 50, 100, and 200 microliters, resulting in a range of overpressure and underpressure. Counter-regulation was recorded over 10 minutes.
- **Results**: In some cases, MEP counter-regulation presented as Eustachian tube openings with steep and fast pressure changes toward 0 Pa. In others, gradual and slow pressure changes related to the mastoid were observed, sometimes crossing 0 Pa into opposite pressures. Many cases exhibited combinations of these distinct mechanisms.
- **Conclusion**: Both the human mastoid and the Eustachian tube were capable of active counter-regulation of MEP in short-term experimental pressure changes in healthy ears. These two systems appeared to function in a complementary manner, with the mastoid related to continuous regulation of smaller pressures, whereas the tube was associated with in.

### A randomized controlled trial of balloon dilation as a treatment for persistent Eustachian tube dysfunction with 1-year follow-up [^113SrpDk]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Follow-up of all participants undergoing balloon dilation through a 12-month follow-up period showed continued significant improvement in ETDQ-7 scores. Additionally, participants who underwent balloon dilation with abnormal middle ear assessments at baseline demonstrated significant improvement at the 12-month follow-up for tympanic membrane position, ability to clear the ears with a Valsalva maneuver, and tympanogram type. The improvements observed over the 12-month follow-up in patient-reported symptoms and objective middle ear functional tests confirm the efficacy of balloon dilation and demonstrate the procedure's durability.

Although carotid artery damage and patulous Eustachian tube are noted in the literature as potential adverse events associated with balloon dilation, these events have not been reported in the literature. The few adverse events that have been reported are minor and transient in nature, such as bleeding and preauricular emphysema. This study provides additional evidence that Eustachian tube balloon dilation is a safe procedure for patients with ETD.

A limitation of this study was the inability to blind the participants to their treatment, which can lead to the placebo effect, especially with patient-reported outcomes. However, since we also observed significant improvements in objective findings such as tympanometry, otoscopy, and Valsalva maneuver in the balloon dilation arm and not in the control arm, we believe that any placebo effect is minimal and that the improvements observed in the ETDQ-7 scores are reliable.

### The rate of eustachian tube dysfunction in adult patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease is low [^115aJmQa]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Low credibility.

In addition to the pathophysiological mechanisms of protection and ventilation of the middle ear by anatomical conditions, environmental and genetic factors also play a role in the development of chronic middle ear processes.

If evidence of Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) exists on testing, then balloon dilatation of the Eustachian tube may be considered as an adjunct therapy, though many patients (based on our data, 82%) do not have evidence of ETD at the time of ear surgery.

It should be considered, however, that currently available clinical standard measurement methods and scores may not be sufficiently suited to detect tubal dysfunctions. One solution would be to apply more advanced testing for ETD, such as the pressure chamber test. We did not perform pressure chamber tests on this patient cohort from clinical routine practice. However, already established measurement procedures of Eustachian tube function should be evaluated and developed further to correctly assess the informative value of the different measurement procedures and thus increase the informative value of the measurements in their entirety.

### The rate of Eustachian tube dysfunction in adult patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease is low [^1159BfxC]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Low credibility.

- **Examination procedure**: Tubomanometry (TMM), as described by Estève, involves sealing pressure probes in the nose and the external ear canal to measure nasopharyngeal (blue) and ear canal pressure changes (red) after the patient swallows water.

- **Performance conditions**: Tubomanometry can be conducted on patients with both an intact ear drum and those with a tympanic membrane defect. Regardless of the condition, ensuring a complete seal of the ear canal with the ear canal probe is necessary. Device adjustments are required in cases of tympanic membrane defects.
- **Measurement interpretation**: The R value (opening latency index) is crucial as it indicates the latency between pressure application in the nasopharynx and the measurement of pressure change in the ear canal. An R value that is nonmeasurable or negative signifies obstruction of the Eustachian tube. An immediate opening corresponds to an R value of 1.

Data were analyzed descriptively, providing insights into the condition under study.

### Sonotubometric assessment for severity of patulous eustachian tube [^112ZYwFJ]. Otology & Neurotology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the morphological patency of the eustachian tube (ET) and sound transmission via the ET.

- **Study design**: Retrospective chart review and model experiment.

- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center.

- **Subjects**: A total of 56 ears from 28 patients (9 men and 19 women, aged 12 to 82 years, mean 40.4 ± 21.5 years) underwent sonotubometric measurements using postural changes, as well as computed tomography (CT) of the ET in the sitting position. This included 26 ears with definite patulous ET, 9 ears with possible patulous ET, and 21 ears without patulous ET.

- **Method**: Commercial equipment for sonotubometry (JK-05A; RION Co, Ltd, Kokubunji, Tokyo, Japan) was used in two investigations.
- **Retrospective survey**: Sound patency of 7kHz band noise via the ET was assessed by comparing the acoustic transfer function via the ET in the sitting and forward-bending positions. Sound patency via the ET was compared with morphological patency of the ET (cross-sectional area in the narrowest portion), assessed by three-dimensional CT of the ET in the sitting position.
- **Model experiment**: The effect of the ET caliber on the acoustic transfer function was examined using a simple model constructed with two truncated syringes with silicone barrels and a narrow connecting tube.

- **Results**: Sound patency assessed by sonotubometry was well correlated with the cross-sectional area at the narrowest portion of the ET in the sitting position (r = 0.786, p < 0.001). Correlation between the sound patency via the narrow tube and the caliber of the tube was also confirmed.

### The rate of eustachian tube dysfunction in adult patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease is low [^1158rw4k]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). High credibility.

From June 2015 to January 2020, a total of 1,621 consecutive patients with planned "ear surgery" (without paracentesis and/or tympanostomy tubes) were admitted to our hospital. Approximately 50% of the patients (n = 802) did not have diseases expected to stem from ETD. Of those with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease (n = 819), approximately one-fourth (n = 198; 24%) were children, and 43 (5%) could not be included, for example, because of a language barrier. Another 43 patients (5%) had anatomical anomalies or irradiation in the head and neck area. Patients excluded based on anatomic anomalies included those with severe septal deviation, adenoids, polyps obstructing the ear canal, or ear canal stenosis. Six patients with cleft lip and palate were also excluded. Previous BET had been performed in 53 patients (6%).
- **Patient flow and evaluation**: Of the remaining 482 patients, 289 had a prompt positive Valsalva maneuver. The other 193 patients showed a negative or unclear Valsalva maneuver, prompting further evaluation for ETD using the ETS score. Although 55 patients refused further diagnostics, leaving no explicit statement regarding the result possible, 138 were tested with the ETS. Of these, 61 patients had a score higher than 5, indicating good ET function. The other 77 patients had an ETS of 5 or lower, thus defined as having chronic obstructive ETD. Overall, 82% (350 of 482) of the patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease showed a positive result in terms of ET function.

### When can children perform Valsalva and Toynbee maneuvers? An exploratory study [^1154VDeZ]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Low credibility.

Barochallenge-induced Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) is difficult to diagnose because the examination is often normal during clinical assessment. In adults, functional tympanometry testing, performed by asking the patient to Valsalva and Toynbee while measuring the pressure shift, can aid in the diagnosis of ETD. However, standardized values do not exist in children. This study aims to determine the age at which children can perform these maneuvers and the normative values within this population.

Patients with a normal basic ear examination aged 4 years and older, presenting to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic, were recruited. Otoscopy and baseline tympanometry, followed by Valsalva and Toynbee maneuvers, were performed. Because there are no pediatric norms, it was hypothesized that children would achieve the same minimum normal pressure shift as cited in the adult literature (+20 daPa or higher for Valsalva and -20 daPa or lower for Toynbee). The data were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves and logistic regression.

A total of 168 children (276 ears) were assessed. Participants as young as 4 years old were able to perform a Valsalva and Toynbee. Age cut-offs at which children achieved adult norms were 12.5 years (p = 0.016) and 8.5 years (p = 0.071) for Valsalva and Toynbee maneuvers, respectively. The mean pressure shift ranged from +29 to -36 daPa, and males were 2.5 times more likely to achieve Toynbee compared with females (p = 0.006).

Functional tympanometry testing may be used to help diagnose barochallenge-induced Eustachian tube dysfunction in children.

### Assessment of nasal-noise masking audiometry as a diagnostic test for patulous Eustachian tube [^117XexvF]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

The primary objective is to assess the validity of nasal-noise masking audiometry (NNMA) as a clinical diagnostic tool in our patient population.
- **Study design**: Retrospective case review.
- **Setting**: Tertiary ambulatory referral center.
- **Patients**: Patients with patulous Eustachian tube (PET) were identified from referrals to our Eustachian tube disorders clinic, primarily with symptoms including autophony, aural fullness, and hearing their own breathing. The healthy subjects had no history of ear disease.
- **Intervention**: NNMA was measured in 20 ears of 10 healthy subjects as well as in 42 ears of 21 patients with suspected PET.
- **Main outcome measure**: NNMA mean auditory thresholds were measured at frequencies ranging from 250 to 8,000 Hz.
- **Results**: When stratified as definitive or probable PET based on observed tympanic membrane movement with breathing, both Definitive and Probable PET groups had significantly higher NNMA mean auditory thresholds compared to normal ears at 250 Hz (p = 0.001, p = 0.003), 1,000 Hz (p = 0.019, p = 0.001), and 6,000 Hz (p = 0.4, p = 0.001). When stratified based on symptoms on the day of testing, both Symptomatic Ears and Non-Symptomatic Ears had significantly higher mean auditory thresholds compared to normal ears at 250 Hz (p = 0.001, p = 0.015) and at 1,000 Hz (p = 0.002, p = 0.004).

Our results demonstrate a larger masking effect in patients with PET compared to normal subjects in the low-frequency region. In clinical practice, the relatively small effect and the wide variability of results between patients have made this finding significant.

### Diagnosis of the patulous Eustachian tube [^1134J8SP]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to review the diagnosis of the patulous Eustachian tube (PET) based on the diagnostic criteria proposed by the Japan Otological Society (JOS).
- **Methods**: We reviewed typical aural symptoms of PET and the Eustachian tube (ET) obstruction procedure to confirm the diagnosis of PET. Objective findings of a patent ET were obtainable from observations of the movement of the tympanic membrane and ET function tests (tubo-tympano-aerodynamic graphy, sonotubometry). Additionally, the usefulness of other tests such as the patulous Eustachian tube handicap inventory-10 (PHI-10), sonotubometry with postural change (Ohta method), and sitting computed tomography (CT) for diagnosing PET is described.
- **Results and conclusions**: We have described the diagnosis of PET based on the diagnostic criteria proposed by JOS; PHI-10, the Ohta method, and sitting CT are also useful for the diagnosis of PET. Further investigation is needed for an accurate diagnosis and precise evaluation of the pathophysiology of this challenging disease.

### The rate of eustachian tube dysfunction in adult patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease is low [^117EDWS5]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). High credibility.

From all consecutive patients scheduled for "ear surgery" (excluding paracentesis and/or tympanostomy tubes) in our tertiary university referral center, we selected patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease to evaluate for eligibility of a possible additional balloon eustachian tube (BET) dilatation along with the planned middle ear surgery.

Inclusion criteria included chronic inflammatory ear disease (chronic suppurative otitis media, adhesive otitis media [middle ear atelectasis], cholesteatoma) and an age greater than 18 years.

Exclusion criteria included previous BET, technically unfeasible tubomanometry (e.g. due to inability to understand instructions for performing tests), inability to complete questionnaires, craniofacial or middle ear malformations including cleft palate, previous radiotherapy of the cranium or in the head and neck area, otitis media with effusion with planned paracentesis and/or tympanostomy tubes only, implantation of electronic hearing devices, age less than 18 years, and diseases that do not stem from ETD (non-inflammatory chronic middle ear disease [e.g. otosclerosis], tumors, solely external auditory canal conditions, etc).

ET function in the 482 patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease was first evaluated with the Valsalva maneuver. In those patients in whom the Valsalva maneuver was clearly and immediately positive, it was assumed that there was no (relevant) chronic obstructive ETD, and that an additional BET would thus not be useful.

### Balloon dilatation of the Eustachian tube for obstructive Eustachian tube dysfunction in adults [^114vSc8j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) causes symptoms and signs of pressure dysregulation in the middle ear and is associated with tympanic membrane retraction, otitis media with effusion, and chronic otitis media. Interventions aiming to improve symptoms can be non-surgical or surgical, including balloon dilatation of the Eustachian tube, also known as balloon Eustachian tuboplasty (BET) for obstructive ETD. However, existing published evidence for the effectiveness and safety of BET remains unclear.
- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of balloon dilatation of the Eustachian tube in adults with obstructive Eustachian tube dysfunction.
- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The final search was updated on 18th January 2024. There were no restrictions on language, publication date, or study setting.
- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials were included if they allocated adult participants with chronic obstructive ETD to treatment randomly and compared BET with non-surgical treatment, no treatment, or other surgical treatment. Studies with other designs were excluded.
- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently selected trials using predetermined inclusion criteria, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data, and rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to GRADEpro. Statistical analyses were performed.

### Evaluation of predive parameters related to Eustachian tube dysfunction for symptomatic middle ear barotrauma in divers [^115kZZdW]. Otology & Neurotology (2005). Low credibility.

Eustachian tube dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of middle ear barotrauma. This investigation evaluates the predictive value of several parameters related to tubal dysfunction, in relation to symptomatic middle ear barotrauma in divers. The study was designed as prospective and blinded.

Thirty-one sport scuba divers with normal predive audiometry, tympanometry, and general and otorhinolaryngologic examination participated. After an occurrence of middle ear barotrauma, the individual diver's predive data on smoking, mild septal deviation, otitis media history, rhinosinusitis history, Valsalva, Toynbee, and nine-step inflation/deflation tympanometric test, as well as the degree of mastoid pneumatization, were registered to calculate predictive value in relation to the barotrauma. All symptomatic ears were examined within 24 hours of diving by the investigator, who was blinded to the predive findings. Barotraumas that occurred during an upper respiratory tract infection were excluded.

The divers completed a total of 774 dives (median, 25; range, 3–100). Symptomatic middle ear barotrauma occurred in 19 ears (31%) of 14 divers (45%) at one time or another. The rate of tubal dysfunction measured by the nine-step test and a mastoid pneumatization below average were significantly higher in divers (p < 0.05) as well as in ears (p < 0.005) with barotrauma. Positive and negative predictive values of both parameters for subsequent barotrauma were between 69% and 76%. Combining the results into a two-test battery in a strict approach (positive on both) increased predictive accuracy.

### Eustachian tube dysfunction in children with unilateral cleft lip and palate: Differences between ipsilateral and contralateral ears [^112L2DVy]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2020). Low credibility.

To evaluate Eustachian tube dysfunction in the ipsilateral and contralateral ears in children with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP), a retrospective chart review was conducted at a tertiary care children's hospital. The study included seventy-four consecutive patients with UCLP, born between 2005 and 2011, who were treated at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh Cleft-Craniofacial Center.
- **Main outcome measures**: Conductive hearing loss, tympanogram type, number of middle ear effusions, tympanostomy tubes, and complications. The hypothesis was formulated prior to the time of writing a collection.

Conductive hearing loss was nearly twice as common in the ipsilateral ear (43.2%) compared with the contralateral ear (23.0%; p = 0.001, McNemar test). There were no significant differences in the frequency of each type of tympanogram between the contralateral and ipsilateral ears. The proportions of ipsilateral (90.5%) and contralateral (91.9%) ears with effusion were not significantly different. The total number of tubes received was not significantly different between the two ears (median of 2 bilaterally). When combined, complications (retractions, perforations, and cholesteatomas) were significantly more common in the ipsilateral ear (29.7%) compared with the contralateral ear (18.9%; p = 0.039, McNemar test).

In conclusion, in children with UCLP, there were significantly more instances of conductive hearing loss and complications on the cleft side compared to the noncleft side. This suggests that Eustachian tube dysfunction may indeed be more severe on the cleft side.

### Tubomanometry-score as predictor of outcome for balloon Eustachian tuboplasty in patients with Eustachian tube dysfunction [^112YGwKN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Just over half of the patients experienced a subjectively satisfactory effect of balloon Eustachian tuboplasty (BET) at the postoperative follow-up. Preoperatively, the prevalence of normal tympanograms (type A) and R values (R ≤ 1) was significantly higher in asymptomatic ears compared to Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) ears. The prevalence of pathologic tympanograms (B) and pathological R values (R = 0) decreased significantly postoperatively.
- **Patient selection**: Ruling out patulous Eustachian tube dysfunction (PETD) before BET is extremely crucial. PETD occurs when the lumen of the ET is not collapsed at rest, causing a patent ET. Symptoms of PETD should always be addressed at the preoperative clinical visit and can somewhat mimic those from ETD, such as pressure in the ear and ringing in the ear. However, especially autophony and synchronous movements of the tympanic membrane with respiration are pathognomonic for PETD and should raise suspicion of the condition. Dilating an already gaping ET can worsen the condition, which should be avoided at all costs.

Diagnosing ETD is challenging due to its wide variety of non-specific symptoms combined with the lack of diagnostic tools. For instance, pain in or around the ear can be caused by other conditions such as temporomandibular joint disorder, eczema in the ear canal, and headache. Furthermore, a pathologic tympanogram is not pathognomonic for ETD. Correct patient selection is paramount for achieving a successful outcome after BET, as the procedure aims to improve the opening of the ET, addressing ear symptoms stemming from conditions not caused by insufficient middle ear ventilation.

### Imaging of the eustachian tube and its function: a systematic review [^115CqKba]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

There are two clinical requirements for the radiological assessment of the eustachian tube (ET): a reliable test of ET function and detailed anatomical imaging of the ET and its surrounding structures for surgical planning. The inaccessibility of the ET has contributed to the fact that there is currently no reliable test for determining ET function, meaning that many diagnoses are based on clinical history alone. The lack of reliable outcome measures for eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) has hindered research into new treatments and complicated patient selection for new therapies. Imaging may provide a useful non-invasive solution for assessing ET function.

Surgeons increasingly require imaging in pre-operative planning for complex skull base surgery, for ET resection in malignancy, and for new interventions for ETD such as balloon dilatation tuboplasty. The proximity of the ET to the internal carotid artery and other skull base structures, combined with inter-patient anatomical variation, can make surgery in this area hazardous.

In addition to the evolving clinical need, imaging has been instrumental in developing our understanding of the ET's structure and dynamic function, providing valuable information where cadaveric dissection and in vivo endoscopy have failed. It is likely that new imaging techniques will continue to advance our understanding of ETD.

This systematic review aims to answer the following questions: which anatomical structures of the ET can be defined radiologically, what are the radiological features of obstructive ETD, what are the radiological features of patulous ETD, and how can imaging be used as a mea?

### Imaging of the eustachian tube and its function: A systematic review [^1131KeDE]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

CT imaging has been utilized in the analysis of eustachian tube (ET) opening, which is still not fully understood. In healthy volunteers, Tarabichi et al. found that by performing CT during a Valsalva maneuver, the nasopharyngeal third of the cartilaginous ET could be seen in 94%, and the whole length of the tube in 35%. Interestingly, the group went on to use the technique in ears undergoing surgery for chronic disease and visualized a similar rate of patency in the nasopharyngeal third of the ET, suggesting that the obstruction may lie in the protympanic part. A 3D CT reconstruction from the group is shown in Figure 8.

Another study comes from McDonald et al, who used cine CT to visualize an air bolus moving up the ET towards the middle ear. While they were unable to follow the progress of a single opening over the entire ET length, the team hypothesized that their finding might explain why clinical tests of ET function suggest that the ET may not always open along its full length. This study examining gas exchange along the ET provides a clear contrast to other studies which have looked at the clearance of secretions. Earlier work using radiographs suggested ET opening with progressive closure towards the nasopharynx as a method of pumping secretions out of the middle ear. These findings were replicated by Niwa et al, who used intratympanic contrast with sequential CT repeats at one scan per second. Interestingly, this group also tested the same ears with tubo-tympano-aerodynamic-graphy (TTAG), a manometric clinical test of ET opening during Valsalva, in a mixed patient group with chronic conditions.

### Late-phase allergy and eustachian tube dysfunction [^111V6m8q]. Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

This study investigated the role of late-phase allergy in the development of otitis media with effusion. Brown Norway rats were sensitized to ovalbumin and later challenged transtympanically. Eustachian tube ventilatory function was assessed at 2, 4, 8, 24, 28, and 32 hours post-challenge by measuring passive opening and closing pressures, active clearance of positive and negative middle ear pressure, and mucociliary clearance.

The results demonstrate that exposure to transtympanic allergen induces eustachian tube dysfunction and subsequent formation of effusion. Allergic animals showed significant increases in passive and active opening pressures, as well as a decreased ability to actively clear middle ear pressure. Finally, the mucociliary function was significantly impaired in all sensitized rats exposed to transtympanic allergen.

These findings demonstrate that late-phase allergy leads to significant eustachian tube dysfunction and subsequent formation of effusion by impairing the ventilatory and clearance functions of the eustachian tube.

### Concordance analysis of the pressure chamber and tubomanometer according to Estève for the determination of Eustachian tube opening pressure [^111LT1bw]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Low credibility.

For the diagnosis of Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD), clinical procedures such as tympanometry, micro-otoscopy, and maneuvers according to Toynbee and Valsalva only allow an indirect assessment for the moment. With a prevalence of up to 5%, the selection of patients with ETD and its subtypes is clinically relevant. Dynamic methods of Eustachian tube function assessment include a hypo/hyperbaric pressure chamber and Estève's tubomanometer (TMM). One method of assessing ETD is the evaluation of Eustachian tube opening pressure (ETOP).
- **Material and methods**: We performed a concordance analysis between the pressure chamber and TMM to determine ETOP. For this purpose, we analyzed the measurements of both methods from 28 healthy subjects using Bland-Altman plots, regression according to Passing-Bablok, and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. The maximum tolerated clinical deviation of measured values was set at 10%.
- **Results**: A maximum of 53 measurements of ETOP between the pressure chamber and TMM were compared. Mean ETOP for TMM was 28.7 hPa, passive opening was 32 hPa, Toynbee maneuver was 28.4 hPa, and Valsalva maneuver was 54.6 hPa. Concordance analysis revealed the following results:
	- **Passive opening versus TMM**: Bland-Altman mean difference 3.3 hPa, limits of agreement ± 31.8 hPa; Passing-Bablok regression y = 0.67x + 9.36; Lin's rccc = 0.18.
	- **Toynbee versus TMM**: Bland-Altman mean difference 0.7 hPa, limits of agreement ± 35.8 hPa; Passing-Bablok regression y = 0.47x + 14.03; Lin's rccc = 0.14.
	- **Valsalva versus TMM**: Bland-Altman mean difference 24.2 hPa.

### Tests of eustachian tube function: The effect of testing technique on tube opening in healthy ears [^117PeNwD]. Otology & Neurotology (2017). Low credibility.

There is no agreement on the best clinical test for eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction. Numerous tests have been developed to detect ET opening, and all require a patient to perform a Valsalva, Toynbee, or sniff maneuver, or to swallow on demand. We aimed to characterize existing tests of ET function in healthy ears and identify the optimal method and patient maneuver for each test. Our own normative data is presented alongside published comparisons.

- **Study design**: Diagnostic test cohort study.
- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center.
- **Patients**: Seventy-five healthy ears from 42 volunteers.
- **Interventions**: Six tests of ET function, each performed using multiple different patient maneuvers.
- **Main outcome measure**: Detected ET opening rate for each test-maneuver combination.

The highest detected opening rates were noted as follows: sonotubometry 94%; nine-step test inflation/deflation 93/94%; continuous impedance 88%; patient-reported opening 79%; observed tympanic membrane movement 78%; and Tubo-tympano-aerodynamic-graphy 76%. Valsalva maneuvers were most effective at opening the ET. Toynbee and swallow maneuvers were more effective when performed without water compared to with water. For Valsalva and sniff maneuvers, there was a significant correlation between the peak nasopharyngeal pressure generated and the ET opening rate.

Based on ET opening detection rates, we recommend the use of dry swallows with sonotubometry and the nine-step test when testing patient-reported opening and observed membrane movement and when performing Tubo-tympano-aerodynamic-graphy.
