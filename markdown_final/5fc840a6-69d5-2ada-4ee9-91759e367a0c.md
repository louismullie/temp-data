## Question

Travelers diarrhea

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about travelers' diarrhea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining travelers' diarrhea and its epidemiology. Then, I should verify the etiologic spectrum and how it varies by region. Next, I will review risk factors and pathophysiology. After that, I need to classify severity and decide when to test. Then, I will examine prevention, including diet, hand hygiene, bismuth subsalicylate, and the role of antibiotics. Finally, I will detail treatment by severity, including rehydration, loperamide, and antibiotic choices, and close with special populations and postinfectious sequelae, making sure I double-check each claim against guidelines and high-quality reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and burden. Travelers' diarrhea is typically defined as three or more unformed stools in 24 hours with at least one associated symptom such as cramping, urgency, fever, nausea, or vomiting, and it remains the most common travel-related illness, with attack rates around 30–70% during a 2-week stay in high-risk regions, though improved hygiene has reduced risk in some destinations to roughly 8–20% in select areas [^5c3a972b] [^da549991].

> I need to check the etiologic spectrum. Most cases are bacterial, with enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) historically predominant, but enteroaggregative E. coli, Campylobacter, Shigella, and Salmonella are also common, and norovirus contributes meaningfully. Importantly, regional patterns shift antibiotic choices, with Campylobacter resistance to fluoroquinolones high in South and Southeast Asia, making azithromycin preferred there, whereas ciprofloxacin remains acceptable in other regions pending susceptibility data [^5c3a972b] [^27b25e11] [^d7ae5a92].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk factors. Destination is the strongest predictor, with highest risk in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of Latin America, and risk is amplified by young age, male sex, immunocompromise, and certain travel styles; host genetics and dining behaviors also modulate susceptibility, and adherence to dietary precautions is often imperfect in real-world travel, limiting their effectiveness despite counseling [^5c3a972b] [^5ae3d8fa] [^a1b9d8e6].

> Next, I should review severity classification to guide management. Mild disease is tolerable and does not interfere with activities, moderate disease is distressing or interferes with plans, and severe disease is incapacitating or includes dysentery; persistent diarrhea is defined as lasting 14 days or more, which should trigger evaluation for parasites and other causes, and I should confirm that this schema aligns with ISTM and IDSA guidance before proceeding [^41838719] [^e61a346f].

> I will now examine diagnostics. For uncomplicated, nonbloody, nonpersistent travelers' diarrhea, routine testing is not recommended; however, I should double-check that persistent diarrhea warrants evaluation for parasites, that C. difficile testing is indicated after recent antibiotic exposure, and that inflammatory markers or endoscopy may be needed when red flags or refractory symptoms are present, consistent with IDSA and ACG positions [^e61a346f] [^18bbcba6] [^acb732b0].

> Let me think about prevention next. Dietary counseling is standard but often insufficient on its own; hand hygiene helps in select contexts but has limited impact for typical foodborne bacterial TD; bismuth subsalicylate offers moderate protection and can be considered for short trips if dosing is acceptable; probiotics have inconsistent benefit and are not routinely recommended; and antibiotic prophylaxis is not routine but may be considered for high-risk travelers for short durations, with rifaximin favored when prophylaxis is indicated due to minimal systemic absorption, while acknowledging that it does not cover invasive pathogens [^5c3a972b] [^7e7232f1] [^de8a2ac8] [^3a5af758] [^2be17c7d].

> Wait, let me verify treatment by severity. For mild disease, oral rehydration and supportive care suffice, and loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate can be used symptomatically; for moderate disease, add loperamide and consider a short-course antibiotic such as azithromycin, a fluoroquinolone where appropriate, or rifaximin for noninvasive E. coli–predominant regions; for severe disease or dysentery, prompt antibiotic therapy is indicated, with azithromycin preferred in South/Southeast Asia and fluoroquinolones reasonable elsewhere when susceptibility supports use, and adjunctive loperamide is safe and effective in nonbloody cases to shorten illness and improve function [^5c3a972b] [^27b25e11] [^4b746fa2] [^dd0cb27c] [^a803085a] [^6fe5900e].

> I should confirm antibiotic specifics and resistance patterns. Azithromycin is effective as single-dose or 3-day therapy and performs comparably to levofloxacin in multiple RCTs, with advantages against Campylobacter in high-resistance regions; rifaximin is nonabsorbed and effective for noninvasive E. coli but should be avoided when invasive pathogens are suspected; ciprofloxacin remains an option where Campylobacter resistance is low, but rising resistance necessitates regional tailoring and caution [^6c2d3c2d] [^153f10ee] [^97981e90] [^b4952a47] [^d7ae5a92].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child, pregnant, or immunocompromised. In children, azithromycin is preferred when antibiotics are indicated, with weight-based dosing and attention to dehydration risk; loperamide is contraindicated in children under 2 years and should be used cautiously in older children; in pregnancy, azithromycin is favored; in immunocompromised hosts, consider lower thresholds for testing and treatment, and in select high-risk scenarios, prophylaxis may be reasonable with specialist input [^3c1b5e50] [^44f3e3b1] [^ff9416f4].

> I need to ensure I address postinfectious sequelae. A meaningful minority develop postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome after TD, and persistent symptoms should prompt evaluation for parasites, C. difficile, lactose malabsorption, and other GI diseases; emerging data also highlight microbiome disruption after TD and antibiotics, reinforcing judicious antimicrobial use and the need for research into microbiome-targeted therapies [^5c3a972b] [^e61a346f] [^89c0a944].

> Let me reconsider the practical takeaway. Pretravel counseling should set expectations, provide a written plan for self-treatment, and tailor antibiotic choices to destination; travelers should carry loperamide and a stand-by antibiotic when indicated, use strict hand hygiene in outbreak or norovirus-prone settings, and seek care for red flags such as blood in stool, high fever, severe pain, dehydration, or symptoms persisting beyond 14 days, aligning with CDC, ISTM, and ACG guidance [^7a11c3ee] [^5c3a972b] [^7e7232f1].

---

Traveler's diarrhea is best managed with **oral rehydration** for all patients, **loperamide for non-bloody diarrhea** [^6fe5900e], and **antibiotics for moderate-to-severe or dysenteric cases** [^4b746fa2] [^dd0cb27c]. Azithromycin is **first-line in South/Southeast Asia** due to fluoroquinolone resistance [^5c3a972b] [^d7ae5a92]; ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin are acceptable elsewhere [^27b25e11]. Rifaximin is an option for noninvasive E. coli in adults [^bb8e0ab7] [^b4952a47]. Routine stool testing is not needed for uncomplicated cases [^69e8410b]; reserve evaluation for persistent symptoms, dysentery, or immunocompromise [^e61a346f]. Prevention relies on safe food/water and hand hygiene; antibiotic prophylaxis is reserved for high-risk travelers [^3a5af758] [^7e7232f1].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

- **Bacterial pathogens**: Predominate (80–90%), including ETEC, EAEC, Campylobacter, Shigella, and Salmonella [^5c3a972b] [^ec20fd00].
- **Viral pathogens**: Norovirus is common, especially in outbreaks [^a1b9d8e6].
- **Parasitic pathogens**: Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Cyclospora are more often associated with persistent diarrhea [^notfound].
- **Risk factors**: Destination (South Asia, Africa, Latin America), young age, immunocompromise, and high-risk behaviors (e.g. street food) [^2b7a409d] [^5c3a972b].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include **abrupt onset** of three or more unformed stools in 24 hours, often with cramping, urgency, nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever [^5c3a972b]. Severe disease includes dysentery (bloody stools), high fever, or incapacitating symptoms [^41838719].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Routine testing is **not recommended** for uncomplicated cases [^69e8410b]; diagnose clinically and treat empirically [^e61a346f]. Testing is indicated for:

- **Persistent diarrhea**: ≥ 14 days (evaluate for parasites) [^ea8ca06b].
- **Dysentery**: Grossly bloody stools or severe illness [^notfound].
- **Immunocompromise**: HIV, immunosuppressive therapy [^notfound].
- **Recent antibiotic use**: Test for C. difficile if antibiotics within 8–12 weeks [^23690139].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Supportive care

Supportive care is **foundational** for all patients, with oral rehydration solutions (ORS) as first-line therapy [^b15f0ebc]. Loperamide is effective for non-bloody diarrhea to reduce frequency and duration [^a803085a]; avoid in dysentery or high fever [^2c51426b].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated for **moderate-to-severe or dysenteric illness** [^4b746fa2] [^dd0cb27c]:

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Regimen** |
|-|-|-|
| Azithromycin | First-line in South/Southeast Asia; effective against Campylobacter, Shigella, ETEC | 1 g single dose or 500 mg daily × 3 days [^5c3a972b] [^6c2d3c2d] |
| Ciprofloxacin | Alternative outside high-resistance regions | 500 mg single dose or 500 mg BID × 3 days [^notfound] |
| Rifaximin | Noninvasive E. coli in adults | 200 mg TID × 3 days [^b4952a47] [^bb8e0ab7] |

---

Adjunctive loperamide with antibiotics can **shorten illness and improve symptoms** in non-bloody diarrhea [^a803085a] [^c5bd52b1].

---

## Prevention

- **Food and water precautions**: Avoid high-risk foods (raw, street food), drink bottled or boiled water [^7e7232f1].
- **Hand hygiene**: Frequent handwashing with soap or alcohol-based sanitizers [^7e7232f1].
- **Antibiotic prophylaxis**: Reserved for high-risk travelers (e.g. immunocompromised, chronic disease); rifaximin or bismuth subsalicylate are options [^3a5af758] [^2be17c7d] [^54bb9bc6].
- **Vaccines**: Limited role; cholera vaccine for high-risk exposures [^647f14b7].

---

## Complications

Complications include **post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome** in 3–17% [^5c3a972b], chronic diarrhea from persistent infections (e.g. Giardia), and rare mortality in high-risk patients [^notfound].

---

## Special populations

- **Children**: Azithromycin preferred; avoid loperamide in young children [^44f3e3b1].
- **Pregnant women**: Azithromycin is safe; avoid fluoroquinolones.
- **Immunocompromised**: Lower threshold for testing and treatment; consider prophylaxis [^ff9416f4].

---

Traveler's diarrhea is common but usually self-limited; **ORS and loperamide are first-line** for mild cases, while antibiotics are reserved for moderate-to-severe or dysenteric illness, with azithromycin preferred in South/Southeast Asia. Prevention hinges on safe food/water and hand hygiene, with prophylaxis for high-risk travelers.

### Evaluation and management of traveler's diarrhea in children [^3c1b5e50]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Traveler's diarrhea is the most common travel disease in both children and adults. Adult guidelines for traveler's diarrhea have been established, but significant gaps persist in guidance for the evaluation and management of pediatric traveler's diarrhea. Adult guidelines are not necessarily applicable in children, and it is essential for clinicians to account for the differences in pediatric pathophysiology, clinical presentations, and treatment recommendations when evaluating and managing pediatric traveler's diarrhea.

### An update on travelers' diarrhea [^6f5f6304]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Travelers' diarrhea, affecting millions of travelers every year globally, continues to be a leading cause of morbidity despite advances in vaccination, prevention, and treatment. Complications of travelers' diarrhea often present to gastroenterologists and some patients followed by gastroenterologists are at higher risk of developing travelers' diarrhea. This review will provide an update on recent progress made in the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of travelers' diarrhea.

Recent Findings

Most causes of travelers' diarrhea remain bacterial, but newly recognized pathogens are emerging. Patient-related and travel-related factors affect disease development risk and should guide prophylaxis and treatment. Although specific vaccines are being developed, they have not yet had a major impact on travelers' diarrhea, and understanding their roles and limitations is especially important. Prophylaxis and treatment of populations at risk (children, chronically ill patients, and those on immunosuppressive medications) remain challenging and require a tailored approach.

Summary

Travelers' diarrhea will continue to challenge patients and physicians despite the use of sanitation advice, prophylactic vaccines, and treatment with antibiotics. Effects may extend beyond the time of travel, such as postinfectious complications and exacerbation of preexisting disease. Future research should focus on novel strategies for reducing exposure to pathogens, vaccine development, early detection, and targeted treatments.

### Traveler's diarrhea in the pediatric population: etiology and impact [^15d0cbff]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Children who travel are at risk of developing the same, well-known illnesses that affect adult travelers. The etiology, treatment, and actual risk of these illnesses are not well defined in children. The limited amount of data available forces clinicians to extrapolate appropriate treatment for children. Recommendations for children have not been standardized. The role and judicious use of antimicrobials in the treatment of pediatric traveler's diarrhea have evolved during recent decades and will be reviewed here. The past 2 decades have seen an unprecedented, sustained growth in travel. The epidemiology related to travel medicine has evolved to describe travelers and their illnesses more specifically. The development of the field of travel medicine has led to greater understanding and improved, targeted treatment of travel-related illnesses. Most of the data available today describe traveler's diarrhea in adults. Children traveling to distant destinations from their home country have not been well studied, yet treatment parameters exist in practice and will be reviewed here.

### Traveler's diarrhea: a clinical review [^5c3a972b]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute diarrhea is the most common illness that affects travelers to low-income regions of the world. Although improved hygiene has reduced the risk of traveler's diarrhea in many destinations, the risk remains high in others.

Objective

To review the current state of knowledge on the etiology, risk factors, prevention, and management of traveler's diarrhea.

Evidence Review

A search of the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases for the period 2012-April 2014 was performed for articles on traveler's diarrhea. The database search yielded 2976 articles, of which 37 were included in this review. These were added to 85 articles previously identified by the authors.

Findings

Improved hygiene has reduced the risk of traveler's diarrhea from 20% or more (for a 2-week stay) to between 8% and 20% in some parts of the world. Acquiring traveler's diarrhea causes 12% to 46% of travelers to change their travel plans. Returning travelers seeking medical care have a diagnosis of gastrointestinal disturbance in approximately one-third of all cases. Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome may occur in 3% to 17% of patients who have had traveler's diarrhea. Prevention of traveler's diarrhea by dietary avoidance measures is often not successful. Chemoprophylaxis should be restricted to travelers who are at risk of severe complications of diarrhea. Ciprofloxacin is the standard treatment in self-therapy of traveler's diarrhea except when patients are in South or Southeast Asia, where azithromycin is preferred.

Conclusions and Relevance

Diarrhea remains a common problem for international travelers. Persons intending to travel to at-risk countries should be counseled regarding prevention measures and may be given a travel pack that includes medications for self-treatment should they become ill.

### Emerging concepts in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of travelers' diarrhea [^76597cac]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Traveller's diarrhea, though not life-threatening. is often a vexing problem, which impacts overall function of the traveller while on holiday. Increasing data is available regarding molecular diagnostic techniques, which may help obtain an early etiologic diagnosis. Use of antibiotics for traveller's diarrhea is controversial in this era of multidrug resistance and microbiome disruption.

Recent Findings

Travel to the tropics promotes gut colonization with drug-resistant bacteria and this risk increases after treatment with antibiotics, leading to potential ecological impacts in the country of residence.

Summary

Traveller's diarrhea is common and can impact a traveller's itinerary leading to significant inconvenience, and occasional longer term sequelae. Though bacterial causes predominate, recommended treatment is conservative in mild-to-moderate cases. Molecular techniques for early diagnosis of traveller's diarrhea may help with appropriate management. Treatment with antibiotics is sometimes required but is associated with gut colonization by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

### New insights and directions in travelers' diarrhea [^f1c0297d]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Since first studied more than 5 decades ago the risk of travelers'diarrhea for persons going from industrialized regions to developing countries has remained high. Most cases of illness are caused by bacterial agents. Travelers' diarrhea is associated with temporary disability and it may progress to chronic intestinal illness and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. Exercising care about food and beverage intake, the use of rifaximin prophylaxis for selective patients, and self-treatment of all resultant illness will continue to be the way in which the disease is prevented or managed best by travelers. Future approaches will be aimed at making host regions safer and providing more effective methods of treatment and prevention of enteric disease during short-term international travel.

### Travellers' diarrhoea-solidifying our knowledgebase [^89c0a944]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Travellers' diarrhoea remains one of the most common diseases amongst international travellers. However, significant uncertainty remains about the most effective strategies for its prevention and management. This review summarises recent advances in travellers' diarrhoea epidemiology, diagnostics, and management, focusing on new severity definitions, the impact of molecular diagnostics, antimicrobial resistance, and postinfectious sequelae.

Recent Findings

The incidence of travellers' diarrhoea remains substantial although much of this is attributable to mild disease. Viral travellers' diarrhoea is more frequently recognised due to the improved sensitivity of molecular diagnostics. Advances in microbiome research reveal both acute and persistent disruption to the microbiota following travellers' diarrhoea and antibiotic use. New severity definitions incorporating functional impairment offer improved clinical relevance but consensus over use remains lacking. Nonabsorptive antibiotics and probiotics show promise for treatment and prevention, but antimicrobial resistance continues to rise. Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) significantly impacts the recovery of some travellers' diarrhoea patients.

Summary

Consensus on severity definitions is needed to support successful research into new vaccines and therapeutics. Surveillance of resistance, research into microbiome disruption and recovery, and development of vaccines and probiotics are key priorities. Better pathophysiological understanding and new intervention strategies are required to help alleviate the suffering of post-travellers' diarrhoea IBS.

### Travelers' diarrhea: antimicrobial therapy and chemoprevention [^72aa115c]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

The use of preventive measures and self-treatment for travelers' diarrhea is routine in regions where the occurrence of diarrhea is predictably high. People traveling to these areas who do not exercise care in their selection of consumed foods and beverages will suffer high rates of illness. Such diarrhea normally affects the traveler for a day, although it can result in chronic postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. Although systemic antibacterial drugs are effective in preventing diarrhea, their use is not routinely recommended because of side effects and their importance as a therapy for extra-intestinal infections. This review focuses on current and future uses of antibacterial drugs in the prevention and therapy of travelers' diarrhea. Minimally absorbed (< 0.4%) rifaximin can effectively reduce the occurrence of travelers' diarrhea without side effects. Bismuth subsalicylate is a useful alternative, although it is less effective than rifaximin for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea and the required doses are less convenient. All people who travel to high-risk areas should take curative antimicrobial agents with them for self-treatment of illness: rifaximin 200 mg three times a day for 3 days, or an absorbable agent such as a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin taken in a single dose initially, with the need for a second or third dose determined by clinical response. Loperamide (up to 8 mg per day for ≤ 2 days) can be given with the antibiotic to offer rapid symptomatic improvement. In the future, the ability to evaluate the genetic risk of illness acquisition might allow person-specific recommendations to be made.

### Rifaximin: a new treatment for travelers' diarrhea [^bb8e0ab7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, drug interactions and precautions, and dosing recommendations of rifaximin, a new nonabsorbed antimicrobial agent for travelers' diarrhea.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-July 2004) was conducted to extract human and animal research data in the English language on rifaximin.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were reviewed and included to evaluate the efficacy of rifaximin in the treatment of travelers' diarrhea.

Data Synthesis

Rifaximin is approved for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea in patients ≥ 12 years of age with diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of Escherichia coli. Rifaximin was superior to placebo and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and equivalent to ciprofloxacin in the primary clinical endpoint of the time to the last unformed stool passed.

Conclusions

Rifaximin is a viable alternative to ciprofloxacin for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea. As rifaximin is not systemically absorbed, it offers the advantage of leading to the development of less resistance compared with systemically absorbed antibiotics, in addition to fewer systemic adverse effects and drug interactions. However, the potential for cross-resistance between rifaximin and rifampin, as well as with other classes of antibiotics, is of concern and needs to be elucidated.

### Health recommendations for international travel: a review of the evidence base of travel medicine [^ce42523a]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

International travel is increasing, including travel to countries with emerging economies. Travel may pose health risks for the individual and contribute to the global spread of infectious diseases. The specialty of travel medicine is aimed at minimizing health risks associated with international travel. The field has emerged in the past 25 years, and the evidence base supporting its clinical practice is growing. This review will describe the evidence base underlying travel medicine, highlight recently updated travel medicine guidelines, and outline future research priorities.

Recent Findings

Recommendations for a number of common vaccines for travelers have been updated recently. More sophisticated detection methods are leading to the identification of a wider spectrum of pathogens associated with travelers' diarrhea, and antibiotic resistance is increasingly being identified. New treatment options for malaria are available, and a fifth Plasmodium species causing disease in humans has been identified.

Summary

An evidence base for the practice of travel medicine is emerging. Expert opinion and consensus guidelines continue to play an important role in supporting clinical practice.

### Traveler's diarrhea [^da549991]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Travelers' diarrhea (TD) is the most important health issue among international travelers. In high risk areas, 50–90% of travelers may experience an episode of TD. The risk of acquiring TD is influenced by factors such as the destination, duration of stay, standard of accommodation, type of travel, age of the traveler, and also by individual risk factors. Most cases of TD are caused by bacteria; treatment for TD are loperamide and antibiotics. Preventive strategies such as hygiene measures have limited impact. Prophylactic intake of antibiotics or vaccines to prevent from TD can be considered in special situations.

### Absence of efficacy of nonviable Lactobacillus acidophilus for the prevention of traveler's diarrhea: a randomized, double-blind, controlled study [^99314078]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Diarrhea is the most common illness associated with international tourism. We evaluated the efficacy of a probiotic preparation of nonviable Lactobacillus acidophilus (hereafter referred to as LA) for the prevention of traveler's diarrhea.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Travelers were randomized to receive either LA or placebo twice daily from 1 day before their departure to 3 days after their return. On each day of the trip and the week following the return, travelers had to record the number and consistency of stools and their adherence to the treatment. Diarrhea was defined as ≥ 3 unformed stools in a 24-h period.

Results

From January 2001 to September 2004, a total of 174 subjects were randomized to each treatment group. Half of the travelers went to West Africa, and organized tours or backpacking were the most common modes of traveling. The incidence of diarrhea did not differ between the 2 groups; it was 61.4 cases per 100 person-months in the LA group (95% confidence interval [CI] 44.1–85.5) and 43.4 cases per 100 person-months in the placebo group (95% CI, 30.0–62.9) (P = 0.14). Adjustment for travel duration and other variables did not reveal any difference between the 2 groups (adjusted hazard ratios comparing the LA and placebo groups were 1.43 [95% CI, 0.87–2.36] in an intent-to-treat analysis and 1.38 [95% CI, 0.79–2.39] in an efficacy analysis).

Conclusions

There was no beneficial effect of treatment with LA for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea. More studies are required to assess the efficacy of other specific probiotics (e.g., a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG preparation) for preventing traveler's diarrhea.

### Traveler's diarrhea [^ab9109e8]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Acute diarrhea affects millions of persons who travel to developing countries each year. Food and water contaminated with fecal matter are the main sources of infection. Bacteria such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella are common causes of traveler's diarrhea. Parasites and viruses are less common etiologies. Travel destination is the most significant risk factor for traveler's diarrhea. The efficacy of pretravel counseling and dietary precautions in reducing the incidence of diarrhea is unproven. Empiric treatment of traveler's diarrhea with antibiotics and loperamide is effective and often limits symptoms to one day. Rifaximin, a recently approved antibiotic, can be used for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea in regions where noninvasive E. coli is the predominant pathogen. In areas where invasive organisms such as Campylobacter and Shigella are common, fluoroquinolones remain the drug of choice. Azithromycin is recommended in areas with quinolone-resistant Campylobacter and for the treatment of children and pregnant women.

### Effect of adjunctive loperamide in combination with antibiotics on treatment outcomes in traveler's diarrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a803085a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A previous Cochrane Collaboration review established an effective advantage of antibiotic therapy, compared with placebo, for treatment of traveler's diarrhea. The goal of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to establish the effect on treatment outcomes of using antimotility agents in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.

Methods

The meta-analysis was conducted through searches of electronic databases and pertinent reference lists (including other review articles) and consultation with experts in the field. Clinical trials on therapy of infectious diarrhea in adult populations that met eligibility criteria were studied. Data were extracted and verified by 2 independent investigators and were analyzed for outcomes of clinical cure at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h and time to last unformed stool. Study quality, heterogeneity, and publication bias were assessed. When appropriate, effect estimates among studies were pooled and sensitivity analyses were performed.

Results

Nine studies consisting of 12 different adjunctive loperamide antibiotic regimens were included for analysis. Among 6 paired studies comparing antibiotics alone versus antibiotics in combination with loperamide, the odds of clinical cure at 24 h and 48 h favored combination therapy, with summary odds ratios of 2.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.8–3.6; P = 0.20 by chi(2) heterogeneity statistic) and 2.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.5–3.1; P = 0.20, by chi(2) heterogeneity statistic), respectively, with no evidence of heterogeneity. Factors that possibly affect advantage of combination therapy over solo therapy included increased frequency of pretreatment diarrhea and higher prevalence of noninvasive pathogens.

Conclusion

Antibiotic therapy with adjunctive loperamide offers an advantage over antibiotics alone by decreasing the illness duration and increasing the probability of early clinical cure.

### Traveller's diarrhoea [^ec20fd00]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2005). Medium credibility.

Traveller's diarrhoea affects over 50% of travellers to some destinations and can disrupt holidays and business trips. This review examines the main causes and epidemiology of the syndrome, which is associated with poor public health infrastructure and hygiene practices, particularly in warmer climates. Although travellers may be given common sense advice on avoidance of high-risk foods and other measures to prevent traveller's diarrhoea, adherence to such advice is sometimes difficult and the evidence for its effectiveness is contradictory. However, non-antimicrobial means for prevention of traveller's diarrhoea are favoured in most settings. A simple stepwise approach to the management of traveller's diarrhoea includes single doses or 3-day courses of antimicrobials, often self administered. The antibiotics of choice are currently fluoroquinolones or azithromycin, with an emerging role for rifaximin. In the long term, there will be greater benefit and effect on the health of local inhabitants and travellers from improving public health and hygiene standards at tourist destinations.

### Military and civilian sector practice patterns for short-term travelers' diarrhea self-treatment in adults [^647ba60b]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The Deployment and Travel Medicine Knowledge, Attitude, Practice and Outcomes Study (KAPOS) investigates medical provider and traveler contributions to medical outcomes within the U.S. Military Health System. Travelers' diarrhea is among the most common of travel-related illnesses, and travelers' diarrhea self-treatment (TDST) is a recommended topic in pretravel healthcare visits. – The U.S. military considers travelers' diarrhea to be one of the most important infectious disease threats to force health protection, and as such, it is a major focus of research and development activities. Guidelines for the use of TDST exist, with many of the underlying studies conducted in a military setting. – Studies predating these guidelines show inconsistent awareness among military clinicians of travelers' diarrhea management principles. The aim of this study was to describe prescription patterns for travelers' diarrhea in the Military Health System and identify variation in practice by practice setting (military versus civilian facilities), military duty status (service members versus other beneficiaries), and provider specialty (travel medicine specialists versus nonspecialists).

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^f927eebd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — empiric antimicrobial therapy for acute and persistent watery diarrhea is generally discouraged: in most people with acute watery diarrhea and without recent international travel, empiric antimicrobial therapy is not recommended (strong, low), with an exception that may be made in people who are ill-appearing, and empiric treatment should be avoided in people with persistent watery diarrhea lasting 14 days or more (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with acute or persistent watery diarrhea should not be offered empiric or preventive therapy, but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). Features suggesting inflammatory infection that warrant investigation include high fever, significant abdominal pain, and duration > 3 days, and given the relatively small benefit of empiric treatment (1 day shorter illness on average) and the likelihood of viral infection in the absence of inflammatory signs, empiric treatment cannot be recommended and may be potentially harmful.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^7e7232f1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — prevention and prophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea: Patient level counseling on prevention of acute enteric infection is not routinely recommended but may be considered in the individual or close contacts of the individual who is at high risk for complications. Individuals should undergo pretravel counseling regarding high-risk food/beverage avoidance to prevent traveler's diarrhea. Frequent and effective hand washing and alcohol-based hand sanitizers are of limited value in preventing most forms of traveler's diarrhea but may be useful where low-dose pathogens are responsible for the illness as for example during a cruise ship outbreak of norovirus infection, institutional outbreak, or in endemic diarrhea prevention. Bismuth subsalicylates have moderate effectiveness and may be considered for travelers who do not have any contraindications to use and can adhere to the frequent dosing requirements. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics for prevention of TD are not recommended. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis has moderate to good effectiveness and may be considered in high-risk groups for short-term use.

### Travelers' diarrhea [^2b7a409d]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Travelers' diarrhea affects 20–60% of travelers to low-income regions of the world. Much of the evidence for the clinical description and management of travelers' diarrhea was generated years ago, however, there is new information on geographic and host risk, etiology, and prevention strategies.

Recent Findings

Travel to South Asia, followed by sub-Saharan Africa and South America, carries the highest risk for diarrheal syndromes in returned travelers. Women are more susceptible to travel-related diarrhea than men. Host genetic studies have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the lactoferrin, osteoprotegerin, and IL-10 genes are associated with small but increased risks for diarrhea and enteric pathogens. Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis is likely to be a new agent identified as causing travelers' diarrhea, and heat-stable toxin-producing Escherichia coli appears to be more common than heat-labile toxin E. coli. Overall levels of sanitation at the travel destination, including individual eating establishments, are strong predictors for acquisition of travelers' diarrhea. A new transdermal LT vaccine shows promise in modifying the severity of travelers' diarrhea. It remains uncertain whether prophylaxis or prompt self-treatment of travelers' diarrhea will prevent late-onset irritable bowel syndrome. For self-treatment, azithromycin is the drug of choice in travelers to areas where there is a high risk of fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter spp., such as South and Southeast Asia and possibly North Africa, Central and South America.

Summary

There is increased understanding of the determinants of travelers' diarrhea. Despite this travelers' diarrhea remains one of the most common illnesses in travelers. Continued focus on intervention strategies may ultimately lead to decreased incidence.

### Drug prophylaxis for travelers' diarrhea [^d5476105]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Travelers' diarrhea is the most common health impairment in persons visiting developing countries, affecting 20% to > 50% of tourists. Although it is usually benign, travelers' diarrhea represents a considerable socioeconomic burden for both the traveler and the host country. The most common enteropathogens are enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative Escherichia coli. Travelers' compliance with dietary precautionary measures is poor. Despite the excellent protection rates provided by antibiotics, routine administration of prophylaxis is currently not recommended because of potential adverse reactions. Of the various antibiotics that have been tested, quinolones are considered to be the first choice worldwide; however, quinolone-resistant pathogens are increasingly being isolated. Because it is frequently administered and provides only moderate protection, bismuth subsalicylate is not considered a recommendable option for prophylaxis in Europe, where it is rarely available anyhow. To date, no probiotic has been able to demonstrate clinically relevant protection worldwide. In conclusion, there is no satisfactory prophylactic option, and worldwide monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the search for novel antimicrobial agents, such as nonabsorbed antibiotics, and nonantibiotic medications should continue.

### Current concepts in travelers' diarrhea: epidemiology, antimicrobial resistance and treatment [^5ae3d8fa]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to review recent advances in travelers' diarrhea, which remains one of the most common health problems afflicting individuals from developed countries visiting less affluent regions of the world.

Recent Findings

A large epidemiologic study done at the point of departure provided insights into regional risk factors for travelers' diarrhea and demonstrated that visitors rarely exercised dietary precautions aimed at disease prevention. A preventive program implemented with the close interaction between public health agencies, hotel industry and academia can result in effective reduction of cases. A polymorphism in the IL-8 gene promoter is associated with susceptibility to diarrhea due to enteroaggregative Escherichia coli. New diagnostic tools assist in better understanding the role of norovirus and emerging bacterial enteric pathogens such as enteroaggregative E. coli. Rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic, is a safe and effective alternative for the prevention and treatment of travelers' diarrhea due to non-invasive organisms.

Summary

Traditional public health and new antimicrobial agents can decrease the risk of travel related diarrhea.

### Diarrhoea in adults (acute) [^aff905ff]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An estimated 4000 million cases of diarrhoea occurred worldwide in 1996, resulting in 2.5 million deaths.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute diarrhoea in adults living in resource-rich countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute mild-to-moderate diarrhoea in adults from resource-rich countries traveling to resource-poor countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute mild-to-moderate diarrhoea in adults living in resource-poor countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute severe diarrhoea in adults living in resource-poor countries? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to January 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 71 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, antimotility agents, antisecretory agents, bismuth subsalicylate, diet, intravenous rehydration, nasogastric tube rehydration, and oral rehydration solutions (amino acid oral rehydration solution, bicarbonate oral rehydration solution, reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution, rice-based oral rehydration solution, standard oral rehydration solution).

### Acute diarrhea [^2c51426b]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Acute diarrhea in adults is a common problem encountered by family physicians. The most common etiology is viral gastroenteritis, a self-limited disease. Increases in travel, comorbidities, and foodborne illness lead to more bacteria-related cases of acute diarrhea. A history and physical examination evaluating for risk factors and signs of inflammatory diarrhea and/or severe dehydration can direct any needed testing and treatment. Most patients do not require laboratory workup, and routine stool cultures are not recommended. Treatment focuses on preventing and treating dehydration. Diagnostic investigation should be reserved for patients with severe dehydration or illness, persistent fever, bloody stool, or immunosuppression, and for cases of suspected nosocomial infection or outbreak. Oral rehydration therapy with early refeeding is the preferred treatment for dehydration. Antimotility agents should be avoided in patients with bloody diarrhea, but loperamide/simethicone may improve symptoms in patients with watery diarrhea. Probiotic use may shorten the duration of illness. When used appropriately, antibiotics are effective in the treatment of shigellosis, campylobacteriosis, Clostridium difficile, traveler's diarrhea, and protozoal infections. Prevention of acute diarrhea is promoted through adequate hand washing, safe food preparation, access to clean water, and vaccinations.

### Foodborne and waterborne illness and breastfeeding… [^b921899c]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance Breastfeeding mothers with travelers' diarrhea from food or water should continue to breastfeed their infants while also significantly increasing their fluid intake. Exclusive breastfeeding protects infants against travelers' diarrhea. Breastfeeding with travelers' diarrhea A nursing mother with diarrhea caused by food or water sources can continue to breastfeed her child. However, she should also increase her own fluid intake to prevent dehydration. The organisms that cause travelers' diarrhea do not pass through breast milk. It is safe for mothers and their children using properly prepared solutions of oral rehydration salts to continue to breastfeed. Antidiarrheal medications Breastfeeding mothers should carefully check the labels of over-the-counter antidiarrheal medications to avoid using bismuth subsalicylate. These compounds can lead to the transfer of salicylate to the child through breast milk.

Antibiotics Fluoroquinolones and macrolides, commonly used to treat travelers' diarrhea, are excreted in breast milk. Decisions about whether a nursing mother should use these antibiotics should be made in consultation with the child's primary care provider. Most experts consider short-term use of the antibiotic azithromycin compatible with breastfeeding. Breastfeeding infants with travelers' diarrhea Exclusive breastfeeding protects infants against travelers' diarrhea. Breastfeeding is an ideal rehydration therapy. Children who are suspected of having travelers' diarrhea should be breastfed more frequently. Children in this situation should not be offered other fluids or foods that replace breastfeeding. Parents of children with travelers' diarrhea should consult with the child's primary care provider.

### Poorly absorbed antibiotics for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea [^95b757a4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

This article describes the use of poorly absorbed antibiotics for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea. Poorly absorbed oral antibiotics can deliver high concentrations of drug to the site of enteric infection with minimal risk of systemic adverse effects, toxicity, and drug interactions. Compared with systemically absorbed oral antibiotics, poorly absorbed oral antibiotics may be less associated with the pressure that leads to the development of bacterial resistance, because they do not affect bacteria outside the gastrointestinal tract. In clinical studies, poorly absorbed oral antibiotics, including aztreonam, bicozamycin, and rifaximin, were more effective than and as well tolerated as placebo; in particular, rifaximin was as effective as oral ciprofloxacin in reducing the duration of illness in traveler's diarrhea. More research is warranted to delineate the effects of poorly absorbed antibiotics in invasive infection and to assess the potential for the development of bacterial resistance.

### Therapy for and prevention of traveler's diarrhea [^10ad652d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Acute diarrhea associated with international travel is commonly caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, or noroviruses. Early studies to define these enteropathogens took place at the University of Maryland during the Theodore E. Woodward years. Although a reduction in the rate of diarrhea may be possible through avoidance of foods and beverages likely to be contaminated, a more effective preventive strategy is to administer nonabsorbed (< 0.4%) rifaximin each day during trips to areas where the risk of traveler's diarrhea is high (i.e., high-risk areas). For the self-treatment of diarrhea that occurs during travel, all persons planning trips to high-risk areas should take with them medication with expected activity against the prevalent bacterial enteropathogens: rifaximin (for the treatment of common afebrile, nondysenteric diarrhea), a fluoroquinolone, or azithromycin. Further study is needed to determine whether it is possible to avoid important morbidity associated with diarrhea and the development of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome with chemoprophylaxis and/or early effective treatment.

Traveler's diarrhea — course, treatment, and etiologies: The majority of traveler's diarrhea is self-limited and lasts for < 7 days; most TD is self-treatable with oral rehydration therapy and, for nonbloody diarrhea in adults, an antimotility agent. Approximately 10% of traveler's diarrhea is caused by parasitic infections, which can persist for weeks to months, and Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea is an increasing concern among travelers with persistent diarrhea, especially those with recent antimicrobial agent therapy; in a US FoodNet study between 2004 and 2009, the majority of cases of typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and Shigella dysenteriae infection were associated with travel.

### Management of the returning traveler with diarrhea [^068ca91e]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Traveler's diarrhea (TD) strikes 20–60% of travelers visiting developing countries. It occurs shortly after the return and can be distinguished into two categories: acute and persistent TD. Acute TD, mostly caused by bacterial and viral pathogens, is usually mild and self-limited, and deserves empirical symptomatic and/or antibiotic therapy in selected cases. Fluoroquinolones are progressively superseded in this indication by azithromycin, a well tolerated macrolide active against most bacteria responsible for TD, including the quinolone-resistant species of Campylobacter jejuni that are now pervasive, especially in Southeast Asia and India. Persistent TD in the returning traveler is much rarer than its acute counterpart and may be associated with three types of causes. Persistent infections, among which Giardia and possibly Entamoeba predominate, account for a significant proportion of cases. Postinfectious processes represent a second cause and comprise temporary lactose malabsorption and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome, now considered a major cause of persistent TD. Finally, apparently unrelated chronic diseases causing diarrhea are occasionally unmasked by TD and represent a third type of persistent TD, among which the well established case of incident inflammatory bowel disease poses intriguing pathogenesis questions. This review discusses recent advances in the field and provides practical recommendations for the management of TD in adult, immunocompetent returning travelers.

### What's new in enteric infectious diseases at home and abroad [^1189bb3b]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review was designed to focus on the important research in the area of acute infectious diarrhea published within the past year. PubMed was reviewed for articles published in 2004 and 2005 relating to pathogen-specific diarrhea and for travelers' diarrhea to identify the newly published articles.

Recent Findings

New studies continue to show the importance of the diarrheagenic Escherichia coli as causes of acute and persistent diarrhea. Enteroaggregative E. coli has recently been shown to be an unrecognized cause of community-acquired diarrhea in infants in the USA. Genetic factors explain an increased susceptibility to travelers' diarrhea among international travelers. Also, poorly non-absorbed rifaximin (< 0.4%) was shown to be an effective drug when used prophylactically to prevent bacterial diarrhea during high risk travel.

Summary

Studies will continue to define the etiology of diarrhea and to better understand the epidemiology and prevention of infectious diarrhea. Antibacterial resistance among enteric bacterial pathogens is a growing problem, leading to the search for newer antibacterial drugs. Diarrhea due to bacterial agents in international travelers can be prevented and treated successfully by antibacterial drugs. The nonabsorbed rifamycin drug, rifaximin, appears to be ideally suited to become the important new drug in prevention and treatment of travelers' diarrhea. Studies are underway to determine the value of the drug in preventing invasive forms of diarrhea during travel to Asia and in the prevention of the commonly occurring post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.

### A randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of rifaximin compared with placebo and with ciprofloxacin in the treatment of travelers' diarrhea [^b4952a47]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2006). Low credibility.

Rifaximin was compared with placebo and ciprofloxacin for treatment of travelers' diarrhea in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Adult travelers (N = 399) consulting travel clinics in Mexico, Guatemala, and India were randomized to receive rifaximin 200 mg three times a day, ciprofloxacin (500 mg two times a day and placebo once a day), or placebo three times a day for 3 days. Patients recorded in daily diaries the time and consistency of each stool and documented symptoms for 5 days after treatment. Stool samples were collected for microbiologic evaluations before and after treatment. The median time to last unformed stool (TLUS) in the rifaximin group (32.0 hours) was less than one half that in the placebo group (65.5 hours; P = 0.001; risk ratio 1.6; 95% confidence interval 1.2, 2.2; primary efficacy endpoint). The median TLUS in the ciprofloxacin group was 28.8 hours (P = 0.0003 versus placebo; P = 0.35 versus rifaximin). Rifaximin was less effective than ciprofloxacin for invasive intestinal bacterial pathogens. Oral rifaximin is a safe and effective treatment of travelers' diarrhea caused by noninvasive pathogens.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^c5bd52b1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — treatment of acute disease: The usage of balanced electrolyte rehydration over other oral rehydration options in the elderly with severe diarrhea or any traveler with cholera-like watery diarrhea is recommended. The use of probiotics or prebiotics for the treatment of acute diarrhea in adults is not recommended, except in cases of postantibiotic-associated illness. Bismuth subsalicylates can be administered to control rates of passage of stool and may help travelers function better during bouts of mild-to-moderate illness. In patients receiving antibiotics for traveler's diarrhea, adjunctive loperamide therapy should be administered to decrease duration of diarrhea and increase chance for a cure. The evidence does not support empiric anti-microbial therapy for routine acute diarrheal infection, except in cases of traveler's diarrhea (TD) where the likelihood of bacterial pathogens is high enough to justify the potential side effects of antibiotics.

### Epidemiology of traveler's diarrhea [^5f37b7c9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Among travelers from developed countries who visit developing countries, > 60% may experience traveler's diarrhea, accounting for 40,000 travelers daily or > 15 million travelers annually. Traveler's diarrhea is often accompanied by other symptoms, most often abdominal cramps. Although the spontaneous cure occurs after a mean of 4 days, a few patients have symptoms for weeks, and it is increasingly noted that some patients may later develop irritable bowel syndrome. Traveler's diarrhea is life threatening only exceptionally, but it frequently it leads to incapacitation. Both host factors (e.g., age, behavior, nationality, and genetic factors) and environmental factors (primarily the selected destination and hotel) play an important role in risk for traveler's diarrhea.

### Trial evaluating ambulatory therapy of travelers' diarrhea (TrEAT TD) study: a randomized controlled trial comparing 3 single-dose antibiotic regimens with loperamide [^369fe049]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recommended treatment for travelers' diarrhea includes the combination of an antibiotic, usually a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin, and loperamide for rapid resolution of symptoms. However, adverse events, postdose nausea with high-dose azithromycin, effectiveness of single-dose rifaximin, and emerging resistance to front-line agents are evidence gaps underlying current recommendations.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind trial was conducted in 4 countries (Afghanistan, Djibouti, Kenya, and Honduras) between September 2012 and July 2015. US and UK service members with acute watery diarrhea were randomized and received single-dose azithromycin (500 mg; 106 persons), levofloxacin (500 mg; 111 persons), or rifaximin (1650 mg; 107 persons), in combination with loperamide (labeled dosing). The efficacy outcomes included clinical cure at 24 hours and time to last unformed stool.

Results

Clinical cure at 24 hours occurred in 81.4%, 78.3%, and 74.8% of the levofloxacin, azithromycin, and rifaximin arms, respectively. Compared with levofloxacin, azithromycin was not inferior (P = 0.01). Noninferiority could not be shown with rifaximin (P = 0.07). At 48 and 72 hours, efficacy among regimens was equivalent (approximately 91% at 48 and 96% at 72 hours). The median time to last unformed stool did not differ between treatment arms (azithromycin, 3.8 hours; levofloxacin, 6.4 hours; rifaximin, 5.6 hours). Treatment failures were uncommon (3.8%, 4.4%, and 1.9% in azithromycin, levofloxacin, and rifaximin arms, respectively) (P = 0.55). There were no differences between treatment arms with postdose nausea, vomiting, or other adverse events.

Conclusions

Single-dose azithromycin, levofloxacin, and rifaximin with loperamide were comparable for treatment of acute watery diarrhea.

Clinical Trial Registration

### Rifaximin for the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea [^209e7132]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable rifamycin derivative with an excellent safety profile and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against a variety of enteropathogens causing acute infectious diarrhea. After oral ingestion, its bioavailability is known to be less than 0.4%, and it has a low potential for significant drug interactions. In the treatment of travelers' diarrhea caused by noninvasive diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, it has been demonstrated that rifaximin significantly shortens the duration of diarrhea and has an efficacy similar to that of ciprofloxacin. Moreover, according to two randomized placebo-controlled trials, prophylactic treatment with rifaximin reduced the risk of developing travelers' diarrhea by more than 50% compared with the placebo group. For the treatment of acute diarrhea unrelated to travel, a short course of rifaximin significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea, and its overall efficacy was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. The discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivoantimicrobial activities of rifaximin, however, and the clinical implication of the rapid appearance of bacterial resistance, must be further elucidated. In conclusion, this gut-selective antibiotic seems to be a promising option for the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea secondary to noninvasive E. coli and also appears to be effective in chemoprophylaxis for travelers' diarrhea.

### Rifaximin: a unique gastrointestinal-selective antibiotic for enteric diseases [^3a059d99]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Rifaximin is gaining attention for its potential activity in a multitude of gastrointestinal diseases. We review the unique pharmaceutical properties of this antibiotic and the published evidence in the literature regarding the use of rifaximin for different gastrointestinal disorders.

Recent Findings

Rifaximin is a gastrointestinal-selective antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, an excellent safety profile, minimal drug interactions, and negligible impact on the intestinal microbiome. Rifaximin is currently approved in the United States for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea caused by noninvasive diarrheagenic Escherichia coli and is approved in more than 30 other countries for a variety of gastrointestinal disorders. Considerable research with this medication has been conducted for the treatment and prevention of travelers' diarrhea, the treatment of portal systemic encephalopathy, Clostridium difficile infection, small bowel intestinal overgrowth, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pouchitis, and colonic diverticular disease.

Summary

Rifaximin is effective for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea and can be considered as the treatment of choice for uncomplicated travelers' diarrhea. When invasive travelers' diarrhea pathogens are suspected, an alternative antibiotic should be administered. Rifaximin appears promising as a chemoprophylaxis for travelers' diarrhea and as a treatment of portal systemic encephalopathy. This antibiotic may be effective for other gastrointestinal diseases, but more well designed clinical studies are needed to confirm its efficacy for these off-label indications. Future studies will determine whether the development of significant bacterial resistance will limit rifaximin use.

### Update in traveler's diarrhea [^d2fbc8b7]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

TD has not proved as preventable as hoped, despite knowing that it is transmitted mainly through food. Travelers have little ability to select restaurants based on the kitchen hygiene. The rates of TD in travelers to developing countries have not changed in the past 50 years, either because the dietary precautions they are taught are not effective or they cannot be adhered to in the course of a pleasurable vacation. Nonantibiotic prophylaxis with bismuth subsalicylate has the potential to prevent 40% to 60% of TD episodes in short-term travelers, and is probably underused. Antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent up to 90% of infections, but is not routinely recommended. Empiric treatment of TD has been the best approach to dealing with this problem, but its usefulness is being undermined by growing antibiotic resistance in many parts of the world. Fluoroquinolones are still the most useful agents where Campylobacter is not a predominant pathogen. Rifaximin may prove to be a useful addition to the options for treatment and prophylaxis. If used for treatment, it may require a backup antibiotic in areas where Campylobacter and Shigella are prominent pathogens.

Persistent diarrhea — management focuses on treating identified enteropathogens and underlying gastrointestinal (GI) disease: specific treatment of identified enteropathogens is usually indicated and appropriate management of underlying GI disease is warranted; if bacterial infection is suspected or determined by culture-independent testing, stool culture can determine antimicrobial susceptibility; dietary modifications might help patients with malabsorption or lactose intolerance; symptomatic treatment or the use of nonabsorbable antibiotics offers potential benefit if small intestinal bacterial overgrowth accompanies the symptom complex.

Enterococcus faecium did not prevent TD, while Saccharomyces boulardii given to 3,000 Austrian travelers produced a clinically modest dose-dependent benefit, most notable in travelers to North Africa and Turkey. Lactobacillus GG showed mixed results: among 276 Finnish travelers in Turkey, the diarrhea attack rate was 41% vs. 46.5% with placebo with protection 39.5% at one location and almost nil at the other; in a US study of 245 travelers, incidence per day at risk was 3.9% vs. 7.4% with a calculated protection rate of 47%. Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and a nonviable formulation of Lactobacillus acidophilus were ineffective.

### Acute diarrhea in adults [^3bf816e4]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute diarrheal disease accounts for 179 million outpatient visits annually in the United States. Diarrhea can be categorized as inflammatory or noninflammatory, and both types have infectious and noninfectious causes. Infectious noninflammatory diarrhea is often viral in etiology and is the most common presentation; however, bacterial causes are also common and may be related to travel or foodborne illness. History for patients with acute diarrhea should include onset and frequency of symptoms, stool character, a focused review of systems including fever and other symptoms, and evaluation of exposures and risk factors. The physical examination should include evaluation for signs of dehydration, sepsis, or potential surgical processes. Most episodes of acute diarrhea in countries with adequate food and water sanitation are uncomplicated and self-limited, requiring only an initial evaluation and supportive treatment. Additional diagnostic evaluation and management may be warranted when diarrhea is bloody or mucoid or when risk factors are present, including immunocompromise or recent hospitalization. Unless an outbreak is suspected, molecular studies are preferred over traditional stool cultures. In all cases, management begins with replacing water, electrolytes, and nutrients. Oral rehydration is preferred; however, signs of severe dehydration or sepsis warrant intravenous rehydration. Antidiarrheal agents can be symptomatic therapy for acute watery diarrhea and can help decrease inappropriate antibiotic use. Empiric antibiotics are rarely warranted, except in sepsis and some cases of travelers' or inflammatory diarrhea. Targeted antibiotic therapy may be appropriate following microbiologic stool assessment. Hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, and food and water safety measures are integral to preventing infectious diarrheal illnesses.

Immunocompromised travelers — contraindications and other health risks — Healthcare professionals should assess whether the traveler's conditions, medications, or treatments constitute contraindications to, decrease the effectiveness of, or increase the risk for adverse events from disease-prevention measures for the trip. Depending on destination, measures might include immunizations or medications for malaria chemoprophylaxis or self-treatment for travelers' diarrhea. Clinicians also should assess whether destination health hazards could exacerbate underlying conditions or cause more severe outcomes in an immunocompromised traveler and determine whether specific interventions are available to mitigate these risks.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^6fe5900e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — non-antibiotic therapies for acute diarrheal infections in adults — medical treatment is not required in patients with non-severe, non-cholera-like diarrhea. Bismuth subsalicylates (BSSs) can be administered to control rates of passage of stool and may help travelers function better during bouts of mild to moderate illness. (Strong recommendation, high level of evidence) BSS will reduce the stools passed by ~40% and the recommended dose of BSS for therapy of acute diarrhea is 30 mL (525 mg) of liquid formulation or two tablets (263 mg per tablet) chewed well each 30–60 min not to exceed eight doses in 24 h. The major antimotility drugs used for therapy of acute diarrhea are loperamide and diphenoxylate. Of these, the most useful drug is loperamide, which has less central opiate effects. In patients receiving antibiotics for TD, adjunctive loperamide therapy can be administered to decrease duration of diarrhea and increase chance for a cure. (Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence) The recommended dose of loperamide for therapy for adults with diarrhea is 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after subsequently.

### Treatment of travelers' diarrhea: randomized trial comparing rifaximin, rifaximin plus loperamide, and loperamide alone [^00d4f780]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Antimotility agents provide rapid temporary relief of acute diarrhea, whereas antibiotics slowly cure the illness. Thus, the combination of an antimotility agent and an antibiotic may provide greater therapeutic benefit than either drug alone. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of rifaximin-loperamide in the treatment of travelers' diarrhea.

Methods

Consenting adults with acute diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools in 24 hours with ≥ 1 symptom of enteric infection) were randomized to receive rifaximin 200 mg 3 times daily for 3 days; loperamide 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after each unformed stool; or a combination of both drugs using the same dosing regimen. The primary end point was the median time from beginning therapy until passing the last unformed stool.

Results

A total of 310 patients completed treatment with rifaximin (n = 102), loperamide (n = 104), or rifaximin-loperamide combination therapy (n = 104). The groups showed demographic similarity. Rifaximin and rifaximin-loperamide significantly reduced the median time until passage of the last unformed stool (32.5 ± 4.14 h and 27.3 ± 4.13 h, respectively) vs loperamide (69 ± 4.11 h; P = 0.0019). The mean number of unformed stools passed during illness was lower with rifaximin-loperamide (3.99 ± 4.28) compared with rifaximin (6.23 ± 6.90; P = 0.004) or loperamide alone (6.72 ± 6.93; P = 0.002). All treatments were well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse events.

Conclusions

Rifaximin-loperamide therapy provided rapid symptomatic improvement and greater overall wellness compared with either agent alone.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of rifaximin to prevent travelers' diarrhea [^a09580b0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Travelers' diarrhea causes substantial morbidity and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome.

Objective

To evaluate nonabsorbable rifaximin for prevention of travelers' diarrhea.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Setting

Guadalajara, Mexico.

Participants

U.S. students.

Intervention

On arrival in Guadalajara, Mexico, 210 U.S. adults received rifaximin (200 mg/d, 200 mg twice daily, or 200 mg 3 times daily) or placebo for 2 weeks.

Measurements

Participants were followed daily for 3 weeks for enteric disease and symptoms and daily for 5 weeks for drug side effects. Changes in intestinal coliform flora were studied.

Results

Travelers' diarrhea developed in 14.74% of participants taking rifaximin and 53.70% of those taking placebo (rate ratio, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.17 to 0.43]). Rifaximin provided 72% and 77% protection against travelers' diarrhea and antibiotic-treated travelers' diarrhea, respectively (P < 0.001 for both), and all rifaximin doses were superior to placebo. In the groups that did not report travelers' diarrhea, rifaximin significantly reduced the occurrence of mild diarrhea (P = 0.02) and moderate and severe intestinal problems (P = 0.009 for pain or cramps; P = 0.02 for excessive gas). Rates of adverse events were comparable in the rifaximin and placebo groups. Minimal changes in coliform flora were found during rifaximin therapy.

Limitations

Rifaximin safely prevented travelers' diarrhea in Mexico, where most cases are caused by diarrhea-producing Escherichia coli. A study is needed in Asia to determine whether rifaximin can prevent diarrhea caused by invasive bacterial pathogens.

Conclusions

Rifaximin prevents travelers' diarrhea with minimal changes in fecal flora, and more liberal chemoprophylaxis against this disease should be considered. Future studies should evaluate whether rifaximin is effective in preventing postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome.

### Military and civilian sector practice patterns for short-term travelers' diarrhea self-treatment in adults [^34050256]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

A predominance of young adult male service members prescribed travel-related medications is consistent with active duty demographics and mission-related travel. This serves as a noteworthy contrast to the more than 29,000 beneficiaries in this study, who would have travel patterns more similar to other civilian populations. Travelers' diarrhea self-treatment antibiotic prescription rates were consistently low at both military and civilian settings, but antibiotics were omitted from care more often at civilian facilities. For service members, this is likely influenced by access to military medical services when deployed or traveling on temporary duty. In that context, withholding standby therapy and providing guidance on how to seek care could be an appropriate course of action. However, because the trend is also seen in care provided to beneficiaries, it suggests that patient or provider preference, or lack of knowledge of self-treatment recommendations could be factors. At military facilities, travel medicine specialists were more likely to prescribe TDST therapies compared with nonspecialists for both service members and beneficiaries. For service members, travel medicine specialists were more likely to prescribe antimotility agents, antibiotics, or combination therapy. For beneficiaries, travel medicine specialists were more likely than nonspecialists to prescribe either antimotility agents alone or a combination of antimotility agents and antibiotics. With some form of TDST prescribed to beneficiaries in approximately 82% of study encounters by travel medicine specialists versus 35% by nonspecialists, this represents an important distinction in the quality of care, based on prevailing evidence and guidelines from national organizations across the timespan that this study describes. –

### Travelers' diarrhea… [^a1b9d8e6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Introduction Travelers' diarrhea is the most predictable travel-related illness. Attack rates range from 30% to 70% of travelers during a 2-week period, depending on the destination and season of travel. Traditionally, TD was thought to be prevented by following simple dietary recommendations, but studies have found that people who follow these rules can still become ill. Poor hygiene practices in local restaurants and underlying hygiene and sanitation infrastructure deficiencies are likely the largest contributors to the risk for TD. Risk for travelers TD occurs equally in male and female travelers; it is more common in young adult travelers than in older travelers. In short-term travelers, bouts of TD do not appear to protect against future attacks, and > 1 episode of TD can occur during a single trip. A cohort of expatriates residing in Kathmandu, Nepal, experienced an average of 3.

2 episodes of TD per person during their first year. In more temperate regions, seasonal variations in diarrhea risk can occur. In South Asia, for example, much higher TD attack rates are reported during the hot months preceding the monsoon. Cyclospora cayetanensis infection, in which symptoms can present quickly. Bacterial and viral TD present with the sudden onset of symptoms that can range from mild cramps and urgent loose stools to severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, and vomiting; with norovirus, vomiting can be more prominent. Diarrhea caused by protozoa. For travelers on shorter trips, symptoms may occur after returning home, often allowing for easier access to more comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and specific treatment. The most common parasitic cause of TD is.

### Azithromycin and loperamide are comparable to levofloxacin and loperamide for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea in United States military personnel in Turkey [^97981e90]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The recommended treatment for traveler's diarrhea is the combination of an appropriate antibiotic (usually a fluoroquinolone) and loperamide. Azithromycin compared favorably with fluoroquinolones in trials that did not include the use of loperamide, but combination therapy has not, to our knowledge, been studied to date.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind trial was conducted at Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, fromJ une 2003 through August 2004. Adults from the United States with noninflammatory diarrhea were randomized to receive a single dose of azithromycin (1000 mg; 106 persons) or levofloxacin (500 mg; 101 persons) plus loperamide (4 mg initially and as needed thereafter). Volunteers maintained a symptom diary and were evaluated on days 1, 3, and 7 after treatment.

Results

No differences were noted with respect to pretreatment symptoms or pathogen distribution. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen isolated (from 45% of patients in the azithromycin group and 42% of patients in the levofloxacin group), and Campylobacter species was the second most common pathogen isolated (from 6% of patients in the azithromycin group and 9% of patients in the levofloxacin group). Median time to last diarrheal stool (azithromycin group, 13 h; levofloxacin group, 3 h), median time to resolution of associated symptoms (2 days), and additional loperamide usage (azithromycin group, 39% of patients; levofloxacin group, 34% of patients) were similar between groups. Azithromycin use was associated with more nausea in the 30 min after dosing (azithromycin group, 8% of patients; levofloxacin group, 1% of patients; Pp.004), but no vomiting or other adverse events were noted in either group.

Conclusions

Single-dose treatment with azithromycin (1000 mg) and loperamide is as effective as single-dose treatment with levofloxacin (500 mg) and loperamide for noninflammatory diarrhea. Although nausea after dosing is uncommon, it is more frequently associated with azithromycin than with levofloxacin. Future studies should focus on determining whether lower doses of azithromycin would decrease the frequency of nausea and decrease treatment costs without affecting efficacy.

### A multisite network assessment of the epidemiology and etiology of acquired diarrhea among U.S. military and Western travelers (global travelers' diarrhea study): a principal role ofamong travelers with gastrointestinal illness [^0a324677]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Travelers' diarrhea (TD) has been described as the most common medical ailment among those traveling from resource-wealthy to resource-poor countries. According to data from the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, the highest burden of infectious diarrhea was reported among U.S. citizens returning from travel to Mexico (32.7%), India (8.2%), and Peru (4.0%). Although modern advances in public health, such as improved water, sanitation and hygiene conditions; development and widespread dissemination of vaccines; and antimicrobials to treat infection have all led to an overall decline in infectious diarrhea during U.S. military engagements, it still remains a significant threat to travelers, both civilian and military, even those whose travel is long term (1 month or more). Military personnel experience TD in austere, operational settings that are unique among international travelers, and present diagnostic challenges. The 2019 U.S. Military Infectious Diseases Threats Prioritization Panel, which ranks infectious disease threats by tiers of military concern to guide medical research investment, ranked bacterial diarrhea first among 65 threats. Diarrheal illnesses continue to threaten operational capability through mission degradation and lost person-hours, with deployed military service members traveling from higher to lower income countries experiencing an approximately 30% incidence of diarrhea, and most cases of untreated TD lasting 4–5 days. There is a dire need for improved surveillance that will better define this infectious disease threat and leading to more effective prevention and treatment practices.

The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division, Global Emerging Infections Surveillance section facilitates global surveillance of enteric pathogens across the Geographic Combatant Commands to provide data that inform force health protection (FHP) decision-making, Department of Defense (DoD) policy, public health action to prevent, detect, and respond to enteric threats, as well as research involving product development (e.g. pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and diagnostics), ultimately benefiting DoD beneficiaries worldwide. Although enteric surveillance throughout the DoD overseas laboratory network is robust, it has been hampered by a lack of integrated case definitions, standardized data elements, and nonuniversally optimized laboratory procedures. Such limitations are challenges to understanding the true burden of disease across regions. In an effort to improve harmonization and yield more comparable data, DoD partners designed and implemented a multisite Global TD (GTD) protocol consisting of standardized case definitions for enteric disease and harmonized laboratory methods for identification of enteric pathogens.

### Military and civilian sector practice patterns for short-term travelers' diarrhea self-treatment in adults [^e1a37dc6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This study shows low overall prescribing of TDST, particularly among civilian providers and military nonspecialists, despite long standing CDC and other guidelines that standby self-treatment of moderate to severe travelers' diarrhea is recommended. Variations in prescribing practices to service members may be accounted for, in part, by Force Health Protection policy, access to deployed medical support, or other differences in patient population itineraries. A practice gap also existed for both Department of Defense service members and beneficiaries cared for at military facilities. Compared with nonspecialists, travel medicine specialists at military facilities were more likely than nonspecialists to prescribe either antimotility agents alone or a combination of antimotility agents and antibiotics to beneficiaries. Travel medicine specialists were more likely than nonspecialists to prescribe any TDST regimen to service members. This suggests a quality of care disparity that may require enhancing provider knowledge of travelers' diarrhea treatment recommendations, processes that improve access to travel medicine decision support tools, and consultative services.

Infectious diarrhea — loperamide and antidiarrheal safety — A meta-analysis has shown loperamide reduced diarrhea prevalence at both 24 and 48 hours after onset of treatment and reduced total duration; however, deaths have been reported in 0.54% of children given loperamide, and all events occurred in children < 3 years old. In healthy adults, loperamide has been shown to be effective in reducing diarrhea, largely in travelers and with antimicrobials, and in these studies it was not associated with increased occurrence of adverse events; loperamide significantly reduces stool volume in traveler's diarrhea and in most noncholera watery diarrhea syndromes. Patients should be advised about medications with the potential to increase the risk of complications from diarrhea, particularly antidiarrheal and antimicrobial agents, and limited reports suggest that routine use of medications with anticholinergic properties may lead to increased risk of severe outcomes, including death, from diarrhea caused by C. difficile and Clostridium perfringens.

Traveler's diarrhea (TD) antimicrobial therapy — azithromycin versus fluoroquinolones — Four randomized controlled trials comparing azithromycin to fluoroquinolones for TD found no efficacy difference, and three trials showed azithromycin was as effective as a fluoroquinolone in Thailand or Mexico. In adult student travelers to Mexico, single-dose azithromycin 1,000 mg was comparable to levofloxacin 500 mg in shortening illness duration, 22.3 vs. 21.5 h. Azithromycin was also active for Campylobacter (including fluoroquinolone-resistant strains) and is effective against Shigella spp. and noninvasive diarrheagenic Escherichia coli.

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^d7ae5a92]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Traveler's diarrhea — fluoroquinolone resistance and role — shows high Campylobacter resistance and advises against empiric fluoroquinolones without pathogen confirmation. Although ciprofloxacin has been regarded as an effective agent for traveler's diarrhea in the past, resistance rates are increasing; resistance to Campylobacter species is particularly problematic in patients with a history of international travel, with fluoroquinolone resistance of approximately 61%. Therefore, fluoroquinolones would not be an appropriate option in the treatment of traveler's diarrhea unless a pathogen is defined and antimicrobial susceptibilities are confirmed.

### Azithromycin found to be comparable to levofloxacin for the treatment of US travelers with acute diarrhea acquired in Mexico [^153f10ee]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Increased drug resistance among enteropathogens is an emergent problem in travelers' diarrhea. This randomized, double-blind trial was conducted in Guadalajara, Mexico, during the summers of 1999–2001 to compare azithromycin with levofloxacin for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea. A total of 217 US adults were randomized to receive a single oral dose of azithromycin (1000 mg; 108 persons) or levofloxacin (500 mg; 109 persons), with a follow-up period of 4 days. Three patients in each group dropped out of the study. The median time between initiation of therapy and passage of the last unformed stool (azithromycin group, 22.3 h; levofloxacin group, 21.5 h) and the number of unformed stools passed during the 4-day follow-up period (azithromycin group, 6.5; levofloxacin group, 5.5) were similar. Treatment failure occurred in 10 patients (9.5%) receiving azithromycin and 8 patients (7.5%) receiving levofloxacin. Possible minor, self-limiting adverse events occurred in 57 patients in each treatment group. Azithromycin was found to be a safe and effective alternative to levofloxacin for the treatment of acute travelers' diarrhea in US adult travelers to Mexico.
