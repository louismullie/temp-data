## Question

Anti VEGF agents

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anti-VEGF agents, including their mechanisms, agents, indications, efficacy, dosing strategies, safety, special populations, resistance, cost and access, and emerging developments. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanistic foundation and classification of anti-VEGF therapies. Then, I should verify the key agents and their molecular distinctions. Next, I will review indications across oncology and ophthalmology. After that, I should examine efficacy data by indication. Then, I need to analyze dosing strategies and their trade-offs. Next, I will evaluate safety, including systemic risks and ocular complications. I will then consider special populations and practical constraints. Finally, I should address resistance mechanisms, cost and access, emerging innovations, and synthesize practical recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic basis and classification. Anti-VEGF therapies reduce angiogenesis by neutralizing VEGF-A or blocking VEGF receptors; mechanisms include monoclonal antibodies (bevacizumab, ranibizumab, brolucizumab), soluble decoy receptors (aflibercept), and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (fruquintinib, sunitinib, pazopanib), with the therapeutic benefit being multifactorial beyond simple vessel pruning, including vascular normalization and modulation of the tumor microenvironment [^11226MJ4] [^115YA3xB] [^112X7Uwh].

> Wait, let me verify the key agents and their molecular differences. Bevacizumab is a full-length humanized IgG1 that binds all VEGF-A isoforms. Ranibizumab is a Fab fragment derived from bevacizumab. Aflibercept is a fusion protein acting as a VEGF trap. Brolucizumab is a small single-chain antibody fragment. And faricimab is a bispecific antibody targeting both VEGF-A and angiopoietin-2, offering dual-pathway inhibition with extended durability, which is important for treat-and-extend paradigms [^116RrpbN] [^113BsKdY] [^111SWPEw].

> I need to check oncology indications next. In cancer, anti-VEGF agents are approved across multiple lines and histologies, including metastatic colorectal, non-small cell lung, renal cell, ovarian, cervical, hepatocellular, and glioblastoma, and the ASCO guidance reinforces anti-VEGF as a standard option in first-line mCRC for certain phenotypes and supports shared decision-making given adverse event risks [^113UrYwQ] [^117PiRoZ] [^116dwLpE].

> Hold on, I should verify ophthalmic indications. In ophthalmology, anti-VEGF therapy is first-line for neovascular AMD, diabetic macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion, and treatment-warranted retinopathy of prematurity, with consistent high-quality evidence and guideline endorsement supporting efficacy and safety over two years, although longer-term safety data remain a focus of ongoing study [^112Wu4jU] [^115fjUvE] [^116zYR7f] [^11433roq] [^116gXy9z].

> Next, I should review efficacy by indication. For nAMD, randomized trials show anti-VEGF maintains vision and can improve it, with ranibizumab and bevacizumab yielding similar visual outcomes despite large cost differences, and faricimab achieves comparable visual gains with extended dosing intervals, reducing treatment burden [^115qNaDj] [^111xwX6j] [^111SWPEw]. For diabetic retinopathy and DME, anti-VEGF improves vision and reduces progression risk compared with laser monotherapy, aligning with ADA and AOA recommendations [^116zYR7f] [^11433roq]. In RVO, anti-VEGF improves visual acuity and is preferred over steroids given the latter's adverse profile. In oncology, bevacizumab and TKIs improve progression-free survival in several cancers, though overall survival gains are inconsistent and context-dependent, with notable lack of OS benefit in newly diagnosed glioblastoma despite PFS improvement [^112cKuPR] [^113CZ7Ni] [^112r2Hkh].

> Let me consider dosing strategies and their trade-offs. Monthly fixed dosing provides the strongest average visual gains but at high visit and injection burden; treat-and-extend individualizes intervals to disease activity, maintaining outcomes with fewer injections; PRN regimens reduce injections but risk undertreatment and worse long-term vision. I initially thought PRN and treat-and-extend were broadly equivalent in outcomes, but wait, I should double-check — Cochrane suggests monthly regimens are probably slightly more effective than PRN, and treat-and-extend outcomes approximate monthly in some studies, reinforcing the need to individualize and monitor closely [^111N4ZbN] [^1174vPBc] [^113ayDwM].

> I should confirm systemic safety considerations, especially for intravitreal therapy. Large meta-analyses and AAO guidance indicate no clear increase in major cardiovascular events with intravitreal anti-VEGF overall, though signals for increased nonocular hemorrhages in AMD cohorts and rare arterial thromboembolic events exist; detectable systemic exposure has been demonstrated, but clinical significance appears low in aggregate. For patients with CKD or diabetic kidney disease, emerging data suggest intravitreal anti-VEGF may reduce circulating VEGF and, in some cases, precipitate renal decline, so clinicians should coordinate with nephrology and monitor renal function in at-risk patients [^111yjVxW] [^115XaT9o] [^115nHYeQ] [^1112LiQt].

> But wait, what about oncology patients receiving systemic anti-VEGF. I need to ensure we capture the higher-risk systemic profile: hypertension is very common and often requires aggressive management, proteinuria and thrombotic microangiopathy can occur, and wound-healing complications are clinically relevant; thus, pretreatment risk assessment, BP control, urinalysis, and surgical planning are essential. There remains no single best antihypertensive class for VEGF inhibitor–induced hypertension, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs may not fully reverse the pathophysiology, so cardio-oncology input is prudent [^115XaT9o] [^116nmrwJ] [^1135evva].

> I will now examine ocular safety. Endophthalmitis is rare but serious, with estimated risks around 0.1% per injection in RCTs, lower with PRN or extended regimens than with monthly dosing. Noninfectious inflammation, retinal tears or detachment, and IOP elevation can occur, and RPE tears may happen with active lesions but are not a contraindication to continued therapy. These risks underscore aseptic technique, dilated fundus examination, and patient counseling on red flags [^111N4ZbN] [^112ygJAq] [^113oLPnw].

> Let me think about special populations and practical constraints. In pregnancy and lactation, safety data are lacking; anti-VEGF is generally avoided unless maternal benefit clearly outweighs potential fetal risk. In infants with ROP, bevacizumab and ranibizumab reduce recurrence in zone I disease but may increase recurrence in zone II, and long-term neurodevelopmental effects remain uncertain, so decisions should weigh anatomy, logistics, and follow-up capacity. In elderly patients with cardiovascular comorbidity, I should confirm that intravitreal therapy remains acceptable with standard precautions, while systemic anti-VEGF warrants closer BP and renal monitoring [^113oLPnw] [^113E8i6b] [^111zqmau].

> Next, I should review resistance and response variability. Intrinsic and acquired resistance to anti-VEGF therapy is common in oncology, with tumor vasculature heterogeneity and compensatory pathways contributing. In ophthalmology, tachyphylaxis and incomplete morphologic response occur, prompting strategies such as switching agents, shortening intervals, or adding combination therapy in select cases. Predictive biomarkers remain elusive, so clinical judgment and imaging guide adjustments [^115YA3xB] [^114xpv9U] [^113n6KqW].

> I need to check cost and access, as these drive real-world outcomes. Bevacizumab is 20–40 times less expensive than ranibizumab or aflibercept yet achieves comparable visual outcomes in many settings, but payer restrictions, compounding concerns, and perceived medicolegal risk can limit its use; biosimilars offer potential cost relief, though ophthalmic biosimilars require robust evidence before routine substitution, and the Academy advises against step-therapy mandates lacking ophthalmic-specific data [^115Q8bM1] [^113uMcCq] [^114NdaQ6].

> Hold on, I should verify emerging developments. Faricimab's dual VEGF/Ang-2 inhibition extends treatment intervals to 12–16 weeks in phase 3 programs with comparable visual outcomes, and real-world data are accumulating on switching strategies. High-dose aflibercept (EYLEA HD) is now available for nAMD and DME, aiming to extend durability. In oncology, newer TKIs like fruquintinib are approved in refractory mCRC after prior anti-VEGF exposure, reflecting ongoing evolution of the class [^111SWPEw] [^117XNgK4] [^112X7Uwh].

> Finally, I should synthesize practical recommendations. For nAMD, DME, and RVO, initiate anti-VEGF promptly and tailor regimen to disease activity and patient preference, favoring treat-and-extend when feasible to balance efficacy and burden. Monitor for ocular complications and counsel on warning signs. In CKD or high cardiovascular risk, coordinate systemic care and consider renal monitoring. For oncology, select anti-VEGF when guideline-supported, anticipate and proactively manage hypertension and proteinuria, and plan surgeries around washout periods to mitigate wound-healing risk. Across settings, engage in shared decision-making to align treatment intensity, agent choice, and monitoring with patient goals and comorbidities [^112Wu4jU] [^116zYR7f] [^116dwLpE].

Anti-VEGF agents are a cornerstone of modern therapy for neovascular retinal diseases and certain cancers, with **strong evidence for preserving vision** in AMD, DME, and RVO [^115qNaDj] [^115fjUvE] [^114vRpYi] and improving progression-free survival in oncology [^113CZ7Ni]. They are generally safe, but clinicians must monitor for rare systemic events [^111yjVxW] and ocular complications [^112Wu4jU]; in patients with CKD, **use caution** due to potential renal effects [^1112LiQt]. Emerging agents like faricimab offer extended durability [^111SWPEw], and biosimilars may improve access and reduce costs [^114XVK3E].

---

## Mechanism of action

Anti-VEGF agents **block VEGF signaling**, reducing angiogenesis and vascular permeability [^11226MJ4]. They include monoclonal antibodies (ranibizumab, bevacizumab, brolucizumab), fusion proteins (aflibercept), and bispecific antibodies (faricimab) [^113BsKdY] [^111SWPEw].

### Oncology

In oncology, **metastatic colorectal cancer** is treated with bevacizumab in combination regimens [^113UrYwQ] [^117PiRoZ]. Non-small cell lung cancer also uses bevacizumab in selected patients [^113UrYwQ]. Renal cell carcinoma is managed with bevacizumab or TKIs (sunitinib, pazopanib) [^113BzpZ4] [^115YA3xB]. Glioblastoma treatment includes bevacizumab for recurrent disease [^113UrYwQ] [^112r2Hkh]. Ovarian and cervical cancers also have bevacizumab-containing regimens [^113UrYwQ].

### Emerging roles for antiangiogenesis factors in management of ocular disease [^1135spQF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

The first antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) was developed as an anticancer drug for colonic carcinomas. Since then, anti-VEGFs have developed in scope and indications. They have revolutionized the treatment of exudative macular degeneration and have had a major impact on treatment of several other conditions. This has resulted in an increased number of patients seeking treatment with new treatment options and has had a considerable financial impact on health care resources. Anti-VEGFs have been used in the treatment of all age groups of the population ranging from infants where it is used for treatment of retinopathy of prematurity to the elderly where it is used in exudative macular eegeneration.

### Hypertension and antiangiogenesis: the Janus face of VEGF inhibitors [^1135evva]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Several other important points are highlighted by the 2 studies in this issue of JACC: CardioOncology. Patients receiving VEGFIs for cancer therapy have substantial baseline cardiovascular comorbidity. Exacerbation of hypertension occurs in the majority, and there is now further real-world evidence to reinforce this point and, in particular, to intensify BP surveillance during the first 4 to 6 weeks of VEGFI therapy. This may be even more pertinent with more selective agents such as axitinib. However, even after the identification and initial treatment of the VEGFI-associated BP rise, current strategies are not good enough to return BP to baseline during VEGFI treatment. Although both studies raise questions about the most efficacious drug to prevent or treat VEGFI-associated hypertension we still do not have a robust answer, and in particular, the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in these patients is unclear. Optimal antihypertensive therapy has not yet been defined, and accordingly, the selection of classes of antihypertensive drugs should be based on particular comorbidities and cancer types in individual patients.

Furthermore, BP targets from the population as a whole are extrapolated to the VEGFI-treated cancer population. Whether this is appropriate or not is unclear, especially since the cancer population may be more susceptible to end-organ effects because of the sudden nature of the BP rise coupled with the direct toxic effects of VEGFIs on the vasculature, myocardium, and kidneys. On the other hand, evidence-based BP thresholds at which VEGFI dose reduction or interruption should occur are still required. These are needed to ensure that this is only done when there is a genuine risk of cardiovascular morbidity becoming more prescient than the index cancer. In addition to defining the optimum agent for the prevention and treatment of the VEGFI-associated BP rise, it is of particular importance to identify those drugs that might provide added value over and above the reduction of BP per se in order to provide additional cardioprotective and renoprotective effects. It is as important to identify antihypertensive drugs that are not effective and that should probably be avoided.

### Ten years of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy [^113Js18w]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2016). Medium credibility.

The targeting of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), a crucial regulator of both normal and pathological angiogenesis, has revealed innovative therapeutic approaches in oncology and ophthalmology. The first VEGFA inhibitor, bevacizumab, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004 for the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, and the first VEGFA inhibitors in ophthalmology, pegaptanib and ranibizumab, were approved in 2004 and 2006, respectively. To mark this tenth anniversary of anti-VEGFA therapy, we discuss the discovery of VEGFA, the successes and challenges in the development of VEGFA inhibitors and the impact of these agents on the treatment of cancers and ophthalmic diseases.

### Hypertension and antiangiogenesis: the Janus face of VEGF inhibitors [^111ova7D]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Unless adequately powered randomized controlled trials to assess effects of different antihypertensive drugs in the prevention or treatment of VEGFI-associated hypertension are conducted, clinical treatment will remain suboptimal, and management will rely on expert opinion rather than evidence. Trials should have clinically relevant endpoints that address the control of BP and its target organ effects (left ventricular systolic dysfunction and renal dysfunction) versus cancer outcomes, including VEGFI dose reduction and treatment interruption. The field, although advancing, is still in its infancy regarding the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of VEGFI-induced hypertension and evidence-based best clinical practice. Clinical decisions and research questions that rely so heavily on understanding the balance between cardiovascular risk and optimum cancer care will only be adequately tackled by continued and increasing cardiovascular-oncology collaboration.

### Anti-VEGF / VEGFR therapy for cancer: reassessing the target [^111h2BLm]. Cancer Research (2012). Low credibility.

Judah Folkman recognized that new blood vessel formation is important for tumor growth and proposed antiangiogenesis as a novel approach to cancer therapy. Discovery of vascular permeability factor VEGF-A as the primary tumor angiogenesis factor prompted the development of a number of drugs that targeted it or its receptors. These agents have often been successful in halting tumor angiogenesis and in regressing rapidly growing mouse tumors. However, results in human cancer have been less impressive. A number of reasons have been offered for the lack of greater success, and, here, we call attention to the heterogeneity of the tumor vasculature as an important issue. Human and mouse tumors are supplied by at least 6 well-defined blood vessel types that arise by both angiogenesis and arterio-venogenesis. All 6 types can be generated in mouse tissues by an adenoviral vector expressing VEGF-A(164). Once formed, 4 of the 6 types lose their VEGF-A dependency, and so their responsiveness to anti-VEGF/VEGF receptor therapy. If therapies directed against the vasculature are to have a greater impact on human cancer, targets other than VEGF and its receptors will need to be identified on these resistant tumor vessels.

### Safety and efficacy of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies for neovascular age-related macular degeneration: a report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology [^115CkXKT]. Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To review the evidence on the safety and efficacy of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Methods

A literature search of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases was last conducted in February 2017; there were no date restrictions, and the search was limited to studies published in English. The combined searches yielded 191 citations, 28 of which were selected because they were clinical trials and were deemed clinically relevant for the Ophthalmic Technology Assessment Committee Retina/Vitreous Panel to review in full. The panel methodologist then assigned a level of evidence rating to each study.

Results

Sixteen of the 28 citations provided level I evidence supporting the use of anti-VEGF agents for neovascular AMD, including intravitreal ranibizumab, aflibercept, and bevacizumab. Eight studies reviewed provided level II evidence, and 4 studies provided level III evidence, but only the level I studies are included in this assessment. There are long-term follow-up data on the efficacy of ranibizumab and bevacizumab (≥ 5 years), but these data are subject to the bias of incomplete follow-up.

Conclusions

Review of the literature indicates that intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF therapy is safe and effective for neovascular AMD over 2 years, the period for which data are available. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term safety and comparative efficacy of these agents.

### Anti-angiogenic therapy for high-grade glioma [^112r2Hkh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in September 2014. The most common primary brain tumours in adults are gliomas. Gliomas span a spectrum from low to high grade and are graded pathologically on a scale of one to four according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. High-grade glioma (HGG) carries a poor prognosis. Grade IV glioma is known as glioblastoma and carries a median survival in treated patients of about 15 months. Glioblastomas are rich in blood vessels (i.e. highly vascular) and also rich in a protein known as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that promotes new blood vessel formation (the process of angiogenesis). Anti-angiogenic agents inhibit the process of new blood vessel formation and promote regression of existing vessels. Several anti-angiogenic agents have been investigated in clinical trials, both in newly diagnosed and recurrent HGG, showing preliminary promising results. This review was undertaken to report on the benefits and harms associated with the use of anti-angiogenic agents in the treatment of HGGs.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of anti-angiogenic therapy in people with high-grade glioma (HGG). The intervention can be used in two broad groups: at first diagnosis as part of 'adjuvant' therapy, or in the setting of recurrent disease.

Search Methods

We conducted updated searches to identify published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE and Embase to October 2018. We handsearched proceedings of relevant oncology conferences up to 2018. We also searched trial registries for ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs evaluating the use of anti-angiogenic therapy to treat HGG versus the same therapy without anti-angiogenic therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors screened the search results and reviewed the abstracts of potentially relevant articles before retrieving the full text of eligible articles.

Main Results

After a comprehensive literature search, we identified 11 eligible RCTs (3743 participants), of which 7 were included in the original review (2987 participants). There was significant design heterogeneity in the included studies, especially in the response assessment criteria used. All eligible studies were restricted to glioblastomas and there were no eligible studies evaluating other HGGs. Ten studies were available as fully published peer-reviewed manuscripts, and one study was available in abstract form. The overall risk of bias in included studies was low. This risk was based upon low rates of selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias. The 11 studies included in this review did not show an improvement in overall survival with the addition of anti-angiogenic therapy (pooled hazard ratio (HR) of 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.02; P = 0.16; 11 studies, 3743 participants; high-certainty evidence). However, pooled analysis from 10 studies (3595 participants) showed improvement in progression-free survival with the addition of anti-angiogenic therapy (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.79; P < 0.00001; high-certainty evidence). We carried out additional analyses of overall survival and progression-free survival according to treatment setting and for anti-angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone. Pooled analysis of overall survival in either the adjuvant or recurrent setting did not show an improvement (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02; P = 0.12; 8 studies, 2833 participants; high-certainty evidence and HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; P = 0.90; 3 studies, 910 participants; moderate-certainty evidence, respectively). Pooled analysis of overall survival for anti-angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy also did not clearly show an improvement (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00; P = 0.05; 11 studies, 3506 participants; low-certainty evidence). The progression-free survival in the subgroups all showed findings that demonstrated improvements in progression-free survival with the addition of anti-angiogenic therapy. Pooled analysis of progression-free survival in both the adjuvant and recurrent setting showed an improvement (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.82; P < 0.00001; 8 studies, 2833 participants; high-certainty evidence and HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.76; P < 0.00001; 2 studies, 762 participants; moderate-certainty evidence, respectively). Pooled analysis of progression-free survival for anti-angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone showed an improvement (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.77; P < 0.00001; 10 studies, 3464 participants). Similar to trials of anti-angiogenic therapies in other solid tumours, adverse events related to this class of therapy included hypertension and proteinuria, poor wound healing, and the potential for thromboembolic events, although generally, the rate of grade 3 and 4 adverse events was low (< 14.1%) and in keeping with the literature. The impact of anti-angiogenic therapy on quality of life varied between studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of anti-angiogenic therapy does not significantly improve overall survival in newly diagnosed people with glioblastoma. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of anti-angiogenic therapy for people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma at this time. Overall there is a lack of evidence of a survival advantage for anti-angiogenic therapy over chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma. When considering the combination anti-angiogenic therapy with chemotherapy compared with the same chemotherapy alone, there may possibly be a small improvement in overall survival. While there is strong evidence that bevacizumab (an anti-angiogenic drug) prolongs progression-free survival in newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, the impact of this on quality of life and net clinical benefit for patients remains unclear. Not addressed here is whether subsets of people with glioblastoma may benefit from anti-angiogenic therapies, nor their utility in other HGG histologies.

### Switching to faricimab from the current anti-VEGF therapy: evidence-based expert recommendations [^111SWPEw]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

The approval of faricimab, an inhibitor of both VEGF and Ang-2, represents the first bispecific intravitreal agent for the management of patients with nAMD or DME. Data from Phase 3 trialsand real-world studies have demonstrated its safety, visual and anatomic benefits and durability. Beyond faricimab's demonstrated benefit as a first-line treatment, its administration as a longer-lasting therapy and use in patients whose disease is refractory to other agents remain to be elucidated.

### Evaluation of intraocular pressure elevation after multiple injections of intravitreal ranibizumab [^111YCLt5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

With the introduction of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibodies in ophthalmologic therapies, there was a fundamental change in treatment options for various ocular diseases. The indications for anti-VEGF therapy include neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central vein or branch vein occlusion with macular edema, and diabetic maculopathy.–For all indications, an effective therapy with anti-VEGF antibodies can only be achieved by repeated intravitreal anti-VEGF injections.

In general practice, three intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF antibodies are given every 4 weeks in the initial upload phase, followed by further intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF antibodies when a macular edema persists or increases. Therefore, a monthly ophthalmologic checkup is needed to ensure a correct treatment interval with anti-VEGF antibodies. Another requirement to allow for frequent anti-VEGF therapy is a low rate of side effects. Until now, various efficacy and safety studies have demonstrated very low rates of side effects after intravitreal anti-VEGF injections.–Potential side effects of anti-VEGF therapy include retinal tears, retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, uveitis, or endophthalmitis.

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^111zqmau]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Systemic safety of anti-VEGF therapy indicates that anti-VEGF treatments may carry theoretical risks for systemic arterial thromboembolic events and increased intraocular pressure, but a 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis found that intravitreal anti-VEGF agent use did not increase major cardiovascular events (I++, Moderate quality); among patients with diabetes, a Veteran Health Affairs database analysis did not find a higher risk of systemic adverse events; and a 2023 Cochrane systematic review reported no increased mortality risk though a clinically relevant increase could not be ruled out (I+, Good quality). Another systematic review concluded that anti-VEGF treatment intensity had no significant influence on mortality; however, there was marginal evidence of higher mortality risk in the subgroup with DME with incidence rate ratio 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02–1.33, P = 0.03 (I++, Moderate quality). An additional meta-analysis suggested there may be a modest increased risk of death and cerebrovascular events in patients receiving monthly therapy for 2 years, and a 2021 review found no increase in major cardiovascular events but increased mortality in patients with DR.

### Anti-VEGF drugs as the 2009 first-line therapy for choroidal neovascularization in pathologic myopia [^116zYv2c]. Retina (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pathologic myopia is the second cause of choroidal neovascularization, after age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and the first cause in patients younger than 50 years. The current treatment of subfoveal myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) is verteporfin photodynamic therapy, but its long-term effectiveness has been disappointing. Antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs are now widely used not only to treat choroidal neovascularization in AMD but also for choroidal neovascularization in other conditions. This review summarizes the data supplied by published case series studies about anti-VEGF therapy in mCNV.

Methods

Analysis of the current literature allowed discussion of the optimal parameters for mCNV treatment by anti-VEGF, including the choice of anti-VEGF drug, its dose, the treatment protocol, and indications for retreatment.

Results

To date, the results of intravitreal bevacizumab or ranibizumab for mCNV have been reported in at least 14 studies, but they were all pilot, monocentric, and noncomparative case series. Nevertheless, they provided useful information on > 250 patients and showed similar results, with significant improvement of visual acuity and an excellent safety profile.

Conclusion

Shifting from one treatment to another is always difficult in the absence of prospective and controlled comparative studies. However, in 2009, intravitreal ranibizumab or bevacizumab may be considered as first-line therapy for sub- and juxtafoveal mCNV for three reasons: the safety of anti-VEGF drugs and intravitreal injection procedures; the disappointing long-term results of other therapies, including verteporfin treatment; and the excellent convergent results of anti-VEGF therapy in all pilot studies.

### Quantifying conflict of interest in the choice of anti-VEGF agents [^114NdaQ6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

The number of intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents for neovascular macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusions has grown rapidly in the past 20 years from 0.25 million in 2005 to 5.9 million in 2016 with continued growth to the present. In 2019, the market value of anti-VEGF drugs in United States was $6.4 billion. Given the volume and economic value of this activity, the factors that influence physician choice of drug are worth examining from a public health perspective.

Many factors influence the decision of which anti-VEGF drug to use including efficacy, safety, FDA approval status, legal risk; acquisition, inventory, and storage cost and risk; and economic reward. Although there continues to be a debate about the relative efficacy of anti-VEGF drugs, for the most part, they have been shown in multiple studies to be equally effective and safe in the treatment of neovascular macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and retinal vein occlusions. However, bevacizumab is not FDA-approved for intraocular use, whereas aflibercept and ranibizumab are. Ophthalmic bevacizumab is repackaged by compounding pharmacies from larger vials meant for oncologic use, and published examples of contamination during this step may influence choice.

A potential conflict of interest (COI) is inherent in the ophthalmologist's choice of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents for the treatment of retinal vascular disease. The three drugs commonly used–aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab–vary widely in cost and reimbursement by payers, such that the choice of which drug to use has financial consequences for physicians. These consequences could influence drug choice.

The purpose of this paper is to quantify the economic COI that may influence ophthalmologists' choice of anti-VEGF agent.

### Current and upcoming anti-VEGF therapies and dosing strategies for the treatment of neovascular AMD: a comparative review [^1163xYqj]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed world, with the expected number of affected elderly individuals reaching 17.8million. Antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injection therapy has been instrumental in treating a disease process that was previously thought to be untreatable. Over the past two decades, landmark studies have demonstrated the efficacy of different anti-VEGF medications and investigated the optimal dosing regimen and delivery mechanism to increase overall vision and minimise patient burden. In this review, we outline landmark neovascular age-related macular degeneration clinical trials that have demonstrated level 1 evidence for its usage or have contributed to the understanding of how to dose these agents.

### Mechanisms of adverse effects of anti-VEGF therapy for cancer [^1138h63m]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Proliferation of new blood vessels is necessary for tumours to grow and contributes to the spread of blood-borne metastases. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) not only drives angiogenesis, but also serves as a survival factor for endothelial cells and promotes the abnormal phenotype of blood vessels in tumours. Unlike tumour vessels that have VEGF as survival factor, the normal adult vasculature is regarded as largely independent of VEGF for survival, stability, and normal function. Indeed, the rationale for using VEGF inhibitors on tumours is based on the assumption that tumour vessels can be impacted without harming other vessels. Consistent with this assumption, clinical studies have demonstrated that VEGF inhibitors have robust actions on certain types of tumours with infrequent serious side events.

This review examines current views of the basis of adverse events associated with VEGF inhibitors in the treatment of cancer. Many agents that inhibit VEGF signalling are under development, in clinical trials, or approved for use in cancer. Rapidly expanding use of these agents in the clinic reflects their efficacy. Increased use is also advancing the understanding of their actions in tumours and increasing familiarity with the adverse effects associated with their use. Adverse events in cancer therapy include any unfavourable symptom, sign, laboratory finding, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment that may or may not be related to the treatment (Common Toxicity Criteria Manual (NCI-CTC), Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute, U.S. National Institutes of Health. Adverse events are graded as absent (Grade 0), mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe and undesirable (Grade 3), life-threatening or disabling (Grade 4), or fatal (Grade 5)). Tumour progression or signs and symptoms directly related to the tumour are not considered as adverse events in this context.

### VEGF inhibition, hypertension, and renal toxicity [^116nmrwJ]. Current Oncology Reports (2012). Low credibility.

The use of anti-angiogenic agents as part of the therapeutic armamentarium for advanced stage solid tumors has become the standard of care in several instances, particularly for renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. These agents primarily target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and/or its receptors, and include bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF, as well as tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including VEGF receptors. These therapies, as a general class of anti-angiogenic medications, have been shown to have common adverse vascular effects attributable directly or indirectly to their anti-VEGF effects, including hypertension, renal vascular injury, often manifested by proteinuria and thrombotic microangiopathy, and congestive heart failure. Knowledge of these common side effects and their underlying mechanisms may allow for more accurate and prompt diagnoses, timely clinical interventions, and the development of rational and standard treatments. These measures may minimize patient morbidity and mortality, not only by the treatment of side effects, but also by minimizing the disruption of treatment of the underlying malignancy, as well as improving patient quality of life.

### Importance of treatment duration: unmasking barriers and discovering the reasons for undertreatment of anti-VEGF agents in neovascular age-related macular degeneration [^113SQru4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Intravitreal therapy cannot work if you do not receive them and appear at follow-up visits. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), only 50% of patients with chronic diseases adhere to treatment recommendations in developed countries. Historically, the research in ophthalmology was mainly based on NA to glaucoma medication. The invasive character of anti-VEGF treatment and necessity for frequent visits are also related to NA and subsequently worse visual outcomes. Recently, a group of experts succeeded in formulating meaningful proposals for a definition of NA. However, the extent of adherence to intravitreal therapy and their relevant key drivers are still not fully understood or at least inadequately captured within prospective studies. Anti-VEGF treatment should be "respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions".

### Factors involved in anti-VEGF treatment decisions for neovascular age-related macular degeneration: insights from real-world clinical practice [^1111gEah]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding the factors affecting physician choice of anti-VEGF agent may identify specific barriers to treatment and the potential effect on treatment outcomes for patients with nAMD. Although previous real-world studies have reported treatment strategies and drug choice in clinical practice, little is known about the rationale of physicians prescribing these medications. The goals of this analysis are to describe: i) the preferred treatment strategies of physicians and those used in practice, ii) the factors and restrictions that affect physician prescription of anti-VEGF agents for treating nAMD, and iii) the reasons physicians have for switching between anti-VEGF agents in clinical practice.

### Does laser still have a role in the management of retinal vascular and neovascular diseases? [^111c71fg]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To discuss the current role of laser therapies in the management of retinal vascular and neovascular diseases.

Design

Perspective.

Methods

Laser's role in the management of diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and venous occlusive disease is discussed, with emphasis on comparing laser with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy and discussion of situations where these treatment methods can be complementary.

Results

Thermal panretinal photocoagulation remains the usual practice for treatment of neovascularization in proliferative diabetic retinopathy and after venous occlusive events. Focal/grid laser still has a role for patients with macular edema resulting from diabetes or venous occlusion that is poorly responsive to anti-VEGF agents and in patients who are unable or unwilling to return for frequent injections. Focal/grid laser also is used as combination therapy with anti-VEGF agents for these indications. Focal laser can be used for extrafoveal choroidal neovascularization to avoid the treatment burden and risks of multiple injections. Photodynamic therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of central serous chorioretinopathy and idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and as combination therapy with anti-VEGF agents in age-related macular degeneration.

Conclusions

Anti-VEGF agents are effective in preventing vision loss and improving vision in multiple diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, and retinal vein occlusions. Despite a substantial decrease in its use for these conditions in recent years, laser therapies continue to serve important roles in our ability to combat retinal pathologic features and will remain a pivotal component of our practices for at least the next several years.

### The place of VEGF inhibition in the current management of renal cell carcinoma [^113BzpZ4]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Mature phase III data from the lead compounds is awaited. However, the available phase II and phase III data shows significant activity in both progression-free survival and clinical benefit (CR+PR+SD). Early indications are that there will be a significant effect upon overall survival. Given that this is a disease with few active treatment options for the majority of patients, there is now a significant body of data demonstrating that this class of agents has useful clinical activity.

We therefore believe that all metastatic clear cell RCC patients should at some point during their treatment have the opportunity to be exposed to a VEGF inhibitor. Patients who are of reasonable performance status and who do not have any specific contraindications for anti-VEGF treatment should therefore be referred to a centre that has access to an appropriate agent within the context of a clinical trial. Pharmaceutical companies should be encouraged to expand their planned extended-use programmes to enable patients to access these active drugs pre-licensing. Commissioners should be made aware of the fact that once licensed, these drugs should be made available for a patient population which up until now has had no adequate therapeutic options.

### Biomarkers of angiogenesis and their role in the development of VEGF inhibitors [^113CZ7Ni]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Various strategies for inhibiting VEGF have been investigated over the last decade. These include neutralising antibodies to VEGF, low-molecular-weight VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKis) and soluble VEGFR constructs (VEGF-Trap) (Table 1).

Angiogenesis and VEGF have been confirmed as targets of anti-cancer therapeutics in multiple disease settings. Randomised clinical trials in the first- and second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, renal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma have demonstrated an improvement in response, progression-free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) when conventional therapy was supplemented by VEGF inhibitors.

The demonstration of a survival advantage conferred by VEGF inhibitors is of great importance. However, the initial promise of anti-angiogenic agents, namely the reduced prevalence of drug resistance and durable stabilisation of disease, has not been realised. Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors also have a range of host toxicities. They are expensive and optimal development of combination anti-vascular regimens requires the identification of those patients most likely to benefit from treatment with this class of drugs. Despite attempts, this goal has eluded us. In this study, we review the use of candidate predictive and/or pharmacodynamic biomarkers pertinent to VEGF inhibition and highlight approaches that are yet to be investigated.

### Safety implications of vascular endothelial growth factor blockade for subjects receiving intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies [^112Mejrz]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate potential safety risks associated with nonspecific inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

Design

A perspective, reviewing the current literature.

Methods

Herein, we discuss the systemic safety of VEGF-targeted therapies, address safety issues for VEGF-targeted therapies in neovascular age-related macular degeneration, and propose the consideration of methods for identifying low rate systemic safety signals from patients treated with these agents.

Results

Several prospective, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies generally are well tolerated. However, within these trials, there is some circumstantial evidence that links systemic VEGF inhibition to systemic adverse events, particularly systemic thromboembolic events. Because all of the intravitreal anti-VEGF agents have been associated with detectable levels in the systemic circulation, there is a scientific rationale for the occurrence of potential systemic adverse events. However, if safety issues are present, they occur at very low rates and may go undetected in controlled clinical trials of premarketed drugs.

Conclusions

We propose that highly sensitive methodologies be put into place for identifying low rate safety signals, including postmarketing clinical trials, chart reviews, electronic medical records, and various national and international registries and databases, to evaluate the systemic safety of antiangiogenic agents in ocular diseases such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

### Diabetic macular edema: pathophysiology and novel therapeutic targets [^116PnHZg]. Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the major cause of vision loss in diabetic persons. Alteration of the blood-retinal barrier is the hallmark of this disease, characterized by pericyte loss and endothelial cell-cell junction breakdown. Recent animal and clinical studies strongly indicate that DME is an inflammatory disease. Multiple cytokines and chemokines are involved in the pathogenesis of DME, with multiple cellular involvement affecting the neurovascular unit. With the introduction of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents, the treatment of DME has been revolutionized, and the indication for laser therapy has been limited. However, the response to anti-VEGF drugs in DME is not as robust as in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and many patients with DME do not show complete resolution of fluid despite multiple intravitreal injections. Potential novel therapies targeting molecules other than VEGF and using new drug-delivery systems currently are being developed and evaluated in clinical trials.

ASCO mCRC targeted therapy, anti–EGFR use — Anti–epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy plus doublet chemotherapy should be offered as first-line therapy to patients with MSS or pMMR left-sided RAS wild-type mCRC (Type: Evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Strong). Anti-EGFR therapy is not recommended as first-line therapy for patients with right-sided RAS wild-type mCRC, and consistent with the qualifying statements to Recommendation 1.1 and 1.2, these patients should be offered chemotherapy and anti-VEGF therapy. Anti-EGFR therapy is not recommended for patients with RAS-mutant mCRC, and anti-EGFR therapy with triplet chemotherapy is not recommended. Although anti-EGFR therapy is preferred, anti-VEGF therapy remains an active treatment option for patients with left-sided treatment-naive RAS wild-type mCRC in the first-line setting. Shared decision making is recommended, including a discussion of potential for benefit and risk of harms, such as the increased risk of treatment-related rash with anti-EGFR agents.

### Patient preferences associated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies for neovascular age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema [^115Q8bM1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) are leading causes of blindness among working-age and elderly populations, respectively. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is considered the standard of care for nAMD and DME, with four agents commonly used in current clinical practice: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved ranibizumab and aflibercept for nAMD and DME; FDA-approved brolucizumab for nAMD; and off-label bevacizumab for both conditions.–Landmark trials suggest that these agents have comparable safety and efficacy in their respective indications;–therefore, treatment preferences among physicians and patients may instead be driven by other factors, such as differences in cost and labeled injection frequency. For example, monthly injections of ranibizumab 0.5 mg and 0.3 mg are FDA-approved for the treatment of nAMD and DME, respectively, whereas aflibercept 2.0 mg is indicated every 8 weeks after three to five monthly loading doses, and brolucizumab 6.0 mg is recommended every 8–12 weeks after three monthly loading doses in patients with nAMD. Moreover, wholesale acquisition costs for these on-label therapies currently range between $1170–$1950 per dose, while the cost of repackaged bevacizumab 1.25 mg has been estimated at $50–$60.–

As treatment decisions become more complex and the delivery of patient-centered care becomes increasingly important, physicians are often encouraged to involve patients in decisions regarding their health. This paradigm shift towards shared decision-making has been driven by evidence that treatment adherence, patient satisfaction, and clinical outcomes are improved when patient preferences are taken into consideration.–Patient preferences in health care are often evaluated using conjoint analysis, a survey-based technique used to quantify the value placed on characteristics (or "attributes") related to a health product or service. Through a series of trade-off exercises, patient preferences are used to generate utility values that demonstrate the relative importance of each attribute in treatment decisions. Conjoint analyses have been used to elicit patient preferences for the management of several ophthalmic conditions, including glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and nAMD.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor biosimilars for neovascular age-related macular degeneration [^114XVK3E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive eye disease characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and is a leading cause of vision loss and disability worldwide. Although intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy is an effective treatment option that helps to prevent vision loss or to improve visual acuity in people with neovascular AMD, treatment imposes a significant financial burden on patients and healthcare systems. A biosimilar is a biological product that has been developed to be nearly identical to a previously approved biological product. The use of biosimilars may help reduce costs and so may increase patient access to effective biologic medicines with similar levels of safety to the drugs on which they are based.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of anti-VEGF biosimilar agents compared with their corresponding anti-VEGF agents (i.e. the reference products) that have obtained regulatory approval for intravitreal injections in people with neovascular AMD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registries together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was 2 June 2023.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared approved anti-VEGF biosimilars with their reference products for treating the eyes of adult participants (≥ 50 years) who had an active primary or recurrent choroidal neovascularization lesion secondary to neovascular AMD.

Outcomes

Our outcomes were: best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central subfield thickness (CST), vision-related quality of life, serious ocular and non-ocular adverse events (AE), treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), and serum concentrations of biosimilars and reference drugs.

Risk Of Bias

We assessed the risk of bias (RoB) for seven outcomes reported in a summary of findings table by using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We synthesized results for each outcome using meta-analysis, where possible, by calculating risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and continuous outcomes, respectively. Where this was not possible due to the nature of the data, we summarized the results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for prespecified outcomes.

Included Studies

We included nine parallel-group multi-center RCTs that enrolled a total of 3814 participants (3814 participating eyes), with sample sizes that ranged from 160 to 705 participants per study. The mean age of the participants in these studies ranged from 67 to 76 years, and the proportion of women ranged from 26.5% to 58.7%. Ranibizumab (Lucentis) was the reference product in seven studies, and aflibercept (Eyelea) was the reference product in two others. All the included studies had been supported by industry. The follow-up periods ranged from 12 to 52 weeks (median 48 weeks). Five studies (56%) were conducted in multi-country settings across Europe, North America and Asia, two studies in India, and one each in Japan and the Republic of Korea. We judged all the included studies to have met high methodological standards.

Synthesis Of Results

With regard to efficacy, our meta-analyses demonstrated that anti-VEGF biosimilars for neovascular AMD resulted in little to no difference compared with the reference products for BCVA change at 8 to 12 weeks (MD -0.55 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters, 95% CI -1.17 to 0.07; 8 studies, 3603 participants; high-certainty evidence) and the proportion of participants who lost fewer than 15 letters in BCVA at 24 to 48 weeks (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01; 7 studies, 2658 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Almost all participants (96.6% in the biosimilar group and 97.0% in the reference product group) lost fewer than 15 letters in BCVA. The evidence from two studies suggested that there was no evidence of difference between biosimilars and reference products in vision-related quality of life measured by the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) summary scores at 24 to 48 weeks (MD 0.82, 95% CI -0.70 to 2.35; 2 studies, 894 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). With regard to the safety profile, meta-analyses also revealed little to no difference between anti-VEGF biosimilars and the reference products for the proportion of participants who experienced serious ocular AEs (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.26; 7 studies, 3292 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and for TEAEs leading to investigational product discontinuation or death (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.46; 8 studies, 3497 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Overall, 1.4% of participants in the biosimilar group and 1.2% in the reference product group experienced serious ocular adverse events. The most frequently documented serious ocular AEs were retinal hemorrhage and endophthalmitis. Although the evidence is of low certainty due to imprecision, meta-analysis suggested that anti-VEGF biosimilars led to no difference compared with the reference products for cumulative incidence of ADAs (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.22; 8 studies, 3066 participants; low-certainty evidence) or mean maximum serum concentrations (MD 0.42 ng/mL, 95% CI -0.22 to 1.05; subgroup of 3 studies, 100 participants; low-certainty evidence). We judged the overall risk of bias to be low for all studies.

Authors' Conclusions

In our review, low to high certainty evidence suggests that there is little to no difference, to date, between the anti-VEGF biosimilars approved for treating neovascular AMD and their reference products in terms of benefits and harms. While anti-VEGF biosimilars may be a viable alternative to reference products, current evidence for their use is based on a limited number of studies - particularly for comparison with aflibercept - with sparse long-term safety data, and infrequent assessment of quality of life outcomes. Our effect estimates and conclusions may be modified once findings have been reported from studies that are currently ongoing, and studies of biosimilar agents that are currently in development.

### Clinical utilization of anti-vascular endothelial growth-factor agents and patient monitoring in retinal vein occlusion and diabetic macular edema [^113AbrGu]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This large retrospective claims analysis provides the first comprehensive look at the utilization of anti-VEGF therapies in BRVO, CRVO, and DME in US clinical practice during the period leading up to publication of findings from major clinical trials of anti-VEGF agents in these indications. Our results show that the number of patients receiving bevacizumab for these conditions steadily increased. However, patients in clinical practice were monitored less frequently and received far fewer injections compared with patients in major clinical trials. Further research is necessary to confirm these findings in larger ranibizumab samples, to determine factors that may contribute to the observed low injection frequency, and to evaluate the visual outcomes associated with these reduced utilization patterns.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs for treatment of retinopathy of prematurity [^113E8i6b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in angiogenesis in foetal life. Researchers have recently attempted to use anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a vasoproliferative disorder. The safety and efficacy of these agents in preterm infants with ROP is currently uncertain.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-VEGF drugs when used either as monotherapy, that is without concomitant cryotherapy or laser therapy, or in combination with planned cryo/laser therapy in preterm infants with type 1 ROP (defined as zone I any stage with plus disease, zone I stage 3 with or without plus disease, or zone II stage 2 or 3 with plus disease).

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1966 to 11 December 2016), Embase (1980 to 11 December 2016), CINAHL (1982 to 11 December 2016), and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy or safety of administration, or both, of anti-VEGF agents compared with conventional therapy in preterm infants with ROP.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane and Cochrane Neonatal methods for data collection and analysis. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

Six trials involving a total of 383 infants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Five trials compared intravitreal bevacizumab (n = 4) or ranibizumab (n = 1) with conventional laser therapy (monotherapy), while the sixth study compared intravitreal pegaptanib plus conventional laser therapy with laser/cryotherapy (combination therapy). When used as monotherapy, bevacizumab/ranibizumab did not reduce the risk of complete or partial retinal detachment (3 studies; 272 infants; risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 5.13; risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.04; very low-quality evidence), mortality before discharge (2 studies; 229 infants; RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.26 to 8.75), corneal opacity requiring corneal transplant (1 study; 286 eyes; RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.26), or lens opacity requiring cataract removal (3 studies; 544 eyes; RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.79). The risk of recurrence of ROP requiring retreatment also did not differ between groups (2 studies; 193 infants; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.63; RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.07; very low-quality evidence). Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in the risk of recurrence in infants with zone I ROP (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.62), but an increased risk of recurrence in infants with zone II ROP (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.01 to 6.32). Pooled analysis of studies that reported eye-level outcomes also revealed significant increase in the risk of recurrence of ROP in the eyes that received bevacizumab (RR 5.36, 95% CI 1.22 to 23.50; RD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17). Infants who received intravitreal bevacizumab had a significantly lower risk of refractive errors (very high myopia) at 30 months of age (1 study; 211 eyes; RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.20; RD -0.40, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.30; low-quality evidence). When used in combination with laser therapy, intravitreal pegaptanib was found to reduce the risk of retinal detachment when compared to laser/cryotherapy alone (152 eyes; RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.55; RD -0.29, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.16; low-quality evidence). The incidence of recurrence of ROP by 55 weeks' postmenstrual age was also lower in the pegaptanib + laser therapy group (76 infants; RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.7; RD -0.35, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.16; low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the risk of perioperative retinal haemorrhages between the two groups (152 eyes; RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.56; RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.05; very low-quality evidence). However, the risk of delayed systemic adverse effects with any of the three anti-VEGF drugs is not known.

Authors' Conclusions

Implications for practice: Intravitreal bevacizumab/ranibizumab, when used as monotherapy, reduces the risk of refractive errors during childhood but does not reduce the risk of retinal detachment or recurrence of ROP in infants with type 1 ROP. While the intervention might reduce the risk of recurrence of ROP in infants with zone I ROP, it can potentially result in higher risk of recurrence requiring retreatment in those with zone II ROP. Intravitreal pegaptanib, when used in conjunction with laser therapy, reduces the risk of retinal detachment as well as the recurrence of ROP in infants with type 1 ROP. However, the quality of the evidence was very low to low for most outcomes due to risk of detection bias and other biases. The effects on other critical outcomes and, more importantly, the long-term systemic adverse effects of the drugs are not known. Insufficient data precludes strong conclusions favouring routine use of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents - either as monotherapy or in conjunction with laser therapy - in preterm infants with type 1 ROP.

Implications For Research

Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of anti-VEGF agents on structural and functional outcomes in childhood and delayed systemic effects including adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.

### VEGF-targeted therapy: mechanisms of anti-tumour activity [^11226MJ4]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2008). Medium credibility.

Several vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted agents, administered either as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy, have been shown to benefit patients with advanced-stage malignancies. VEGF-targeted therapies were initially developed with the notion that they would inhibit new blood vessel growth and thus starve tumours of necessary oxygen and nutrients. It has become increasingly apparent, however, that the therapeutic benefit associated with VEGF-targeted therapy is complex, and probably involves multiple mechanisms. A better understanding of these mechanisms will lead to future advances in the use of these agents in the clinic.

Regarding medical management for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to general principles of management and follow-up, AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that randomized, controlled clinical trials support the use of antioxidant supplementation for slowing the progression to later stages of AMD; intravitreal injection of complement factor inhibitor to decrease the rate of GA growth; and intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and laser photocoagulation surgery to treat neovascular AMD.

- thermal laser photocoagulation surgery is rarely used in clinical practice and is not recommended for subfoveal MNV.

### Mechanisms of adverse effects of anti-VEGF therapy for cancer [^116tG5Vd]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Advances in understanding the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in normal physiology are giving insight into the basis of adverse effects attributed to the use of VEGF inhibitors in clinical oncology. These effects are typically downstream consequences of suppression of cellular signalling pathways important in the regulation and maintenance of the microvasculature. Downregulation of these pathways in normal organs can lead to vascular disturbances and even regression of blood vessels, which could be intensified by concurrent pathological conditions. These changes are generally manageable and pose less risk than the tumours being treated, but they highlight the properties shared by tumour vessels and the vasculature of normal organs.

### Factors involved in anti-VEGF treatment decisions for neovascular age-related macular degeneration: insights from real-world clinical practice [^1129SeYv]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Most physicians (75%) agreed that some insurers restrict and some deny patient access to products that physicians deem most appropriate for them. Physicians reported health plan coverage as a key reason in their choice of anti-VEGF agent for 17% of the patients sampled (77/451), stating they would have recommended an nAMD-approved branded agent for 65% of these patients (50/77) had it been possible.

The availability and access to anti-VEGF agents also differed between approved agents and the off-label agent bevacizumab. For anti-VEGF agents approved for nAMD (aflibercept, brolucizumab, or ranibizumab), only about one-third of physician responses (51/168) indicated availability without restrictions (Figure 3). Conversely, for off-label bevacizumab, most physician responses (80%, 45/56) indicated availability without restrictions (Figure 3). Common restrictions on anti-VEGF agents include the physician needing a prior authorization or approval, the agent being available to the physician only after another option was tried, and the agent being restricted to a specific hospital, specialist unit, provider, or patient subset (Figure 3).

Availability and restrictions on approved anti-VEGF agents (aflibercept, ranibizumab, and brolucizumab; n = 168 physician responses) compared with off-label bevacizumab (n = 56 physician responses). Physicians were able to choose multiple answers for types of restrictions.

### Intravitreal injections – 2025 [^111yjVxW]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Systemic complications of anti-VEGF therapy — risk profile and evidence synthesis indicate that when agents such as anti-VEGF medications and corticosteroids are given systemically, they can have significant and potentially life-threatening complications, and although all intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments may carry theoretical risks for systemic arterial thromboembolic events, the results of clinical trials remain inconclusive; a 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies did not increase the risk of major cardiovascular events but there were increased nonocular hemorrhages in patients with AMD, additional meta-analyses found that anti-VEGF therapies and treatment intensity did not have an effect on mortality with low certainty evidence making estimates imprecise, and ophthalmologists need to monitor the patient for the possibility of long-term systemic side effects.

### Factors involved in anti-VEGF treatment decisions for neovascular age-related macular degeneration: insights from real-world clinical practice [^116GpEXp]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Physicians identify clinical benefit, patient convenience, and out-of-pocket costs as top factors influencing nAMD treatment decisions, including choice of treatment strategy and anti-VEGF agent. In addition, physicians reported clinical benefit as most influential in switching agents. However, physicians face non-clinical roadblocks in prescribing approved anti-VEGF agents, such as administrative controls and lack of coverage. Minimizing restrictions on approved anti-VEGF agents in payer policies could assist physicians in prescribing the appropriate medications for patients with nAMD and ultimately improve treatment outcomes in clinical practice.

### Intravitreal injections – 2025 [^115fjUvE]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy — clinical role in retinal disease: Anti-VEGF agents have become the first-line of therapy for treating and stabilizing most cases of neovascular AMD, and are used for treatment of many other retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and retinal vein occlusion; multiple well-designed studies have shown intravitreal anti-VEGF agents provide more effective treatment for center-involved diabetic macular edema than laser monotherapy, and therefore anti-VEGF agents are the preferred initial treatment choice when visual acuity is affected.

### Clinical utilization of anti-vascular endothelial growth-factor agents and patient monitoring in retinal vein occlusion and diabetic macular edema [^113hhWJQ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Retinal vein occlusion (RVO), divided into central (CRVO) or branch (BRVO), and diabetic macular edema (DME) are among the most common retinal vascular diseases responsible for vision loss and blindness.–RVO and DME are estimated to affect approximately 16.4 million and 21 million people worldwide, respectively. Although the pathogeneses of CRVO, BRVO, and DME are multifactorial, upregulation of VEGF is a common underlying source of vision loss in all three diseases.–

Treatment options for patients with macular edema secondary to BRVO, CRVO, or DME include laser surgery, intravitreal corticosteroids, and intravitreal anti-VEGF agents. Anti-VEGF agents, including ranibizumab (Lucentis ®; Genentech, San Francisco, CA, USA) and bevacizumab (Avastin ®; Genentech), have become standard therapy in these conditions. Ranibizumab was initially approved in the US for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) in 2006; it received approvals for BRVO and CRVO in June 2010, and for DME in August 2012. Bevacizumab is not US Food and Drug Administration-approved for intraocular use, but is widely used off-label for all four indications. A third agent, aflibercept (Eylea ®; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Tarrytown, NY, USA) was approved for CRVO in September 2012 and is currently under regulatory evaluation for DME.

### Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor dosing regimens: benefits and burden [^114VvGfm]. Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Topic

To examine the outcomes of clinical trials and case studies that investigated the different dosing regimens used for the 3 intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors that are available currently. The Comparisons of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Treatments Trial (CATT) data are discussed briefly here and are reviewed in greater detail in a separate accompanying article.

Clinical Relevance

Sustained improvement with the 2 most widely used anti-VEGF drugs, bevacizumab and ranibizumab, requires monthly visits, posing a difficulty for patients. Thus, there is a need to evaluate whether individualized treatment regimens may reduce patient burden and improve patient outcomes.

Methods

Review of clinical trials and case studies presented at recent medical conferences and published in peer-reviewed literature.

Results

Numerous trials, including the Efficacy and Safety of Ranibizumab in Patients with Subfoveal Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) Secondary to AMD, Prospective Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging of Patients with Neovascular AMD Treated with Intraocular Ranibizumab, Study of Ranibizumab in Patients with Subfoveal CNV Secondary to AMD, Extension Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Ranibizumab in Subjects with CNV Secondary to AMD or Macular Edema Secondary to Retinal Vein Occlusion, Safety Assessment of Intravitreal Lucentis for AMD, and CATT, have evaluated alternatives to monthly dosing. Evidence suggests that either a treat-as-needed or, possibly, a treat-and-extend regimen provides a reasonable approach to monthly injections recommended for bevacizumab and ranibizumab, with the caveat that as yet, careful and ongoing surveillance remains a key feature of optical management.

Conclusions

Individualization of antiangiogenic treatment using data from clinical trials evaluating various dosing regimens against the patient's disease, lifestyle, and economic restrictions continues to evolve.

### Antiangiogenic drugs in the management of ocular diseases: focus on antivascular endothelial growth factor [^115z5Kvt]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) complications are the leading cause of severe vision loss among the aging population in the many western countries. The introduction of molecular inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), such as pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab, as treatments for wet AMD has provided new hope for affected patients. Now we have these treatment options, which have the possibility to improve or maintain visual acuity for patients suffering from AMD. The treatment needs to be optimized and this is in progress. Based on emerging evidence, adopting a variable VEGF inhibitor-dosing strategy guided by visual acuity assessment and optical coherence tomography are now being tried to reduce the frequency of injections. VEGF inhibitors in combination with photodynamic therapy are another way to optimize treatment. Physicians are waiting for new guidelines for the management of AMD and the results of current and upcoming trials systematically addressing these issues will be expected to provide it.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^113ayDwM]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to management of macular neovascularization, AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that the criteria for treatment of AMD and the techniques of therapy are described in the anti-VEGF agent, MPS, and AREDS literature. Anti-VEGF agent product labeling and other literature discuss techniques of intravitreal injection. As is the case with most clinical trials, these treatment trials do not provide clear guidance for the management of all patients encountered in clinical practice. The first major prospective randomized anti-VEGF treatment trials (ANCHOR: Anti-VEGF Antibody for the Treatment of Predominantly Classic CNV in AMD, MARINA: Minimally Classic/Occult Trial of the Anti-VEGF Antibody Ranibizumab in the Treatment of Neovascular AMD, VIEW, CATT, IVAN, and HARBOR) used either a fixed continuous treatment regimen (approximately every 4 or 8 weeks) or an individualized discontinuous treatment regimen (as-needed or PRN treatment). Choice of the treatment strategy to use should be individually tailored based on discussion between the patient and physician. The PRN regimens using ranibizumab appear to have efficacy and safety comparable to fixed monthly regimens over 1 year of treatment, but they do not maintain the initial visual gains with longer follow-up. Caution should be used when dosing PRN bevacizumab, as it may be slightly less effective than other monthly anti-VEGF regimens and other PRN anti-VEGF regimens. Vision gains during the first 2 years of the CATT clinical trials were not maintained at the 5-year follow-up visit, but 50% of the patients maintained a VA of 20/40. A continuous, variable dosing regimen that attempts to individualize therapy, commonly referred to as treat-and-extend, is frequently used in clinical practice as an alternative to the two treatment approaches above. Prospective studies such as Lucentis Compared to Avastin Study (LUCAS) have shown similar efficacy between monthly and treat-and-extend for bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Personalized treatment interval dosing regimens, which are based on treat-and-extend and use prespecified criteria, maintain visual and anatomic improvements while allowing for extended dosing intervals in clinical studies evaluating faricimab and aflibercept 8 mg. Subretinal hemorrhages are relatively common in neovascular AMD. Small subretinal hemorrhages are a sign of active MNV or PCV and may be managed with anti-VEGF therapy. For the management of larger submacular hemorrhages, the Submacular Surgery Trial study was inconclusive. Pneumatic displacement procedures, the use of tPA (tPA), and/or pars plana vitrectomy have been proposed. The data on management of these larger hemorrhages are inadequate to make a recommendation at this time.

### Clinical and regulatory considerations for the use of bevacizumab biosimilars in metastatic colorectal cancer [^116GXctk]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Biosimilars - biological medicines highly similar to a licensed reference product (RP) - can mitigate the risk of drug shortages by providing treatment alternatives and, with their lower costs, increase patient access to medication and reduce health care expenditure. However, limited knowledge of biosimilar approval processes and lack of confidence in their quality and efficacy can limit their uptake. Importantly, biosimilars are approved based on tightly controlled regulatory pathways to demonstrate that the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the proposed biosimilar are highly similar to the RP, with no clinically meaningful differences. Initially, a battery of highly sensitive in vitro studies are performed, comparing critical quality attributes between the proposed biosimilar and RP. Subsequently, in vivo pharmacodynamic studies compare the activity and physiologic effects of the biosimilar and RP. Finally, clinical studies are conducted, including a pharmacokinetic equivalence study and a confirmatory comparative clinical trial. The latter is performed in the most sensitive patient population for which the RP is licensed, to provide the greatest possibility of identifying any clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biosimilar and RP. When equivalent safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in one setting, the totality of evidence, together with scientific justification that there are no anticipated differences between the RP and proposed biosimilar in mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity or toxicity, allows extrapolation into indications where clinical studies were not performed with the proposed biosimilar. Here, we review the approval process for biosimilars, focusing on the licensing of bevacizumab biosimilars and their extrapolation to metastatic colorectal cancer.

### Role of pegaptanib sodium in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration [^117XDcoi]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is responsible for more than half the blind registration in the United Kingdom. Retinal manifestations of AMD can be categorized as either atrophic or neovascular. The hallmark of AMD is the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Until recently, there have been few, limited treatment modalities (eg, photodynamic therapy [PDT]) for this condition and the mainstay of treatment has comprised social and lifestyle support. However, increased understanding of the molecular processes at work in neovascular AMD and CNV in recent years has led to the introduction of new anti-angiogenic agents that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These agents either inhibit a selected VEGF isoform (eg, VEGF(165) inhibition by pegaptanib sodium) or inhibit all forms of the VEGF isoform (eg, non-selective VEGF blockade by ranibizumab). The trial data suggest that non-selective inhibition of VEGF offers better treatment outcomes in neovascular AMD. As a result, agents that inhibit all VEGF isoforms are now widely used as first-line therapy for this condition. However, it is known that VEGF plays an important role in maintaining the intergrity of the cardiovascular system and, particularly as the age of patients with AMD places them at an elevated risk of thromboembolic events, long-term post-marketing surveillance data are essential to determining whether non-selective VEGF blockade confers any increased risk. Theoretically, selective VEGF inhibition may reduce any risk associated with pan-VEGF blockade, yet on the basis of initial trials, their use remains more limited at this time. However, clinical practice suggests that initial trials may have under-estimated the efficacy of selective-VEGF inhibition. Observational studies also indicate that better treatment outcomes may be possible by combining VEGF inhibitors sequentially with each other, or with existing therapies (eg, photodynamic therapy [PDT]). The optimum role and indications of anti-VEGF agents will come through careful consideration of the available efficacy and safety data, from the outcomes of long-term follow-up studies, and through assessment of the relative merits of the two approaches to VEGF inhibition in clinical practice. At this time, further head-to-head trials, and economic evaluations, comparing the treatment alternatives are needed.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents for diabetic maculopathy [^113iV3Jo]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

The management of diabetic macular oedema is changing. The therapeutic armamentarium for diabetic macular oedema (DMO) includes a new group of drugs that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These anti-VEGF agents are already being used widely in DMO in clinical practice despite that several phase III trials on these drugs are still underway. There are no established protocols on the use of these agents in DMO, but short-term results are appealing. This review provides an update on the use of anti-VEGF agents in DMO. Although intravitreal delivery of anti-VEGF agents is a relatively safe procedure, the long-term local and systemic effects of these agents in the diabetic population remain unknown. In this regard, this review also highlights the need for close surveillance of the use of these drugs in this high-risk population.

### Evidence-based guidelines for intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic retinopathy in chronic kidney disease [^1112LiQt]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Intravitreal therapy using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) has transformed the approach to treating diabetic retinopathy (DR), but its application in individuals with diabetes and chronic kidney disease, the majority of whom have diabetic kidney disease, involves a complex evaluation of risks and benefits. Emerging evidence indicates that the systemic absorption of anti-VEGF agents administered intravitreally may lower circulating VEGF levels and negatively impact the renal endothelium, especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney issues. In this article, we showcase an evidence-based framework for the safe administration of anti-VEGF therapy in patients with DR accompanied by chronic kidney disease. We introduce a novel renoretinal syndrome, which we refer to as anti-VEGF-associated nephropathy (AVAN), and outline diagnostic criteria, severity classifications, biopsy indications, and treatment recommendations to guide clinical practice.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor biosimilars in ophthalmology [^113eYLuE]. Retina (2022). Medium credibility.

Bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech), an anti-VEGF approved for oncology indications, is commonly used off-label as a compounded drug to treat retinal diseases in clinical practice. Bevacizumab is the first-line treatment for patients with nAMD in many countries and is also commonly used in the United States.

Because of the high cost of originator biologics, these approved therapies can result in significant financial burden that may affect treatment access. In health care systems without reimbursement, this burden falls to the patient and can result in treatment discontinuation or reduced adherence to the treatment regimen, ultimately leading to worse visual outcomes. In health care systems with reimbursement, the sustainability of the health care system can be negatively affected by the financial burden of high treatment costs.

Biosimilar drugs present an opportunity to decrease this financial burden because biosimilars are available at a lower cost than the originator products. Although prevalent in oncology, biosimilar use in ophthalmology is still in its infancy. As of September 2022, only two ranibizumab biosimilars are approved in the United States and EU, but additional biosimilars are in development. This article aims to educate ophthalmologists on the safety and efficacy of biosimilars, increase awareness of the biosimilar approval process, and present the current and upcoming biosimilars in ophthalmology in the United States and EU.

The search for reliable biomarkers predictive of response to anti-VEGF therapy has been elusive.

### Treatment regimens for administration of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents for neovascular age-related macular degeneration [^111N4ZbN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of permanent blindness worldwide. The current mainstay of treatment for neovascular AMD (nAMD) is intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents: aflibercept, ranibizumab, and off-label bevacizumab. Injections can be given monthly, every two or three months ('extended-fixed'), or as needed (pro re nata (PRN)). A variant of PRN is 'treat-and-extend' whereby injections are resumed if recurrence is detected and then delivered with increasing intervals. Currently, injection frequency varies among practitioners, which underscores the need to characterize an optimized approach to nAMD management.

Objectives

To investigate the effects of monthly versus non-monthly intravitreous injection of an anti-VEGF agent in people with newly diagnosed nAMD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and three trials registers from 2004 to October 2019; checked references; handsearched conference abstracts; and contacted pharmaceutical companies to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different treatment regimens for anti-VEGF agents in people with newly diagnosed nAMD. We considered standard doses only (ranibizumab 0.5 mg, bevacizumab 1.25 mg, aflibercept 2.0 mg, or a combination of these).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods for trial selection, data extraction, and analysis.

Main Results

We included 15 RCTs. The total number of participants was 7732, ranging from 37 to 2457 in each trial. The trials were conducted worldwide. Of these, six trials exclusively took place in the US, and three included centers from more than one country. Eight trials were at high risk of bias for at least one domain and all trials had at least one domain at unclear risk of bias. Seven trials (3525 participants) compared a PRN regimen with a monthly injection regimen, of which five trials delivered four to eight injections using standard PRN and three delivered nine or 10 injections using a treat-and-extend regimen in the first year. The overall mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at one year was +8.8 letters in the monthly injection group. Compared to the monthly injection, there was moderate-certainty evidence that the mean difference (MD) in BCVA change at one year for the standard PRN subgroup was -1.7 letters (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.8 to -0.6; 4 trials, 2299 participants), favoring monthly injections. There was low-certainty evidence of a similar BCVA change with the treat-and-extend subgroup (0.5 letters, 95% CI -3.1 to 4.2; 3 trials, 1226 participants). Compared to monthly injection, there was low-certainty evidence that fewer participants gained 15 or more lines of vision with standard PRN treatment at one year (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.99; 4 trials, 2299 participants) and low-certainty evidence of a similar gain with treat-and-extend versus monthly regimens (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.36; 3 trials, 1169 participants). The mean change in central retinal thickness was a decrease of -166 μm in the monthly injection group; the MD compared with standard PRN was 21 μm (95% CI 6 to 32; 4 trials, 2215 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and with treat-and extend was 22 μm (95% CI 37 to -81 μm; 2 trials, 635 participants; low-certainty evidence), in favor of monthly injection. Only one trial (498 participants) measured quality of life and reported no evidence of a difference between regimens, but data could not be extracted (low-certainty evidence). Both PRN regimens (standard and 'treat-and-extend') used fewer injections than monthly regimens (standard PRN: MD -4.6 injections, 95% CI -5.4 to -3.8; 4 trials, 2336 participants; treat-and-extend: -2.4 injections, 95% CI -2.7 to -2.1 injections; moderate-certainty evidence for both comparisons). Two trials provided cost data (1105 participants, trials conducted in the US and the UK). They found that cost differences between regimens were reduced if bevacizumab rather than aflibercept or ranibizumab were used, since bevacizumab was less costly (low-certainty evidence). PRN regimens were associated with a reduced risk of endophthalmitis compared with monthly injections (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.46; 6 RCTs, 3175 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Using data from all trials included in this review, we estimated the risk of endophthalmitis with monthly injections to be 8 in every 1000 people per year. The corresponding risk for people receiving PRN regimens was 1 in every 1000 people per year (95% CI 0 to 4). Three trials (1439 participants) compared an extended-fixed regimen (number of injections reported in only one large trial: 7.5 in one year) with monthly injections. There was moderate-certainty evidence that BCVA at one year was similar for extended-fixed and monthly injections (MD in BCVA change compared to extended-fixed group: -1.3 letters, 95% CI -3.9 to 1.3; RR of gaining 15 letters or more: 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.10). The change in central retinal thickness was a decrease of 137 μm in the monthly group; the MD with the extended-fixed group was 8 μm (95% CI -11 to 27; low-certainty evidence). The frequency of endophthalmitis was lower in the extended-fixed regimen compared to the monthly group, but this estimate was imprecise (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.11; low-certainty evidence). If we assumed a risk of 8 cases of endophthalmitis in 1000 people receiving monthly injections over one year, then the corresponding risk with extended-fixed regimen was 2 in 1000 people (95% CI 0 to 9). Other evidence comparing different extended-fixed or PRN regimens yielded inconclusive results.

Authors' Conclusions

We found that, at one year, monthly regimens are probably more effective than PRN regimens using seven or eight injections in the first year, but the difference is small and clinically insignificant. Endophthalmitis is probably more common with monthly injections and differences in costs between regimens are higher if aflibercept or ranibizumab are used compared to bevacizumab. This evidence only applies to settings in which regimens are implemented as described in the trials, whereas undertreatment is likely to be common in real-world settings. There are no data from RCTs on long-term effects of different treatment regimens.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for neovascular age-related macular degeneration [^115qNaDj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of uncorrectable severe vision loss in people aged 55 years and older in the developed world. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to AMD accounts for most cases of AMD-related severe vision loss. Intravitreous injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents aims to block the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye to prevent vision loss and, in some instances, to improve vision.

Objectives

- To investigate ocular and systemic effects of, and quality of life associated with, intravitreous injection of three anti-VEGF agents (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab) versus no anti-VEGF treatment for patients with neovascular AMD• To compare the relative effects of one of these anti-VEGF agents versus another when administered in comparable dosages and regimens SEARCH METHODS: To identify eligible studies for this review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (searched January 31, 2018); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to January 31, 2018); Embase Ovid (1947 to January 31, 2018); the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to January 31, 2018); the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) Registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch - searched January 31, 2018); ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov - searched November 28, 2018); and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en - searched January 31, 2018). We did not impose any date or language restrictions in electronic searches for trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated pegaptanib, ranibizumab, or bevacizumab versus each other or versus a control treatment (e.g. sham treatment, photodynamic therapy), in which participants were followed for at least one year.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened records, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional data. We compared outcomes using risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences (MDs). We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 16 RCTs that had enrolled a total of 6347 participants with neovascular AMD (the number of participants per trial ranged from 23 to 1208) and identified one potentially relevant ongoing trial. Six trials compared anti-VEGF treatment (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, or bevacizumab) versus control, and 10 trials compared bevacizumab versus ranibizumab. Pharmaceutical companies conducted or sponsored four trials but funded none of the studies that evaluated bevacizumab. Researchers conducted these trials at various centers across five continents (North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia). The overall certainty of the evidence was moderate to high, and most trials had an overall low risk of bias. All but one trial had been registered prospectively. When compared with those who received control treatment, more participants who received intravitreous injection of any of the three anti-VEGF agents had gained 15 letters or more of visual acuity (risk ratio [RR] 4.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.32 to 7.55; moderate-certainty evidence), had lost fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.55; high-certainty evidence), and showed mean improvement in visual acuity (mean difference 6.7 letters, 95% CI 4.4 to 9.0 in one pegaptanib trial; mean difference 17.8 letters, 95% CI 16.0 to 19.7 in three ranibizumab trials; moderate-certainty evidence) after one year of follow-up. Participants treated with anti-VEGF agents showed improvement in morphologic outcomes (e.g. size of CNV, central retinal thickness) compared with participants not treated with anti-VEGF agents (moderate-certainty evidence). No trial directly compared pegaptanib versus another anti-VEGF agent and followed participants for one year; however, when compared with control treatments, ranibizumab and bevacizumab each yielded larger improvements in visual acuity outcomes than pegaptanib. Visual acuity outcomes after bevacizumab and ranibizumab were similar when the same RCTs compared the same regimens with respect to gain of 15 or more letters of visual acuity (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.12; high-certainty evidence) and loss of fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02; high-certainty evidence); results showed similar mean improvement in visual acuity (mean difference [MD] -0.5 letters, 95% CI -1.5 to 0.5; high-certainty evidence) after one year of follow-up, despite the substantially lower cost of bevacizumab compared with ranibizumab. Reduction in central retinal thickness was less among bevacizumab-treated participants than among ranibizumab-treated participants after one year (MD -11.6 μm, 95% CI -21.6 to -1.7; high-certainty evidence); however, this difference is within the range of measurement error, and we did not interpret it to be clinically meaningful. Ocular inflammation and increased intraocular pressure (IOP) after intravitreal injection were the most frequently reported serious ocular adverse events. Researchers reported endophthalmitis in less than 1% of anti-VEGF-treated participants and in no cases among control groups. The occurrence of serious systemic adverse events was comparable across anti-VEGF-treated groups and control groups; however, the numbers of events and trial participants may have been insufficient to show a meaningful difference between groups (evidence of low- to moderate-certainty). Investigators rarely measured and reported data on visual function, quality of life, or economic outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Results of this review show the effectiveness of anti-VEGF agents (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab) in terms of maintaining visual acuity; studies show that ranibizumab and bevacizumab improved visual acuity in some eyes that received these agents and were equally effective. Available information on the adverse effects of each medication does not suggest a higher incidence of potentially vision-threatening complications with intravitreous injection of anti-VEGF agents compared with control interventions; however, clinical trial sample sizes were not sufficient to estimate differences in rare safety outcomes. Future Cochrane Reviews should incorporate research evaluating variable dosing regimens of anti-VEGF agents, effects of long-term use, use of combination therapies (e.g. anti-VEGF treatment plus photodynamic therapy), and other methods of delivering these agents.

### Targeting angiogenesis: progress with anti-VEGF treatment with large molecules [^112cKuPR]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Angiogenesis — one of the hallmarks of cancer — has emerged as a valid therapeutic target in oncology. The VEGF system represents a key mediator of tumor-initiated angiogenesis and the first target of antiangiogenesis agents introduced in clinical practice. Although anti-VEGF therapies have clearly demonstrated antitumor efficacy in various malignancies, especially when combined with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, their mechanism of action is not fully understood. This Review will discuss the rationale for using antiangiogenic compounds and will focus on large molecules, such as antibodies, that target the VEGF system. Clinical data on bevacizumab is discussed in detail. Predictive markers for anti-VEGF agents have not yet been identified and questions regarding the usefulness of bevacizumab in the adjuvant setting as well as its continued use beyond progression remain unanswered, in spite of negative data on bevacizumab in treating patients with adjuvant colon cancer. Nonetheless, anti-VEGF therapy has enhanced the arsenal of anticancer therapies and has provided new insights into the biology of malignancy.

### Switching to faricimab from the current anti-VEGF therapy: evidence-based expert recommendations [^111uuu5L]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Dual inhibition of the angiopoietin (Ang)/Tie and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathways in patients with retinal diseases, such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and diabetic macular oedema (DME), may induce greater vascular stability and contribute to increased treatment efficacy and durability compared with treatments that only target the VEGF pathway. Faricimab, a bispecific intravitreal agent that inhibits both VEGF and Ang-2, is the first injectable ophthalmic drug to achieve treatment intervals of up to 16 weeks in Phase 3 studies for nAMD and DME while exhibiting improvements in visual acuity and retinal thickness. Data from real-world studies have supported the safety, visual and anatomic benefits and durability of faricimab, even in patients who were previously treated with other intravitreal agents. These evidence-based expert recommendations from a panel of retina specialists consolidate current evidence with clinical experience for the optimal use of faricimab in patients with nAMD or DME, with a focus on switching from an anti-VEGF agent to faricimab.

Regarding medical management for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to complications of treatment (intravitreal pharmacotherapy, general principles), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that a review of the literature concluded that anti-VEGF therapy is safe and effective for neovascular AMD. The risks of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents in pregnant or lactating women have not been studied. Intravitreal pharmacotherapy can result in endophthalmitis, noninfectious inflammation, retinal tear, or detachment.

### Aflibercept (VEGF trap-eye): the newest anti-VEGF drug [^117Sa9GC]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

The approval application draws on the strengths of two concurrent AMD trials: the VIEW 1 trial, which enrolled 1217 patients in North American centres, and the VIEW 2 trial, which enrolled 1240 patients in South American, European, Asian and Australian centres. Each trial randomised patients among four treatment arms: monthly 0.5 mg VTE, monthly or bimonthly 2 mg VTE, and monthly 0.5 mg ranibizumab. All VTE investigational arms reached the primary endpoint — non-inferiority for maintenance of vision (≤ 15 letters of vision loss) compared to ranibizumab (94% for ranibizumab arms and 95% to 96% for all VTE arms).

Physicians will naturally question what advantage, if any, the VTE brings to our treatment of chorioretinal vascular diseases. Though many factors determine drug selection, most retina surgeons will ask three important questions. What is the peak effect of the drug (usually measured by letters of improvement)? What is the duration of action (usually determined by the frequency of drug administration)? Is the drug safe (usually determined by systemic adverse events)?

Since pegaptanib use is infrequent, the VTE enters a clinical environment dominated by the two closely related antibody-based drugs, bevacizumab and ranibizumab. The clinical superiority of ranibizumab over both observation and photodynamic therapy was well documented in both the MARINA(7.2 letters vs −10.4 letters) and ANCHOR(11.3 letters vs −9.5 letters) studies, thus establishing ranibizumab as the standard against which all subsequent drugs are compared. Due in part to its off-label use in ophthalmology, bevacizumab has never been subjected to comparable controlled trials, but the recently reported Comparison of Age-related Macular Degeneration Treatment Trials demonstrated its near equivalency to ranibizumab with monthly dosing (8.0 letters vs 8.5 letters) and non-significantly poorer outcomes with as needed dosing (5.9 letters vs 6.8 letters). Most physicians, therefore, now believe the two drugs to be clinically equivalent.

### Factors involved in anti-VEGF treatment decisions for neovascular age-related macular degeneration: insights from real-world clinical practice [^113nVZZC]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss among individuals over 60 years of age in the United States (US), with a prevalence of 12.6% in adults of 40 years of age and older for early-stage AMD. Neovascular AMD (nAMD) arises from abnormal blood vessel formation originating primarily from the choroid, which can lead to intraretinal or subretinal fluid, hemorrhage, and vision loss in patients with nAMD. The standard-of-care for nAMD is the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents to slow vision loss in patients. Anti-VEGF agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of nAMD include aflibercept, brolucizumab, and ranibizumab, and bevacizumab is frequently used off-label. Most recently, faricimab, a bispecific anti-VEGF and anti-angiopoietin-2 antibody, has also been approved for nAMD. Although many studies have investigated patient preference for specific anti-VEGF agents, little is currently understood about physician preference and the barriers faced when prescribing anti-VEGF agents in real-world clinical practice.

Four principles have been identified for the ideal anti-VEGF treatment of retinal diseases, including nAMD: "maximize and maintain visual acuity benefits for all patients"; "decide when to treat next, rather than whether to treat now"; "titrate the treatment intervals to match patients' needs"; and "treat at each monitoring visit". However, in routine clinical practice, physicians may face barriers in prescribing their choice of anti-VEGF agent and must also consider the type of treatment strategy, such as the use of "treat-and-extend" (treat and monitor at every visit and extend the dosing interval if the patient and disease are stable), "fixed interval" (to treat and monitor at every visit on a fixed interval), or "pro re nata" injection regimens (to monitor at every visit and treat as needed). Choice of treatment strategy can affect clinical outcomes, as certain regimens such as "treat-and-extend" can improve visual acuity outcomes in patients with nAMD compared with a "pro re nata" strategy. Choice of treatment strategy also dictates the frequency and associated costs of injections that patients will receive over a 1-year and 2-year period. These factors may prevent physicians from prescribing agents that would otherwise have benefited patients, potentially affecting clinical outcomes for patients with nAMD.

### Adverse effects of anticancer agents that target the VEGF pathway [^115XaT9o]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Antiangiogenesis agents that target the VEGF/VEGF receptor pathway have become an important part of standard therapy in multiple cancer indications. With expanded clinical experience with this class of agents has come the increasing recognition of the diverse adverse effects related to disturbance of VEGF-dependent physiological functions and homeostasis in the cardiovascular and renal systems, as well as wound healing and tissue repair. Although most adverse effects of VEGF inhibitors are modest and manageable, some are associated with serious and life-threatening consequences, particularly in high-risk patients and in certain clinical settings. This Review examines the toxicity profiles of anti-VEGF antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors. The potential mechanisms of the adverse effects, risk factors, and the implications for selection of patients and management are discussed.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for neovascular age-related macular degeneration [^112nyebR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of uncorrectable severe vision loss in people aged 55 years and older in the developed world. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to neovascular AMD accounts for most AMD-related severe vision loss. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, injected intravitreally, aim to block the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye to prevent vision loss and, in some instances, improve vision.

Objectives

To investigate: (1) the ocular and systemic effects of, and quality of life associated with, intravitreally injected anti-VEGF agents (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab) for the treatment of neovascular AMD compared with no anti-VEGF treatment; and (2) the relative effects of one anti-VEGF agent compared with another when administered in comparable dosages and regimens.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 3), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to March 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to March 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 27 March 2014.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated pegaptanib, ranibizumab, or bevacizumab versus each other or a control treatment (e.g., sham treatment or photodynamic therapy). All trials followed participants for at least one year.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened records, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional data. We analyzed outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences (MDs). We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 12 RCTs including a total of 5496 participants with neovascular AMD (the number of participants per trial ranged from 28 to 1208). One trial compared pegaptanib, three trials ranibizumab, and two trials bevacizumab versus controls; six trials compared bevacizumab with ranibizumab. Four trials were conducted by pharmaceutical companies; none of the eight studies which evaluated bevacizumab were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The trials were conducted at various centers across five continents (North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia). The overall quality of the evidence was very good, with most trials having an overall low risk of bias. When compared with control treatments, participants who received any of the three anti-VEGF agents were more likely to have gained 15 letters or more of visual acuity, lost fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity, and had vision 20/200 or better after one year of follow up. Visual acuity outcomes after bevacizumab and ranibizumab were similar when the same regimens were compared in the same RCTs, despite the substantially lower cost for bevacizumab compared with ranibizumab. No trial directly compared pegaptanib with other anti-VEGF agents; however, when compared with controls, ranibizumab or bevacizumab yielded larger improvements in visual acuity outcomes than pegaptanib. Participants treated with anti-VEGFs showed improvements in morphologic outcomes (e.g., size of CNV or central retinal thickness) compared with participants not treated with anti-VEGF agents. There was less reduction in central retinal thickness among bevacizumab-treated participants than among ranibizumab-treated participants after one year (MD -13.97 μm; 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.52 to -1.41); however, this difference is within the range of measurement error and we did not interpret it as being clinically meaningful. Ocular inflammation and increased intraocular pressure after intravitreal injection were the most frequently reported serious ocular adverse events. Endophthalmitis was reported in fewer than 1% of anti-VEGF treated participants; no cases were reported in control groups. The occurrence of serious systemic adverse events was comparable across anti-VEGF-treated groups and control groups; however, the numbers of events and trial participants may have been insufficient to detect a meaningful difference between groups. Data for visual function, quality of life, and economic outcomes were sparsely measured and reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review indicate the effectiveness of anti-VEGF agents (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab) in terms of maintaining visual acuity; ranibizumab and bevacizumab were also shown to improve visual acuity. The information available on the adverse effects of each medication do not suggest a higher incidence of potentially vision-threatening complications with intravitreal injection compared with control interventions; however, clinical trial sample sizes may not have been sufficient to detect rare safety outcomes. Research evaluating variable dosing regimens with anti-VEGF agents, effects of long-term use, combination therapies (e.g., anti-VEGF treatment plus photodynamic therapy), and other methods of delivering the agents should be incorporated into future Cochrane reviews.

Regarding medical management for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to general principles of management and follow-up, AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that early detection and prompt treatment of active neovascular AMD improves visual outcomes. Intravitreal injection therapy using anti-VEGF (VEGF) agents, which may or may not target other factors such as placental growth factor or angiopoietin-2, is the most effective way to manage neovascular AMD and is the first-line treatment. Symptoms suggestive of post-injection endophthalmitis or retinal detachment require prompt evaluation.

### Angiogenic inhibitors: a new therapeutic strategy in oncology [^111JJTrE]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2005). Medium credibility.

Angiogenesis is a multistep, complex and tightly regulated process that is necessary for tumor growth and metastasis. Based on data of preclinical models, several antiangiogenic compounds has been shown to modify activated tumor endothelium, which suggests that these compounds can improve cytotoxic drug delivery. Such agents have entered clinical trials as single agents or in combination with cytotoxic drugs, and have shown promising antitumor activity. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of antiangiogenic drugs are reviewed here. Most of the early clinical testing of these agents was conducted in patients with advanced disease resistant to standard therapies. Phase III trials compared the efficacy of standard chemotherapy alone with standard chemotherapy in combination with an experimental angiogenesis inhibitor. Although some of these studies were negative or controversial, recent studies validated in large clinical trials with an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody demonstrated significant clinical benefit and renewed enthusiasm for this therapeutic strategy. This review describes the clinical studies of antiangiogenic agents and highlights the challenges related to choosing appropriate strategies for the selection of patients, study design and choice of appropriate endpoints for the studies' development.

Early detection and treatment of AMD to arrest the deterioration in vision may help preserve patients' quality of life and independence, and management options for AMD include observation, antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements, intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and laser photocoagulation surgery, while several new treatments such as stem cells and gene therapy are currently under investigation.

### Guidelines for the management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration by the European Society of Retina Specialists (EURETINA) [^114DD9h1]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has been described as the leading cause of legal blindness, affecting 10%–13% of adults over 65 years of age in North America, Europe, Australia and, recently, Asia. AMD is a major medical and socioeconomic challenge worldwide and, based on increased life expectancy and a growing negative impact of environmental risk factors, particularly arteriosclerosis, obesity and smoking, its incidence is expected to at least double by 2020. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 reported an exponential increase of 160% in vision-related years lived with disability due to AMD, highlighting the overwhelming burden for societies overall. Moreover, with an impact similar to AIDS, renal failure and stroke, AMD has a profound effect on the quality of life of those affected.

Fortunately, progress in AMD's diagnosis and therapy, based on advances in medical research has recently wrought a substantial paradigm shift in the management of neovascular AMD. Identification of a major pathogenetic feature, that is, the influence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has opened an easily accessible therapeutic window. Landmark clinical trials proved that intravitreal inhibition of VEGF-A can efficiently block the pathophysiological process of AMD, restore retinal morphology and increase/maintain neurosensory function in most patients with neovascular AMD. Since the approval of anti-VEGF pharmacotherapy in 2006, the prevalence of legal blindness and visual impairment due to AMD has been considerably reduced, removing neovascular AMD from the list of incurable diseases.

The impressive benefit of antiangiogenic therapy has since been widely recognised. However, real-life outcomes have consistently been found to be less favourable than clinical trial results. The community faces a huge dilemma in the management of AMD, with substantial controversies over the efficacy of substances, choice of therapeutic regimens and adequate monitoring needs. This is further aggravated by exponentially growing costs resulting from highly priced drugs, increasing patient numbers and long-term disease chronicity. At the same time, one of the most successful therapeutic break-throughs in ophthalmology is currently at the centre of an array, of unresolved issues and the standard-of-care is vastly inconsistent.

Evidently, there are enormous variations in clinical practice, and considerable uncertainty about how the scientific evidence should be reduced to clinical practice in widely varying settings. The EURETINA community has, therefore, taken responsibility for bringing together experts in the field to develop a working guidance based on the best available scientific and clinical knowledge. The goal is to provide clinically sound, economically acceptable and unbiased diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations to brighten the horizon for patients and physicians worldwide.

### Defining response to anti-VEGF therapies in neovascular AMD [^114xpv9U]. Eye (2015). Low credibility.

The introduction of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) has made significant impact on the reduction of the visual loss due to neovascular age-related macular degeneration (n-AMD). There are significant inter-individual differences in response to an anti-VEGF agent, made more complex by the availability of multiple anti-VEGF agents with different molecular configurations. The response to anti-VEGF therapy have been found to be dependent on a variety of factors including patient's age, lesion characteristics, lesion duration, baseline visual acuity (VA) and the presence of particular genotype risk alleles. Furthermore, a proportion of eyes with n-AMD show a decline in acuity or morphology, despite therapy or require very frequent re-treatment. There is currently no consensus as to how to classify optimal response, or lack of it, with these therapies. There is, in particular, confusion over terms such as 'responder status' after treatment for n-AMD, 'tachyphylaxis' and 'recalcitrant' n-AMD. This document aims to provide a consensus on definition/categorisation of the response of n-AMD to anti-VEGF therapies and on the time points at which response to treatment should be determined. Primary response is best determined at 1 month following the last initiation dose, while maintained treatment (secondary) response is determined any time after the 4th visit. In a particular eye, secondary responses do not mirror and cannot be predicted from that in the primary phase. Morphological and functional responses to anti-VEGF treatments, do not necessarily correlate, and may be dissociated in an individual eye. Furthermore, there is a ceiling effect that can negate the currently used functional metrics such as > 5 letters improvement when the baseline VA is good (ETDRS > 70 letters). It is therefore important to use a combination of both the parameters in determining the response. The following are proposed definitions: optimal (good) response is defined as when there is resolution of fluid (intraretinal fluid; IRF, subretinal fluid; SRF and retinal thickening), and/or improvement of > 5 letters, subject to the ceiling effect of good starting VA. Poor response is defined as < 25% reduction from the baseline in the central retinal thickness (CRT), with persistent or new IRF, SRF or minimal or change in VA (that is, change in VA of 0+4 letters). Non-response is defined as an increase in fluid (IRF, SRF and CRT), or increasing haemorrhage compared with the baseline and/or loss of > 5 letters compared with the baseline or best corrected vision subsequently. Poor or non-response to anti-VEGF may be due to clinical factors including suboptimal dosing than that required by a particular patient, increased dosing intervals, treatment initiation when disease is already at an advanced or chronic stage), cellular mechanisms, lesion type, genetic variation and potential tachyphylaxis); non-clinical factors including poor access to clinics or delayed appointments may also result in poor treatment outcomes. In eyes classified as good responders, treatment should be continued with the same agent when disease activity is present or reactivation occurs following temporary dose holding. In eyes that show partial response, treatment may be continued, although re-evaluation with further imaging may be required to exclude confounding factors. Where there is persistent, unchanging accumulated fluid following three consecutive injections at monthly intervals, treatment may be withheld temporarily, but recommenced with the same or alternative anti-VEGF if the fluid subsequently increases (lesion considered active). Poor or non-response to anti-VEGF treatments requires re-evaluation of diagnosis and if necessary switch to alternative therapies including other anti-VEGF agents and/or with photodynamic therapy (PDT). Idiopathic polypoidal choroidopathy may require treatment with PDT monotherapy or combination with anti-VEGF. A committee comprised of retinal specialists with experience of managing patients with n-AMD similar to that which developed the Royal College of Ophthalmologists Guidelines to Ranibizumab was assembled. Individual aspects of the guidelines were proposed by the committee lead (WMA) based on relevant reference to published evidence base following a search of Medline and circulated to all committee members for discussion before approval or modification. Each draft was modified according to feedback from committee members until unanimous approval was obtained in the final draft. A system for categorising the range of responsiveness of n-AMD lesions to anti-VEGF therapy is proposed. The proposal is based primarily on morphological criteria but functional criteria have been included. Recommendations have been made on when to consider discontinuation of therapy either because of success or futility. These guidelines should help clinical decision-making and may prevent over and/or undertreatment with anti-VEGF therapy.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor in neovascular age-related macular degeneration-a systematic review of the impact of anti-VEGF on patient outcomes and healthcare systems [^115cRTgd]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of irreversible vision impairment and blindness in the developed world, has a profound effect on the quality of life of affected individuals and on healthcare systems. In 2010, AMD was responsible for 5% of the blindness cases registered worldwide, and the total healthcare expenditure for managing AMD-related visual impairment surpassed $343 billion. Aging is the greatest risk factor for developing AMD, so its prevalence and the associated socioeconomic burden of the disease are expected to increase significantly as the world's population ages. By the end of 2020, nearly 196 million people worldwide are expected to have AMD; by 2040, this number will increase to 288 million.

Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), recognized as the most common late stage of AMD, is responsible for most cases of blindness; nAMD accounts for approximately 10% of AMD cases, but results in 80–90% of legal blindness caused by AMD. nAMD is the only AMD stage for which a specific treatment is presently available: anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. Randomized controlled trials established the efficacy and safety of intravitreal aflibercept and intravitreal ranibizumab in nAMD and enabled the licensing of these drugs. There is also widespread off-label use of intravitreal bevacizumab in many countries. The introduction of anti-VEGF as a standard treatment in nAMD has led to a great improvement in the prognosis of patients, allowing recovery and maintenance of visual function in most cases. Bloch et al. reported an association between the introduction of anti-VEGF injections and the reduction in blindness in the Danish population. Johnston et al. reported a similar reduction in blindness and sight impairment in the United Kingdom. So far, systematic reviews of anti-VEGF have focused on characterizing clinical outcomes, such as visual acuity (VA), and treatment burden (injection frequency and visits). A broad and comprehensive systematic review on the impact of anti-VEGF beyond VA is lacking.

Patient-centered outcomes and costs associated with the use of anti-VEGF are important outcomes to be studied, in particular from a societal perspective. To this end, this study aims to systematically review the published evidence of the economic impact and the impact on patients' overall well-being after receiving anti-VEGF therapy for nAMD.

### Brolucizumab: evaluation of compassionate use of a complex anti-VEGF therapy [^116RrpbN]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Important ethical implications always accompany the use of off-label therapies. While the Food and Drug Association (FDA) restricts commercial promotion of off label drugs, it does not restrict a physician's ability to prescribe them (Hackett on-label and off-label) Many large institutions provide guidance for the process of off label prescribing that includes informing the patient on all risks, documenting the indication for off label use, and receiving and recording informed consent (J Simon off label med. u). Many physicians believe that off-label treatments should not be promoted to consumers and that the FDA approval process protects the public from harmful or ineffective drugs (pdf physicians perspective approval). While the latter is true, off-label therapies often provide the best, and potentially only, option, especially in certain rescue therapeutic treatments. Instead of limiting promotion or use of off label therapies, a further emphasis must be placed on assessing appropriate use of off label treatments since off-label indications include different safety profiles than that of the indication originally approved by the FDA (J Simon off label med. Hackett on-label and off-label). Additionally, while increased adverse drug events may be associated with the off-label use of prescription drugs lacking strong scientific backing, the same is not the case for those with sufficient scientific evidence (in defense of response). If an off-label use of a prescription drug has strong scientific evidence, it may have the same, more, or less risk of complications as on label therapy.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^117FLQXp]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to complications of treatment (intravitreal pharmacotherapy, general principles), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that all anti-VEGF treatments may carry theoretical risks for systemic arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) and increased intraocular pressure, although the results of clinical trials studying these risks remain inconclusive. A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis found that intravitreal anti-VEGF agent use did not increase major cardiovascular events, but there were increased nonocular hemorrhages in patients with AMD. Another systematic review with meta-analyses concluded that anti-VEGF treatment intensity had no significant influence on mortality.

### Changes in tumour vessel density upon treatment with anti-angiogenic agents: relationship with response and resistance to therapy [^115YA3xB]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

The inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling can suppress tumour growth by suppressing tumour angiogenesis. Agents designed to target this pathway include the VEGF-A-neutralising antibody, bevacizumab, and a range of anti-angiogenic receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including sunitinib, pazopanib, cediranib and regorafenib. Vascular endothelial growth factor pathway-targeted agents have been tested in numerous malignancies and have been approved in several indications, including metastatic breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, and renal cancer; hepatocellular carcinoma; glioblastoma; and neuroendocrine tumours. However, individual responses are variable, with some patients demonstrating resistance from the outset (intrinsic resistance) and others going on to develop resistance following a brief period of disease control (acquired resistance). Unfortunately, our understanding of what determines response and resistance to these agents is limited, and the answers to many fundamental questions are still unresolved. For example, what mechanisms underlie intrinsic and acquired resistance to these agents? Can response and resistance be predicted? How do we overcome resistance in order to improve the efficacy of this therapeutic approach?.

In patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), the administration of sunitinib or pazopanib as a single-agent therapy has been shown to extend progression-free and overall survival, and this form of therapy is now the standard of care for mRCC. Nevertheless, ∼20% of mRCC patients demonstrate intrinsic resistance and derive no benefit. Moreover, although the majority of patients do achieve a period of disease control with these drugs, resistance is invariably acquired, typically within months of starting the treatment. The current standard practice to treat with single-agent TKIs in this setting, combined with the manifestation of both intrinsic and acquired resistance, makes mRCC an important setting in which to explore the mechanisms that underlie response and resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in patients.

Recommendation strength and shared decision-making — the guideline clarifies that "Many recommendations within this guideline have been given a strength of weak, on the basis of moderate or lower quality evidence". It defines that, "According to the GRADE system, a weak recommendation is one for which most informed people would choose the recommended course of action, but a substantial number would not", and advises that "a shared decision-making approach is advised across recommendations, considering performance status, contraindications to therapies such as anti-VEGF antibodies, values and preferences, and other factors, as several of the recommended treatment options have a significant risk of adverse events, which needs to be carefully weighed along with the potential for benefit".

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor pharmacotherapy for age-related macular degeneration: a report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology [^114qfxS2]. Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the evidence about the safety and efficacy of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pharmacotherapies for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Design

Literature searches were conducted in May and October 2007 in PubMed with no date restrictions, limited to articles published in English, and in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials without a language limitation and yielded 310 citations. The first author reviewed the abstracts of these articles and selected 73 articles of possible clinical relevance for review by the panel. The panel deemed 64 of these articles sufficiently clinically relevant to review in full text and assigned ratings of level of evidence to each of the selected articles with the guidance of the panel methodologists.

Results

Eleven studies provided level I evidence for intravitreal pegaptanib and ranibizumab for neovascular AMD; there were no studies rated level I for bevacizumab for neovascular AMD. Five studies were rated as level II, which included studies of ranibizumab and bevacizumab, and the remaining 38 articles retrieved were rated as level III. The studies do not provide information about long-term results or the value (comparative effectiveness) and cost-effectiveness of combined therapies.

Conclusions

Review of the available literature to date suggests that anti-VEGF pharmacotherapy, delivered by intravitreal injection, is a safe and effective treatment for neovascular AMD for up to 2 years. There is level I evidence to support this conclusion for pegaptanib and ranibizumab, but none for bevacizumab at this time.

### What is the evidence for systemic effects of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, and should we be concerned? [^115nHYeQ]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has revolutionised the treatment of retinal disease, and appears to be very safe. Nevertheless, there are several lines of evidence that imply that small doses of these agents could potentially have a systemic effect. The clinical significance of these systemic effects remains unclear, but further study is indicated.

### The role of VEGF in cancer angiogenesis and tumorigenesis: insights for anti-VEGF therapy [^1158eDHC]. Cytokine (2025). Medium credibility.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical regulator of angiogenesis, playing a pivotal role in both physiological and pathological processes. It promotes the formation of new blood vessels and activates downstream signaling pathways that regulate endothelial cell function. This review highlights recent advancements in the understanding of VEGF's molecular structure and its isoforms, as well as their implications in disease progression. It also explores the mechanisms of VEGF inhibitors. While VEGF inhibitors show promise in the treatment of cancer and other diseases, their clinical use faces significant challenges, including drug resistance, side effects, and complex interactions with other signaling pathways. To address these challenges, future research should focus on: (i) enhancing the understanding of VEGF subtypes and their distinct roles in various diseases, supporting the development of personalized treatment strategies; (ii) developing combination therapies that integrate VEGF inhibitors with other targeted treatments to overcome resistance and improve efficacy; (iii) optimizing drug delivery systems to reduce off-target effects and enhance therapeutic outcomes. These approaches aim to improve the effectiveness and safety of VEGF-targeted therapies, offering new possibilities for the treatment of VEGF-related diseases.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor in neovascular age-related macular degeneration-a systematic review of the impact of anti-VEGF on patient outcomes and healthcare systems [^112gKG18]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Anti-VEGF treatment for nAMD has been used in clinical practice for more than a decade, but our understanding of its patient-relevant benefits and societal impacts are still incomplete. The introduction of anti-VEGF therapies led to a significant increase in the number of nAMD patients receiving treatment and required healthcare systems to increase the resources allocated to treat nAMD. We can establish a clear link between the introduction of anti-VEGF treatment and a significant reduction in the incidence of blindness by nAMD, which comes at considerable cost to healthcare systems. However, there is limited evidence on the impact of anti-VEGF treatment on other patient-related outcomes.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^115HKv4S]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to general principles of management and follow-up, AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that consequences of untreated neovascular AMD include a substantial economic burden on patients, their family, and society. Anti-VEGF agents are cost-effective for the management of neovascular AMD, and the choice of which agent to use should be individually tailored based on discussion between the patient and physician. Early detection and treatment of AMD to arrest the deterioration in vision may help preserve patients' QoL and independence. Management options for AMD include observation, antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements, intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents, PDT, and laser photocoagulation surgery. Several new treatments such as stem cells and gene therapy are currently under investigation. Patients who are currently smoking should be advised to stop. Studies have found that the physician's advice to stop smoking is a helpful motivator for patients who are attempting to quit and is associated with increased long-term smoking abstinence rates. An important component of care for a patient with AMD is referral for vision rehabilitation as well as continued follow-up for general eye care.

### TREAT-AND-EXTEND REGIMENS WITH ANTI-VEGF AGENTS IN RETINAL DISEASES: a literature review and consensus recommendations [^1174vPBc]. Retina (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

A review of treat-and-extend regimens (TERs) with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents in retinal diseases.

Methods

There is a lack of consensus on the definition and optimal application of TER in clinical practice. This article describes the supporting evidence and subsequent development of a generic algorithm for TER dosing with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, considering factors such as criteria for extension.

Results

A TER algorithm was developed; TER is defined as an individualized proactive dosing regimen usually initiated by monthly injections until a maximal clinical response is observed (frequently determined by optical coherence tomography), followed by increasing intervals between injections (and evaluations) depending on disease activity. The TER regimen has emerged as an effective approach to tailoring the dosing regimen and for reducing treatment burden (visits and injections) compared with fixed monthly dosing or monthly visits with optical coherence tomography-guided regimens (as-needed or pro re nata). It is also considered a suitable approach in many retinal diseases managed with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, given that all eyes differ in the need for repeat injections.

Conclusion

It is hoped that this practical review and TER algorithm will be of benefit to health care professionals interested in the management of retinal diseases.

Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (Anti-VEGF) therapies and comparative trials — Anti-VEGF are substances that inhibit the action of vascular endothelial growth factor protein. Bevacizumab is a full-length monoclonal antibody that binds all isoforms of VEGF and has FDA approval for intravenous use in metastatic colorectal, metastatic breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. The ANCHOR Study evaluated Anti-VEGF antibody ranibizumab for predominantly classic CNV in AMD. The CATT trial compared the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab and ranibizumab and an individualized dosing regimen (PRN) to monthly injections. The DENALI study, part of the SUMMIT studies, compared ranibizumab and verteporfin PDT combination therapy with ranibizumab alone. The DERBY study is a Phase 3 clinical trial for pegcetacoplan (complement C3 inhibitor) compared with sham injections in patients with GA.

### Anti-VEGF agents in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration: applying clinical trial results to the treatment of everyday patients [^112UqTve]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The vision gains reported with monthly intravitreal ranibizumab in the MARINA and ANCHOR trials led to an immediate paradigm shift in the treatment of neovascular AMD with retina physicians universally switching to the pan-VEGF blocking agents ranibizumab and bevacizumab, and patients expecting visual improvement. As these agents are primarily used on a pro re nata (PRN) dosing schedule (because neither patients nor physicians want monthly injections), the factors involved in making the treatment and retreatment decisions are very important in any attempt to maximize vision gain.

Design

Analysis of literature, ongoing clinical trials, and the clinical assessments that can aid clinicians in treatment and retreatment decisions.

Methods

Literature review and perspective.

Results

If a monthly injection protocol is not used, clinicians should use both functional and anatomic criteria to attempt to guide treatment and retreatment decisions. Qualitative optical coherence tomography (OCT) appears to be the most sensitive and practical assessment tool to determine anatomic response to treatment but should be used in conjunction with clinical examination.

Conclusions

If monthly intravitreal injections are not performed, a combination of clinical examination (looking for new hemorrhage) and qualitative OCT (to assess response to treatment and early signs of recurrent leakage) can be used to guide anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), treatments with the goal of maintaining a "normal" retinal anatomy in an attempt to maximize the benefit (visual acuity gains) to risk (number of injections required) ratio.

### Anti-angiogenic drugs: involvement in cutaneous side effects and wound-healing complication [^111P7sfE]. Advances in Wound Care (2014). Low credibility.

Significance: The uses of anti-angiogenic drugs have not only made an impact on the battle to eliminate cancer but are also responsible for a number of medical complications. The long-term use of these drugs has increased the spectrum and incidence of cutaneous side effects and wound-healing complications. It is, therefore, necessary to understand the overall impact that these drugs have on patient care. Recent Advances: This review highlights the role of vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor in angiogenesis and wound healing and looks at how angiogenic inhibitors promote wound-healing complications. Critical Issues: With an increased use of anti-angiogenic drugs for the treatment of various cancers and ocular diseases, there is an increased need for clinicians to define the risks and to optimize the usage of these drugs to reduce the incidence of cutaneous side effects and wound-healing complications. In addition, awareness is needed when treating patients on anti-angiogenic drugs so as not to exacerbate potential wound-healing complications when performing surgical procedures. Future Directions: Clinicians and surgeons will need to develop management guidelines to optimize patient care to reduce the risk of morbidity. When performing a surgical procedure, the impact of adverse effects from the use of anti-angiogenic drugs should be considered to ensure the welfare of the patient. In addition, the development of more specific inhibitors is necessary to reduce target effects to reduce the occurrence of adverse effects.

### Aflibercept to treat retinopathy of prematurity: need for more research [^116ZQufk]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Until recently, the standard care for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) was destructive treatment of the peripheral avascular retina, most often using laser therapy. Now, intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents have been included in recommendations for treatment-warranted ROP. The three anti-VEGF agents used to treat ROP are bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept and clinical trials using, a variety of treatment strategies, have shown all three are efficacious and easy to administer. Intravitreal Bevacizumab is most used in the US, and ranibizumab has been approved for ROP use in Europe. In 2023, the FDA approved aflibercept for treatment of severe ROP. We summarize the clinical trial results and provide a side-by-side comparisons of the three drugs. Despite FDA approval of the use of aflibercept to treat ROP, there is a need for more research as the body of knowledge regarding this agent to treat ROP is limited.

### Vascular endothelial growth factor biology: clinical implications for ocular treatments [^114NdQCk]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

Decades of research on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have reached fruition with the recent development of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments for exudative age-related macular degeneration. VEGF is a critical regulator of angiogenesis and vascular permeability with diverse roles, both pathological and physiological, during development and adulthood. The aim of this article is to review aspects of VEGF biology that may be relevant to the clinical use of anti-VEGF agents in ophthalmology: molecular characteristics and isoforms of VEGF; its roles in vasculogenesis, vascular maintenance and angiogenesis; systemic effects of VEGF inhibition; and properties of current anti-VEGF agents.
