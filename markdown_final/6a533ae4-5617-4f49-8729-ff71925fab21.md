## Question

Treponema pallidum antibodies

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how Treponema pallidum antibodies are detected, interpreted, and used in syphilis diagnosis and management, including the roles of nontreponemal and treponemal assays, algorithms, special populations, and limitations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the two distinct antibody types and their biological basis. Then, I should verify the performance characteristics by disease stage and the implications of the serologic window period. Next, I will review traditional versus reverse screening algorithms and when to add a second treponemal test. After that, I need to check how to interpret discordant results and how to monitor treatment with nontreponemal titers. I will then consider special populations such as HIV, pregnancy, and neonates, followed by direct detection methods and point-of-care options. Finally, I should double-check limitations, cross-reactivity, and summarize practical recommendations with appropriate caveats and follow-up strategies.

> Let me first confirm the two antibody classes that underpin serologic diagnosis. Nontreponemal antibodies are antiphospholipid antibodies directed against lipoidal antigens released from damaged host tissues and treponemes; they are not specific to T. pallidum and are typically measured with RPR or VDRL, which are quantitative and useful for screening and treatment monitoring, though they can be falsely positive in other conditions and may be nonreactive very early or very late in infection [^112Ugc9y] [^114KDEjc]. Treponemal antibodies are specific to T. pallidum proteins and are detected by assays such as TPPA, FTA-ABS, EIAs, and chemiluminescence immunoassays; they usually appear earlier than nontreponemal antibodies and, once positive, tend to persist for life, which means they cannot by themselves distinguish active from past or treated infection [^115Kq5vW] [^111A1xNN].

> Wait, let me verify performance by stage before drawing conclusions. In primary syphilis, nontreponemal tests have lower sensitivity, roughly 62–78% for RPR/VDRL, and treponemal immunoassays vary from about 78–96% depending on the platform, with TPPA outperforming FTA-ABS in several studies; this is precisely why early infections can be seronegative and why repeat testing is advised if suspicion remains high [^1123GK4A] [^112M4C94] [^117Q76ue]. In secondary syphilis, both treponemal and nontreponemal tests are highly sensitive, often near 100%, reflecting robust antibody production, whereas in latent and tertiary disease, treponemal tests remain sensitive while nontreponemal titers may wane or become nonreactive, especially after treatment or in late disease [^112dmXW2] [^115QC6bc].

> Hold on, I should verify the window period and seroconversion dynamics. Treponemal assays can turn positive within about 1–2 weeks after the appearance of a chancre, whereas nontreponemal tests may lag and remain nonreactive for up to 3–4 weeks; thus, a negative serology early after exposure does not exclude syphilis, and repeating testing in 2–4 weeks is prudent when clinical suspicion persists [^115QC6bc] [^1146BUgA]. I need to ensure I also note that very early treatment can blunt seroconversion, so PCR on lesions or IgM immunoblotting may be needed in that scenario to avoid false reassurance from negative serology [^116csVhc] [^113K6iuT].

> Next, I should review the traditional algorithm and confirm its strengths and weaknesses. The traditional approach screens with a nontreponemal test such as RPR or VDRL and confirms reactive results with a treponemal assay like TPPA or FTA-ABS; this aligns with historical practice and public health workflows, but it can miss some early cases and requires timely confirmatory testing to avoid patients being lost to follow-up [^1129u9xF] [^1149BTkr]. Let me double-check that CDC still accepts both traditional and reverse algorithms, which it does, emphasizing that laboratories should ensure linkage of results across steps to avoid delays in management and reporting [^114jpsPm] [^1129u9xF].

> Now, I will examine the reverse sequence algorithm and its trade-offs. Reverse algorithms begin with an automated treponemal immunoassay (EIA/CIA), followed by a quantitative nontreponemal test to assess activity; if discordant (treponemal positive, nontreponemal negative), a second, different treponemal test is recommended to adjudicate, with TPPA preferred for its specificity and performance in primary disease [^116SqG79] [^112QUEjQ]. I should confirm that reverse algorithms can improve detection of early and latent infection but may yield more isolated reactive treponemal results in low-prevalence settings, necessitating careful clinical correlation and, at times, repeat testing or direct detection methods [^111A1xNN] [^112jtvvN].

> Let me consider how to interpret discordant results, and I should double-check common pitfalls. A reactive treponemal screen with a nonreactive nontreponemal test and negative confirmatory treponemal assay usually reflects a false-positive screen, but it could also represent very early infection before nontreponemal seroconversion; repeating serology in 2–4 weeks and reviewing prior treatment history are essential next steps [^1146BUgA] [^111A1xNN]. Conversely, a reactive nontreponemal with negative treponemal tests suggests a biologic false-positive, though again, early infection remains possible; in such cases, repeat testing and clinical correlation are warranted, and I should remember that HIV can increase biologic false-positive rates for nontreponemal tests, albeit interpretation remains the same [^1113UeFp] [^1146BUgA].

> I need to ensure I am precise about treatment monitoring. Nontreponemal titers are the mainstay for following response; an appropriate fourfold decline (for example, from 1:32 to 1:8) is expected 6–12 months after therapy depending on stage, and clinicians should use the same nontreponemal assay over time because titers are method-dependent and not interchangeable [^111KjkLu] [^112dRLSz] [^114jpsPm]. But wait, what if the patient is serofast with persistent low-level RPR reactivity? That can occur in a minority after adequate therapy, so trends and clinical context matter more than a single static titer, and treponemal tests should not be used to monitor treatment because they usually remain positive for life [^115kRHaF] [^115Kq5vW].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with HIV. I initially thought treponemal tests might perform differently in HIV, but hold on, I should verify. Current guidance indicates treponemal and nontreponemal tests are interpreted the same regardless of HIV status, even though serologic responses can occasionally be atypical or delayed, and biologic false-positive nontreponemal results may be more frequent in some untreated or advanced HIV contexts, so if serology and clinical findings disagree, presumptive treatment with close follow-up is reasonable [^1113UeFp] [^112AuSfq]. I should also remember to consider prozone phenomenon in high-titer secondary syphilis and dilute samples if clinically suspected to avoid false negatives [^112AuSfq].

> For pregnancy and congenital syphilis, I need to check that screening recommendations align with public health priorities. Universal screening is recommended in pregnancy, and interpretation of maternal and neonatal serologies must integrate timing of infection, treatment history, and comparative nontreponemal titers; maternal treponemal antibodies transfer transplacentally, so neonatal diagnosis relies on nontreponemal titers that are at least fourfold higher than the maternal titer or on direct detection methods when available [^112WApK2]. Let me reconsider the role of direct detection here; PCR on neonatal or placental specimens can be helpful in select scenarios, but availability and validation vary, so coordination with pediatric infectious disease specialists is prudent [^116D27js].

> I will now examine direct detection methods and their limitations. Dark-field microscopy of lesion exudate has 75–100% sensitivity in primary syphilis but requires immediate, expert evaluation and appropriate lesions, while direct fluorescent antibody tests offer similar sensitivity with better specimen stability but lack FDA-cleared reagents in the US, limiting access [^116D27js] [^112A6ihd]. NAATs on lesion swabs can detect T. pallidum before seroconversion and have sensitivities around 75–95% in primary lesions, but whole-blood NAATs have lower sensitivity and no FDA-cleared assays are available, so their use remains adjunctive and setting-dependent [^111zBbge] [^117Kc1Hx]. Hold on, I should verify that some guidelines still recommend molecular testing on lesions when available; yes, European and UK guidance endorse lesion NAAT where feasible to strengthen early diagnosis [^116WcRNP].

> Let me review point-of-care options and their performance. The FDA-cleared Syphilis Health Check has pooled sensitivity around 87–99% and specificity around 96–97% depending on study design, and its performance improves when combined with nontreponemal testing in algorithms; dual HIV–syphilis POC tests also show good concordance with laboratory standards and can expand screening access, though confirmatory testing remains necessary [^115B2Ge6] [^113ZPf9a] [^1135SpPX]. I should confirm that CLIA-waived status applies to specific products and that quality assurance and training are required even in waived settings, which CDC emphasizes [^1135SpPX].

> I should double-check key limitations and cross-reactivity issues to avoid overcalling positives. Treponemal assays can cross-react with other treponemal infections such as yaws, bejel, and pinta, and isolated reactive treponemal chemiluminescence results can reflect true remote infection, seroreversion of older treponemal assays, or false positives; thus, a second treponemal test and clinical history are critical before labeling someone as having had syphilis [^115Kq5vW] [^113DG5HJ]. Nontreponemal false positives can occur with autoimmune disease, acute viral infections, and pregnancy, so quantitative titers and clinical correlation help distinguish biologic false positives from true infection, especially when treponemal tests are negative [^112Ugc9y].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations and ensure internal consistency. Use an algorithm that combines treponemal and nontreponemal testing, either traditional or reverse, and ensure timely linkage of results. If reverse screening is used, add a second treponemal test when discordant and interpret in clinical context, repeating serology in 2–4 weeks if early infection is suspected [^116SqG79] [^1129u9xF]. Monitor treatment with serial nontreponemal titers using the same assay and expect at least a fourfold decline by 6–12 months depending on stage, recognizing that serofast responses can occur and that treponemal tests are not used for follow-up [^111KjkLu] [^112dRLSz] [^114jpsPm]. In HIV, interpret tests the same but maintain a lower threshold for presumptive treatment if serology and clinical findings diverge, and consider prozone if secondary syphilis is suspected with unexpectedly negative nontreponemal results [^1113UeFp] [^112AuSfq]. In pregnancy, screen universally and coordinate maternal–neonatal serologies with treatment history; in neonates, use comparative nontreponemal titers or direct detection when available to diagnose or exclude congenital infection [^112WApK2].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed the core question about T. pallidum antibodies directly. Treponema pallidum infection elicits two antibody responses that clinicians must measure and interpret together: treponemal antibodies that are highly specific and usually lifelong, and nontreponemal antibodies that reflect disease activity and decline with successful therapy; no single serologic test suffices for diagnosis across all stages, which is why algorithms, clinical correlation, and, when indicated, direct detection or repeat testing are essential to avoid misclassification and to guide appropriate treatment and public health actions [^115Kq5vW] [^112dmXW2].

---

Treponema pallidum antibodies are detected by **treponemal tests** (TPPA, FTA-ABS, EIAs/CIAs) that are highly specific and usually persist for life, indicating current or past infection but not activity [^115Kq5vW] [^1113UeFp]. Nontreponemal tests (RPR, VDRL) detect antibodies to lipoidal antigens, are **quantitative**, and reflect disease activity; they typically decline after treatment and are used to monitor response [^112Ugc9y] [^112dRLSz]. No single test is sufficient; **algorithms combining treponemal and nontreponemal assays** are required for accurate diagnosis and staging [^114KDEjc] [^114jpsPm]. Treponemal tests can be positive after treatment, so **nontreponemal titers are essential** for monitoring therapy [^112dRLSz] [^114jpsPm]. False positives/negatives and biological false positives can occur, especially in low-prevalence settings or with other conditions; **clinical correlation and repeat testing** are recommended when results are discordant or suspicion remains high [^111A1xNN] [^1146BUgA].

---

## Types of treponemal antibodies

Treponemal antibodies are **classified** by the antigens they target:

- **Treponemal antibodies**: Specific to T. pallidum antigens (e.g. TPPA, FTA-ABS, EIAs/CIAs); typically persist for life after infection [^115Kq5vW] [^111A1xNN].

- **Nontreponemal antibodies**: Target lipoidal antigens (cardiolipin-lecithin-cholesterol complexes); quantitative and reflect disease activity; usually decline after treatment [^112Ugc9y] [^111KjkLu].

---

## Diagnostic tests for detecting treponemal antibodies

Several **diagnostic tests** are available to detect treponemal antibodies:

| **Test type** | **Examples** | **Description** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Treponemal tests | - TPPA <br/> - FTA-ABS <br/> - EIAs <br/> - CIAs | Highly specific for T. pallidum; detect IgG/IgM | - Confirmatory <br/> - Identify current/past infection [^115Kq5vW] [^114KDEjc] |
| Nontreponemal tests | - RPR <br/> - VDRL | Quantitative; reflect disease activity | - Screening <br/> - Monitor treatment response [^112Ugc9y] [^112dRLSz] |
| Rapid point-of-care tests | - Syphilis Health Check <br/> - DPP HIV-Syphilis | Rapid detection of treponemal antibodies | Screening in resource-limited settings [^111r8rfJ] |

---

## Clinical significance of treponemal antibodies

Treponemal antibodies have distinct **clinical significance**:

- **Persistence**: Treponemal antibodies persist after treatment, so they cannot distinguish active from past infection [^115Kq5vW] [^1113UeFp].

- **Monitoring treatment**: Nontreponemal titers decline after successful therapy, making them useful for monitoring response [^112Ugc9y] [^112dRLSz].

- **False positives/negatives**: Biological false positives can occur, especially in low-prevalence settings or with other conditions; clinical correlation is essential [^111A1xNN] [^1146BUgA].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Several **limitations and challenges** exist in detecting and interpreting treponemal antibodies:

- **Window period**: Seroconversion can take 2–4 weeks after exposure, causing false negatives early in infection [^115QC6bc] [^1129u9xF].

- **Persistence**: Treponemal antibodies persist, complicating interpretation of past vs. current infection [^115Kq5vW] [^115QC6bc].

- **False positives**: Occur in low-prevalence settings or with other conditions; confirmatory testing is required [^111A1xNN] [^1146BUgA].

- **HIV coinfection**: Serologic responses may be atypical, requiring careful interpretation [^1113UeFp] [^112AuSfq].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **algorithmic testing** — combining treponemal and nontreponemal tests — to improve diagnostic accuracy and staging [^114KDEjc] [^114jpsPm]. Treponemal tests are preferred for **confirmatory testing** because of their high specificity [^115Kq5vW] [^112dmXW2]. Nontreponemal titers are used to **monitor treatment response**, with a fourfold decline indicating successful therapy [^112Ugc9y] [^112dRLSz].

---

Treponema pallidum antibodies are central to syphilis diagnosis, with treponemal tests confirming infection and nontreponemal tests gauging activity and treatment response. Accurate diagnosis and management require **combined algorithms** and clinical correlation.

Point-of-Care Serologic Testing

Because the syphilis algorithm might require confirmatory or other reflex testing, laboratory-based serologic testing for syphilis might take 3–5 days and might require patients to return to the clinic for follow-up or treatment. An accurate POC serologic antibody test for syphilis can shorten the time to treatment because the infection could be identified at the time of the visit or encounter. Studies evaluating the performance of POC syphilis serologic tests include traditional or reverse algorithms that use nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal laboratory-based serologic tests as reference standards (Supplementary Table 7). Multiple POC syphilis serologic tests or dual POC serologic tests are available and used internationally for HIV and syphilis; however, only the Syphilis Health Check (Diagnostics Direct) and Dual Path Platform (DPP) HIV-Syphilis Assay (Chembio Diagnostics) are FDA cleared and CLIA waived for the detection of T. pallidum antibodies. Physician office laboratories and public health field-based screening programs that offer CLIA-waived tests are required to have and maintain a CLIA certificate of waiver that requires these tests to be quality assured and operated by trained personnel according to manufacturer instructions.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syphilis, more specifically with respect to confirmatory testing, IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that chemiluminescence immunoassay and treponemal enzyme immunoassay have suboptimal specificity, resulting in a low positive predictive value in low-prevalence population. Obtain additional reflex confirmatory testing by Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test or Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test if chemiluminescence immunoassay or treponemal enzyme immunoassay tests are used.

### Novel point-of-care test for simultaneous detection of nontreponemal and treponemal antibodies in patients with syphilis [^112A9Cbg]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

We describe a point-of-care immunochromatographic test for the simultaneous detection of both nontreponemal and treponemal antibodies in the sera of patients with syphilis that acts as both a screening and a confirmatory test. A total of 1,601 banked serum samples were examined by the dual test, and the results were compared to those obtained using a quantitative rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test and the Treponema pallidum passive particle agglutination (TP-PA) assay. Compared to the RPR test, the reactive concordance of the dual test nontreponemal line was 98.4% when the RPR titers of sera were ≥ 1:2 and the nonreactive concordance was 98.6%. Compared to the TP-PA assay, the reactive and nonreactive concordances of the treponemal line were 96.5% and 95.5%, respectively. These results indicate that the dual test could be used for the serological diagnosis of syphilis in primary health care clinics or resource-poor settings and therefore improve rates of treatment where patients may fail to return for their laboratory results.

### Evaluation of elecsys syphilis assay for routine and blood screening and detection of early infection [^116bsitj]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Treponema pallidum infections can have severe complications if not diagnosed and treated at an early stage. Screening and diagnosis of syphilis require assays with high specificity and sensitivity. The Elecsys Syphilis assay is an automated treponemal immunoassay for the detection of antibodies against T. pallidum The performance of this assay was investigated previously in a multicenter study. The current study expands on that evaluation in a variety of diagnostic settings and patient populations, at seven independent laboratories. The samples included routine diagnostic samples, blood donation samples, samples from patients with confirmed HIV infections, samples from living organ or bone marrow donors, and banked samples, including samples previously confirmed as syphilis positive. This study also investigated the seroconversion sensitivity of the assay. With a total of 1,965 syphilis-negative routine diagnostic samples and 5,792 syphilis-negative samples collected from blood donations, the Elecsys Syphilis assay had specificity values of 99.85% and 99.86%, respectively. With 333 samples previously identified as syphilis positive, the sensitivity was 100% regardless of disease stage. The assay also showed 100% sensitivity and specificity with samples from 69 patients coinfected with HIV. The Elecsys Syphilis assay detected infection in the same bleed or earlier, compared with comparator assays, in a set of sequential samples from a patient with primary syphilis. In archived serial blood samples collected from 14 patients with direct diagnoses of primary syphilis, the Elecsys Syphilis assay detected T. pallidum antibodies for 3 patients for whom antibodies were not detected with the Architect Syphilis TP assay, indicating a trend for earlier detection of infection, which may have the potential to shorten the time between infection and reactive screening test results.

### How to interpret syphilis testing [^111YmFtC]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Rates of syphilis, including congenital syphilis, have been rising worldwide. Syphilis is particularly difficult to diagnose given its non-specific symptoms and the inability to culture Treponema pallidum on regular media. Therefore, various diagnostic methods and complementary testing algorithms have been devised with the aim of accurately diagnosing syphilis. These diagnostic methods include direct detection techniques, useful in diagnosing early primary syphilis before seroconversion, and serological testing divided into treponemal (TT) and non-treponemal (NTT) tests. TTs detect Treponema pallidum -specific antibodies but cannot differentiate active from past infections, while NTT titres correlate with disease activity. In neonates being evaluated for congenital syphilis, maternal antibody transfer complicates this interpretation, necessitating careful correlation with clinical findings and maternal history. We explore these aforementioned tests with cases highlighting how they can be used and interpreted in different clinical scenarios.

### Origins of syphilis and management in the immunocompetent patient: facts and controversies [^114CN4GA]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the continued efficacy of penicillin since the 1940s, many aspects of the natural history, diagnosis, and management of syphilis remain controversial. A key factor among the numerous factors explaining the persistence of significant areas of controversies is the absence of a gold standard direct method for distinguishing between the different stages of syphilis and appraising treatment response. This contribution presents an overview of some of the most debated aspects of the origins, diagnosis, and management of syphilis in immunocompetent patients. The two main current hypotheses on the origins of Treponema pallidum are the "Columbian" and the "Pre-Columbian" hypotheses. Strong evidence supports that Columbus' crew brought T pallidum to Europe at the time of discovery of the New World. Because T pallidum culture and inoculation to animals are not readily available methods, the gold standard method for the diagnosis of syphilis is the direct identification of T pallidum by dark field microscopy or direct fluorescent antibody tests. These methods, however, are inapplicable in many patients, and thus the diagnosis of syphilis is usually based on the clinical and serologic picture. Serologic tests should only be considered as surrogate markers of the disease and do not provide definite distinction between syphilis stages. The optimal combination of serologic tests is still undefined. Other areas of controversy include the identification of patients who would benefit from a lumbar puncture, the diagnostic criteria of neurosyphilis, and the most relevant markers of treatment response.

### Clinical test performance of a rapid point-of-care syphilis treponemal antibody test: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115B2Ge6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We reviewed relevant syphilis diagnostic literature and conducted a meta-analysis to address the question, "What is the sensitivity and specificity of the Syphilis Health Check, a rapid qualitative test for the detection of human antibodies to Treponema pallidum". The Syphilis Health Check is the only rapid syphilis test currently cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis using Bayesian bivariate random-effects and fixed-effect models to create pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the Syphilis Health Check. We identified 5 test evaluations published in the literature and 10 studies submitted to the FDA and for a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments waiver application. The pooled sensitivity (95% CI) from the laboratory evaluations (n = 5) was 98.5% (92.1–100%), while pooled specificity was 95.9% (81.5–100.0%). The pooled sensitivity for prospective studies (n = 10) was 87.7% (71.8–97.2%), while pooled specificity was 96.7% (91.9–99.2%). Using nontreponemal supplemental testing, the sensitivity improved to a pooled sensitivity of 97.0% (94.8–98.6%). The Syphilis Health Check may provide accurate detection of treponemal antibody.

### Antibody responses elicited against the Treponema pallidum repeat proteins differ during infection with different isolates of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum [^113H9RGA]. Infection and Immunity (2003). Low credibility.

Variation in the expression of the different Tpr proteins in the syphilis spirochete, Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, may have important implications in its ability to evade host immune detection and cause persistent infection. In the present study we examined the pattern of antibody responsiveness to different Tpr members during infection with three isolates of T. pallidum. There was variability in the specificities and temporal patterns of reactivity of the antibodies elicited against the individual Tpr proteins, suggesting that isolates may express different repertoires of Tpr proteins during infection.

### Serological testing for syphilis in the differential diagnosis of cognitive decline and polyneuropathy in geriatric patients [^114fkdsg]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

In 42 of 4116 patients (1.0%, 32 women, 10 men), TP-ECLIA detected antibodies directed against TP in serum (Table 1, Fig. 1). In general, TP-specific antibody concentrations in TP-ECLIA were low (median = 2.75 AU/ml, 25th/75th percentile 1.5/4.88 AU/ml). All patients with detectable TP-specific antibodies in serum had cognitive impairment or distal-symmetric neuropathy. 37 patients with TP-specific antibodies either suffered from mild cognitive impairment or dementia, and 26 patients presented with distal-symmetric neuropathy. 5 patients with a positive TP-ECLIA had only neuropathy. The principal reasons for testing in patients with a positive TP-ECLIA are listed in Table 1. MMST scores were available in 33 patients (median 18, 25th/75th percentile 13.5/24) (normal values ≥ 27).

Treponemal and non-treponemal testing

Specific tests react to treponemal antibodies against spirochaetes and include; fluorescent treponemal-antibody absorption (FTA ABS), Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay (TPHA), Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA), microhaemagglutination assay for antibodies to Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP), and Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay (TP-EIA). They remain positive for life following infection and remain positive after successful treatment. A positive result does not inform the recency or activity of infection. False-positive results can occur from other inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or from other infections especially other spirocheteal infections such as yaws, bejel and pinta.

Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and VDRL are non-specific tests that detect cardiolipin antibodies produced in response to cardiolipin-cholesterol lecithin antigen in active syphilis infection. These tests are read by dilutional titration, decrease following treatment and increase with active infection. Usually a 4x fold titre decrease/increase is a significant result as a halving or doubling could result from reader interpretational error. With appropriate treatment, titres typically return to non-reactive or occasionally to a long term low titre (Fig. 12).

Fig. 12
Graph depicting serological testing reactivity during the natural history of syphilis infection.

Treponemal specific tests react to treponemal antibodies which once positive remain so for life (although there will be no reaction the first few weeks of primary infection). Non-treponemal testing react in response to cardiolipin-cholesterol lecithin antigen in active syphilis infection. With adequate treatment titres will normally return to a non-reactive level. Again, there may be no reactive result in early infection. (Permissions from Ghanem, Ram, and Rice 2020, NEJM).

False negative results may occur with non-treponemal testing, especially in early primary/acute infection, and patients may need re-testing two weeks after initial presentation. False-positive non-treponemal testing can occur with infections such as tuberculosis, rickettsia and leprosy, in endocarditis and during pregnancy.

Availability of specific assays varies and it is critical that clinicians liaise with their local Infectious Disease physicians and laboratories to determine the available tests and their interpretation.

### Significance of isolated reactive treponemal chemiluminescence immunoassay results [^113DG5HJ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Isolated reactive serum treponemal chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA) specimens cause clinical uncertainty.

Methods

Sera were screened by CIA, and reactive samples underwent reflex testing with rapid plasma reagin (RPR), Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA), and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA Abs) assays. Samples reactive only on the CIA were deemed "isolated" reactive CIA samples. We undertook detailed review of a subset of subjects with isolated reactive CIA specimens.

Results

Of 28 261 specimens, 1171 (4.1%) were reactive on CIA, of which 133 (11.3%) had isolated CIA reactivity. Most subjects (66 of 82 [80.5%]) with isolated reactive CIA specimens were from high-prevalence populations. We found evidence of CIA, TPPA, and FTA Abs seroreversion. The median chemiluminescent signal-to-cutoff ratio was similar for isolated reactive CIA sera and sera that were reactive on either FTA Abs or TPPA assays (2.19 vs 2.32; p = 0.15) but lower than for sera reactive on both FTA Abs and TPPA assays (12.37; P < .001) or for sera reactive on RPR assays (25.53; P < .001). A total of 11 of 20 patients (55%) with an isolated reactive CIA specimen who underwent medical record review had previous or subsequent evidence of syphilis infection.

Conclusions

Isolated reactive CIA specimens may represent true T. pallidum infection and may be found after seroreversion of traditional treponemal assays.

### It is time to use treponema-specific antibody screening tests for diagnosis of syphilis [^116VwAbu]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Assays that detect treponema-specific antibodies, which are either automated or can be done as point-of-care tests, have been developed, some of which are FDA approved. These assays have the advantage of being easily performed and demonstrate high sensitivity, both key features of an infectious disease screening test. As a result, many high-volume clinical laboratories have begun to offer a reverse syphilis testing algorithm where a treponema-specific test is used for screening, followed by a nontreponemal test (i.e., rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) to assess disease activity and treatment status. Concerns about physicians being able to understand and apply this new testing algorithm have been expressed (8). In this point-counterpoint, Michael Loeffelholz of the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston explains why his laboratory has adopted this reverse algorithmic approach. Matthew Binnicker of the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, explains why the reverse algorithm may not be suitable for all clinical laboratories and every clinical situation.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^114KDEjc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

This report provides new CDC recommendations for tests that can support a diagnosis of syphilis, including serologic testing and methods for the identification of the causative agent Treponema pallidum. These comprehensive recommendations are the first published by CDC on laboratory testing for syphilis, which has traditionally been based on serologic algorithms to detect a humoral immune response to T. pallidum. These tests can be divided into nontreponemal and treponemal tests depending on whether they detect antibodies that are broadly reactive to lipoidal antigens shared by both host and T. pallidum or antibodies specific to T. pallidum, respectively. Both types of tests must be used in conjunction to help distinguish between an untreated infection or a past infection that has been successfully treated. Newer serologic tests allow for laboratory automation but must be used in an algorithm, which also can involve older manual serologic tests. Direct detection of T. pallidum continues to evolve from microscopic examination of material from lesions for visualization of T. pallidum to molecular detection of the organism. Limited point-of-care tests for syphilis are available in the United States; increased availability of point-of-care tests that are sensitive and specific could facilitate expansion of screening programs and reduce the time from test result to treatment. These recommendations are intended for use by clinical laboratory directors, laboratory staff, clinicians, and disease control personnel who must choose among the multiple available testing methods, establish standard operating procedures for collecting and processing specimens, interpret test results for laboratory reporting, and counsel and treat patients. Future revisions to these recommendations will be based on new research or technologic advancements for syphilis clinical laboratory science.

### Syphilis pathogenesis: host immune response vs pathogen immune evasion [^111mSzKF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum, remains a significant global health problem despite being preventable and curable. The pathogen's ability to evade the immune system by using virulence factor-based strategies and invading immune-privileged sites enables persistent infection in the untreated host. This translational update describes the host innate and adaptive immune responses in syphilis and the sophisticated mechanisms employed by T. pallidum to avoid immune clearance. Recent advances in immune profiling have enhanced our understanding of the host immune response and identified potential biomarkers for disease staging and treatment monitoring. However, knowledge gaps remain regarding T. pallidum 's immune evasion mechanisms, the dynamics of cellular and humoral immunity, and the characteristics of long-term protective immune responses against T. pallidum. Bridging these gaps by integrating microbiology, immunology, and multiomics approaches is crucial for advancing diagnostic tools, therapeutic strategies, and vaccine development to ultimately reduce the global burden of syphilis.

Principles for Syphilis Diagnosis

Indications for syphilis testing include identification of individual, population, or community risk factors for exposure to T. pallidum; signs and symptoms suggestive of syphilis; or a known sexual contact of someone who has syphilis. The selection of laboratory tests and interpretation of results vary by stage of syphilis and previous treatment history. After diagnosis and staging has occurred, benzathine penicillin G is the recommended therapy for clinical resolution of infection and avoidance of sequelae. Patients with a history of penicillin allergy should be managed according to CDC's Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines, 2021.

Testing for syphilis is based on the detection of reactive antibodies (typically in serum or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]), suggestive of exposure to T. pallidum; direct observation of the organism by darkfield or fluorescent microscopy of lesion fluids or exudate; or histologic assessment of infected tissues or amplification of T. pallidum- specific nucleic acid sequences in fluids, exudate, or tissue biopsy material. Conventional microscopy used to examine Gram-stained smears is insufficient to visualize T. pallidum because of the bacterium's slender morphology and poor uptake of aniline dyes. No available nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are cleared by FDA for marketing in the United States, and culture for T. pallidum is cumbersome and is available only in selected research laboratories. Nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests are most suitable for screening or diagnosis in conjunction with a medical history and physical examination when antibody titers are important to determine recent exposure to infection, a presumptive diagnosis in persons with signs or symptoms suggestive of syphilis, or to determine response to treatment.

INTRODUCTION

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum. In 2019, the estimated global prevalence of syphilis was 49.7 million, a 61% increase from 1990. Rates of syphilis have risen significantly in many high- and middle-income countries over the past decade. In England, notifications more than doubled between 2013 and 2022 (6.2–15.4 per 100,000), while they more than tripled in Australia and the United States (US) (7.6–24.3 per 100,000 and 5.5–17.7 per 100,000, respectively). Rates of congenital syphilis have also surged, with a 755% increase reported in the US between 2012 and 2021. Syphilis can present with numerous symptoms and lead to severe conditions including neurosyphilis. In pregnancy, syphilis infection can be transmitted vertically, causing neonatal morbidity and mortality.

Serological testing is the primary method for diagnosing syphilis, involving multiple tests to screen, confirm, and stage the infection. The reverse screening algorithm is commonly used in high-volume laboratories. This algorithm begins with a sensitive treponemal antibody immunoassay. If this assay is positive, it is followed by non-treponemal antibody tests. If the treponemal and non-treponemal results are discordant, a second confirmatory treponemal test is performed. In the United Kingdom and Australia, if the screening treponemal antibody result is positive, national guidelines recommend concurrent performance of non-treponemal and treponemal tests. The Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay is considered the preferred assay for confirmatory treponemal testing in international guidelines. However, due to regulatory restrictions, this test has been withdrawn from some regions, including Europe and Australia. This has necessitated rapid updates to guidelines and evaluations of alternative tests and diagnostic algorithms. Although the TPPA remains available in other regions including the US, there is currently only one TPPA manufacturer worldwide. As such, there are potential weaknesses in the supply chain for this important test.

### Pulmonary syphilis with a cicatricial variant of organizing pneumonia: a case report [^111ZrXvs]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In many cases, syphilis is strongly suspected, requiring appropriate initial testing. However, diagnosis of cases that have no clinical suspicion of syphilis is difficult. T. pallidum culture is difficult and is usually used only in clinical or basic research. Therefore, serum data are used to diagnose syphilis in clinical practice. The conventional serological testing algorithm for syphilis involves initial screening with a non-treponemal test (e.g. RPR). Non-treponemal reactivity testing is then confirmed with a treponemal test such as fluorescent treponemal antibody absorptiometry. In this case, a discrepancy was observed, with a positive treponemal test and a negative non-treponemal test. False-positive treponemal tests can also be seen in a variety of other diseases, including spirochete infections, malaria, and leprosy. In a report from New York, 3% of 116,822 specimens for first screening with a treponemal test and then retesting reactive results with a non-treponemal test were discordant. Discordant results are often observed in patients with a history of successful syphilis treatment. For patients without a history of treated syphilis, a discordant result can occur in very early-stage syphilis or in cases with a prozone phenomenon; in late-stage syphilis when non-treponemal tests have become nonreactive over time; and in patients with advanced immunosuppression (e.g. patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), which is thought to reflect B-cell failure during late-stage HIV infection.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^116SqG79]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Laboratory diagnosis of syphilis has traditionally involved an algorithm beginning with a nontreponemal test (eg, rapid plasma regain [RPR]) followed by a manual Treponema pallidum– specific assay (eg, T. pallidum particle agglutination assay [TP-PA]) for confirmation of reactive nontreponemal serology. Currently, various treponemal-specific immunoassays are increasingly being used for syphilis screening and diagnosis, including enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIAs), and microbead immunoassays (MBIAs), among others. These assays can be automated, reducing labor and turnaround time. Because some of these assays are relatively nonspecific, a reverse-sequence algorithm has been employed beginning with a treponemal immunoassay, followed by reflex nontreponemal testing (eg, RPR) on initially reactive specimens. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends conducting a TP-PA if there are discordant results between the immunoassay and RPR (eg, EIA-reactive, RPR-nonreactive). Regardless of which algorithm is used, for laboratories to select the most appropriate treponemal test(s) it is important to consider the sensitivity and specificity of these assays in clinically characterized sera, stratified by stage of syphilis.

We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the test performance of treponemal-specific tests, and results of this review were presented to a national consultation of experts in November 2017. Our review was based on a single key question: What is the sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal tests currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the diagnosis of syphilis (by stage)? Our objective of this review was to inform the selection of the appropriate confirmatory treponemal test for laboratories using the traditional algorithm. These data will assist laboratories in their selection of an initial treponemal test when the reverse sequence algorithm is used for diagnosis of syphilis. Additionally, the data will facilitate selection of the appropriate second treponemal test for patients with initially discordant treponemal and nontreponemal serology (eg, CIA-reactive, RPR-nonreactive).

### Refining timely diagnosis of early syphilis by using Treponema pallidum PCR or IgM immunoblotting next to conventional serology for syphilis [^113K6iuT]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

subsp. pallidum is a fastidious spirochete and the etiologic agent of syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Syphilis diagnoses and disease staging are based on clinical findings and serologic testing. Moreover, according to most international guidelines, PCR analysis of swab samples from genital ulcers is included in the screening algorithm where possible. It has been suggested that PCR might be omitted from the screening algorithm due to low added value. As an alternative to PCR, IgM serology might be used. In this study, we wanted to establish the added value of PCR and IgM serology for diagnosing primary syphilis. Added value was defined as finding more cases of syphilis, preventing overtreatment, or limiting the extent of partner notification to more recent partners. We found that both PCR and IgM immunoblotting could aid the timely diagnosis of early syphilis in ~24% to 27% of patients. PCR has the greatest sensitivity and can be applied to cases with an ulcer with suspected reinfection or primary infection. In the absence of lesions, the IgM immunoblot could be used. However, the IgM immunoblot has better performance in cases with suspected primary infection than in reinfections. The target population, testing algorithm, time pressures, and costs should determine whether either test provides sufficient value to be implemented in clinical practice.

What about follow-up?

Because syphilis has no test-of-cure, conversion to a non-reactive RPR is the best evidence of successful treatment. Patients should be tested at the start of treatment and monitored at six and 12 months. No clinical data guide interpretation of RPR titres after treatment, and guidelines are based on expert opinion. See table 3 for recommendations from European, UK, US, Canadian, and WHO guidelines.

Each algorithm has advantages and disadvantages and both are acceptable (Table 1). The traditional algorithm might be less sensitive in detecting early or late latent syphilis, although an increase in false positives might occur when applying the reverse algorithm in low-prevalence populations. The development of antibodies that react with nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal tests might take up to 2 weeks after primary infection with T. pallidum (Figure 1). The main advantage of automated treponemal immunoassays in high-volume laboratories is increased throughput and reduced labor costs. Considerations for test and algorithm selection include cost, labor, volume of specimen test requests, throughput, laboratory space, and turnaround time. In addition, clinicians and state and local public health STD programs need nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) test results coupled with treponemal test results for timely clinical management and public health reporting. If one test result in the algorithm is delayed and needs to be coupled with the initial test by the clinician or the STD program, matching errors can occur, and clinical management and reporting can be delayed. The laboratory processing the initial screening test should ensure the second or third (if necessary) test results, especially if performed in a different laboratory, are linked with the screening test result when the report is sent to the ordering clinician and public health department.

Comparison of traditional and reverse algorithms for syphilis screening by serology — CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024

Recommendation for syphilis serologic testing algorithm. Serologic tests that measure antibodies to both nontreponemal (lipoidal) and treponemal antigens related to syphilitic infections should be used in combination, when the primary test is reactive, to aid in the diagnosis of syphilis (Box) (Figure 3). Sole reliance on one reactive serologic test result can misclassify a patient's syphilis status. Both the traditional syphilis screening algorithm (initial screening with nontreponemal [lipoidal antigen] assays) and the reverse syphilis screening algorithm (initial screening with treponemal immunoassays) are acceptable. The preferred algorithm should be based on laboratory resources, including staff, space and costs, test volume, and patient populations served.

### Evaluation of an enzyme immunoassay technique for detection of antibodies against Treponema pallidum [^113ZuaEH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

In the present study, the performance of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique (Eti-syphilis-G and Eti-syphilis-M; DiaSorin) for detection of Treponema pallidum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies for the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis was evaluated. Four hundred forty-one samples were studied. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 100 and 93%, respectively, compared with the results of a microhemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP) and 99.4 and 100%, respectively, compared with the results of the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-Abs) test. The results of the ELISA technique were concordant with those of MHA-TP for 98% of the samples tested, while the rate of concordance with the FTA-Abs test was 99.5%. The sensitivities of the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, MHA-TP, and the ELISA in the different phases of syphilis compared with the results of the FTA-Abs test were 92, 88, and 100%, respectively, for patients with primary syphilis; 100% for all tests evaluated for patients with secondary syphilis; 97.2, 99.4, and 100%, respectively, for patients with latent syphilis; and 57.9, 92.6, and 97.9%, respectively, for patients with past treated syphilis. The RPR test was reactive with 12 samples that were negative by all the specific tests. IgM antibodies were most frequently detected by the ELISA for IgM antibodies (32.8%) than by the FTA-Abs for IgM antibodies (28.4%). Detection of these antibodies by the FTA-Abs test and the ELISA for IgM antibodies decreased with the stage of disease (72 and 88%, respectively, for patients with primary syphilis to 17 and 19%, respectively, for patients with early latent syphilis). The high sensitivity and specificity of this ELISA technique during all stages of syphilis, together with the fact that it is a simple, objective, and easily automated method, lead us to believe that it could be used as a screening test for syphilis.

### Molecular and direct detection tests for Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum: a review of the literature, 1964–2017 [^115WwfNP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Direct detection methods for Treponema pallidum include dark-field microscopy (DFM), direct fluorescence antibody (DFA) testing, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Here, we reviewed the relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address 2 main questions with respect to T. pallidum direct detection techniques: "What are the performance characteristics for each direct detection test for T. pallidum and what are the optimal specimen types for each test?" and "What options are available for T. pallidum molecular epidemiology?" To answer these questions, we searched 5 electronic databases (OVID Medline, OVID Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Scopus) from 1964 to 2017 using relevant search terms and identified 1928 articles, of which 37 met our inclusion criteria. DFM and DFA sensitivities ranged from 73% to 100% in cases of primary syphilis; and while sensitivity using silver stain histopathology for T. pallidum was generally low (0%-41%), higher performance characteristics were observed for T. pallidum-specific IHC (49–92%). Different genes have been targeted by T. pallidum-specific NAATs, with the majority of studies indicating that sensitivity is primarily dependent on the type of collected biological sample, with highest sensitivity observed in primary lesion exudate (75–95%). Given the rising incidence of syphilis, the development of direct, Food and Drug Administration-cleared T. pallidum NAATs should be considered an immediate priority.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^112M4C94]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

The sensitivity of manual treponemal tests in primary syphilis has been estimated from studies that used reference standards such as darkfield microscopy (,–), clinical findings, or stored serum collected from patients staged as having primary syphilis, although the criteria used to stage the disease were not fully described (Supplementary Table 2). MHA-TP had a sensitivity of 53.0%, 72.5%, and 88.6% in studies that used darkfield microscopy as the reference standard. In studies that used stored sera collected from patients who were clinically classified as having primary syphilis, MHA-TP had a sensitivity of 45.9%, 64% and, 88.6%. A 2019 study involving 959 patients, 55 of whom were classified as having primary syphilis (on the basis of serology, physical findings, and positive or negative darkfield microscopy) reported a sensitivity of 78.2% (95% CI = 65.0%–88.2%) and 94.5% (95% CI = 84.9%–98.9%) for FTA-ABS and TPPA, respectively. Other studies with fewer patients, different reference standards, or both are more difficult to compare; sensitivities of FTA-ABS and TPPA have ranged from 88.4% to 100% and 86.2% to 100%, respectively, for primary syphilis (,–).

### Do antiborrelial antibodies suggest Lyme disease in Cuba? [^111QByV2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

ELISA has been widely used to detect antibodies to B. burgdorferi; however, this assay is not standardized, which results in different levels of sensitivity and specificity. False-positive results may occur, especially when serum samples are obtained from persons with other illnesses.

To study possible cross-reactions with other infectious illnesses, different serologic tests were applied to the positive serum samples by using ELISA. One sample was weakly reactive to human leptospirosis (indirect hemagglutination assay with erythrocyte-sensitive substance antigen [Labiofam, Havana, Cuba]), but no samples were reactive to syphilis (rapid plasma reagin [Imefa, Havana, Cuba] and hemagglutination of Treponema pallidum [Oxoid, Diagnostic Reagents, Basingstoke, UK]). No indication of other infectious diseases was found.

All serum samples positive by ELISA were also analyzed by IgG and IgM Western blotting in the spirochete laboratory at the University of Trieste, Italy. The Western blotting was performed with a protein profile from whole–cell strain PKo and by applying the criteria of positivity described by Hauser et al. Two serum samples showed clear IgM antibody bands to 41- and 23-kDa proteins. No IgG bands were observed. This test reportedly is more sensitive than ELISA for IgM detection.

We investigated the clinical manifestations of the patients with positive Western blotting. We found that one of the patients had been bitten several times by ticks and had an erythematous rash around the different bite sites; the rashes reddened and expanded over the course of a few days, with partial central clearing. The patient also had fever, hepatosplenomegaly, adenopathies, joint pain, and some nonspecific symptoms. He was given erythromycin before the laboratory results were confirmed and had a satisfactory recovery. In similar situations, repeat testing would be highly advisable. This was the same patient with low levels of antibodies to Leptospira. Investigating the symptoms of the other patient was not possible.

### Reduced Treponema pallidum-specific opsonic antibody activity in HIV-infected patients with syphilis [^111B5CMH]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals may have poorer serological responses to syphilis treatment and may be more likely to experience neurosyphilis. Treponema pallidum is cleared from sites of infection by opsonization, ingestion, and killing by macrophages.

Methods

Serum samples from 235 individuals with syphilis were tested for T. pallidum-specific opsonic activity. Blood T. pallidum concentrations were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification of the tp0574 gene, and T. pallidum was detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of 16S ribosomal RNA.

Results

Opsonic activity was higher with higher serum rapid plasma reagin titers (P < .001), and in those treated for uncomplicated syphilis before serum collection (P < .001). Opsonic activity was lower in HIV-infected than in HIV-uninfected individuals even after the above factors were taken into account (P = .006). In participants in whom blood T. pallidum was detectable, those with the highest opsonic activity had lower blood T. pallidum concentrations. In multivariable analyses, there was not a significant relationship between opsonic activity and detection of T. pallidum in CSF or CSF-VDRL reactivity.

Conclusions

Serum T. pallidum-specific opsonic activity is significantly lower in HIV-infected individuals. Impaired T. pallidum-specific immune responses could contribute to differences in the course of disease or treatment response.

### Timing of primary syphilis treatment and impact on the development of treponemal antibodies: a cross-sectional clinic-based study [^116csVhc]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Serology is negative in a proportion of primary syphilis cases where Treponema pallidum PCR testing is positive. We aimed to identify discordant, T. pallidum PCR-positive, serology-negative primary syphilis cases and any clinical or laboratory factors associated with failure to subsequently seroconvert.

Methods

Serodiscordant primary syphilis cases that were T. pallidum PCR-positive and serology-negative (including rapid plasma reagin, T. pallidum particle agglutination, T. pallidum enzyme immunoassay or T. pallidum chemiluminescence assay) were identified from the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre electronic records between April 2011 and December 2019. Clinical and laboratory associations were examined.

Results

There were 814 primary syphilis cases in the study period and 38 (4.7%) were serodiscordant, 35 in men who have sex with men. Thirty-two had follow-up serology performed a median of 24 days later, of which 16 (50%) seroconverted, mostly (81%) within 6weeks. Failure to seroconvert was significantly associated with treatment on day 1. Of the 12 cases treated on day 1, 10 (83%) failed to seroconvert compared with 6 of 20 (30%) among those who were treated after day 1.

Discussion

Earlier treatment of primary syphilis can prevent the development of serological markers. T. pallidum PCR can identify primary syphilis lesions before the development of serological markers and improve diagnosis of early primary syphilis lesions. Serology alone will miss a proportion of primary syphilis infections and should be repeated if a diagnosis of syphilis is being considered.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^113ZfvZu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We conducted a systematic review of relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question, "What is the sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal tests currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the diagnosis of syphilis (by stage)?" There were 16 treponemal assays evaluated: 13 immunoassays and 3 manual assays (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test [FTA-ABS], microhemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum antibodies [MHA-TP], Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay [TP-PA]). MHA-TP and FTA-ABS were less sensitive in primary and secondary syphilis than TP-PA; TP-PA is the most specific manual treponemal assay. There is insufficient evidence to recommend one particular treponemal immunoassay (eg, enzyme immunoassays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, microbead immunoassays) over another based on published performance data. For diagnosis of neurosyphilis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) TP-PA has similar performance to CSF FTA-ABS in studies with patients with definitive or presumptive neurosyphilis. However, CSF treponemal testing has limitations in its sensitivity and specificity and should be interpreted within the context of the clinical scenario, additional CSF test results and syphilis prevalence.

Treponemal tests target specific T. pallidum antigens, either intact or sonicated T. pallidum or defined recombinant proteins; these tests were traditionally used to confirm that a reactive nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) test is the result of T. pallidum infection. Treponemal antibodies generally persist after treatment and cannot be used to distinguish between a current infection or a previously treated infection. None of the nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) or treponemal tests can distinguish infections caused by other T. pallidum subspecies. Multiple capillary whole blood immunoassays for which the specimen is collected by skin puncture have been developed as rapid tests and might offer diagnostic utility in clinical, public health, or nonclinical settings. Direct detection tests of T. pallidum are limited to darkfield microscopic examination of lesion fluids, staining of lesion fluid or exudate smears or tissue sections obtained by biopsy for treponemal spirochetes, or amplification of specific nucleic acid sequences by validated laboratory-developed tests.

### Analytical performance characteristics of a new transcription-mediated amplification assay for Treponema pallidum [^117LWtLg]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical specimen testing showed that the assay is compatible with oropharyngeal swab, anorectal swab, and serum sample matrices, with T-time values ranging from approximately 9 to 27 min for these three specimen types, and a high overall agreement (92%) of T47 PCR with TMA for the swab specimens. While the assay is not validated to be quantitative, tight clustering of the serum specimen T-times around a mean value of 20.8 min indicates the presence of treponemes possibly at lower concentrations in these serum samples than in some of the swab-based specimens, a finding consistent with previously published reports. Our finding of a relatively low positive agreement (20% to 37%, depending on clinical stage) between RPR serological status and serum TMA results in this convenience sample of serum specimens is consistent with previous data using PCR to test serum, for which sensitivity estimates ranged from 14.7% to 50.2%.

The results presented in this report build on our prior work and demonstrate the high analytical sensitivity and specificity of TMA for the detection of, especially the absence of cross-reactivity of the assay with nonsyphilis treponemesandand the ability to detectRNA in serum. The use of PCR-based NAATs as a direct detection method for syphilis has been reported on extensively, with several studies showing that these assays can detectin seronegative persons. In our companion study to this current investigation, TMA also detected an additional 10% of syphilis infections in seronegative persons, a finding confirmed by T47 PCR testing of the same samples. Combined, these results suggest that molecular testing may be a useful adjunctive method to serological screening by enabling the detection of occult infection in the preseroconversion window period prior to the onset of symptomatic primary syphilis, as well as for persons with recently developed chancres. The asymptomatic period can last from 10 to 90 days, during which time the mucosal shedding ofcould theoretically lead to partner transmission and infection. Adding NAAT testing of mucosal swab-based samples to current serology-based screening algorithms may therefore help close the "window period gap" from initial infection to seroconversion. Although empirical evidence for this approach is currently lacking, clinicians and public health programs have sometimes employed a similar strategy for HIV screening using pooled NAAT testing. Such a strategy may be particularly useful in geographic areas or patient populations with high incidences of syphilis.

### Analysis of 3 algorithms for syphilis serodiagnosis and implications for clinical management [^112jtvvN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Algorithms for the diagnosis of syphilis continue to be a source of great controversy, and numerous test interpretations have perplexed many clinicians.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional study of 24 124 subjects to analyze 3 syphilis testing algorithms: traditional algorithm, reverse algorithm, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) algorithm. Every serum sample was simultaneously evaluated using the rapid plasma reagin, Treponema pallidum particle agglutination, and chemiluminescence immunoassay tests. With the results of clinical diagnoses of syphilis as a gold standard, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the 3 syphilis testing algorithms. The κ coefficient was used to compare the concordance between the reverse algorithm and the ECDC algorithm.

Results

Overall, 2749 patients in our cohort were diagnosed with syphilis. The traditional algorithm had the highest negative likelihood ratio (0.24), a missed diagnosis rate of 24.2%, and only 75.81% sensitivity. However, both the reverse and ECDC algorithms had higher diagnostic efficacy than the traditional algorithm. Their sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 99.38%-99.85%, 99.98%-100.00%, and 99.93%-99.96%, respectively. Moreover, the overall percentage of agreement and κ value between the reverse and the ECDC algorithms were 99.9% and 0.996, respectively.

Conclusions

Our research supported use of the ECDC algorithm, in which syphilis screening begins with a treponemal immunoassay that is followed by a second, different treponemal assay as a confirmatory test in high-prevalence populations. In addition, our results indicated that nontreponemal assay is unnecessary for syphilis diagnosis but can be recommended for determining serological activity and the effect of syphilis treatment.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^112QUEjQ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendation for serologic syphilis testing. Nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests (e.g. RPR or VDRL) are not interchangeable when used to determine antibody titers; testing on follow-up samples must be performed with the same type of test (Box). The TPPA test is the preferred manual treponemal test.

Comment and evidence summary. Sensitivity and specificity estimates of RPR and VDRL were similar but not exact in head-to-head studies and studies that used similar reference standards (–, –, –). When assessing changes in antibody titers using nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests, it is critical that the same test be used because titers are used by clinicians to classify the infection status of a patient and follow treatment response. A recent study with 959 patients estimated the sensitivity of FTA-ABS and TPPA to be 78.2% and 94.5%, respectively, when testing specimens from patients with primary syphilis. Two studies that tested specimens from patients with secondary syphilis reported a sensitivity of 92.8%–95.0% compared with 100% for TPPA. Many automated treponemal immunoassays are similar in sensitivity, and certain ones are slightly less specific when compared with the manual TPPA, except for the Trep-Sure test which has inferior specificity. Among the other immunoassays, data are insufficient to recommend one assay based on test performance.

### Highlighting a potential pitfall: positive Treponema pallidum immunohistochemical stain in a patient without syphilis [^112ZhcS1]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2019). Medium credibility.

The Treponema pallidum antibody immunohistochemical (IHC) stain has improved our ability to detect the organism histologically. We present a case of a man with genital condyloma acuminatum with a positive T. pallidum IHC stain but negative T. pallidum serologies and no syphilitic symptoms. It has been shown that the T. pallidum antibody IHC can cross-react, staining other spirochetes, including Borrelia burgdorferi and the Brachyspira family of intestinal spirochetes. Because of the proximity of our patient's lesions to the anus, and the persistently negative T. pallidum serologies, we believe nontreponemal spirochetes colonized the condyloma, giving a false-positive T. pallidum IHC. This cross-reactivity is a potential diagnostic pitfall and is important for the dermatopathologist to recognize, thereby avoiding false diagnosis of syphilis.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^114jpsPm]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendation for endpoint titers. Endpoint titers (the highest dilution yielding a reactive result) should be determined and clearly reported when testing serum with nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) assays that detect antibodies to lipoidal antigens (i.e. RPR and VDRL). Reports should not contain mathematical symbols such as > or < signs (Box).

Endpoint titers (the highest dilution yielding a reactive result) should be determined and clearly reported when testing serum with nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) assays that detect antibodies to lipoidal antigens (i.e. rapid plasma reagin and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory). Reports should not contain mathematical symbols such as > or < signs.
Recommendation for syphilis serologic testing algorithm. Serologic tests that measure antibodies to both nontreponemal (lipoidal) and treponemal antigens related to syphilitic infections should be used in combination, when the primary test is reactive, to aid in the diagnosis of syphilis. Sole reliance on one reactive serologic test result can misclassify a patient's syphilis status. Both the traditional syphilis screening algorithm (initial screening with nontreponemal [lipoidal antigen] assays) and the reverse syphilis screening algorithm (initial screening with treponemal immunoassays) are acceptable. The preferred algorithm should be based on laboratory resources, including staff, space and costs, test volume, and patient populations served.
Recommendation for serologic syphilis testing. Nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests (e.g. rapid plasma reagin or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) are not interchangeable when used to determine antibody titers; testing on follow-up samples must be performed with the same type of test. The Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test is the preferred manual treponemal test.
Recommendation for syphilis serologic testing in pregnant persons. Nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal tests should be interpreted in the same manner regardless of pregnancy status.
Recommendation for syphilis serologic testing in persons living with HIV/AIDS. Nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal tests should be interpreted in the same manner regardless of HIV status.
Recommendation for the direct detection of Treponema pallidum by darkfield microscopy. Darkfield microscopy should be maintained if already in use or established in sexually transmitted diseases clinics where a point-of-care test for primary or secondary syphilis diagnosis would be beneficial for timely patient treatment.
Recommendation for direct detection of Treponema pallidum by immunohistochemistry and silver staining. Immunohistochemistry is preferred over silver staining for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections regardless of anatomic site.

### Is serological testing a reliable tool in laboratory diagnosis of syphilis? Meta-analysis of eight external quality control surveys performed by the German infection serology proficiency testing program [^1156mc97]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

The accuracy of diagnostic tests is critical for successful control of epidemic outbreaks of syphilis. The reliability of syphilis serology in the nonspecialist laboratory has always been questioned, but actual data dealing with this issue are sparse. Here, the results of eight proficiency testing sentinel surveys for diagnostic laboratories in Germany between 2000 and 2003 were analyzed. Screening tests such as Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (mean accuracy, 91.4% [qualitative], 75.4% [quantitative]), Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (mean accuracy, 98.1% [qualitative], 82.9% [quantitative]), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (mean qualitative accuracy, 95%) were more reliable than Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) testing (mean accuracy, 89.6% [qualitative], 71.1% [quantitative]), the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) (mean accuracy, 88% [qualitative], 65.8% [quantitative]), and immunoblot assays (mean qualitative accuracy, 87.3%). Clearly, immunoglobulin M (IgM) tests were more difficult to manage than IgG tests. False-negative results for samples that have been unambiguously determined to be IgM and anti-lipoid antibody positive accounted for 4.7% of results in the IgM ELISA, 6.9% in the VDRL test, 18.5% in the IgM FTA-ABS, and 23.0% in the IgM immunoblot assay. For negative samples, the mean percentage of false-positive results was 4.1% in the VDRL test, 5.4% in the IgM ELISA, 0.7% in the IgM FTA-ABS, and 1.4% in the IgM immunoblot assay. On average, 18.3% of participants misclassified samples from patients with active syphilis as past infection without indicating the need for further treatment. Moreover, 10.2% of laboratories wrongly reported serological evidence for active infection in samples from patients with past syphilis or in sera from seronegative blood donors. Consequently, the continuous participation of laboratories in proficiency testing and further standardization of tests is strongly recommended to achieve better quality of syphilis serology.

### Performance assessment of treponemal and nontreponemal tests for the diagnosis of acquired syphilis [^116Z4V2T]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

As with the ELISA, the FTA-ABS test showed high performance. However, seven anti- T. pallidum -positive samples from the FTA-ABS test were falsely diagnosed as negative, with a sensitivity of 96.3%. These seven false-negative samples were correctly classified as positive by the ELISA, and five of them were classified as positive by the VDRL test. Of the anti- T. pallidum -negative samples, only one was positive when assessed by the FTA-ABS test, with a specificity of 99.5%. Our findings are consistent with those of other studies that reported sensitivity values ranging from 86.1% to 100%, and specificity ranged from 92.5% to 100%. In contrast, our results are not consistent with data from other studies, which reported sensitivity and specificity values of 77.5%and 61.5%, respectively. When the serum samples were stratified by clinical stage of syphilis, we found that sensitivity ranged from 93.7% for latent syphilis to 96.8% and 98.7% for primary and secondary syphilis. Other studies reached similar results, except for those for primary syphilis, which had a low value (∼78%).

Recommendations for Syphilis Testing in the United States

Nontreponemal (Lipoidal Antigen) Tests

Nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests typically have been used as a screening test for syphilis, as a diagnostic test when patients have signs or symptoms suggestive of syphilis or have a known sexual contact, when assessing possible reinfections, and when monitoring treatment outcome (Figure 1). RPR and VDRL tests are still the primary screening methods used in public health laboratories in the United States; other FDA-cleared nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests (e.g. the toluidine red unheated serum test [TRUST] and unheated serum reagin test [USR]) are available but are less commonly used in the United States. Regardless of which test method is applied, serum antibody titers from RPR, VDRL, and other nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests should not be used interchangeably to manage patients because they are different test methods and the subjective titer results can vary by laboratory. Therefore, patient specimens should be tested using the same nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) test method and specimen type.

The manual nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests are flocculation tests that detect antibody-antigen complexes that fall out of solution as a precipitate. Microscopic or macroscopic procedures have been developed to detect the precipitate that forms after specific binding of antibodies to a combination of cardiolipin, cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine that are used as antigens in nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests. VDRL tests are read microscopically at 100x magnification. The RPR test uses charcoal to aid in detection of the flocculant, and the results can be read macroscopically because the antigen-antibody lattice traps the charcoal particles. The TRUST test uses toluidine red dye in place of charcoal.

### Clinical development and performance of the first to know syphilis self-test for over-the-counter usage: arapid test for treponemal antibody [^115sN1hJ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is complex and necessitates a combination of clinical and laboratory criteria to differentiate current or past infection and absence of infection. Culture for T. pallidum is cumbersome and is available only in selected research laboratories, and there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared PCR test for syphilis at present. Darkfield microscopy is a direct detection test for T. pallidum that can diagnose early primary syphilis (sensitivity 75% to 100%); however, it requires samples from moist lesions or exudates, along with highly trained technicians and specialized equipment. It is not recommended for secondary syphilis due to low sensitivity. Serological testing remains the mainstay for diagnosing syphilis infection. Serology is divided into two different types of tests: non-treponemal tests (NTTs), such as the rapid plasma regain [RPR] test and the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and treponemal tests (TTs), such as the T. pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) and Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption (FTA-ABS). While TT is often positive for life, NTT titers usually decrease after treatment. However, in certain cases, especially in late stages of syphilis, non-treponemal antibodies may persist at low levels for extended periods. The traditional NTTs are cost-effective and useful for initial screening and monitoring of syphilis treatment; however, they can be affected by false-positive and false-negative results. TTs provide higher specificity and sensitivity for confirming syphilis but cannot effectively monitor the disease activity after treatment or differentiate between active and past infections. Thus, both TTs and NTTs have inherent limitations due to variability in their diagnostic performance, hampering syphilis control and prevention efforts in real-world settings. A single serologic NTT or TT is not sufficient for diagnosis, and therefore a combination of positive TT and reactive NTT is required for the diagnosis of syphilis infection. In the past, syphilis screening mainly followed a traditional testing algorithm, starting with NTT, and the positive results required further confirmation through more specific TTs. With increased availability of various treponemal-specific immunoassays including enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIAs), recently, many laboratories are increasingly adopting a "reverse sequence screening" algorithm, which begins the screening with a TT, followed by confirmation of the reactivity with an NTT. When the NTT is non-reactive, a second but different treponemal test is performed to determine if the first treponemal test was a false positive. Regardless of which algorithm is used, it is important to consider the sensitivity and specificity of these assays in clinically characterized sera, stratified by the stage of syphilis, and all screening results must be correlated with clinical diagnosis, which includes patients' symptoms, previous history, and sexual risk factors to make an accurate diagnosis.

Between 2009 and 2013, polymerase-chain-reaction assay was used to detect Treponema pallidum in the blood samples collected from 296 patients with early syphilis (241 being HIV infected) and 102 patients (34.5%) had spirochetemia. The presence of spirochetemia was associated with lower CD4 counts (per 10-cell/mm(3) decrease, adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 1.020; 95% CI, 1.006–1.036) and secondary syphilis (AOR, 4.967; 95% CI, 2.016–12.238). Patients with early latent syphilis were less likely to achieve serological response compared with those with primary or secondary syphilis (AOR, 0.317; 95% CI, 0.142–0.708). However, serological response was not affected by presence of spirochetemia or antibiotic regimens.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^115KhZF7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

We conducted a systematic review of relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question, "What is the sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal tests currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the diagnosis of syphilis (by stage)?" There were 16 treponemal assays evaluated: 13 immunoassays and 3 manual assays (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test [FTA-ABS], microhemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum antibodies [MHA-TP], Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay [TP-PA]). MHA-TP and FTA-ABS were less sensitive in primary and secondary syphilis than TP-PA; TP-PA is the most specific manual treponemal assay. There is insufficient evidence to recommend one particular treponemal immunoassay (eg, enzyme immunoassays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, microbead immunoassays) over another based on published performance data. For diagnosis of neurosyphilis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) TP-PA has similar performance to CSF FTA-ABS in studies with patients with definitive or presumptive neurosyphilis. However, CSF treponemal testing has limitations in its sensitivity and specificity and should be interpreted within the context of the clinical scenario, additional CSF test results and syphilis prevalence.

### Evaluation of a rapid one-step immunochromatographic test and two immunoenzymatic assays for the detection of anti-Treponema pallidum antibodies [^116dvvJY]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The control of syphilis depends on screening of the population at risk and is usually performed using the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test (TPPA). Outside Europe the rapid plasma reagin test (RPR) or venereal disease research laboratory test is most often used for screening purposes. Because of the drawbacks in current diagnostic procedures, ie, long turnaround time, the need is felt for a rapid and simple test that can potentially be performed on whole blood.

Objective and Study Design

In this study a one-step immunochromatographic test (Biorapid Syphilis) and two ELISA, the Bioelisa Syphilis 3.0 and ETI-Treponema Plus, were evaluated.

Methods

Serum samples were collected between February 2000 and May 2006 at the University Hospital in Maastricht, The Netherlands. 145 TPPA-positive sera, confirmed by fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-Abs, treponemal test) and/or RPR (non-treponemal) were included. Furthermore, 41 sera from healthy controls and 144 TPPA-negative sera from controls with underlying conditions that might interfere with T pallidum serology were collected.

Results

The sensitivity and specificity of the Biorapid Syphilis, Bioelisa Syphilis 3.0 and ETI-Treponema Plus were 92% and 79%, 100% and 100% and 100% and 100%, respectively, with our selected sera.

Conclusions

The performance of both ELISA was excellent in our study and is favoured over the TPPA because of its ability to be run on an automated system. The sensitivity and specificity of the Biorapid Syphilis were considered too low to implement the test in a hospital laboratory in a developed country but it might be useful in primary healthcare settings in developing countries.

### Reactivity of antibodies from syphilis patients to a protein array representing the Treponema pallidum proteome [^114mE7ar]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

To identify antigens important in the human immune response to syphilis, the serum antibody reactivity of syphilitic patients was examined with 908 of the 1,039 proteins in the proteome of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum using a protein array enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Thirty-four proteins exhibited significant reactivity when assayed with human sera from patients in the early latent stage of syphilis. A subset of antigens identified were further scrutinized for antibody reactivity at primary, secondary, and latent disease stages, and the results demonstrate that the humoral immune response to individual T. pallidum proteins develops at different rates during the time course of infection.

Question 3: Which lab test can be used to monitor treatment response?
A. Rapid plasma reagin
B. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS)
C. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels
D. Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay (IgG)
E. Chemiluminescence immunoassay

Answers:
A. Rapid plasma regain – Correct. Nontreponemal tests such as rapid plasma regain, venereal disease research laboratory, and toluidine red unheated serum tests are traditionally used as initial screening tests but also as the main way of monitoring a patient's response to treatment due to their quantitative results. Successful therapy will be indicated by a decline in antibody titers.
B. FTA-ABS – Incorrect. FTA-ABS is a qualitative treponemal test, thus providing no useful tracking of treatment response. The FTA-ABS assay is thought to be most sensitive in primary syphilis.
C. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels – Incorrect. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels correlate with disease severity and activity in response to treatment in sarcoidosis, not syphilis.
D. Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay (IgG) – Incorrect. The T. pallidum enzyme immunoassay is also a treponemal test that has become a favorite of large laboratories as a screening test due to its lower cost compared with the others.
E. Chemiluminescence immunoassay – Incorrect. The chemiluminescence immunoassay is also a treponemal test. All treponemal tests are based upon the detection of antibodies directed against specific treponemal antigens and thus tend to be more specific than nontreponemal tests.

INTRODUCTION

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum. Syphilis has a wide variety of clinical presentations, including genital ulcers, skin lesions, hepatitis, meningitis, aortic disease, and neurologic syndromes. Syphilis in pregnant women can lead to fetal loss, stillbirth, neonatal death, and congenital infections in neonates. The number of patients with syphilis has increased significantly worldwide in the past few decades. To prevent the transmission of syphilis, it is necessary to identify infected individuals through prompt diagnostic testing, provide appropriate treatment for positive cases, and offer comprehensive sexual health education. In addition, molecular surveillance of T. pallidum clonality has the potential to enhance clinical care, prevention, and control efforts by contributing to a better understanding of T. pallidum acquisition and transmission. However, the efficient diagnosis and molecular surveillance of syphilis remain challenging for a number of reasons. First, most patients are asymptomatic and are identified only during screening. Second, the diagnosis of syphilis relies on serologic testing (treponemal and nontreponemal tests), and patients are often missed within the period between the initial T. pallidum infection and the appearance of antibodies in early syphilis for serologic testing or because they refuse to provide blood samples. Third, it is difficult to culture T. pallidum in vitro. Fourth, lesions of primary and secondary syphilis contain low loads of T. pallidum.

### Sexually acquired syphilis: laboratory diagnosis, management, and prevention [^115B3dvk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The methods used for the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis include direct detection of Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum and serologic testing. Serologic testing relies on both nontreponemal and treponemal tests. In newly developed reverse-sequence screening algorithms, treponemal tests are performed before nontreponemal tests. The management of syphilis requires appropriate staging, treatment, and follow-up of patients along with the prompt reporting of infections to public health authorities to assist with prevention and control efforts. Benzathine penicillin G remains the treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis. Screening of populations at higher risk for syphilis is recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Preventive Services Task Force, and the World Health Organization. The second article in this continuing medical education series reviews the testing for and the management of sexually acquired syphilis.

Six different Treponema (TP)-specific immunoassays were compared to the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test. A total of 615 samples were tested.

All results that were discrepant between the TP-specific assays were associated with samples from noninfectious cases (11 immunoassay false positives and 7 from previous syphilis cases). Our study demonstrated that TP-specific immunoassays generally showed high sensitivities, specificities, and percentages of agreement compared to FTA-ABS, with rare cases of false-positive or false-negative results. Therefore, most TP-specific immunoassays are acceptable for use in screening for syphilis. However, it is important to perform a thorough review of a patient's clinical and treatment history for interpreting the results of syphilis serology.

### Discordant results from reverse sequence syphilis screening-five laboratories, United States, 2006–2010… [^111A1xNN]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Treponema pallidum particle agglutination or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed tests. Among discordant sera, the rate of nonreactive confirmatory treponemal tests was 2. 9 times higher in a population with low prevalence of syphilis, suggesting that the low-prevalence population had a higher percentage of false-positive test results. Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis, cannot be cultured. As a result, serologic testing is the method most often used to diagnose syphilis in patients with suspected disease. Because syphilis can be asymptomatic, serologic screening is recommended for 1) persons at high risk, to detect latent infections; 2) pregnant women, to prevent congenital syphilis; and 3) blood donors, to prevent transmission through transfusion.

Serodiagnosis of syphilis involves the detection of two distinct types of antibodies: 1) nontreponemal antibodies directed against lipoidal antigens released from damaged host cells and possibly from the treponemes themselves and 2) treponemal antibodies directed against T. pallidum proteins. Nontreponemal antibody tests can be nonreactive early in the course of infection and in late stages of disease, and often become nonreactive after treatment of early infection. Treponemal antibodies appear earlier than nontreponemal antibodies and usually remain detectable for life, even after successful treatment. A total of 140, 176 sera screened with a treponemal EIA/CIA were included in the analyses antibodies are produced within 2 weeks of infection, the utility of IgM treponemal testing for diagnosis of primary syphilis and evaluation of infection in asymptomatic, seropositive, untreated persons should be investigated. Abbreviations: EIA/CIA = enzyme immunoassay/chemiluminescence immunoassay; RPR = rapid plasma reagin; TP-PA = Treponema pallidum particle agglutination. * Despite these recommendations for reverse sequence screening, CDC continues to recommend the traditional algorithm with reactive nontreponemal tests confirmed by treponemal testing.

Introduction

The aetiological agent of syphilis, Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum, can be transmitted through sexual contact, from an infected mother to her child, and through blood transfusion or other non-sexual contact. Untreated syphilis progresses through multiple stages — primary, secondary, latent and tertiary — progressing from infectious and symptomatic stages to a latent asymptomatic phase, with the tertiary stage affecting multiple body organs. A recent surveillance report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed a rise in primary and secondary syphilis cases in the USA particularly among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. A resurgence in syphilis cases globally has also been described in recent years.

Due to a lack of sustainable in vitro culture techniques for T. pallidum, unavailability of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared molecular tests and limitations associated with direct detection tests such as dark field microscopy, indirect serological tests that detect non-treponemal and treponemal antibodies remain the mainstay for routine syphilis detection. Non-treponemal tests include Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) slide test, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and unheated serum reagin that detect antibodies to lipoidal moieties derived from damaged host cells and treponemes as a result of the host immune response. Owing to the non-specific nature of these tests, the traditional algorithm requires confirmation of a reactive non-treponemal result with a treponemal-specific test that includes T. pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA), T. pallidum haemagglutination assay, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption or other automated treponemal assays. Most treponemal tests use whole bacterial lysate or a combination of recombinant and/or purified peptides and proteins to capture the antibody. Treponemal tests have become more mainstream for syphilis screening due to ease of use, high throughput and ability to improve workflow efficiency using automated systems. A caveat is that treponemal antibodies persist in successfully treated patients which means the treponemal test cannot distinguish current infection from infections that have been successfully treated in the past. Confirmatory testing with non-treponemal tests is recommended when using the reverse sequence screening algorithm, followed by reflex testing with another treponemal assay to verify discordant results if any. None of the serological tests currently approved for use is sufficient as a stand-alone assay for definitive diagnosis of syphilis.

Which diagnostic test should be done (table 1)?

Table 1
Diagnostic tests for syphilis

CLIA = chemiluminescence immunoassay. EIA = enzyme immunoassay. RPR = rapid plasma reagin. DFM = dark field microscopy. DFA = direct fluorescent antibody stain. PCR = polymerase chain reaction.

Treponema pallidum may be visualised from lesions using dark field microscopy, direct fluorescent antibody testing, or polymerase chain reaction. Because these tests are not widely available, diagnosis predominantly relies on serology. While serologic tests and laboratory algorithms vary, testing usually begins with a screening treponemal test, such as an enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (EIA or CLIA) to detect treponemal antibodies. A positive screening test should be followed by a confirmatory treponemal test, typically the T pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA). If both tests are positive, infection with syphilis is confirmed. Thereafter, the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test (a quantitative non-treponemal test) should be used to measure disease activity and to track response to treatment (although 15–41% of patients remain reactive even after successful treatment).

Test timing

Screening treponemal tests (EIA or CLIA) usually become reactive first, often within two weeks of the chancre. However, patients with negative results who have syphilis-like symptoms or who report a high risk contact should be re-tested after a further two to four weeks.

The RPR test may remain non-reactive for up to four weeks after the chancre, so it is often negative in primary syphilis, but it is 98–100% sensitive in secondary syphilis. However, because the RPR is a test of non-specific tissue damage, it may be positive for reasons other than syphilis.

In the absence of treatment, a negative non-treponemal test three months after potential exposure effectively rules out a new syphilis infection.

Note that treponemal tests cannot distinguish active from treated infections and generally remain positive for life (see table 2).

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^1113UeFp]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Although data suggest that nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) test performance sensitivities do not significantly differ between persons living with and without HIV infection, studies have reported increased likelihood of BFP in HIV-positive persons. In studies with samples sizes that ranged from 789 to 300,000, serum testing by VDRL or RPR indicated that the rate of BFP results was 2.5–34.5 times higher among HIV-positive persons than HIV-negative persons. These studies were conducted in populations before antiretroviral therapy was widely available or in populations where viral load was not assessed. BFP rates in persons living with HIV infection who are virally suppressed have not been studied.

Treponemal test positivity generally persists after previously treated infection, unless the infection is treated before the secondary stage, as has been previously described in persons without HIV infection. Before modern antiretroviral therapy, seroreversion of either the MHA-TP or FTA-ABS test was found to vary by severity of HIV disease in two studies and was lower for asymptomatic HIV infection (five of 69 patients) than symptomatic HIV/AIDS (eight of 21 patients) in one study. In another study, seroreversion was identified in 14% of 29 patients with asymptomatic HIV infection and 41% of 29 patients with symptomatic HIV infection. However, two subsequent studies including 31 and 104 patients found no difference in seroreversion of treponemal tests by HIV status in patients previously treated for syphilis. In a more recent study of 294 patients with previous syphilis followed for ≥ 6 months after treatment and with no signs of syphilis during the follow-up interval, 87% were reactive for FTA-ABS, 92% for TPPA, and 96%–99% for one of four treponemal immunoassays. Treponemal immunoassays were statistically significantly more likely to remain reactive compared with FTA-ABS.

Recommendation for syphilis serologic testing in persons living with HIV/AIDS. Nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal tests should be interpreted in the same manner regardless of HIV status (Box).

Comment and evidence summary. On the basis of existing data, nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal tests should be interpreted the same for patients with and without HIV infection.

### Clinical test performance of a rapid point-of-care syphilis treponemal antibody test: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114D2fhV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

We reviewed relevant syphilis diagnostic literature and conducted a meta-analysis to address the question, "What is the sensitivity and specificity of the Syphilis Health Check, a rapid qualitative test for the detection of human antibodies to Treponema pallidum". The Syphilis Health Check is the only rapid syphilis test currently cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis using Bayesian bivariate random-effects and fixed-effect models to create pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the Syphilis Health Check. We identified 5 test evaluations published in the literature and 10 studies submitted to the FDA and for a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments waiver application. The pooled sensitivity (95% CI) from the laboratory evaluations (n = 5) was 98.5% (92.1–100%), while pooled specificity was 95.9% (81.5–100.0%). The pooled sensitivity for prospective studies (n = 10) was 87.7% (71.8–97.2%), while pooled specificity was 96.7% (91.9–99.2%). Using nontreponemal supplemental testing, the sensitivity improved to a pooled sensitivity of 97.0% (94.8–98.6%). The Syphilis Health Check may provide accurate detection of treponemal antibody.

Genital lesions — syphilis testing approach is outlined as follows: Syphilis has seen an unprecedented surge, including significantly increased rates in congenital syphilis, and screening is recommended in many settings. In the United States, rapid diagnostic tests with good performance parameters for diagnosing primary syphilis are lacking, and darkfield smear exams and NAATs for detecting T. pallidum, although recommended by CDC, are not readily available in clinical laboratories and lack sensitivity in early disease. Typically, testing for syphilis is performed by serology and requires 2 tests, with traditional testing consisting of initial screening with an inexpensive non-treponemal test (ie, rapid plasma reagin [RPR]), then retesting reactive specimens with a more

### Syphilis [^112dmXW2]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Syphilis is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum that is endemic in low-income countries and occurs at lower rates in middle-income and high-income countries. The disease is of both individual and public health importance and, in addition to its direct morbidity, increases risk of HIV infection and can cause lifelong morbidity in children born to infected mothers. Without treatment the disease can progress over years through a series of clinical stages and lead to irreversible neurological or cardiovascular complications. Although syphilis is an ancient disease and the principles of recommended management have been established for decades, diagnosis and management are often challenging because of its varied manifestations and difficulty in interpretation of serological tests used to confirm diagnosis and evaluate response to therapy. In North America and western Europe, incidence of syphilis has increased dramatically in the past decade among men who have sex with men, particularly those with coexistent HIV infection. Only one drug, penicillin, is recommended for syphilis treatment and response to therapy is assessed based on changes over months in serological test titres. Treatment for patients who cannot receive penicillin and management of patients who do not serologically respond to treatment are common clinical problems.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^1114fkEy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL from 1960 to 30 June 2017. Following the consultation in November 2017, we subsequently updated the literature search from July 2017 to September 2018 using the following search terms: (Treponema pallidum OR Neurosyphilis OR Syphilis) AND (sero-diagnos* OR serodiagnos* OR (serolog* AND (test* OR exam* OR assay* OR screen* OR lab* OR diagnos* OR nontreponemal OR treponemal OR algorithm* OR antibody titer) OR serofast)). The search was limited to human studies published in English.

The initial search yielded n = 4851 nonduplicated abstracts. We excluded n = 4504 abstracts that were not relevant to the key question: studies of nontreponemal testing only, animal studies, direct detection studies, review articles, guidelines, letters to the editor, and other publications that were not primary research studies. We reviewed 347 abstracts, and further excluded n = 230 studies that described obsolete tests only, tests not approved by the FDA, those that used a gold standard based exclusively on non-FDA approved tests, studies of prevalence or laboratory technique only (no test performance), any duplicate publications, and abstracts without a full manuscript. After exclusions, 117 full papers were reviewed for potential inclusion, 81 studies with either descriptive data on use of treponemal tests or actual test performance data were abstracted into Tables of Evidence (Supplementary Table)

Studies with test performance data were prioritized according to their relevance to the key question (Supplementary Table). Studies of high relevance were those with clinically characterized specimens, stratified by stage of syphilis (with/without use of dark-field microscopy for diagnosis of primary syphilis), and included studies that utilized syphilis specimens from commercial or CDC serum banks. Studies of moderate relevance were those with clinically characterized specimens but no stratification by stage (all patients with syphilis analyzed together). Lower relevance studies were those that used a laboratory reference standard only (single or multiple tests) without clinical characterization, and also include studies where clinical characterization could not be assessed or was not performed uniformly across specimens. Studies of high and moderate relevance were abstracted into tables of test performance, and the range of sensitivity and specificity estimates from all studies was abstracted. If only a single study was available for a particular assay, the proportions (n/N) and 95% confidence intervals were abstracted.

### Molecular and direct detection tests for Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum: a review of the literature, 1964–2017 [^115kRHaF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The number of primary and secondary cases of syphilis caused by infection with Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (herein T. pallidum) has steadily increased in the United States since the early 2000s. This has resulted in a nearly 73% increase in the overall number of cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2017 as compared to 2013, and is apparent across sexual behaviors, ethnicities, and gender, leading to a more than 40% increase in congenital syphilis cases over the past year. In the absence of treatment, syphilis can progress through multiple stages and present with a variety of different clinical manifestations, collectively making laboratory testing, alongside a careful clinical evaluation, invaluable for establishing the diagnosis. Diagnostic testing for syphilis can be challenging, however, as the organism cannot be grown in routine culture and there is no single assay with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to identify all stages of disease. Currently, diagnosis remains primarily dependent on serologic evaluation for antibodies to T. pallidum using both treponemal and nontreponemal assays, via either a traditional or reverse algorithmic approach. Although serologic testing is associated with high sensitivity (> 95%) during secondary and later stages of disease, the ability of these assays to detect cases of primary infection is significantly diminished, with studies suggesting that 14% to 46% of patients with primary syphilis may be seronegative depending on the method used. Additional limitations of serologic testing include lifelong seropositivity using treponemal assays and the possibility of serofast status, positive results by nontreponemal assays in successfully treated patients, further complicating the interpretation of results.

Combining the detection of syphilis and HIV antibodies into one point-of-care test integrates syphilis screening into already existing HIV screening programs, which may be particularly beneficial in settings such as antenatal care. Using the INSTI Multiplex downward-flow immunoassay, we tested 200 stored serum samples from high-risk patients enrolled in a longitudinal study on HIV infection and syphilis in Peruvian men who have sex with men and transgender women. This rapid assay detected HIV and Treponema pallidum serum antibodies with sensitivities of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 95.9% to 100%) and 87.4% (95% CI, 81.4% to 92.0%), respectively, and specificities of 95.5% (95% CI, 89.9% to 98.5%) and 97.0% (95% CI, 84.2% to 99.9%), respectively (n = 200). The sensitivity for syphilis antibody detection was higher in patients with a rapid plasma reagin titer of ≥ 1:8 (97.3%) than in those with a titer of ≤ 1:4 (90%) or a nonreactive titer (66.7%).

Syphilis in people with HIV — early-stage diagnosis and prozone management notes that early-stage disease (primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis) is identified using the same diagnostic tests used in people without HIV, including standard serologic tests and darkfield microscopy of mucocutaneous lesions, if available. VDRL and RPR titers may be higher, lower (in rare instances), or delayed in people with HIV with early-stage syphilis, and no data indicate that treponemal tests perform differently among people with HIV, although uncommon, false-negative serologic tests can occur with documented Treponema pallidum infection. When serologic tests do not match clinical findings of primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis, presumptive treatment is recommended for people with risk factors, and dilution of the sample for prozone phenomenon should be considered. For most people with HIV, serologic tests are accurate and reliable for diagnosing syphilis and for determining response to treatment.

### Refining timely diagnosis of early syphilis by using Treponema pallidum PCR or IgM immunoblotting next to conventional serology for syphilis [^116o8hf6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In short, both PCR and IgM immunoblotting can facilitate the diagnosis of early syphilis for approximately ~24% to 27% of patients. PCR has the greatest sensitivity and can be applied to cases of suspected reinfection or primary infection; however, it depends on the presence of an ulcer. IgM immunoblotting has better performance in cases of suspected primary infection (91%) than in cases of reinfection (59%) and does not rely on the presence of an ulcer. However, false-positive results are a concern. The target population, testing algorithm, time pressures, and costs should determine whether either test provides sufficient value to be implemented in clinical practice.

### A dual point-of-care test shows good performance in simultaneously detecting nontreponemal and treponemal antibodies in patients with syphilis: a multisite evaluation study in China [^116iPk3C]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Rapid point-of-care (POC) syphilis tests based on simultaneous detection of treponemal and nontreponemal antibodies (dual POC tests) offer the opportunity to increase coverage of syphilis screening and treatment. This study aimed to conduct a multisite performance evaluation of a dual POC syphilis test in China.

Methods

Participants were recruited from patients at sexually transmitted infection clinics and high-risk groups in outreach settings in 6 sites in China. Three kinds of specimens (whole blood [WB], fingerprick blood [FB], and blood plasma [BP]) were used for evaluating sensitivity and specificity of the Dual Path Platform (DPP) Syphilis Screen and Confirm test using its treponemal and nontreponemal lines to compare Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay and toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST) as reference standards.

Results

A total of 3134 specimens (WB 1323, FB 488, and BP 1323) from 1323 individuals were collected. The sensitivities as compared with TPPA were 96.7% for WB, 96.4% for FB, and 94.6% for BP, and the specificities were 99.3%, 99.1%, and 99.6%, respectively. The sensitivities as compared with TRUST were 87.2% for WB, 85.8% for FB, and 88.4% for BP, and the specificities were 94.4%, 96.1%, and 95.0%, respectively. For specimens with a TRUST titer of 1:4 or higher, the sensitivities were 100.0% for WB, 97.8% for FB, and 99.6% for BP.

Conclusions

DPP test shows good sensitivity and specificity in detecting treponemal and nontreponemal antibodies in 3 kinds of specimens. It is hoped that this assay can be considered as an alternative in the diagnosis of syphilis, particularly in resource-limited areas.

### Diagnosing Treponema pallidum in secondary syphilis by PCR and immunohistochemistry [^111iWbsA]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Epidemiological aspects of syphilis in Western countries have undergone a significant change with respect to the number of cases. Detection of Treponema pallidum is difficult, and the correct diagnosis of secondary syphilis can be critical. In this study, biopsy samples from skin lesions of 12 patients with secondary syphilis were used. Diagnosis of syphilis was based on clinical presentation, dark-field microscope analysis, and serological tests. Using a polyclonal antibody directed against T. pallidum, we show the presence of T. pallidum in 90% of the samples studied with the bacteria located in the epidermis and the upper dermis. The T. pallidum 47-kDa surface protein gene could be amplified by PCR in 75% of the skin lesions. When combining both techniques, T. pallidum was detected in 92% of the samples from patients with secondary syphilis but not in the control samples. Our work suggests that both immunohistochemistry and PCR could be useful for the diagnosis of secondary syphilis and may be helpful in some rare cases when serological assays failed to detect T. pallidum antibodies.

### Novel Treponema pallidum serologic tests: a paradigm shift in syphilis screening for the 21st century [^1176XFWj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The mainstay of diagnosis for Treponema pallidum infections is based on nontreponemal and treponemal serologic tests. Many new diagnostic methods for syphilis have been developed, using specific treponemal antigens and novel formats, including rapid point-of-care tests, enzyme immunoassays, and chemiluminescence assays. Although most of these newer tests are not yet cleared for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration, their performance and ease of automation have promoted their application for syphilis screening. Both sensitive and specific, new screening tests detect antitreponemal IgM and IgG antibodies by use of wild-type or recombinant T. pallidum antigens. However, these tests cannot distinguish between recent and remote or treated versus untreated infections. In addition, the screening tests require confirmation with nontreponemal tests. This use of treponemal tests for screening and nontreponemal serologic tests as confirmatory tests is a reversal of long-held practice. Clinicians need to understand the science behind these tests to use them properly in syphilis management.

### Molecular and direct detection tests for Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum: a review of the literature, 1964–2017 [^114Lfy9r]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Direct detection methods for Treponema pallidum include dark-field microscopy (DFM), direct fluorescence antibody (DFA) testing, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Here, we reviewed the relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address 2 main questions with respect to T. pallidum direct detection techniques: "What are the performance characteristics for each direct detection test for T. pallidum and what are the optimal specimen types for each test?" and "What options are available for T. pallidum molecular epidemiology?" To answer these questions, we searched 5 electronic databases (OVID Medline, OVID Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Scopus) from 1964 to 2017 using relevant search terms and identified 1928 articles, of which 37 met our inclusion criteria. DFM and DFA sensitivities ranged from 73% to 100% in cases of primary syphilis; and while sensitivity using silver stain histopathology for T. pallidum was generally low (0%–41%), higher performance characteristics were observed for T. pallidum –specific IHC (49–92%). Different genes have been targeted by T. pallidum –specific NAATs, with the majority of studies indicating that sensitivity is primarily dependent on the type of collected biological sample, with highest sensitivity observed in primary lesion exudate (75–95%). Given the rising incidence of syphilis, the development of direct, Food and Drug Administration–cleared T. pallidum NAATs should be considered an immediate priority.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^115vMLz9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

This report provides new CDC recommendations for tests that can support a diagnosis of syphilis, including serologic testing and methods for the identification of the causative agent Treponema pallidum. These comprehensive recommendations are the first published by CDC on laboratory testing for syphilis, which has traditionally been based on serologic algorithms to detect a humoral immune response to T. pallidum. These tests can be divided into nontreponemal and treponemal tests depending on whether they detect antibodies that are broadly reactive to lipoidal antigens shared by both host and T. pallidum or antibodies specific to T. pallidum, respectively. Both types of tests must be used in conjunction to help distinguish between an untreated infection or a past infection that has been successfully treated. Newer serologic tests allow for laboratory automation but must be used in an algorithm, which also can involve older manual serologic tests. Direct detection of T. pallidum continues to evolve from microscopic examination of material from lesions for visualization of T. pallidum to molecular detection of the organism. Limited point-of-care tests for syphilis are available in the United States; increased availability of point-of-care tests that are sensitive and specific could facilitate expansion of screening programs and reduce the time from test result to treatment. These recommendations are intended for use by clinical laboratory directors, laboratory staff, clinicians, and disease control personnel who must choose among the multiple available testing methods, establish standard operating procedures for collecting and processing specimens, interpret test results for laboratory reporting, and counsel and treat patients. Future revisions to these recommendations will be based on new research or technologic advancements for syphilis clinical laboratory science.

### An immunofiltration device for the simultaneous detection of non-treponemal and treponemal antibodies in patients with syphilis [^111r8rfJ]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The development of a rapid immunofiltration (flow-through) test for the simultaneous detection of non-treponemal and treponemal antibodies in the serum of patients with syphilis.

Methods

The assay is rapid, inexpensive, and requires limited expertise in interpreting the results. The test is based on the principle of immunofiltration, with two antigens and control material spotted on the membrane of a through-flow device. A positive test is characterised by the appearance of three red/magenta spots within 2–10 min.

Results

A total of 376 banked serum samples obtained from the Georgia Public Health Laboratory was examined by the flow-through test, the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test and the Treponema pallidum passive particle agglutination assay (TPPA). The sensitivity and specificity of the non-treponemal spot were 96.5% and 97.7%, respectively, when compared with the RPR test, and the sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal test spot were 97.3% and 99.1% when compared with the TPPA test. In addition, the test yielded equivalent results to those obtained in comparator tests when 104 sera from cases of syphilis of known stage, 49 sera from diseases other than syphilis and 23 sera known to exhibit biological false-positive reactions were tested in parallel.

Conclusions

These results indicate that the dual treponemal and non-treponemal assay could be used as a screen and confirmatory test for the serological diagnosis of syphilis in remote or resource-poor settings where there is a need to provide counselling and treatment at the initial consultation.

### Syphilis in children [^112WApK2]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, is transmitted both sexually and transplacentally. Untreated syphilis is a progressive disease that may result in death or disability in children and adults. Syphilis diagnosis requires 2-stage serologic testing for nontreponemal and treponemal antibodies. Congenital syphilis diagnosis requires careful review of maternal testing and treatment, comparison of maternal and neonatal nontreponemal antibody titers, and clinical evaluation of the neonate. In this review, we present the current epidemiology of syphilis, and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of syphilis as they relate to pediatric practice, specifically, congenital syphilis and acquired syphilis in adolescents and pregnant women.

### Treponema pallidum detection at asymptomatic oral, anal, and vaginal sites in adults reporting sexual contact with persons with syphilis [^1123GK4A]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, results in substantial disease and death if left untreated. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated a global burden of 6 million new syphilis infections in 2018, and syphilis remains a major public health challenge. High incidence of syphilis continues to persist among men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income countries. Increases in syphilis among heterosexual populations and congenital syphilis have also been reported in many countries, including Australia. Early detection and treatment are essential in reducing the infectious period and transmission. Developing interventions aimed at improving syphilis control, including methods that can detect syphilis infection as early as possible, is essential.

To identify early syphilis infection, persons who are at risk for syphilis infection should undergo screening. The conventional method for syphilis screening involves serologic testing, which consists of detecting T. pallidum antibodies by using T. pallidum –specific and nonspecific tests. However, a challenge with this method is the window period between the infection onset and the appearance of antibodies in very early syphilis, which can lead to a negative serologic result during that period, causing the infection to go undetected. Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of T. pallidum –specific and –nonspecific serologic tests for syphilis vary by stages of infection. For example, T. pallidum –nonspecific tests are less sensitive in detecting primary syphilis (62%–78%) than in detecting secondary syphilis (97%–100%). T. pallidum –specific tests such as immunoassays have a wide range of sensitivities for detecting primary syphilis (78%–96%), varying according to the specific immunoassay used. Furthermore, those T. pallidum –specific immunoassays demonstrate persistent presence of treponemal antibodies in patients previously treated for syphilis, which can sometimes pose challenges in identifying a very early new syphilis infection when treponemal antibodies are present and T. pallidum –nonspecific tests are nonreactive. Therefore, laboratory methods that can enhance detection of very early syphilis infections are needed.

### Update on syphilis diagnostics [^111n651Z]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Syphilis is rising globally, with resultant increases in morbidity and mortality that disproportionately impact underserved populations. Appropriate screening and testing for syphilis with accurate, reliable, affordable, and timely assays is crucial for combating this epidemic. This review provides a brief overview of laboratory methods for syphilis diagnosis, with a focus on recent updates in diagnostics and directions for future research.

Recent Findings

Syphilis can be complex and time-consuming to diagnose and stage appropriately. The historic use of darkfield microscopy for diagnosis has been eclipsed by algorithms that include both nontreponemal and treponemal antibody tests for screening and confirmation of active Treponema pallidum infection. Newer diagnostic modalities include nucleic acid amplification assays (NAATs) and point-of-care testing (POCT), which hold promise for increasing identification of active syphilis but have notable limitations. More work is needed to develop accurate, reliable, affordable, and expeditious tests to optimize syphilis diagnosis.

Summary

Algorithms utilizing a combination of serological treponemal and nontreponemal assays remain standard of care for the diagnosis of syphilis, but recently developed NAATs and POCT assays present opportunities to increase syphilis detection. Further research is warranted to improve upon these testing modalities and explore other markers that could aid in syphilis diagnosis.

### A suite of PCR-lwCas13a assays for detection and genotyping of Treponema pallidum in clinical samples [^111zBbge]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (TPA) is the causative agent of syphilis, a resurgent sexually transmitted disease worldwide. Syphilis can progress through multiple stages and present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Laboratory testing is essential for syphilis diagnosis, but existing assays have limited clinical sensitivity, specificity, or both –. There is no single diagnostic test with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to identify all stages of disease. Because neither TPA cultivationnor rabbit-infectivity testing, to isolate TPA strains from patients can be done in routine clinical practice, clinical diagnosis currently relies upon serological testing. Assays employing nontreponemal and treponemal serological tests show high sensitivity (95%) for secondary and later stages of syphilisbut reduced sensitivity for primary syphilis. Lifelong positivity of treponemal and nontreponemal tests (the 'serofast' state) further complicates the interpretation of serological results and response to syphilis treatment –.

Established methods for direct detection of TPA, such as darkfield microscopy (DFM), direct fluorescence antibody (DFA) testingand nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), are often used to complement serological testing but have distinct limitations. DFM and DFA are heavily reliant upon the technologist's expertize, and the performance of these methods and NAAT vary based on specimen type –. Though NAAT is well-established and accurate, the sensitivity of various NAAT assays ranges widely in different stages of disease and specimen types and is problematic for use in neurosyphilis. For mucocutaneous lesion exudates, reported sensitivities of NAATs range from 75–95% in primary syphilis and 20–86% in secondary syphilis. NAATs applied to whole blood reach sensitivities of only 13% in primary syphilis and 38–64% in secondary syphilis, respectively. Given recent dramatic increases in the incidence of syphilis globally, the development of highly sensitive and specific TPA assays should be considered a priority.

In an effort to mitigate these limitations, different direct detection methods for T. pallidum have been developed, including direct visualization of spirochetes from lesion exudate by dark-field microscopy (DFM) or direct fluorescence antibody (DFA) testing, histopathology using silver stains or immunohistochemistry (IHC), and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Notably, no direct detection assay has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing in the United States. Given the limited sensitivity of current serologic assays during primary disease, direct detection assays may be most beneficial in the early stage(s) of infection, yet they are not widely available or performed at local, reference, or public health laboratories (PHLs). There are numerous reasons for this, including challenges associated with accurate assay interpretation and maintaining technological expertise, limited specimen stability or availability for assay validation, and reagent accessibility. However, with the continued increase in syphilis rates, including primary syphilis, hospitals and laboratories may need to re-evaluate the need for direct detection methods, particularly in areas of the United States with a high incidence of disease. This literature review provides an updated summary of the utility and performance characteristics of direct detection techniques for T. pallidum.

### Performance of treponemal tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^117Q76ue]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Treponemal immunoassays are increasingly used for syphilis screening with the reverse sequence algorithm. There are few data describing performance of treponemal immunoassays compared to traditional treponemal tests in patients with and without syphilis.

Methods

We calculated sensitivity and specificity of 7 treponemal assays: (1) ADVIA Centaur (chemiluminescence immunoassay [CIA]); (2) Bioplex 2200 (microbead immunoassay); (3) fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS); (4) INNO-LIA (line immunoassay); (5) LIAISON CIA; (6) Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA); and (7) Trep-Sure (enzyme immunoassay [EIA]), using a reference standard combining clinical diagnosis and serology results. Sera were collected between May 2012-January 2013. Cases were characterized as: (1) current clinical diagnosis of syphilis: primary, secondary, early latent, late latent; (2) prior treated syphilis only; (3) no evidence of current syphilis, no prior history of syphilis, and at least 4 of 7 treponemal tests negative.

Results

Among 959 participants, 262 had current syphilis, 294 had prior syphilis, and 403 did not have syphilis. FTA-ABS was less sensitive for primary syphilis (78.2%) than the immunoassays or TPPA (94.5%-96.4%) (all P ≤ .01). All immunoassays were 100% sensitive for secondary syphilis, 95.2%-100% sensitive for early latent disease, and 86.8%-98.5% sensitive in late latent disease. TPPA had 100% specificity.

Conclusions

Treponemal immunoassays demonstrated excellent sensitivity for secondary, early latent, and seropositive primary syphilis. Sensitivity of FTA-ABS in primary syphilis was poor. Given its high specificity and superior sensitivity, TPPA is preferred to adjudicate discordant results with the reverse sequence algorithm over the FTA-ABS.

### Anti-Treponema pallidum IgA response as a potential diagnostic marker of syphilis [^11224tap]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Serological tests for syphilis detect mainly total Ig, IgM or IgG antibodies. We aimed to evaluate the specific IgA response in syphilis patients according to disease stage.

Methods

A serum IgA-enzyme immunoassay was developed using commercially available microplates coated with recombinant treponemal antigens and an anti-IgA-conjugate. To define a cut-off, we used 91 syphilis positive and 136 negative sera previously defined by the rapid plasma reagin and the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination results. Then we determined the intra- and inter-assay precisions, diagnostic sensitivity according to the clinical stage (in 66, 55 and 42 sera from primary, secondary and latent syphilis patients, respectively) and specificity (in 211 sera from people with conditions different to syphilis). IgA values were further measured in 71 sera from patients with previously treated syphilis.

Results

The newly developed IgA-enzyme immunoassay showed a good discrimination between negative and positive samples with intra- and inter-assay variation coefficients < 20%. The sensitivity was 80.3% (95% CI, 70.0–90.6), 100.0% (95% CI, 99.1–100.0) and 95.2% (95% CI, 87.6–100.0) in primary, secondary and latent syphilis, respectively, and the specificity was 98.1% (95% CI, 96.0–100.0). Further, IgA values were negative in 61.3% (38/62) of patients with previously treated syphilis.

Discussion

Our findings suggest serum IgA as a sensitive and specific marker of syphilis and its detection could be used as a screening assay for active infection. Further evaluation is needed in prospective longitudinal field studies.

What should I do with inconclusive results?

Generally, inconclusive results arise in early infection or from waning antibody levels in late infection. The most common combinations are:

A positive RPR with negative treponemal screening (EIA/CLIA) and confirmatory tests (TPPA) suggests the RPR result is a false positive
A positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with negative confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR is likely a false positive but could indicate early infection
A positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with indeterminant confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR could represent waning antibody levels after a previous, treated infection or a new infection.

When results are inconclusive, clinicians should inquire about previous syphilis infection and treatment, and, if early syphilis is possible, retest in two to four weeks. If results are unchanged, interpretation is based on history — consider the possibility of late untreated infection, treated infection, or non-venereal treponemal disease in adults from endemic countries in South and Central America, South-East Asia, and Africa.

Direct Fluorescence Antibody

Direct fluorescence antibody testing for T. pallidum can be performed as an alternative to DFM on serous fluid collected from syphilitic lesions, and on other body fluids (eg, CSF, AF, etc). This method involves application and ethanol fixation of the specimen to a microscope slide, followed by staining with either fluorescently conjugated monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to T. pallidum and examination for the presence of fluorescent spirochetes. Although such antibodies may be available commercially, none are currently FDA cleared for use in clinical laboratories. A key advantage of DFA over DFM includes the ability to submit air-dried or acetone-fixed samples to the laboratory for examination, circumventing the DFM requirement of immediate evaluation. Additionally, although technologist expertise is still necessary, interpretation of DFA is significantly more straightforward (ie, presence or absence of sufficient fluorescence) than DFM, which depends on accurate assessment of spirochete morphology and motility consistent with T. pallidum. Among the included studies in this review, 2 evaluated performance of the H9–1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) to T. pallidum in primary and secondary lesions, with a sensitivity ranging from 73% to 100% and specificity of 100% compared with DFM (Table 1). The H9–1 mAb is specific to T. pallidum and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue (T. pertenue), detecting a 47 to 48 kDa protein from T. pallidum, and does not react with other commensal spirochetes. Therefore, DFA using this antibody may be performed on oral or anogenital specimens with limited risk of false-positive results. A single study evaluating polyclonal antibodies for DFA on syphilitic lesions was included in this review, which showed high sensitivity and specificity, 84% to 87% and 91% to 100%, respectively, compared with either DFM alone or with a clinical diagnosis based on history, DFM, and syphilis serology results among 350 patients. Overall, despite the similar sensitivity observed between polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for DFA, use of the H9–1 mAb is preferred due to higher associated specificity as compared with polyclonal antibodies. However, these studies were all performed decades ago, with no recent publications evaluating DFA, underscoring the limited accessibility of reagents and utility of this method in current clinical practice.

### Syphilis laboratory guidelines: performance characteristics of nontreponemal antibody tests [^112Ugc9y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Since Treponema pallidum cannot be cultured, and direct detection methods are not routinely available in most clinical settings, the detection of nonspecific or nontreponemal and treponemal antibodies forms the mainstay of syphilis laboratory diagnoses. Of note, the terms "nonspecific" or "nontreponemal" antibodies would be more accurately termed "antiphospholipid" antibodies, since they represent host antibodies made in response to phosphatidylcholine taken up from mammalian tissue by T. pallidum. However, these terms are commonly used in the literature and in clinical practice, so we have elected, for clarity, to use them in this document. For further discussion of treponemal-specific antibodies, please see Park et al in this issue. Antiphospholipid antibodies are used in combination with treponemal antibodies in the clinical context to help diagnose infections with T. pallidum. The primary antiphospholipid antibody tests in current use are the rapid plasma reagin (RPR), the venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) and, to a much lesser extent, the toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST) and unheated serum reagin. Both nonautomated and automated platforms are available to detect these antibodies. Nontreponemal tests are generally performed on serum, but some may also be performed on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to aid in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Finally, nontreponemal antibody titers are used to monitor treatment responses, although this is not the focus of this review.

The diagnosis of any syphilis stage relies on a clinical evaluation of patient symptoms and medical history, as well as on an interpretation of laboratory tests. As syphilis rates continue to rise throughout the United States, there is a need to systematically identify the performance characteristics of nontreponemal tests to aid laboratorians as they seek to provide support to clinicians for syphilis diagnoses. We sought to review the literature to address this question: what are the performance characteristics, stratified by the stage of syphilis, for nontreponemal serologic tests?

### Performance assessment of treponemal and nontreponemal tests for the diagnosis of acquired syphilis [^111kg2sh]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Diagnostic performance of three commercial IgG T. pallidum immunoassays for the diagnosis of syphilis by using anti- T. pallidum -positive (all clinical stages; n = 187) and anti- T. pallidum -negative (n = 192) samples

To evaluate the heterogeneity of IgG detection by all three commercial T. pallidum immunoassays due to different clinical stages of syphilis, sensitivities were compared using samples from individuals with primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis (Table 2). We found positivity in all 31 positive samples from individuals with primary syphilis tested with the recombinant ELISA, whereas 96.8% (30/31) of the samples tested with the VDRL and FTA-ABS tests were positive. Among samples from individuals with secondary syphilis (n = 77), ELISA detected IgG in 100% of samples, and both the VDRL and FTA-ABS tests detected IgG in 98.7% (76/77) of samples. Sensitivity in individuals with late latent disease (n = 79) was 100% for samples tested with the ELISA, 97.5% (77/79) for samples tested with the VDRL test, and 93.7% (74/79) for samples tested with the FTA-ABS test. Regardless of clinical stage, no significant differences were found between tests.

Table 2
Sensitivity of three commercial IgG T. pallidum immunoassays for the diagnosis of syphilis, by clinical stage

All three commercial assays were performed to evaluate cross-reactivity against antibodies from unrelated diseases by using a panel of 323 serum samples (individual data points and results are available in). As shown in Table 3, a higher incidence of cross-reactivity was observed when serum samples were tested with the ELISA and the FTA-ABS test, especially for sexually transmitted viral infections. The highest incidence in samples tested with the FTA-ABS test was observed for HCV (14.7%), followed by HIV (12.5%), HBV (8.8%), and HTLV (7.4%). No cross-reactivity was observed when the VDRL test was used.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Early-stage syphilis diagnosis in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection: Early-stage disease in persons with HIV infection is identified using the same diagnostic tests used in persons without HIV infection — darkfield microscopy of mucocutaneous lesions and standard serologic tests — and results with VDRL and RPR may be higher, lower (in rare instances), or delayed in early-stage syphilis. No data indicate that treponemal tests perform differently among persons with HIV infection, although uncommon, false-negative serologic tests can occur with documented T. pallidum infection. Therefore, if serologic tests do not support the diagnosis of syphilis, presumptive treatment is recommended if syphilis is suspected and other tests should be considered, including repeat serology in 2–4 weeks.

DISCUSSION

Here, we demonstrate that several commercial TPHAs have analytical performance characteristics comparable to those of Serodia TPPA. Importantly, when compared with active untreated syphilis status, three of the commercial TPHAs included in this study had equivalent sensitivity to the TPPA and two had a specificity of > 99%. By contrast, the PPA of the T. pallidum IgG ELISA was < 95% compared to the Serodia TPPA and had a clinical sensitivity < 95%, including for diagnosis of primary, secondary, and late latent disease. The detailed laboratory validation of the single TPHA available in our setting demonstrated excellent PPA and comparable NPA compared to TPPA across a range of clinical sera, plasma, and quality assurance samples, including a specific cross-reactivity panel. It also performed well in the assessment of reproducibility, repeatability, and inter-reader variability, with only a small number of samples recording a final equivocal result.
