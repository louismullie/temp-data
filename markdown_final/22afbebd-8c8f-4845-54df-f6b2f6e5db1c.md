## Question

Left vs right heart failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differences between left and right heart failure, including definitions, pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostics, prognosis, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and classification. Then, I should compare underlying etiologies and mechanisms. Next, I will contrast clinical presentations and diagnostic approaches. After that, I need to evaluate prognosis and outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize management principles and highlight key distinctions and overlaps, making sure I verify each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and classification so I don't build on a shaky foundation. Left heart failure refers to failure of the left ventricle to maintain adequate forward output and/or accommodate venous return, typically categorized as HFrEF or HFpEF, whereas right heart failure is a clinical syndrome of signs and symptoms resulting from right ventricular dysfunction with inadequate RV output despite adequate preload, often secondary to left-sided disease or pulmonary vascular disease rather than primary RV cardiomyopathy, and biventricular failure is common in practice [^e673e58f] [^5c6631e1] [^0c958057].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms before I verify the dominant etiologies. Left heart failure commonly arises from ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, valvular disease, and infiltrative or genetic myopathies, whereas right heart failure is most often secondary to increased RV afterload from left-sided HF with pulmonary hypertension, intrinsic lung disease, pulmonary embolism, or pulmonary arterial hypertension, with primary RV cardiomyopathies like ARVC being less common, and ventricular interdependence means RV dilation and septal shift can impair LV filling, creating a vicious cycle in biventricular disease [^e673e58f] [^1fa468e4] [^2efaaa8a] [^a87cd696].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology figures so I don't overstate them. I initially recalled an incidence of RHF around 500 per 100,000 person-years, but I should double-check the source credibility; that estimate comes from a lower-credibility review, so I will qualify it accordingly, while noting that RV dysfunction is common in HFrEF cohorts and carries adverse prognosis, and that HFpEF accounts for roughly half of HF hospitalizations with RV dysfunction increasingly recognized as prognostically important in this population [^4e413fd7] [^8752f8a4] [^0c958057].

> I will now examine clinical presentation, and I need to ensure I separate classic patterns from exceptions. Left heart failure typically presents with dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, pulmonary crackles, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema, whereas right heart failure manifests with elevated jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, ascites, early satiety, and right upper quadrant discomfort; importantly, isolated acute RHF lacks pulmonary edema, so if edema is present, I should suspect combined disease or left-sided contribution, and in chronic RHF, cachexia and coagulopathy can emerge from sustained venous congestion and underperfusion [^101f776f] [^6ea69793] [^7a4cada7] [^aac45845].

> Next, I should review diagnostics, and I need to check which tests best distinguish mechanisms. Echocardiography is first-line to assess ventricular size and function, valvular lesions, and pulmonary pressures, with TAPSE, RV fractional area change, and tissue Doppler helping quantify RV function; natriuretic peptides reflect hemodynamic congestion but are less specific for isolated RHF and have prognostic value in PAH-associated RHF; cardiac MRI is the gold standard for RV volumes and fibrosis; and right heart catheterization clarifies pulmonary hemodynamics and is recommended when PH is suspected or when evaluating advanced HF therapies, with hemodynamic profiles distinguishing precapillary from postcapillary PH and guiding therapy [^03322766] [^29d0aa8c] [^211e42c9] [^0034f52f] [^cd02ea1c].

> Let me consider prognosis carefully, and I should confirm which markers carry the most weight. RV dysfunction independently predicts mortality in HFrEF and HFpEF, with meta-analytic data suggesting approximately a 2.4-fold increase in mortality when RVD is present in acute HF cohorts, and in PAH, RV failure is the leading cause of death; in acute RHF syndromes such as massive PE or RV infarction, early mortality is high, and in chronic RHF, multiorgan dysfunction from venous congestion compounds risk, with tricuspid regurgitation severity further stratifying risk even after accounting for pulmonary pressures and LVEF [^8752f8a4] [^0a75dbd2] [^76a47638].

> I should confirm management principles and avoid overgeneralizing from left-sided HF therapies. For left HF, guideline-directed medical therapy with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors reduces morbidity and mortality, whereas for isolated RHF, evidence for neurohormonal blockade is limited and mixed, and therapy should prioritize treating the underlying cause such as pulmonary hypertension, correcting volume status, optimizing RV preload and afterload, and considering mechanical support or transplantation in refractory cases; in LVAD candidates, RV failure risk stratification and preparedness for RV support are essential, and in selected RHF from severe TR, tricuspid valve intervention may be considered when medical therapy fails [^d279f105] [^52942a34] [^21788bff] [^827aa52d] [^bc787646].

> But wait, what if the presentation is mixed or the hemodynamics are equivocal; I need to ensure I account for ventricular interdependence and pericardial constraint. RV dilation can compress the LV and reduce transmural filling pressure, so unloading the left side can secondarily improve RV function, and conversely, acute RV pressure overload can precipitate systemic hypotension and shock; recognizing these dynamics helps me decide when isolated LV support may suffice versus when biventricular support is needed in acute decompensation [^2efaaa8a] [^a87cd696] [^21788bff].

> Let me reconsider the key distinctions to avoid conflating entities. Left heart failure is typically a primary myocardial or valvular disorder with forward flow failure and pulmonary congestion, whereas right heart failure is most often a secondary syndrome driven by increased RV afterload with systemic venous congestion; left HF therapies are well established, whereas right HF lacks disease-specific pharmacotherapies and relies on treating the precipitant, meticulous volume and afterload management, and selective use of surgery or mechanical support, with prognosis tightly linked to RV function and the severity of pulmonary vascular disease or tricuspid regurgitation [^e673e58f] [^5c6631e1] [^0a75dbd2] [^76a47638].

Left heart failure (LHF) is primarily due to **left ventricular dysfunction** [^0c958057] from ischemia, hypertension, or valvular disease, causing pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, and orthopnea [^85bf718b]. Right heart failure (RHF) is most often **secondary to LHF or pulmonary disease** [^e673e58f], leading to systemic venous congestion, peripheral edema, and hepatomegaly [^101f776f]. LHF is managed with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) [^d279f105], while RHF care focuses on treating the underlying cause, volume control, and selective use of pulmonary vasodilators or mechanical support [^211e42c9] [^827aa52d]. RHF carries a **worse prognosis** [^8752f8a4] and is less responsive to standard HF therapies, underscoring the need for early recognition and targeted interventions [^b297258c].

## Pathophysiology

### Left heart failure

- **Primary causes**: ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies [^notfound].
- **Mechanism**: impaired LV contractility or relaxation reduces cardiac output and increases left atrial pressure, causing pulmonary congestion and edema [^0c958057].
- **Ventricular interdependence**: elevated LV filling pressures can indirectly affect RV function via septal shift and pericardial constraint [^2efaaa8a].

---

### Right heart failure

- **Primary causes**: pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, chronic lung disease, and congenital heart disease [^0a75dbd2].
- **Mechanism**: increased RV afterload or intrinsic RV dysfunction reduces RV output, causing systemic venous congestion and organ dysfunction [^7a527f71].
- **Ventricular interdependence**: RV dilation and septal shift impair LV filling, reducing cardiac output [^2efaaa8a].

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Left heart failure

For LHF, **echocardiography** assesses LV function, wall motion abnormalities, and valvular disease [^notfound], while **biomarkers** such as BNP/NT-proBNP reflect elevated LV filling pressures and aid diagnosis and monitoring [^1002fbde].

---

### Right heart failure

For RHF, **echocardiography** evaluates RV size and function, tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary pressures [^03322766]; **right heart catheterization** confirms pulmonary hypertension and guides therapy [^0034f52f]; and **biomarkers** such as BNP/NT-proBNP and troponin indicate RV strain and prognosis [^29d0aa8c].

---

## Management strategies

### Left heart failure

- **Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)**: ACE inhibitors/ARBs, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors [^notfound].
- **Device therapy**: ICDs and CRT for selected patients [^notfound].
- **Mechanical support**: LVADs or transplantation in advanced cases [^01391e61].

---

### Right heart failure

- **Treat underlying cause**: pulmonary hypertension management, thrombolysis for PE, correction of congenital lesions [^211e42c9].

- **Mechanical support**: RVADs or ECMO in refractory cases [^21788bff].

---

## Prognosis

LHF prognosis varies with etiology and treatment response; **modern GDMT significantly improves outcomes** [^notfound]. RHF generally carries a **worse prognosis** [^8752f8a4], particularly when due to pulmonary hypertension or RV infarction, and is less responsive to standard HF therapies [^b297258c].

---

## Key differences

| **Parameter** | **Left heart failure** | **Right heart failure** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary cause | LV dysfunction | RV afterload or intrinsic RV disease |
| Clinical features | Pulmonary congestion | Systemic venous congestion |
| Diagnostic focus | LV function, valvular disease | RV function, pulmonary pressures |
| Management | GDMT, devices, transplant | Treat cause, volume control, vasodilators, mechanical support |
| Prognosis | Variable, improving with therapy | Generally worse, limited therapies |

---

Left and right heart failure differ in etiology, presentation, and management, with RHF often secondary to LHF or pulmonary disease and carrying a **worse prognosis**. Effective care requires **targeted therapy** for the underlying cause and careful attention to ventricular interdependence.

Right-sided heart failure (RHF) and right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) — definitions and clinical scope are delineated as follows: RVD, defined as evidence of abnormal right ventricle (RV) structure or function, is associated with poor clinical outcomes independently of the underlying mechanism of disease across the spectrum of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) in patients with acute and chronic heart failure (HF), after cardiac surgery, acute myocardial infarction (MI), congenital heart disease (CHD), and pulmonary hypertension (PH). To distinguish RHF from structural RVD, RHF is defined as a clinical syndrome with signs and symptoms of HF resulting from RVD, and RHF is caused by the inability of the RV to support optimal circulation in the presence of adequate preload. The statement provides evidence-based guidance on pathophysiology of RVD, assessment and evaluation of RV function, epidemiology and prognosis of RHF, and medical and surgical management of acute and chronic RHF, and proposes areas for future investigation.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^2efaaa8a]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Ventricular interdependence in right-sided heart failure — Pathological increases in right ventricular (RV) filling pressures are transmitted to the interventricular septum, and pericardial constraint produces a leftward septal shift that alters left ventricular (LV) geometry; these changes contribute to reduced cardiac output by decreasing LV distensibility, preload, and ventricular elastance and adversely affecting LV diastolic filling, while elevated RV end-diastolic pressure with pericardial constraint distorts ventricular geometry and impairs RV contractile function.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^0a75dbd2]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association scientific statement on right-sided heart failure (RHF) describes diverse causes including primary cardiomyopathies with right ventricular (RV) involvement, RV ischemia and infarction, volume loading from congenital heart disease and valvular pathologies, and pressure loading from pulmonic stenosis or pulmonary hypertension, with progressive RV dysfunction associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Chronic RHF is associated with decreased exercise tolerance, poor functional capacity, decreased cardiac output, progressive end-organ damage from venous congestion and underperfusion, cachexia from poor absorption of nutrients, and a systemic proinflammatory state, and it is the principal cause of death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Acute RHF is associated with hemodynamic instability and is the primary cause of death in patients with massive pulmonary embolism, RV myocardial infarction, and postcardiotomy shock associated with cardiac surgery. Functional assessment of the right side of the heart can be hindered by complex geometry, and multiple hemodynamic and biochemical markers are associated with worsening RHF and can serve to guide clinical assessment and therapeutic decision making. The statement notes that pharmacological and mechanical interventions targeting isolated acute and chronic RHF have not been well investigated and that specific therapies promoting stabilization and recovery of RV function are lacking.

Physiology of the right ventricle — normal RV function is governed by systemic venous return, pulmonary artery (PA) load (RV afterload), pericardial compliance, and native contractility of the RV free wall and interventricular septum; generating RV output requires one sixth the energy expenditure of the LV because much of RV stroke work maintains forward momentum of blood flow into a highly compliant, low-resistance pulmonary circulation.

Background and Purpose

The diverse causes of right-sided heart failure (RHF) include, among others, primary cardiomyopathies with right ventricular (RV) involvement, RV ischemia and infarction, volume loading caused by cardiac lesions associated with congenital heart disease and valvular pathologies, and pressure loading resulting from pulmonic stenosis or pulmonary hypertension from a variety of causes, including left-sided heart disease. Progressive RV dysfunction in these disease states is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this scientific statement is to provide guidance on the assessment and management of RHF.

Methods

The writing group used systematic literature reviews, published translational and clinical studies, clinical practice guidelines, and expert opinion/statements to summarize existing evidence and to identify areas of inadequacy requiring future research. The panel reviewed the most relevant adult medical literature excluding routine laboratory tests using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science through September 2017. The document is organized and classified according to the American Heart Association to provide specific suggestions, considerations, or reference to contemporary clinical practice recommendations.

Results

Chronic RHF is associated with decreased exercise tolerance, poor functional capacity, decreased cardiac output and progressive end-organ damage (caused by a combination of end-organ venous congestion and underperfusion), and cachexia resulting from poor absorption of nutrients, as well as a systemic proinflammatory state. It is the principal cause of death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Similarly, acute RHF is associated with hemodynamic instability and is the primary cause of death in patients presenting with massive pulmonary embolism, RV myocardial infarction, and postcardiotomy shock associated with cardiac surgery. Functional assessment of the right side of the heart can be hindered by its complex geometry. Multiple hemodynamic and biochemical markers are associated with worsening RHF and can serve to guide clinical assessment and therapeutic decision making. Pharmacological and mechanical interventions targeting isolated acute and chronic RHF have not been well investigated. Specific therapies promoting stabilization and recovery of RV function are lacking.

Conclusions

RHF is a complex syndrome including diverse causes, pathways, and pathological processes. In this scientific statement, we review the causes and epidemiology of RV dysfunction and the pathophysiology of acute and chronic RHF and provide guidance for the management of the associated conditions leading to and caused by RHF.

Figure 12 — mechanical circulatory support selection in right ventricular (RV) failure emphasizes that in biventricular dysfunction clinicians must discriminate patients with primary RV involvement necessitating true biventricular support from those with right-sided heart failure caused primarily by left-sided heart disease, among whom left ventricular (LV) mechanical circulatory support alone may provide adequate cardiac support given secondary unloading of the RV after LV decompression; clinician experience and estimations of the probability of recovery guide decisions on the need for durable versus temporary devices, and the presence of pulmonary disease also influences device selection; abbreviations include BiVAD (biventricular assist device), ECMO (extracorporeal membrane support), LVAD (left ventricular assist device), and RVAD (right ventricular assist device).

### The right heart and its distinct mechanisms of development, function, and failure [^d0c2d66d]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2008). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure is the most common cause of hospitalization in the United States for people over the age of sixty-five. As the population ages, the morbidity and mortality from heart failure will become more prevalent. Left heart failure has been, and continues to be, extensively studied. However, a recent report from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute suggests that the right heart has been relatively under-investigated, and unfortunately, most of the basic mechanisms of intracellular signaling within the right heart still remain poorly understood. Right heart failure is now being increasingly recognized as distinctly different from left heart failure, and an important mediator of overall cardiovascular collapse. The purpose of this review, therefore, is to discuss the current understanding of right heart cellular development, physiology, and pathophysiology, as well as to review therapeutic interventions that are both currently available and under investigation.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — prevalence and prognostic impact of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) — RVD is common and adverse in HFrEF, with a meta-analysis prevalence of 48%, RVD seen in ≈60% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, a higher proportion in nonischemic versus ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (65% versus 16%), and 48% of patients undergoing echocardiography during acute HF hospitalization having RVD; these patients had a 2.4-fold increased risk of mortality, and the presence of RVD is described as universally associated with increased mortality.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^6ea69793]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute right-sided heart failure (ARHF) — clinical features are characterized by acute RV dilatation with ventricular interdependence limiting LV filling, reduced RV forward flow, and elevated systemic venous pressure; patients typically show signs of hypoperfusion and hypotension (diaphoresis, listlessness, cyanosis, cool extremities, hypoperfusion, and tachycardia), and pulmonary edema is not consistent with isolated ARHF but suggests ARHF combined with or secondary to left-sided heart failure (LHF).

### Right side of the heart pulmonary circulation unit involvement in left-sided heart failure: diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications [^f3928478]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Although long neglected, the right side of the heart (RH) is now widely accepted as a pivotal player in heart failure (HF) either with reduced or preserved ejection fraction. The chronic overload of the pulmonary microcirculation results in an initial phase characterized by right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, right atrial dilation, and diastolic dysfunction. This progresses to overt RH failure when RV dilation and systolic dysfunction lead to RV-pulmonary arterial (RV-PA) uncoupling with low RV output. In the context of its established relevance to progression of HF, clinicians should consider assessment of the RH with information from clinical assessment, biomarkers, and imaging. Notably, no single parameter can predict prognosis alone in HF. Assessments simultaneously should encompass RV systolic function, pulmonary pressures, an estimation of RV-PA coupling, and RH morphologic features. Despite a large volume of evidence indicating the relevance of RH function to the clinical syndrome of HF, evidence-based management strategies are lacking. Targeting RH dysfunction in HF should be an objective of future investigations, being an unmet need in the current management of HF.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of chronic right-sided heart failure and tricuspid regurgitation. A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association (HFA) and the European association of percutaneous cardiovascular interventions (EAPCI) of the ESC [^996f8941]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Right-sided heart failure and tricuspid regurgitation are common and strongly associated with poor quality of life and an increased risk of heart failure hospitalizations and death. While medical therapy for right-sided heart failure is limited, treatment options for tricuspid regurgitation include surgery and, based on recent developments, several transcatheter interventions. However, the patients who might benefit from tricuspid valve interventions are yet unknown, as is the ideal time for these treatments given the paucity of clinical evidence. In this context, it is crucial to elucidate aetiology and pathophysiological mechanisms leading to right-sided heart failure and tricuspid regurgitation in order to recognize when tricuspid regurgitation is a mere bystander and when it can cause or contribute to heart failure progression. Notably, early identification of right heart failure and tricuspid regurgitation may be crucial and optimal management requires knowledge about the different mechanisms and causes, clinical course and presentation, as well as possible treatment options. The aim of this clinical consensus statement is to summarize current knowledge about epidemiology, pathophysiology and treatment of tricuspid regurgitation in right-sided heart failure providing practical suggestions for patient identification and management.

Digoxin — evidence for use in right heart failure (RHF) associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) is limited and mixed; early small studies reported acute increases in cardiac output (CO) or right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), whereas other studies showed no improvement in exercise capacity or RVEF, and a meta-analysis did not find improvements in RVEF, exercise capacity, or New York Heart Association class; overall, long-term clinical efficacy in RHF remains unknown.

Right-sided mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in acute right heart failure — monitoring and triggers for deployment: Patients with biventricular dysfunction who receive isolated left ventricular (LV) support should be closely monitored for clinical deterioration, and evidence of worsening right heart failure (RHF) should lead to rapid deployment of right ventricular (RV) mechanical support; common indications for right-sided MCS use in acute RHF include acute RHF after left ventricular assist device (LVAD), heart transplantation, right ventricular myocardial infarction (RVMI), and myocarditis.

### Right heart dysfunction and failure in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: mechanisms and management. position statement on behalf of the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^df1fcbc3]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

There is an unmet need for effective treatment strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Until recently, attention in patients with HFpEF was almost exclusively focused on the left side. However, it is now increasingly recognized that right heart dysfunction is common and contributes importantly to poor prognosis in HFpEF. More insights into the development of right heart dysfunction in HFpEF may aid to our knowledge about this complex disease and may eventually lead to better treatments to improve outcomes in these patients. In this position paper from the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology, the Committee on Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction reviews the prevalence, diagnosis, and pathophysiology of right heart dysfunction and failure in patients with HFpEF. Finally, potential treatment strategies, important knowledge gaps and future directions regarding the right side in HFpEF are discussed.

### Right heart phenotype in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^476b80b4]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

The health burden of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is increasingly recognized. Despite improvements in diagnostic algorithms and established knowledge on the clinical trajectory, effective treatment options for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction remain limited, mainly because of the high mechanistic heterogeneity. Diagnostic scores, big data, and phenomapping categorization are proposed as key steps needed for progress. In the meantime, advancements in imaging techniques combined to high-fidelity pressure signaling analysis have uncovered right ventricular dysfunction as a mediator of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction progression and as major independent determinant of poor outcome. This review summarizes the current understanding of the pathophysiology of right ventricular dysfunction in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction covering the different right heart phenotypes and offering perspectives on new treatments targeting the right ventricle in its function and geometry.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^a87cd696]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Right-sided heart failure (RHF) decompensation and chronic remodeling — Declining pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in the setting of high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is an ominous clinical finding; with an intact pericardium, right ventricular (RV) dilation compresses the left ventricular (LV) cavity, impeding LV filling and equalizing biventricular diastolic pressures, and although patients with chronic right heart failure (CRHF) may require higher RV end-diastolic pressure, reduced LV filling is more likely caused by RV dilation and ventricular interdependence than reduced RV forward output; increased transmural pressure from RV dilation with pericardial constraint impairs LV filling, and the combination of RV systolic and biventricular diastolic dysfunction reduces cardiac output, impairs coronary blood flow, and exacerbates peripheral and abdominal congestion; venous congestion also negatively affects hepatic and renal function; CRHF most commonly results from gradual increases in RV afterload caused by pulmonary hypertension (PH) most frequently from left HF, although chronic volume overload from right-sided lesions such as tricuspid regurgitation can also lead to its development; if the load persists, the RV transitions to a decompensated phenotype characterized by myocyte loss and replacement/fibrosis.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^7a4cada7]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic right heart failure (CRHF) — peripheral edema is often the most prominent clinical feature; early stages may have mild symptoms, but as RV function worsens reduction in cardiac output leads to progressive exercise intolerance and fatigue; atrial tachyarrhythmias are common with elevated RAP and can lead to hemodynamic deterioration, and ventricular tachycardia and heart block are additional electrophysiological complications; in patients with pulmonary hypertension, CRHF closely correlates with increased morbidity and mortality; compared with primary left heart failure, CRHF involves increased central venous pressure and reduced LV filling from ventricular interdependence as a consequence of RV dilation; in later stages with reduced systemic output, impaired end-organ function may result from both elevated central venous filling pressures and reduced cardiac output, with increased systemic venous pressure impeding lung lymphatic drainage and exacerbating pulmonary edema and pleural effusions; the organs most affected are the kidneys and liver, with the gastrointestinal tract implicated.

### Right heart failure: toward a common language [^8ba265b0]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

In this perspective, the International Right Heart Foundation Working Group moves a step forward to develop a common language to describe the development and defects that exemplify the common syndrome of right heart failure. We first propose fundamental definitions of the distinctive components of the right heart circulation and provide consensus on a universal definition of right heart failure. These definitions will form the foundation for describing a uniform nomenclature for right heart circulatory failure with a view to foster collaborative research initiatives and conjoint education in an effort to provide insight into echanisms of disease unique to the right heart.

Biomarkers in right-sided heart failure (RHF) are described as follows: NT-proBNP may also be useful in patients with predominantly RHF but is relatively nonspecific; elevated BNP is observed in both LH and right-sided heart dysfunction and is not a reliable marker to distinguish the level of dysfunction within each ventricle; BNP, however, has emerged as a useful marker of prognosis in RHF accompanying PAH. The reliability of other biomarkers such as creatine phosphokinase-MB and troponins is less well established in the setting of RHF, elevated BNP and troponin have adverse prognostic implications in the setting of acute PE, and identifying novel RV-specific biomarkers may lead to targeted therapies for RHF.

Endothelin receptor antagonists — endothelin-1 is implicated in pulmonary hypertension (PH), and agents targeting endothelin receptors type A and B have been extensively studied in group 1 PH, with associations to improvements in heart failure (HF) symptoms, exercise capacity, hemodynamics, and time to clinical worsening, although studies did not explicitly select RHF; in HFrEF, phase II studies showed short-term hemodynamic benefits but phase III trials failed to improve morbidity or mortality.

### Anatomy, function, and dysfunction of the right Ventricle: JACC state-of-the-art review [^66b58319]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

There is increasing recognition of the crucial role of the right ventricle (RV) in determining functional status and prognosis in multiple conditions. The normal RV is anatomically and functionally different from the left ventricle, which precludes direct extrapolation of our knowledge of left-sided physiopathology to the right heart. RV adaptation is largely determined by the level of exposure to hemodynamic overload (both preload and afterload) as well as its intrinsic contractile function. These 3 processes (pressure overload, volume overload, and RV cardiomyopathy) are associated with distinct clinical course and therapeutic approach, although in reality they often coexist in various degrees. The close relationship between the RV and left ventricle (ventricular interdependence) and its coupling to the pulmonary circulation further modulate RV behavior in different clinical scenarios. In this review, the authors summarize current knowledge of RV anatomic, structural, metabolic, functional, and hemodynamic characteristics in both health and disease.

### Late right heart Failure after left ventricular assist device implantation: contemporary insights and future perspectives [^b575c239]. JACC: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Late right heart failure (RHF) is increasingly recognized in patients with long-term left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support and is associated with decreased survival and increased incidence of adverse events such as gastrointestinal bleeding and stroke. Progression of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction to clinical syndrome of late RHF in patients supported with LVAD is dependent on the severity of pre-existing RV dysfunction, persistent or worsening left- or right-sided valvular heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, inadequate or excessive left ventricular unloading, and/or progression of the underlying cardiac disease. RHF likely represents a continuum of risk with early presentation and progression to late RHF. However, de novo RHF develops in a subset of patients leading to increased diuretic requirement, arrhythmias, renal and hepatic dysfunction, and heart failure hospitalizations. The distinction between isolated late RHF and RHF due to left-sided contributions is lacking in registry studies and should be the focus of future registry data collection. Potential management strategies include optimization of RV preload and afterload, neurohormonal blockade, LVAD speed optimization, and treatment of concomitant valvular disease. In this review, the authors discuss definition, pathophysiology, prevention, and management of late RHF.

Postoperative acute right heart failure (ARHF) after cardiac surgery is associated with adverse outcomes; in a coronary artery bypass graft cohort, most patients did not show significant postoperative right ventricular (RV) functional change despite small strain reductions. Postoperative ARHF is associated with increased mortality, prolonged length of stay, and increased resource use, and most patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery did not demonstrate a significant postoperative change in RV function, although modest decreases in longitudinal strain were noted.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^dd5735d2]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) — acute and late right heart failure (RHF): Twenty percent or more of patients undergoing isolated LVAD implantation experience ARHF, and late RHF after discharge occurs in ≈10% of patients. Patients with a history of chemotherapy-associated cardiomyopathy appear to be at higher risk than those with other forms of nonischemic or ischemic disease. LV unloading with mechanical support may improve RV contractility via a reduction in PAP after the acute decline in PCWP associated with LVAD activation, but the converse is also noted that reductions in afterload may lead to reduced contractility. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a risk factor for the development of ARHF in LVAD recipients, and residual, fixed PH likely contributes to RV-PA uncoupling when intraoperative complications occur.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular size and function — impact of left-sided disease and pulmonary pressures: RV size and function can be adversely affected by left ventricular (LV) disease; patients with LV dysfunction secondary to myocardial infarction or heart failure are at increased risk for both RV dilatation and dysfunction, and RV dysfunction is one of the most powerful independent predictors of outcome following myocardial infarction even without overt RV infarction. Elevation in pulmonary pressures may directly contribute to alterations in RV size and function in patients with heart failure, and sleep apnea in heart failure may also contribute substantially. These data suggest that clinical assessment of the right ventricle can add incrementally to standard echocardiographic assessment in left-sided heart disease.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^b3216a20]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology of right heart failure (RHF) — acute RHF mechanisms and ventricular interdependence are detailed as follows: ARHF can occur because of abruptly increased right ventricular (RV) afterload (pulmonary embolus, hypoxia, acidemia) or decreased RV contractility (RV ischemia, myocarditis, postcardiotomy shock); in a healthy individual, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is < 1/10th of the systemic vascular resistance, and an acute increase in RV afterload such as from a large pulmonary embolism (PE) may abruptly decrease RV stroke volume (SV) with minimal increase in RV systolic pressure; acute reductions in RV contractility may be caused by direct myocardial injury such as myocardial inflammation (myocarditis) and ischemia; reduced RV SV results in RV dilatation that promotes tricuspid regurgitation (TR), exacerbates RV dilation, and drives a ventricular‑interdependent effect on left ventricular (LV) filling; ventricular interdependence is defined as forces transmitted through the myocardium and pericardium, and mechanical flattening with leftward septal shift increases LV end‑diastolic pressure, reduces LV transmural filling pressure, and impedes LV diastolic filling, contributing to systemic hypoperfusion; diastolic interaction is described as ventricular competition for diastolic distension/filling within an acutely confined pericardial space, whereas systolic interactions exist because it is estimated that 20% to 40% of RV systolic pressure results from LV contraction; elevated right‑sided filling pressures cause coronary sinus congestion, reducing coronary blood flow and provoking RV ischemia.

### Therapeutic left-to-right shunting in heart failure [^ae4fac62]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction is associated with elevated left atrial pressure at rest due to fluid overload or during exercise, leading to pulmonary venous congestion. Even with available treatments, heart failure hospitalizations remain high, and improvements in quality-of-life scores and functional capacity are modest. Thus, there is growing interest in non-pharmacological methods to decompress the left atrium and improve heart failure symptoms and outcomes. Left-to-right shunts have emerged as a potential therapeutic option to reduce left atrial hypertension, improve quality of life, and impact long-term outcomes. This nascent field carries both potential therapeutic promise and many unanswered questions. Recent data have questioned whether the effects of this therapy vary based on the left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary vascular resistance, and/or right ventricular structure and function. This review discusses the basis for left-to-right shunt therapies, synthesizes past and ongoing clinical trials, and offers future directions.

### Getting the "Right" perspective on angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibition in heart failure [^1fa468e4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The right and left ventricles conduct the same cardiac output under different loading conditions. The thick‐walled left ventricle thickens extensively in a radial orientation during systole, making it well suited to generate the high pressures necessary to perfuse the systemic circulation. This is reflected by its underlying myocardial architecture, with primarily radial myocyte orientation in midlayers, subendocardial myocytes following a right‐hand helix configuration, with subepicardial myocytes forming a left‐hand helix. 1 In contrast, the thin‐walled right ventricle (RV) ejects into a much lower impedance pulmonary circulation and is therefore poorly suited to generate pressure, making it highly sensitive to short‐ or long‐term increases in afterload. Because of the predominant longitudinal orientation of its myocytes, with angulated intrusion of superficial myocytes toward the endocardium, the RV contracts more like a bellow. 2

These fundamental morphological and functional differences between the right and left sides of the heart translate into a different spectrum of diseases. In isolated left‐sided heart failure (HF), an intrinsic cardiac insult typically initiates disease progression. This may take the form of a primary muscle disorder, ischemic or toxic injury to the myocyte, or myocardial consequences of a systemic disease that alter cardiac function. In contrast, right‐sided HF is rarely caused by a primarily cardiomyopathic process (< 8% of cases). 3 Rather, increased RV afterload secondary to left‐sided HF (46%), intrinsic lung disease (17%), pulmonary thromboembolic disease (18%), and pulmonary arterial hypertension (11%) are the predominant causes of right HF. As such, most therapies for the latter syndrome focus on reducing RV afterload, preferentially by treating the underlying disease process. But what if the RV response to afterload mismatch was targeted rather than the load itself in isolation?

Transplantation — In advanced refractory cRHF, transplantation can be considered after excluding reversible causes and assessing comorbidities; in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and cRHF with RAP > 15 mm Hg and a cardiac index < 2.0 L·min−1·m−2, prognosis is generally poor, and referral for transplantation should be considered. In carefully selected patients with cRHF from severe pulmonary vascular disease, heart-lung or double-lung transplantation can be considered. Outcomes for isolated heart transplantation are generally excellent, with 1-year survival ≈90% in the most recent era for all patients, but the presence of RVAD support before heart transplantation is associated with a relative mortality hazard of 3.03 after transplantation; after lung transplantation, 1-year survival is ≈84% for all patients in the most recent era.

### Right ventricular dysfunction in left-sided heart failure with preserved versus reduced ejection fraction [^7a3ab58f]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is recognized as a major prognostic factor in left-sided heart failure (HF). However, the relative contribution of RV dysfunction in HF with preserved (HFpEF) vs. reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is unclear.

Methods and Results

Right ventricular longitudinal strain (RVLS), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) were determined by echocardiography in 657 age- and gender-matched groups of patients with HFpEF [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%; n = 219] and HFrEF (LVEF < 50%; n = 219) and in controls without HF (n = 219) from an Asian population-based cohort study. Across control to HFpEF and HFrEF groups, RV function deteriorated as measured by RVLS (-26.7 ± 5%, -22.7 ± 6.6% and -18.2 ± 6.7%, respectively) and TAPSE (21.0 ± 3.9, 17.5 ± 5.1 and 14.7 ± 4.7mm, respectively), whereas PASP increased (26.8 ± 7.1, 34.5 ± 11.9 and 39.3 ± 16.2 mmHg, respectively) (all P < 0.001). Controlling for PASP in control, HFpEF and HFrEF subjects, the magnitude of RVLS/PASP (-1.06 ± 0.32, -0.75 ± 0.32 and -0.56 ± 0.36, respectively) and TAPSE/PASP ratios (0.83 ± 0.23, 0.54 ± 0.24 and 0.55 ± 0.29, respectively) similarly decreased across groups. Right ventricular dysfunction (by both TAPSE and RVLS) was independently associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and atrial fibrillation, but not with PASP. Among patients with HF, both TAPSE/PASP and RVLS/PASP ratios were related to the composite endpoint of all-cause death and HF hospitalization, even after multivariable adjustment [hazard ratio (HR) 0.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14–0.74 and HR 3.09; 95% CI 1.52–6.26, respectively], with no difference between HFrEF and HFpEF.

Conclusions

Right ventricular dysfunction is present in HFpEF and is even more pronounced in HFrEF for any given degree of pulmonary hypertension. It is independently predicted by left ventricular dysfunction but not by PASP. Right ventricular-arterial coupling is prognostically important in HF regardless of LVEF.

### Systemic consequences of pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure [^649181b7]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a feature of a variety of diseases and continues to harbor high morbidity and mortality. The main consequence of PH is right-sided heart failure which causes a complex clinical syndrome affecting multiple organ systems including left heart, brain, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, skeletal muscle, as well as the endocrine, immune, and autonomic systems. Interorgan crosstalk and interdependent mechanisms include hemodynamic consequences such as reduced organ perfusion and congestion as well as maladaptive neurohormonal activation, oxidative stress, hormonal imbalance, and abnormal immune cell signaling. These mechanisms, which may occur in acute, chronic, or acute-on-chronic settings, are common and precipitate adverse functional and structural changes in multiple organs which contribute to increased morbidity and mortality. While the systemic character of PH and right-sided heart failure is often neglected or underestimated, such consequences place additional burden on patients and may represent treatable traits in addition to targeted therapy of PH and underlying causes. Here, we highlight the current state-of-the-art understanding of the systemic consequences of PH and right-sided heart failure on multiple organ systems, focusing on self-perpetuating pathophysiological mechanisms, aspects of increased susceptibility of organ damage, and their reciprocal impact on the course of the disease.

Although pulmonary load is an important determinant of RV systolic function in PAH, there remains a significant variability in RV adaptation to pulmonary hypertension. In this report, the authors discuss the emerging concepts of right heart pathobiology in PAH. More specifically, the discussion focuses on the following questions. 1) How is right heart failure syndrome best defined? 2) What are the underlying molecular mechanisms of the failing right ventricle in PAH? 3) How are RV contractility and function and their prognostic implications best assessed? 4) What is the role of targeted RV therapy? Throughout the report, the authors highlight differences between right and left heart failure and outline key areas of future investigation.

Right ventricular myocardial infarction — Acute right ventricular myocardial infarction (RVMI) is prevalent in ≈50% of patients with an acute inferior myocardial infarction (MI), and RVMI is associated with hemodynamic compromise in 25% to 50% of patients presenting with this infarct pattern, although most patients recover right ventricular (RV) function within days to weeks after the infarct. One-year mortality after RVMI is reported to be 18% in patients with isolated right coronary artery lesions compared to 27% in the presence of combined right and left coronary artery disease, with long-term follow-up showing mortality beyond the first year at an additional 2%/y to 3%/y through year 10. In 1 series, mortality among patients with inferior MI with RVMI was 25% to 30% compared with 6% in patients without RVMI, and among 666 patients with acute MI undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation of 0.1 mV in lead V4R or VR and echocardiographic evidence of RVMI was associated with higher in-hospital and 1- and 6-month mortality; among MI with cardiogenic shock, 5% had a picture of predominant right heart failure (RHF).

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Substantial efforts have been made in studying the pathophysiology of heart failure due to its high prevalence and poor prognosis. Most of the previous studies have focused on left ventricular (LV) failure since the left ventricle plays a central role in supplying blood to the systemic circulation against strong resistance. Therefore, several medical therapies for heart failure have been developed, such as beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Right ventricular (RV) failure has not been a central issue because the right ventricle pumps blood solely to the pulmonary artery against weak resistance. However, accumulating evidence indicates that RV failure significantly contributes to the pathophysiology of various types of heart failure. RV failure is one of the most important predictors of symptoms and prognosis in patients with pure right-sided heart disease. Additionally, RV failure is a strong independent risk factor for survival in patients with LV failure. However, drugs developed for treating LV failure are not effective against RV failure, and no effective therapies specifically targeting RV failure exist.

Hence, we aimed to understand the RV failure pathophysiology and develop an effective treatment for RV failure. The right ventricle differs from the left ventricle in many ways, including its structure, function, and developmental origin –. In terms of cellular properties, cardiomyocytes in the right ventricle are different from those in the left ventricle. In humans, certain diseases predominantly affect the right ventricle. These findings indicate that the right ventricle has unique characteristics, and hence, there exist therapeutic targets specific to RV failure. Here, we focussed on the right ventricle to dissect the unique molecular signature of RV failure and develop a specific therapy. We believe our findings could pave way for development of RV failure-specific therapeutics.

### The politics of HFpEF – what's good for the left is good for the right… [^fc87beb4]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Among patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, right ventricular dysfunction is strongly associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. 1 The RV is especially sensitive to afterload, and abnormalities in the pulmonary circulation leading to increased RV afterload may play a critical role in driving the exercise intolerance and high risk of hospitalization characteristic of HFpEF. It is generally believed that among patients with heart failure, RV abnormalities are predominantly driven by backward transmission of elevated left ventricular or left atrial pressures into the pulmonary circulation, with subsequent abnormal loading of the RV. Therefore, there has been increasing interest in understanding the interactions between the RV and pulmonary artery, frequently referred to as RV-PA coupling. Gulati G, Litwin SE.

### Association of tricuspid regurgitation with mortality in heart failure with left-sided heart disease [^3a60ea66]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a surrogate marker indicative of right-sided cardiac conditions, often resulting from preceding left-sided heart disease or isolated remodeling of the tricuspid valve (TV) complex. Isolated TR without left-sided heart disease may have fewer detrimental effects on the survival and treatment outcomes. Prognostically, long-standing severe TR, typically accompanied by right ventricular dysfunction, is associated with deteriorating extracardiac organ function and a decline in the patient's physical condition owing to systemic congestion and low cardiac output. Recent advancements in recognizing the indications for TV reconstruction surgeries, along with the introduction of percutaneous TV interventions, have highlighted opportunities to improve the outcomes of patients undergoing these procedures.

Timely and optimized treatment targeting TR is critical for the management of patients with acute decompensated heart failure (HF), a condition characterized by severe disease progression. Nevertheless, current guideline recommendations focus on nonspecific medical management of symptoms and primary conditions related to HF, wherein concomitant TV surgery for patients who undergo left-sided valve surgery is solely indicated as class I. Isolated TV interventions may reduce the symptoms of right-sided HF, but their beneficial effects on excess mortality remain unclear. Furthermore, despite the robust association between TR and poor survival in a wide spectrum of left-sided heart diseases, the precise pathophysiology linked to patient outcomes remains unclear.

In this study, using data from a multicenter registry of hospitalized patients with acutely decompensated HF, we aimed to: 1) classify HF phenotypes based on underlying left-sided valve dysfunction (LVD); 2) analyze baseline characteristics, prevalence of TR, and outcomes of HF patients with left-sided heart disease; and 3) examine survival in patients with moderate or severe LVD.

### Right ventricular function across the spectrum of health and disease [^d56bd027]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Knowledge of right ventricular (RV) function in health and disease has historically lagged behind that of the left ventricle (LV). Early on, it was concluded that a normally functioning RV 'is not necessary for the maintenance of a normal circulation'and one whose function was limited to that of a conduit between the venous and pulmonary circuits. However, the centrality of the RV to normal cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology, as well as symptom burden and overall outcomes in cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, is increasingly recognised. Nevertheless, large gaps in knowledge persist regarding function of the RV in normal healthy individuals, as well as RV pathophysiology in cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, and finally, effective methods for managing RV dysfunction in these populations. The American Heart Association recently emphasised that 'It is remarkable how misunderstood are some basic concepts of right sided heart dysfunction among practicing clinicians and the impact that such misunderstanding can have on appropriate patient management'. Over the past several years, however, the RV has been increasingly scrutinised and new insights have been made, both by advanced imaging techniques and pressure-volume (PV) analysis, a gold standard method of characterising ventricular function. The epidemiology of RV dysfunction in cardiovascular disease has been previously reviewed. In this review, we provide a comprehensive yet concise review on advancements in understanding of RV physiology across the spectrum of health and disease, from elite athletes to normal healthy individuals, as well as RV function in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), pulmonary vascular disease, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and HFrEF patients supported by mechanical circulatory support. Finally, we highlight the centrality of the RV as evidenced by its impact on clinical outcomes, and emphasise knowledge gaps that must be overcome to improve outcomes in this area.

### Understanding chronic heart failure [^96877654]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

The key principles of chronic heart failure and the development of clinical management strategies are described. The physiological changes in chronic heart failure and the clinical management of children with heart failure are considered, but the treatment of heart failure related to congenital heart disease or the intensive care management of heart failure are not mentioned as both topics require consideration in their own right. A greater understanding of the maladaptive responses to chronic heart failure has enabled targeted therapy to be introduced with consequent improvement in symptoms, reduction in hospitalisation and lower mortality.

### Mechanistic basis for differential effects of interatrial shunt treatment in HFrEF vs HFpEF: the RELIEVE-HF trial [^dea269bd]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The RELIEVE-HF (REducing Lung congestion symptoms using the v-wavE shunt in adVancEd Heart Failure) trial randomized 508 patients with heart failure (HF) to interatrial shunt treatment vs placebo procedure. Randomization was stratified into 2 patient groups: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤ 40%); and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (LVEF > 40%). HF event rates (all-cause death, transplantation or left ventricular (LV) assist device, HF hospitalization or outpatient worsening) after shunt treatment during 2-year follow-up were directionally opposite: decreased by 51% in HFrEF, increased by 69% in HFpEF.

Objectives

This study aims to examine differences in cardiac structure and function before and after interatrial shunt placement in patients with HFrEF vs HFpEF that could underlie these discordant clinical outcomes.

Methods

Serial changes from baseline to 12 months in 17 transthoracic echocardiographic parameters in shunt-treated vs control patients in HFrEF vs HFpEF were assessed and compared by ANCOVA (analysis of covariance).

Results

In shunt-treated vs control patients with HFrEF, there were reductions in median LV end-diastolic volumes (-11.9 mL/m² [Q1-Q3: -21.3 to -2.5 mL/m²]; P = 0.01) and LV end-systolic volumes (-8.9 mL/m² [Q1-Q3: -17.2 to -20.7 mL/m²]; P = 0.01) indicative of reverse LV remodeling. There were no significant changes in right ventricular (RV), right atrial, or inferior vena cava sizes or pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP). In contrast, shunt-treated vs control patients with HFpEF did not have LV remodeling, but they had increased RV, right atrial, and inferior vena cava dimensions, and PASP also increased (4.7 mm Hg [Q1-Q3: 0.9–8.5 mm Hg]; P = 0.02). LV and RV diastolic compliance were decreased in HFpEF vs HFrEF at baseline and decreased further after shunt treatment in HFpEF.

Conclusions

Differential changes in left-sided and right-sided heart remodeling and PASP following interatrial shunt placement in patients with HFrEF vs HFpEF provide a mechanistic basis for the variable effects on clinical outcomes observed in RELIEVE-HF. (REducing Lung congestion symptoms using the v-wavE shunt in adVancEd Heart Failure [RELIEVE-HF]; NCT03499236).

### Right heart phenotype in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^6b98a660]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a major health problem that accounts for nearly one-half of HF hospitalizations. This clinical condition originates from an impaired left ventricular (LV) filling due to increased diastolic stiffness, reduced vascular compliance, and ventricular-vascular uncoupling associated with aging, hypertension, and obesity. Therapies aimed at reversing the hypertrophic LV phenotype–related diastolic stiffness and the decreased arterial compliance have been neutral or negative on hard end points shifting the attention to alternative targets of interventions. The LV backward hemodynamic failure becomes rapidly predominant in the manifestations of the syndrome, and most interest has been recently diverted on the right heart (RH) and the pulmonary microcirculation as mainstay contributors to disease progression. Evidence is being gathered that the study of the RH is of relevance for a diagnostic phenomappingand for a better understanding of its clinical trajectory.

This review details the current knowledge on HFpEF focusing on the RH phenotypes and discusses the pathophysiological and clinical implications along with the emerging hypotheses for targeting the right ventricle (RV) and its coupling with the pulmonary circulation (Pc) as key interventions for reversing the disease progression and the negative outcome.

### What role does the right side of the heart play in circulation? [^4a0678a8]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Right ventricular failure (RVF) is an underestimated problem in intensive care. This review explores the physiology and pathophysiology of right ventricular function and the pulmonary circulation. When RVF is secondary to an acute increase in afterload, the picture is one of acute cor pulmonale, as occurs in the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary embolism and sepsis. RVF can also be caused by right myocardial dysfunction. Pulmonary arterial catheterization and echocardiography are discussed in terms of their roles in diagnosis and treatment. Treatments include options to reduce right ventricular afterload, specific pulmonary vasodilators and inotropes.

### Right ventricular function across the spectrum of health and disease [^d4b45b19]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Knowledge of right ventricular (RV) structure and function has historically lagged behind that of the left ventricle (LV). However, advancements in invasive and non-invasive evaluations, combined with epidemiological analyses, have advanced the current understanding of RV (patho)physiology across the spectrum of health and disease, and reinforce the centrality of the RV in contributing to clinical outcomes. In the healthy heart, ventricular-arterial coupling is preserved during rest and in response to increased myocardial demand (eg, exercise) due to substantial RV contractile reserve. However, prolonged exposure to increased myocardial demand, such as endurance exercise, may precipitate RV dysfunction, suggesting that unlike the LV, the RV is unable to sustain high levels of contractility for extended periods of time. Emerging data increasingly indicate that both LV and RV function contribute to clinical heart failure. Reductions in quality-of-life, functional capacity and overall clinical outcomes are worsened among patients with heart failure when there is evidence of RV dysfunction. In addition, the RV is adversely impacted by pulmonary vascular disease, and among affected patients, overall RV function differs based on mechanisms of the underlying pulmonary hypertension, which may result from variations in sarcomere function within RV cardiomyocytes.

### Should less-than-severe functional tricuspid regurgitation in patients undergoing left-sided surgery Be treated more aggressively? [^2024e640]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) dilation and/or dysfunction ensuing from valvular or myopathic derangements of the left heart can lead to asymmetric dilation or distortion of the nonplanar tricuspid valve (TV) annulus, leaflet tethering, malcoaptation, and functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR). The accompanying volume overload in turn, causes further RV dilation and worsening TR, initiating a vicious spiral that may lead to intractable right heart failure and death, left unchecked.

The incidence of FTR in patients undergoing left heart surgery ranges between 7.5% to 14.0% for severe FTR and 15% to 30% for moderate FTR. Of note, FTR present at the time of left-sided valve surgery has been estimated to progress in 7.7% to 67% of patients. Residual or uncorrected FTR, following left-sided surgery, can lead to decreased functional capacity, peripheral edema, congestive hepatopathy, ascites, right heart failure and is predictive of poor survival. In this context, it is important to note that reoperations for isolated or recurrent FTR are associated with very high perioperative mortality.

The North American and European guidelines, both recommend concomitant TV surgery in patients with severe TR undergoing left-sided valve surgery, irrespective of the presence of symptoms, (Class 1). In contrast, surgery is deemed reasonable and should be considered in patients with mild or moderate (progressive) TR with a dilated annulus (≥ 40 mm or > 21 mm/m²) or those with prior heart failure (Class 2a). Because the latter recommendations are based on observational data, the most effective strategy remains somewhat controversial, and consequently, concomitant TV repair practice patterns for less-than-severe FTR vary widely. To some extent, previous guideline discrepancies, the concerns of increased cardiopulmonary bypass time, the need for permanent pacemaker implantation, and the historical incremental mortality associated with TV repairs have influenced a more conservative approach to TV repair, especially in patients with less-than-severe grades of TR, undergoing left heart surgery.

### Pulmonary hypertension with left-sided heart disease [^c0889bfc]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) with left-sided heart disease is defined, according to the latest Venice classification, as a Group 2 PH, which includes left-sided ventricular or atrial disease, and left-sided valvular diseases. These conditions are all associated with increased left ventricular filling pressure. Although PH with left-sided heart disease is a common entity, and long-term follow-up trials have provided firm recognition that development of left-sided PH carries a poor outcome, available data on incidence, pathophysiology, and therapy are sparse. Mitral stenosis was reported as the most frequent cause of PH several decades ago, but PH with left-sided heart disease is now usually caused by systemic hypertension and ischemic heart disease. In patients with these conditions, PH develops as a consequence of impaired left ventricular relaxation and distensibility. Chronic sustained elevation of cardiogenic blood pressure in pulmonary capillaries leads to a cascade of untoward retrograde anatomical and functional effects that represent specific targets for therapeutic intervention. The pathophysiological and clinical importance of the hemodynamic consequences of left-sided heart disease, starting with lung capillary injury and leading to right ventricular overload and failure, are discussed in this Review, focusing on PH as an evolving contributor to heart failure that may be amenable to novel interventions.

### Association of tricuspid regurgitation with mortality in heart failure with left-sided heart disease [^4b7d8cbd]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The adverse survival impact of TR was most pronounced in patients with left-sided heart disease who lacked LVD; even moderate TR worsened survival in this subgroup. TR was associated with adverse outcomes in patients with acute decompensated HF, although the nature of this association differed based on underlying cardiac phenotypes. This underscores the importance of precisely delineating the relationship between TR and the etiology of left-sided heart disease in future clinical studies.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: The prognostic impact of TR is divergent across subtypes of left-sided heart disease; left HF without LVD, even with a preserved EF, is disproportionately affected by TR.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Focusing on the etiology of left-sided heart disease in future trials will help delineate effective treatment strategies for improving clinical outcomes.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^0c958057]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction:

- **Definition**: HFpEF is HF in which the LVEF is ≥ 50% at the time of diagnosis and there is objective evidence of elevated left heart filling pressures either at rest or with exertion.
- **Pathophysiology**: Multiple organ systems contribute. Cardiac abnormalities include impaired LV relaxation, increased LV stiffness, subtle reductions in systolic reserve, myocardial fibrosis, coronary microvascular dysfunction, LA enlargement, and changes in pericardial constraint. Pulmonary and right heart changes include postcapillary pulmonary hypertension, small vessel remodeling, and RV dysfunction in many patients. The arterial system commonly shows increased arterial stiffness and impaired microvascular function. Systemic contributors include obesity, insulin resistance, chronic low grade inflammation, reduced skeletal muscle mass and function, kidney dysfunction with impaired sodium handling, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Several proposed biological pathways link comorbid conditions to myocardial and vascular changes, and greater heterogeneity among patients implies that distinct mechanistic subgroups exist.
- **Epidemiology**: About 3 million people in the US and up to 32 million people worldwide have this condition. It represents roughly half of all people diagnosed with HF. Incidence estimates vary by cohort and time period but are generally about 1–4 new cases per 1,000 person-years. Major risk factors include older age, high BP, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. Women are overrepresented among patients diagnosed in many observational series, although adjusted incidence differences by sex are small in some cohort studies.
- **Disease course**: Presentation is heterogeneous. About two thirds of patients present with overt congestion and volume overload, with signs such as peripheral edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary congestion on chest imaging, and resting echocardiographic indicators of high filling pressure. About one third present with exertional dyspnea without clear resting evidence of congestion; many of these patients demonstrate elevated left heart filling pressures only during exercise testing. Common comorbidities that affect presentation and trajectory include AF, chronic lung disease, anemia, obesity, and frailty. Episodes of acute decompensation are common and may be precipitated by uncontrolled BP, rapid AF, infection, anemia, medication nonadherence, or other physiologic stressors.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Clinical outcomes are substantial. Patients with this syndrome are hospitalized about 1.4 times per year on average. Annual mortality in observational cohorts is approximately 15%, with higher mortality in older patients. After a hospitalization for HF, 5-year rehospitalization rates approach 80 percent and five-year mortality ranges from about 50% to 75% in many series. Patients who have abnormal filling pressures only with exercise nonetheless have higher risks of hospitalization or death than people without elevated exercise pressures.

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^e673e58f]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Right heart failure (HF) — classification and categorization: The most common cause of right HF is left HF, and classification of types of ventricular failure in HF commonly includes 3 categories; left ventricular failure, right ventricular failure, and combined left and right ventricular failure usually termed as biventricular failure. Isolated right HF owing to primary pulmonary hypertension etiologies (World Health Organization Groups 1, 3, and 4) would not be categorized under HF because signs and/or symptoms are not caused primarily by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality, whereas right HF due to primary right ventricular cardiomyopathies such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy would be categorized under HF.

### Assessment and treatment of right ventricular failure [^211e42c9]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) failure is a complex problem with poor outcomes. Diagnosis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion, because many of the signs and symptoms of this condition are nonspecific and can be acute or chronic. Identification of the underlying aetiology, which can include pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, congenital or valvular heart disease, and sepsis, is essential. Echocardiography is the technique of choice for first-line assessment, but cardiac MRI is the current gold standard for anatomical and functional assessment of the right ventricle. Therapy for RV failure should be directed at the underlying cause, although management of symptoms is also important. Therapeutic options range from pharmacological treatment to mechanical RV support and heart transplantation. The complex 3D geometry of the right ventricle and its intricate interactions with the left ventricle have left many questions about RV failure unanswered. However, promising new targeted therapies are under development and mechanical support is becoming increasingly feasible. The next decade will be an exciting time for advances in our understanding and management of RV failure.

### Assessment of right ventricular function in the research setting: knowledge gaps and pathways forward. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^9a4f47d5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular failure conceptual model — Increased afterload drives transitions from normal right ventricular (RV) function to failure with structural and functional changes: RV size increases; in chronic afterload increases, RV hypertrophy develops; RV stroke volume, RV contractility, and RV–pulmonary artery coupling are initially maintained but then progressively decrease; in parallel, RV diastolic dysfunction and RV–left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony develop. At the molecular/biochemical level, alterations occur in angiogenesis, calcium handling, mitochondrial function, and sarcomere organization, with progressive increases in inflammation, neurohormonal activation, fibrosis/collagen deposition, oxidative stress, metabolic dysfunction, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^1002fbde]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptides across acute heart failure care — Natriuretic peptide (NP) levels fluctuate with left ventricular (LV) filling pressures during decompensation and improvement and exhibit intrinsic biological variability of 25–30% for NT-proBNP and 40% for BNP; in the emergency department (ED) NP use includes accuracy of diagnosis with high negative predictive value (NPV), stratification and triage, shortening decision time, and prognosis, in-hospital applications include correlation to LV filling pressure, monitoring response to intravenous (IV) therapies, assessing hemodynamic congestion, guiding discharge decisions and prognosis, and post-discharge uses include identification of residual congestion, prompting early interventions to reduce congestion, and prognosis at 1 week and 1 month; these biomarkers have the highest class of recommendation for exclusion of heart failure because of very high NPV (94%–97%), are helpful in judging whether reported worsening symptoms are related to increased left-sided cardiac filling pressures, but lack a prognostic effect in predominant right-sided HF such as severe tricuspid regurgitation.

### Assessment of right ventricular function in the research setting: knowledge gaps and pathways forward. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^4505ae1e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Optimization of RV assessment in clinical research — Trials designed to detect differences in clinical worsening or survival often require substantial sample sizes that are difficult to achieve in rare diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), particularly when the intervention is added to background therapy. A well-chosen RV surrogate endpoint in clinical trials may facilitate trial design and ultimately drug approval because right ventricular failure is the leading cause of death in PAH. A given endpoint needs to satisfy a number of criteria to serve as a surrogate for hard clinical outcomes before incorporation into trials, and it should be reliable, integral to the disease causal pathway, and targeted by the intervention of interest.

### Contribution of right-sided heart enlargement to cardiomegaly on chest roentgenogram in diastolic and systolic heart failure [^dcf9a1a3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

We investigated the contribution of a dilated right-sided heart to roentgenographic cardiomegaly in patients with heart failure (HF) and a normal ejection fraction (EF; diastolic HF) and those with HF and a decreased EF (systolic HF). We compared the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) on upright chest roentgenograms and major- and minor-axis dimensions of the 4 cardiac chambers on echocardiograms in patients with HF and a normal EF (≥ 0.50, n = 35) and those with a decreased EF (< 0.50, n = 37) and examined the correlation between the CTR and cardiac chamber dimensions. The CTR did not differ between patients with normal and decreased EF values (0.58 ± 0.07 vs 0.60 ± 0.06, p = 0.26). Left-side cardiac chamber dimensions were substantially smaller in patients with a normal EF than in those with a decreased EF (left ventricular minor-axis dimension, 4.4 ± 0.7 vs 5.8 ± 0.8 cm, p < 0.001). In contrast, right-side cardiac chamber dimensions were generally similar between groups. The CTR correlated with major-axis dimensions of the right ventricle and right atrium (p < 0.01 for the 2 comparisons), but not with the left-side cardiac chamber dimensions (all p values > 0.05). In conclusion, the CTR predominantly reflects right- rather than left-sided heart size in patients with HF. Right-sided heart size is similar between patients with normal and decreased EF values. Thus, despite the substantial difference in left ventricular size and EF, there is substantial overlap in the CTR between patients with diastolic and systolic HFs and the CTR is unable to discriminate between groups.

### Left ventricular heart failure and pulmonary hypertension [^0e7339b0]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Sequence of pathophysiological factors contributing to pulmonary hypertension in left ventricular heart failure. Backward transmission of left- to right-sided pathological features at the level of the ventricles, atrioventricular valves, and atria. Data derived from Tedford et al. showing that in left heart failure related pulmonary hypertension with increased wedge pressure the RC time is constant, but slightly decreased (leftward shift) (images containing video loops may be downloaded from the Supplementary material online).

The elevations of pulmonary pressures and PVR represent an increase of both resistive and pulsatile RV afterload, which results in dilatation and maladaptive remodelling of right heart chambers, functional tricuspid regurgitation, and ultimately RV dysfunction and failure. Pathological changes of the RV include hypertrophy, fibrosis, dilatation, and a change in RV shape from a crescent to a more spherical shape, which is associated with functional tricuspid regurgitation and elevated right atrial pressure (RAP). Right ventricular dysfunction resulting in low cardiac output is a key determinant of outcome in PH-LHD. In fact, the prognostic significance of an elevated PAP in HF increases with the degree of RV dysfunction irrespective of LVEF. However, the relationship between the severity of PH and RV dysfunction is not 'linear', as some patients with severe PH display normal RV function. In summary, a dysfunctional RV and clinical signs of right HF in patients with LHD occur as a consequence of pathological changes at the level of the ventricles, atrioventricular valves, and atria in both the left and right heart, and complex pathomechanisms of cardiopulmonary interaction affecting PVR and PA compliance determine the impact of LHD on the right heart (Figure 3).

### Effect of famotidine on outcomes in pulmonary arterial hypertension: a randomized controlled trial [^4258a8b6]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

FOR EDITORIAL COMMENT, SEE

Take-Home Points

Study Question: Do H 2 -receptor antagonists improve outcomes in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension?

Results: Famotidine was found to be safe and well tolerated; however, no significant differences in outcomes for participants with pulmonary arterial hypertension were noted over a 24-week randomized controlled trial.

Interpretation: The current study does not support the use of H 2 -receptor antagonists for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive life-threatening disorder characterized by elevated pulmonary pressures, right ventricular (RV) dilation, and RV dysfunction. All current treatments include an element focused on reducing right heart afterload. Despite meaningful improvement with these therapies, PAH carries a poor prognosis, and the global burden of PAH remains unacceptably high.

RV adaptation plays a pivotal role in PAH outcomes. Targeting treatments to preserve RV structure and function makes logical sense and is aligned with neurohormonal targeted treatments in left-sided heart failure. Despite this rationale, no cardiac-targeted therapy has been shown to benefit individuals with isolated right-sided heart failure. Histaminic signaling may be important in heart failure pathogenesis, relevant in disease complicated by pulmonary hypertension, and H 2 -receptor antagonism may be beneficial across the spectrum of right-sided and left-sided heart failure. In addition, H 2 -receptor antagonists are inexpensive, well tolerated, and available widely. Although existing evidence suggests that H 2 -receptor antagonism may be beneficial in PAH, no rigorous trials have evaluated its efficacy and safety in patients with pulmonary vascular disease. This single-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial of a repurposed drug tested the hypothesis that famotidine is beneficial and safe for patients with PAH.

### Acute right ventricular failure: pathophysiology, aetiology, assessment, and management [^7a527f71]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute right ventricular failure is a complex and rapidly progressive clinical syndrome, whereby the right ventricle fails to provide adequate left ventricular preload, dilates, and causes systemic venous congestion. Previous research in acute heart failure has primarily focused on the left ventricle. Yet, the need for a better understanding of right ventricular anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology, as well as of the diagnosis and management of its acute failure is crucial. Diagnosis mandates a high degree of clinical suspicion, as the majority of signs and symptoms are nonspecific. An accurate and prompt identification of the underlying causes, including pulmonary embolism, right ventricular myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, post-cardiac surgery, and decompensated chronic pulmonary hypertension, is therefore essential. This review provides insights into right ventricular anatomy and functioning and discusses the pathophysiology of acute right ventricular failure, its differential aetiologies, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.

This study shows temporal changes in both incidence and prevalence of left-sided HF in IPF patients in England, with modest reduction in incidence possibly reflecting improved screening and management of cardiovascular risk factors. However, despite decreasing incidence and prevalence, left-sided HF burden is considerably higher in IPF patients than in patients with other comparable chronic respiratory diseases and confers a higher mortality risk. Further studies are needed to explore HF phenotypes in IPF patients, whether there is a temporal relationship between the two diseases, what the aetiological mechanisms driving this association are, what drives the noted gender differences and whether HF treatment modifies the mortality risk.

### Pulmonary hypertension in heart failure: pathophysiology, pathobiology, and emerging Clinical Perspectives [^09c60b1b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is a common hemodynamic complication of heart failure. Interest in left-sided pulmonary hypertension has increased remarkably in recent years because its development and consequences for the right heart are now seen as mainstay abnormalities that begin in the early stages of the disease and bear unfavorable prognostic insights. However, some knowledge gaps limit our ability to influence this complex condition. Accordingly, attention is now focused on: 1) establishing a definitive consensus for a hemodynamic definition, perhaps incorporating exercise and fluid challenge; 2) implementing the limited data available on the pathobiology of lung capillaries and small arteries; 3) developing standard methods for assessing right ventricular function and, hopefully, its coupling to pulmonary circulation; and 4) searching for effective therapies that may benefit lung vessels and the remodeled right ventricle. The authors review the pathophysiology, pathobiology, and emerging clinical perspectives on pulmonary hypertension across the broad spectrum of heart failure stages.

### A roadmap for therapeutic discovery in pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart failure. A scientific statement of the heart failure association (HFA) of the ESC and the ESC working group on pulmonary circulation&right ventricular function [^8c80904a]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with left heart failure (LHF) (PH-LHF) is one of the most common causes of PH. It directly contributes to symptoms and reduced functional capacity and negatively affects right heart function, ultimately leading to a poor prognosis. There are no specific treatments for PH-LHF, despite the high number of drugs tested so far. This scientific document addresses the main knowledge gaps in PH-LHF with emphasis on pathophysiology and clinical trials. Key identified issues include better understanding of the role of pulmonary venous versus arteriolar remodelling, multidimensional phenotyping to recognize patient subgroups positioned to respond to different therapies, and conduct of rigorous pre-clinical studies combining small and large animal models. Advancements in these areas are expected to better inform the design of clinical trials and extend treatment options beyond those effective in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Enrichment strategies, endpoint assessments, and thorough haemodynamic studies, both at rest and during exercise, are proposed to play primary roles to optimize early-stage development of candidate therapies for PH-LHF.

### Right ventricular and right atrial function are less compromised in pulmonary hypertension secondary to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a comparison with pulmonary arterial hypertension with similar pressure overload [^9edfda85]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Traditional strategies to reduce LV filling pressures in HFpEF consists of drugs such as diuretics. Although a beneficial effect of diuretics was suggested in the CHAMPION trial (CardioMEMS HF Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressures to Improve Outcomes in NYHA Functional Class III Heart Failure Patients), clinical effectivity has not been proven in other randomized controlled trials. Therefore, new and nonpharmacological strategies to reduce disease severity and LA pressure in HFpEF are currently under investigation. Recently, an interatrial shunt device has been suggested in HFpEF.– A left-to-right atrial shunt decreases the interatrial pressure gradient. As a result, left-sided pressures decrease at rest but particularly during exercise. The shunt device has shown to ameliorate symptoms and improve functional capacity in HFpEF. – However, considering our findings, the question is how the interatrial shunt will impact the right atrium. On the one hand, by reducing left-sided pressure, atrial septostomy may reduce the interatrial pressure and thus the pericardial constraint and thereby also relieve the right atrium. On the other hand, a further increase in RAP may lead to increased central venous pressure, which may have detrimental effects on renal function. Nevertheless, the first results did not indicate further increase in RAP. The results of 2 larger clinical on effectivity of atrial septostomy in HFpEF are expected soon (REGISTRATION: URL:; Unique identifiers: NCT03499236, NCT03088033).

Right ventricular failure (RVF) — acute on chronic decompensation: Acute decompensation is usually provoked by one or more precipitating factors (e.g., infection, pulmonary embolism, bleeding disorders) or by progression of the underlying disease; patients frequently deteriorate and enter a vicious cycle of hypotension, ischemia, and decreased pump function or may stabilize and revert to more or less stable chronic RVF, and mortality after hospital discharge remains high (35% at 12 mo).

Left vs. right ventricular phenotype

The current knowledge about the heterogeneity of PH in LV HF and the reasons, why some patients develop severe PH and RV dysfunction whereas others do not, remains limited. Two factors may be key: (i) the susceptibility for pulmonary vascular disease (due to genetic factors and/or environmental stressors and/or comorbidities) and (ii) the factor 'time'. In many cases, only a 'snapshot' of a patient is considered during the course of HF development and progression. However, in HF patients who are susceptible for pulmonary vasculopathy, a potential evolution of LV disease to right ventricular (RV) dilatation and functional impairment as a result of PH may be observed. During this evolution, the heart alters progressively across a spectrum from a picture of an abnormal LV with an otherwise normal RV (' left ventricular phenotype ') into a picture of a dilated and functionally impaired RV which may even dominate over the LV abnormality (' right ventricular phenotype ') (Figure 4). The appearance of LV or RV phenotype depends on the point in this evolution that cardiac imaging is undertaken. This is supported by the fact that RV dysfunction in HFpEF is associated with more advanced stages of the disease. Examples of PH and RV phenotype developing over time — depending on patient's susceptibility — are depicted in Supplementary material online, Figure S1. Mortality increases as the RV phenotype develops. It must be emphasized that invasive haemodynamics are not always reliable in differentiating between different phenotypes across the spectrum because the use of diuretics and alterations in fluid status may influence ventricular filling pressures. While post-capillary haemodynamics indicate that LV disease is driving PH, pre-capillary haemodynamics do not exclude LV disease with certainty.

Tricuspid regurgitation — timing of intervention includes the following recommendations: In patients with severe TR (Stages C and D) undergoing left-sided valve surgery, tricuspid valve surgery is recommended. In patients with progressive TR (Stage B) undergoing left-sided valve surgery, tricuspid valve surgery can be beneficial in the context of either tricuspid annular dilation with tricuspid annulus end diastolic diameter > 4.0 cm or prior signs and symptoms of right-sided HF. In patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF and severe primary TR (Stage D), isolated tricuspid valve surgery can be beneficial to reduce symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations. In patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF and severe isolated secondary TR attributable to annular dilation (in the absence of pulmonary hypertension or left-sided disease) who are poorly responsive to medical therapy (Stage D), isolated tricuspid valve surgery can be beneficial to reduce symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations. In asymptomatic patients with severe primary TR (Stage C) and progressive RV dilation or systolic dysfunction, isolated tricuspid valve surgery may be considered. In patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF and severe TR (Stage D) who have undergone previous left-sided valve surgery, reoperation with isolated tricuspid valve surgery may be considered in the absence of severe pulmonary hypertension or severe RV systolic dysfunction.
