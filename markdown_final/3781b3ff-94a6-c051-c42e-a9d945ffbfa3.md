## Question

total amount?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the "total amount" of medication in various contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which "total amount" the user means across the provided references. Then, I should verify the most defensible, reference-supported figures I can extract. Next, I will consider dosing safety principles that hinge on total quantities. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically relevant answer with caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the possible interpretations of "total amount" from the documents. Wait, let me verify the contexts that repeatedly mention totals: total daily doses for opioids and other medications, total medication counts in deprescribing studies, total fluid volumes from IV medications in ICU care, total medication waste in anesthesia, and total environmental impact of medications during procedures, with a few one-off mentions like a 1–40 g/day magnesium range and a 126 mg/day ketorolac nasal maximum [^b142d7a1] [^a7c9d9c1] [^9dd74b28] [^b968848f] [^1f638015] [^6bd38b5c] [^6ed11750].

> I will now examine the most concrete "total amount" figure I can anchor to. Hold on, I should verify the ICU fluid data: in a 20-patient retrospective analysis, IV medications contributed a median of 2423 mL over 72 hours, and switching to the most concentrated formulations would reduce total IV volume by a median of 687.75 mL, roughly an 11% reduction in total IV administration, which is a clear, quantifiable "total amount" statement [^9dd74b28].

> Next, I should review medication waste in anesthesia. Let me check the TIVA waste study: over seven days, leftover propofol, remifentanil, sufentanil, and norepinephrine totaled 0.13 ± 0.04 kg of CO2-equivalent emissions, with 1.2 kg mean solid waste per treatment, which operationalizes "total amount" as environmental and material waste rather than clinical dose totals [^1f638015] [^b968848f].

> Now, I need to consider deprescribing and medication burden. The Shed-MEDS randomized trial showed a 14% reduction in total medication count at PAC discharge and a 15% reduction at 90 days, translating to roughly 2.4 and 2.5 fewer medications on average, respectively, which is a meaningful "total amount" reduction in polypharmacy exposure [^a7c9d9c1].

> But wait, what if the user is thinking about daily dose ceilings or opioid totals. I should double-check those. For ketorolac nasal spray, the labeled maximum is 126 mg per day, and for nitroglycerin sublingual, the maximum is 3 tablets within 15 minutes before seeking urgent care, which are explicit "total amount" limits for acute use [^6ed11750] [^4df77a0e]. For opioids, several FDA conversions emphasize summing total daily opioid doses and then applying conversion factors, underscoring that "total amount" is a foundational step in safe switching, though the exact totals are patient-specific and not a single number I can cite here [^b142d7a1] [^ec0ccfaa] [^7f7eca7b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should also flag that some "total amount" statements are ranges or study-specific aggregates rather than universal constants. For example, magnesium chloride has a usual dosage range of 1–40 g daily, and perioperative IV ketorolac totals in TJA studies ranged from 15 to 150 mg in the first 24 hours, reminding me to contextualize any "total amount" I quote to the clinical scenario and evidence base [^6bd38b5c] [^eb827899].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit about what I can and cannot claim. I can confidently say that in ICU cohorts, IV medications contribute a median of about 2.4 liters over 72 hours and that concentration strategies can reduce total IV volume by roughly 11%, and I can quantify anesthesia-related medication waste as about 0.13 kg CO2-equivalent per MR-HIFU case and 1.2 kg solid waste, as well as deprescribing reductions of about 14–15% in medication count after hospital-to-PAC transitions, but I cannot provide a single universal "total amount" without knowing the drug, context, and timeframe, so I need to ensure the answer stays anchored to these validated figures and their caveats [^9dd74b28] [^1f638015] [^b968848f] [^a7c9d9c1].

The "total amount" of medication depends on the specific drug, indication, and patient factors. For example, **ketorolac nasal spray** has a maximum total daily dose of 126 mg (31.5 mg every 6–8 hours) [^6ed11750], while **tranexamic acid** in total joint arthroplasty shows no added benefit with higher doses, so the lowest effective dose is recommended [^b86794b6] [^6b887a50]. For opioids, total daily doses are often converted to morphine milligram equivalents (MME) to guide safe prescribing and tapering [^c0de33cd]. Always follow label or guideline dosing and adjust for patient-specific factors such as age, weight, renal function, and comorbidities [^a0d047e9].

## Examples of total medication amounts

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Total amount** |
|-|-|-|
| Ketorolac tromethamine (Sprix) | Moderately severe acute pain | 126 mg per day (31.5 mg every 6–8 hours) [^6ed11750] |
| Tranexamic acid (TXA) | Total joint arthroplasty | Dose amount does not significantly affect blood loss or transfusion risk; use the lowest effective dose [^b86794b6] [^6b887a50] |
| Dexmedetomidine | Perioperative sedation | Total dose varies by study; titrated to effect (e.g. 0.5–1 mcg/kg bolus, 0.05–0.7 mcg/kg/hr infusion) [^44f71aa2] |
| Propofol | Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) | Total dose varies by procedure and patient; waste analysis shows ~0.13 kg CO2 per MR-HIFU treatment [^1f638015] [^b968848f] |

## Factors influencing total medication amount

Several factors influence the **total amount** of medication administered:

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, weight, renal function, hepatic function, and comorbidities significantly impact dosing and total medication amount [^a0d047e9].
- **Medication-specific factors**: Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and therapeutic index determine safe and effective dosing ranges [^d0437f55].
- **Clinical guidelines**: Evidence-based guidelines provide dosing recommendations and safety considerations for specific medications and patient populations [^0f51d34a].

---

## Clinical implications of total medication amount

The total amount of medication administered has **significant clinical implications**:

- **Efficacy**: Adequate dosing is essential for therapeutic effect, while underdosing may lead to treatment failure [^e1327263].
- **Safety**: Excessive dosing increases the risk of adverse drug reactions, toxicity, and medication errors [^7ae12309].
- **Cost**: Higher medication amounts can increase healthcare costs, emphasizing the importance of using the lowest effective dose [^b968848f].

---

## Strategies to optimize total medication amount

Healthcare providers employ **various strategies** to optimize the total amount of medication administered:

- **Medication reconciliation**: Regularly reviewing and updating medication lists to prevent errors and ensure appropriate dosing [^3940d192].
- **Deprescribing**: Reducing or discontinuing unnecessary medications to minimize polypharmacy and adverse effects [^a7c9d9c1].
- **Patient education**: Educating patients about proper medication use, adherence, and potential side effects [^492aab30].

---

The total amount of medication administered varies by drug, indication, and patient factors, and **clinicians should balance efficacy and safety** using guideline-based dosing, patient-specific adjustments, and ongoing monitoring.

### Preventing home medication administration errors [^e5790b94]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Home medication dosing tools — recommendations and provision practices are outlined as follows: AAP has long recommended that liquid medications be measured using standard dosing tools, and the FDA has recommended inclusion of a dosing tool with standard measurement markings for all OTC liquid medications. With prescription and OTC products, it is recommended that only the tool provided with the medication be used for administering that medication, and caregivers can be counseled to ask for a dosing tool at the time of medication purchase if they are not given one. Storing the tool with the medication up, away, and out of sight of children can promote caregiver use of the correct tool and prevent unintentional medication ingestions. Tool quality matters; the Pharmacopeia recommends the use of dosing tools with indelible markings. Despite these recommendations, it is not standard practice for dosing tools to be provided in the clinical or pharmacy setting. With the growing use of electronic prescribing, information on optimal dosing tools for prescribed medications could be automatically generated at the point of prescribing in the EHR or at the point of dispensing within pharmacy software systems, providing information to clinicians and pharmacists about which tool is best to use based on the recommended dose amount.

### Sodium phenylbutyrate [^a3d41786]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Who should not take sodium phenylbutyrate powder?

Sodium phenylbutyrate powder is prescribed only for patients with urea cycle disorders. It is not to be used for any other reason. Keep the medication in a safe place where children cannot reach it.

What other medical conditions may also be present that could increase the risk of taking sodium phenylbutyrate powder?

Heart failure or decreased kidney function may lead to retention of the sodium content of sodium phenylbutyrate powder with potentially serious consequences such as worsening heart failure, high blood pressure, and swelling. If these medical conditions are present, the doctor will determine if your child should take sodium phenylbutyrate powder.

How should I or my child take sodium phenylbutyrate powder?

The dose of sodium phenylbutyrate powder prescribed for adults and children is based upon the patient's weight or size. It is very important that the full amount prescribed for any 24-hour period be taken. If a dose is missed it should be administered as soon as possible that same day. The total daily dose should be administered in equally divided amounts with meals.

What medications should I or my child avoid or be cautious of taking while on sodium phenylbutyrate powder?

Patients with urea cycle disorders usually should not take Depakene®(valproic acid), a drug sometimes prescribed for seizure disorders, or Haldol®(haloperidol), a drug used to treat certain types of psychiatric or neurologic disorders. Both of these drugs have been reported to increase blood ammonia levels. Steroids may break down body protein, thereby increasing blood ammonia levels. The doctor should be consulted before administering medications containing steroids.

### Metric units and the preferred dosing of orally administered liquid medications [^581bf9fb]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Metric units for orally administered liquid medications — recommendations specify that orally administered liquid medications should be dosed exclusively by using metric-based dosing with milliliters (ie, mL) to avoid confusion and dosing errors associated with common kitchen spoons. Orally administered liquid medications should be dosed to the nearest 0.1, 0.5, or 1 mL, as appropriate based on the margin for safe and effective dosing, but dosing to the hundredth of a milliliter should be avoided. The only appropriate abbreviation for milliliter is "mL", and the use of alternatives (eg, ml, ML, cc) for dosing orally administered liquid medications should be avoided. Milliliter-based dosing should include leading zeros preceding decimals for doses less than 1 mL (eg, 0.5 mL) to avoid 10-fold dosing errors.

### How often do parents administer medications to their children in hospital? A prospective direct observational study [^2f9192c1]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This was a prospective direct observational study of nurses administering medication to children in hospital, conducted as part of a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of electronic medication systems on errors. Data were collected from nine general medical and surgical wards (excluding oncology, intensive care unit and the emergency department) in a 340-bed paediatric referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. In total, 298 nurses were observed preparing and administering 5137 medication doses to 1565 patients on weekdays and weekends between 07:00 and 22:00 by trained researchers. Details of drugs administered, including whether medications were left for parents (includes family members or carers) to administer, and if nurses observed the administration of the medications by parents, were recorded. Full details of the observational methods have been published previously. A secondary analysis was undertaken to assess the frequencies and proportions of medication doses left with parents, and those observed by nurses to be administered by a parent, by patient characteristics (eg, age, sex) and medication details (route, type, administration time).

### Preventing home medication administration errors [^492aab30]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric medications — provider counseling instructions emphasize giving straightforward and actionable instructions that convey key elements including medication name, medication purpose (indication), dose amount, frequency, duration, route of administration, and side effects. Provide dose amount using milliliter units only, using the abbreviation "mL", avoid spoon-based units, avoid dosing in cubic centimeters (ie, cc), and use mL units consistently in verbal and written communication. To make doses easy to measure, include leading zeros if decimal amounts are used (eg, 0.X), avoid trailing zeros (eg, X.0), and avoid confusing abbreviations such as U (unit) and QD (daily). Give explicit instructions regarding timing by providing information on time of day rather than only frequency (eg, 2 times a day), and include information on explicit timing on prescriptions.

### Preventing home medication administration errors [^7239ec56]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Preventing home medication administration errors — dosing tools for liquid medications: Encourage the use of a standardized dosing tool with all liquid medications; provide oral syringes when dosing accuracy is essential, especially when smaller doses are recommended (eg, < 5 mL) and when medications are for young children; provide a dosing tool with the smallest size to fit the dose without the need for filling the instrument multiple times for a single dose; demonstrate the prescribed dose of medication by using a dosing tool and have the patient/caregiver teachback/showback the dose; counsel caregivers about location of dosing tool for ease of access when medications are administered and store dosing tools with medications safely (eg, up, away, and out of sight); encourage caregivers to ask for a dosing tool with all prescribed medications and to use their medication-specific tool each time; if a dosing tool comes packaged with a medication, caregivers should use that tool to measure that medication.

### Metric units and the preferred dosing of orally administered liquid medications [^e335af8f]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics policy — metric units for orally administered liquid medications — emphasizes that medication overdoses are a common, but preventable, problem among children, and identifies volumetric dosing errors and the use of incorrect dosing delivery devices as 2 common sources. To reduce errors and increase precision of drug administration, milliliter-based dosing should be used exclusively when prescribing and administering liquid medications; teaspoon- and tablespoon-based dosing should not be used. Devices that allow for precise dose administration (preferably syringes with metric markings) should be used instead of household spoons and should be distributed with the medication. Each year, more than 70 000 children visit emergency departments as a result of unintentional medication overdoses.

### The type of follicle-stimulating hormone medication given for in vitro fertilization impacts oocyte retrieval: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^84239161]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

The rate of OHSS varied across some of the four FSH medications. In general, the rate of OHSS increased as the total FSH dose administered increased. Two recent meta‐analyses also demonstrated higher OHSS rates with follitropin alfa/beta than with delta, with higher total doses administered for follitropin alfa/beta. Additionally, OHSS rates between follitropin alfa/beta and urofollitropin/HMG were similar when the total doses were similar. This suggests that the risk of OHSS is related to the total FSH dose administered. Therefore, personalized FSH dosing may help reduce the risk of OHSS, particularly for patients with rapid in‐cycle oestradiol and follicular growth.

Live birth rate is an imperfect biomarker of ovarian response to FSH, given the myriad of other factors that can impact the chance of live birth, beyond the total FSH dose administered. However, clinically, the overarching aim of ART is to achieve a live birth. Our findings indicated that despite differences in oocyte retrieval, live birth rates were similar across FSH medications. Other meta‐analyses comparing follitropin alfa/beta and delta, or follitropin alfa/beta and urofollitropin/HMG, reported similar findings. While the number of retrieved oocytes correlates with live birth rates, it is not the only mitigating factor. Other factors, such as the quality of the oocytes, are also important, as this reflects the likelihood of fertilization, embryo developmental competence, and subsequent live birth outcomes. Although fewer oocytes are retrieved with some FSH medications, this suggests that the oocytes are of sufficient quality to enable embryo development to be similar across medications. This may, in part, explain the similar live birth rates. Unfortunately, the number of 'high quality' embryos was infrequently reported, limiting our interpretation. This infrequent reporting may reflect the difficulty in measuring oocyte quality and resulting embryo development, especially considering that higher numbers of retrieved oocytes may not necessarily result in high quality oocytes. Other variables (e.g. any co‐administered medications, variability in FSH receptor structure) could also contribute to this, representing the complex, multifaceted nature of ART. Additionally, this suggests that the optimal number of retrieved oocytes to result in a live birth varies between FSH medications. Further research is needed to assess the quality of retrieved oocytes and how this relates to live birth rates for individual FSH medications.

### Clinical practice guideline: safe medication use in the ICU [^cfb3b7fc]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Medication administration in the ICU — Reports estimate that 36–56% of MEs in ICUs occur during the medication administration phase, which is the final step in the medication process and the last chance for detection before reaching the patient; frequent administration error types include omission of medications and wrong time of administration, and targeted interventions include BCMA and smart infusion pump technology alongside changes in systems of care delivery (i.e., double checks) and use of subjective assessment tools for titration.

### Effectiveness of double checking to reduce medication administration errors: a systematic review [^874efa7f]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2020). High credibility.

Background

Double checking medication administration in hospitals is often standard practice, particularly for high-risk drugs, yet its effectiveness in reducing medication administration errors (MAEs) and improving patient outcomes remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating evidence of the effectiveness of double checking to reduce MAEs.

Methods

Five databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Ovid@Journals, OpenGrey) were searched for studies evaluating the use and effectiveness of double checking on reducing medication administration errors in a hospital setting. Included studies were required to report any of three outcome measures: an effect estimate such as a risk ratio or risk difference representing the association between double checking and MAEs, or between double checking and patient harm; or a rate representing adherence to the hospital's double checking policy.

Results

Thirteen studies were identified, including 10 studies using an observational study design, two randomised controlled trials and one randomised trial in a simulated setting. Studies included both paediatric and adult inpatient populations and varied considerably in quality. Among three good quality studies, only one showed a significant association between double checking and a reduction in MAEs, another showed no association, and the third study reported only adherence rates. No studies investigated changes in medication-related harm associated with double checking. Reported double checking adherence rates ranged from 52% to 97% of administrations. Only three studies reported if and how independent and primed double checking were differentiated.

Conclusion

There is insufficient evidence that double versus single checking of medication administration is associated with lower rates of MAEs or reduced harm. Most comparative studies fail to define or investigate the level of adherence to independent double checking, further limiting conclusions regarding effectiveness in error prevention. Higher-quality studies are needed to determine if, and in what context (eg, drug type, setting), double checking produces sufficient benefits in patient safety to warrant the considerable resources required.

### Drug dosing recommendations for all patients: a roadmap for change [^884eb491]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

ADJUSTING DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATION TO ENABLE EFFECTIVE DOSING FOR ALL

Consideration should be given to making a few relatively minor changes to the current drug development‐regulatory paradigm based on three principles:
Commitment to provide drug dosing information supporting efficacy and safety for all patients likely to be prescribed the drug as close to market approval as possible and then continuously improve this information by incorporation of RWE.
Continuously invest in developing better prediction tools supporting efficacy, safety, and dosing across projects.
Specific company and the FDA actions taken to develop and implement precision dosing during the investigational new drug process are described in Figure 1 below. These eight steps are designed to determine the need for precision dosing for a new drug, develop the information and analysis needed to create dosing recommendations, and to systematically revise dosing recommendations over the product life cycle.

P135 A retrospective analysis of intravenous (IV) fluid and medication administration in a United Kingdom district general Intensive Care Unit (ICU)

B Scrace, L Squire, D Ashton-Cleary, L Moore, M Spivey

Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, Critical Care, Truro, United Kingdom

Introduction: We aimed to ascertain the extent and make-up of fluid overload in critically ill patients and to identify whether delivery of more concentrated medications could reduce this. Positive fluid balance is associated with increased mortality [1]. A recent study has shown that the predominant component of fluid overload was from IV medications and maintenance fluid [2].

Methods: We reviewed 20 sequential patients admitted to our ICU with an APACHE II score of greater than 15 and a length of stay (LOS) greater than 72 hours. The patients' electronic admission summary was interrogated to establish: length of stay (LOS) fluid balance at 72 hours, total volume administered as IV medications, total volume administered as maintenance fluid and total fluid administered as bolus fluid. Predicted reduction in volume resulting from administration of the most concentrated format of IV medications received in the first 72 hours LOS was calculated for each patient. The percentage reduction in total IV fluid administration was then calculated.

Results: 90% of patients had a positive fluid balance at 72 hours LOS. Median fluid balance at 72 hours was positive 4170.5 mls. IV medications (median 2423 mls) and maintenance fluid (median 3362.5 mls) represented a greater proportion of intravenous fluid administration than bolus fluid (median 1900 mls). Use of the most concentrated format of IV medications gave a predicted median volume reduction of 687.75 mls and a median percentage reduction in total IV administration of 11%.

Conclusions: The proportion of patients with a positive fluid balance and the breakdown of IV fluid administration reflect that seen in recent studies [2]. By administering medications in the highest concentration possible, reductions in fluid administration can be made. A shift away from using maintenance IV fluid in the acute phase of critical illness may lead to reductions in fluid overload.

### The type of follicle-stimulating hormone medication given for in vitro fertilization impacts oocyte retrieval: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3098f6b9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

There may be variations in efficacy between the FSH medications. Each FSH medication has different glycan structures that determine not only the pharmacokinetic properties but also biological activity. In vitro data suggest equivalent potency of follitropin alfa and delta (EC 50 0.0174 and 0.0171 nM, respectively). The specific in vivo activity of urofollitropin, follitropin beta, and follitropin alfawas also comparable, despite potential production or cell line differences. Therefore, the observed variability in oocyte retrieval is more likely related to drug exposure (i.e. total dose) rather than the type of FSH medication administered. For example, administration of urofollitropin retrieved more oocytes than follitropin beta; however, higher total doses of urofollitropin were used. Similarly, the total dose of follitropin delta administered was lower than that of both follitropin alfa and beta, which aligns with the fewer retrieved oocytes with delta. This finding was also supported by a recent meta‐analysis. This suggests that a higher dose of follitropin delta may be required to retrieve the same number of oocytes as follitropin alfa and beta. Upcoming clinical trials will generate evidence confirming this hypothesis. The differences in dosing may have contributed to the high heterogeneity in some of our meta‐analyses. This was illustrated by a meta‐analysis comparing urofollitropin to follitropin alfa/beta, where the number of oocytes retrieved and the total doses administered were similar. While clinically negligible differences in the number of retrieved oocytes between follitropin alfa and beta were observed, the medications were dosed similarly. This is likely due to both medications sufficiently occupying the FSH receptors when given at adequate doses. Age, BMI, AFC, AMH, and basal FSH were not associated with the differences in the number of retrieved oocytes between FSH medications. This is owing to appropriate randomization, as we know that these factors impact ovarian response to an individual FSH medication. Together, these findings suggest that differences in the number of oocytes retrieved for a specific FSH medication can be overcome by adjusting the total dose administered.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate (zohydro) [^b142d7a1]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Consider the following when using the information in Table 1:

This is not a table of equianalgesic doses.
The conversion factors in this table are only for the conversion from one of the listed oral opioid analgesics to ZOHYDRO ER.
The table cannot be used to convert from ZOHYDRO ER to another opioid. Doing so will result in an over-estimation of the dose of the new opioid and may result in fatal overdose.

To calculate the estimated daily ZOHYDRO ER dose using Table 1:

For patients on a single opioid, sum the current total daily dose of the opioid and then multiply the total daily dose by the conversion factor to calculate the approximate oral hydrocodone daily dose. The daily dose should then be divided in half for administration every 12 hours.
For patients on a regimen of more than one opioid, calculate the approximate oral hydrocodone dose for each opioid and sum the totals to obtain approximate total hydrocodone daily dose. The daily dose should then be divided in half for administration every 12 hours.
For patients on a regimen of fixed-ratio opioid/non-opioid analgesic products, use only the opioid component of these products in the conversion.

Always round the dose down, if necessary, to the appropriate ZOHYDRO ER strength(s) available.

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^34f16f5b]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) — pharmacotherapy initiation and agents: For infants with severe NOWS, use of a medication in addition to nonpharmacologic measures is necessary to improve clinical signs and minimize complications; pharmacologic therapy should be considered for severe opioid withdrawal despite nonpharmacologic interventions, with vomiting and loose stools as relative indications. Naloxone should never be administered to an infant with NOWS because it will exacerbate the underlying withdrawal syndrome. The literature supports the use of an opioid for opioid withdrawal as a first-line agent, and in the United States the most common first-line therapy for NOWS is morphine. Ideally, therapy minimizes withdrawal signs and then the infant is weaned using a standardized protocol to minimize total medication exposure.

### Preventing home medication administration errors [^3055a164]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Home medication dosing tools — oral syringes versus dosing cups and size–dose matching are described. Caregivers vary in their ability to dose accurately with different types of standard dosing tools, and dosing cups may be especially difficult to measure with; caregivers may confuse the entire cup as the dose, may not place the cup on a level surface when measuring, or may not look at the markings at eye level. Dosing cups have been associated with a more than threefold increased odds of error compared with oral syringes, and the potential for multifold errors with cups is especially high with small-dose volumes. Oral syringes are typically preferred by health care providers for increased accuracy in dose measurement and are generally recommended when dosing accuracy is essential, and oral syringes are typically recommended for administering medication to young children, especially when small doses are involved. To determine the optimal dosing tool to give to families, it is also important for providers to consider the relationship between the size of the dosing tool and the prescribed dose amount. Dispensing a tool that is too large for a dose (eg, a 10-mL syringe for a 1-mL dose) increases the risk of multifold errors, whereas dispensing a tool that is too small for a dose (eg, 5-mL syringe for a 7.5-mL dose) results in the need to fill a tool multiple times, requiring the use of numeracy skills (eg, 5 + 2.5 = 7.5 mL). Dosing cups may be adequate for larger doses (eg, > 10 mL), particularly for lower-risk medications with wide therapeutic margins.

### Preventing home medication administration errors [^96176eca]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Table 1 — Medication dosing tools, language-concordant care, caregiver engagement, and medication reconciliation — Avoid cups for smaller doses (eg, < 5 mL) and place cups on a level surface when measuring; look at markings at eye level when measuring. Promote dosing-tool best practices: for prescription medications, use tool provided by health care provider or pharmacy for specific medication prescribed; for over-the-counter (OTC) medications, use dosing tool included in packaging; and support colocation of dosing tool with prescribed medication. For language-concordant care, verbal counseling and written information should be provided in the language of patient and/or family preference; high-quality translations should be provided; and trained/certified professional interpreters should be used. Empower caregivers to ask questions, acknowledge that many caregivers have difficulty with administering medications and that questions are expected, and encourage caregivers to request a dosing tool if one is not provided. Reconcile medications by conducting regular reviews of medication lists with patients and caregivers, systematically reviewing each medication taken (eg, name, strength, indication, dose, frequency, and expected duration), and ensuring OTC medications, and vitamins and/or supplements, should be included.

### Topical nasal decongestant oxymetazoline: safety considerations for perioperative pediatric use [^6ce82f48]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Surgeon, anesthesiologist, and operating room personnel — surgical considerations for oxymetazoline — state: avoid administration of an unmonitored medication volume and during a surgical procedure implement a reliable process to keep track of the total volume of medication that is administered; effective communication between the surgeon and anesthesiologist should occur with intraoperative use, routine monitoring of heart rate, BP, and respiration through the intraoperative and postoperative period is essential, and if a second medication bottle needs to be opened for use during a case, ensure that the anesthesiologist is aware; and remove excess medication from pharynx, both during and at the end of the procedure suctioning excess medication that has pooled in the nasopharynx and oropharynx to avoid additional potential mucosal absorption.

### Preventing home medication administration errors [^c10656dd]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Home medication safety — helpful resources compiles tools for safe prescribing practices, health literacy–informed counseling strategies, and safe disposal recommendations/resources, including the AAP Policy Statement "Metric Units and the Preferred Dosing of Orally Administered Liquid Medications", The Joint Commission "Do not use" list, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Universal Precautions Toolkit, the Universal Medication Schedule White Paper, and disposal guidance such as "Where and How to Dispose of Unused Medicines", "Disposal of Unused Medicines: What You Should Know", and "Drug Disposal Information" from the US Department of Justice and DEA.

### Methadone (methadone hydrochloride) [^ec0ccfaa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consider the following when using the information in Table 1:

This is not a table of equianalgesic doses.
The conversion factors in this table are only for the conversion from another oral opioid analgesic to methadone hydrochloride tablets.
The table cannot be used to convert from methadone hydrochloride tablets to another opioid. Doing so will result in an overestimation of the dose of the new opioid and may result in fatal overdose.

Table 1: Conversion Factors to Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets

To calculate the estimated methadone hydrochloride tablets dose using Table 1:

For patients on a single opioid, sum the current total daily dose of the opioid, convert it to a Morphine Equivalent Dose according to specific conversion factor for that specific opioid, then multiply the Morphine Equivalent Dose by the corresponding percentage in the above table to calculate the approximate oral methadone daily dose. Divide the total daily methadone dose derived from the table above to reflect the intended dosing schedule (i.e., for administration every 8 hours, divide total daily methadone dose by 3).
For patients on a regimen of more than one opioid, calculate the approximate oral methadone dose for each opioid and sum the totals to obtain the approximate total methadone daily dose. Divide the total daily methadone dose derived from the table above to reflect the intended dosing schedule (i.e., for administration every 8 hours, divide total daily methadone dose by 3).
For patients on a regimen of fixed-ratio opioid/non-opioid analgesic products, use only the opioid component of these products in the conversion.

Routes of administration, dosing, and titration of medications

Two studies titrated dexmedetomidine, remifentanil, and midazolam to pre-determined target levels of sedation as defined by Bispectral index (BIS) scores 70–80 and > 85. Of the remaining studies, 7 titrated medications to Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) scores of 2 or 3. Two studies administered intramuscular (IM) dexmedetomidine 45 min prior to the regional block. One study employed patient-controlled sedation. Another study utilized target effect site concentrations to titrate remifentanil. Table 2 shows the medication doses, routes of administration, total medication administered, and intraoperative levels of sedation.

There was considerable variety in the total amount of dexmedetomidine and midazolam administered among studies that reported these values as shown in Table 2. Total doses of fentanyl, remifentanil, alfentanil, propofol, and ketamine were not reported in any of the studies. Although medication doses could be estimated from calculations using the average duration of surgery and patient weight, when reported, these calculations were not performed for this review.

### Waste analysis and energy use estimation during MR-HIFU treatment: first steps towards calculating total environmental impact [^1f638015]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Energy consumption

The average energy required by the MR-HIFU device during ablation was 150.0 ± 27.8 W 95% CI (138.4, 161.4). The average total energy used was 60.0 ± 15.6 kWh 95% CI (53.5, 66.5) from the MRI scanner and 3.5 ± 1.1 kWh 95% CI (3.1, 4.0) from the MR-HIFU device per treatment (Table 1). This resulted in a CO 2 emission of 31.4 ± 8.2 kg 95% CI (28.0, 34.8) by the MRI scanner and 1.8 ± 0.6 kg 95% CI (1.6, 2.1) by the MR-HIFU device. In total, 33.2 ± 8.7 kg 95% CI (29.6, 36.8) CO 2 emission was produced per MR-HIFU treatment.

Medication

Eleven types of medication were administered to at least five patients. Six additional types of medication were administered only once and were excluded from analyses (Table 2). All included medication administered during a uterine fibroid MR-HIFU treatment totaled 0.13 ± 0.04 kg 95% CI (0.11, 0.14) of CO 2 emission.

### The type of follicle-stimulating hormone medication given for in vitro fertilization impacts oocyte retrieval: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b50b8871]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Understanding the variability in ovarian response following administration of follicle-stimulating hormone medications in women undergoing in vitro fertilization may help inform prescribing decisions. A systematic review was conducted to compare the number of retrieved oocytes and fertility outcomes following the administration of different follicle-stimulating hormone medications. Databases were searched from inception to November 2024, including studies that compared two follicle-stimulating hormone medications, including follitropin alfa, follitropin beta, follitropin delta, and urofollitropin. Meta-analyses were performed in random effects models with the restricted maximum likelihood method. From 3867 identified articles, 26 (12613 participants) were included. More oocytes were retrieved with follitropin alfa compared to beta (mean difference 0.64, 95% CI 0.09–1.19). Compared to follitropin delta, more oocytes were retrieved with follitropin alfa and beta (1.38, 95% CI 0.09–2.67, and 1.40, 95% CI 0.41–2.39, respectively); however, higher total doses of follitropin alfa and beta were administered (199.29IU, 95% CI 43.15–355.43 and 181.08IU, 95% CI 55.67–306.49, respectively), and the risk of hyperstimulation increased (risk ratios 1.42, 95% CI 1.04–1.96 and 1.75, 95% CI 1.15–2.70, respectively). More oocytes were retrieved with urofollitropin compared to follitropin beta (1.12, 95% CI -1.63 to -0.62), with higher total doses of urofollitropin administered (782.32IU, 95% CI -1493.79 to -70.85). Variability in ovarian response and hyperstimulation rates across the medications decreased when similar total doses were administered. Fertilization, pregnancy, and live birth rates were similar across the medications, despite differences in the number of retrieved oocytes. Additional research is required to evaluate oocyte quality across follicle-stimulating hormone medications.

Consider the following when using the information in Table 1:

This is not a table of equianalgesic doses.
The conversion factors in this table are only for the conversion from another oral opioid analgesic to Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets.
The table cannot be used to convert from Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets to another opioid. Doing so will result in an overestimation of the dose of the new opioid and may result in fatal overdose.

Table 1: Conversion Factors to Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets

To calculate the estimated Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets dose using Table 1:

For patients on a single opioid, sum the current total daily dose of the opioid, convert it to a Morphine Equivalent Dose according to specific conversion factor for that specific opioid, then multiply the Morphine Equivalent Dose by the corresponding percentage in the above table to calculate the approximate oral methadone daily dose. Divide the total daily methadone dose derived from the table above to reflect the intended dosing schedule (i.e., for administration every 8 hours, divide total daily methadone dose by 3).
For patients on a regimen of more than one opioid, calculate the approximate oral methadone dose for each opioid and sum the totals to obtain the approximate total methadone daily dose. Divide the total daily methadone dose derived from the table above to reflect the intended dosing schedule (i.e., for administration every 8 hours, divide total daily methadone dose by 3).
For patients on a regimen of fixed-ratio opioid/non-opioid analgesic products, use only the opioid component of these products in the conversion.

### Medicine partnerships [^e1327263]. Heart (2003). Low credibility.

Partial medication compliance, where patients do not take enough of their prescribed medicine to achieve adequate outcomes, is common. Research using electronic monitoring to assess compliance has shown that people take approximately 75% of doses as prescribed, irrespective of the condition being treated or its severity. Erratic compliance often leads to discontinuation of therapy, as treatment is perceived to be ineffective. Compliance decreases as frequency of dosing increases. Inadequate compliance and treatment persistence results in poor outcomes, despite the best efforts of the medical team. It is important to develop and implement a strategy to improve compliance. Simple steps that can be taken include helping patients to select "cues" to remind them to take their tablets, use of dose reminder boxes, and visual feedback of compliance data from electronic monitors.

### Opioids in total joint arthroplasty: the clinical practice guidelines of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, hip society, and knee society [^9ebd1e8a]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). High credibility.

Total joint arthroplasty postoperative opioids — Guideline Question 5 evaluates the following: For patients undergoing primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA), do opioids administered after surgery affect postoperative pain, opioid consumption, patient reported outcome scores, and/or complications? Scheduled opioid administration without multimodal analgesia within 72 hours after primary TJA reduces the need for additional opioid pain medications for breakthrough pain and may reduce postoperative pain within 72 hours after surgery, but providing scheduled opioids is discouraged. Scheduled opioid administration postoperatively may increase the risk of complications, such as respiratory depression and sedation, especially if combined with other opioids administered during the perioperative period. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Nine studies including six high quality studies and three moderate quality studies evaluated the influence of postoperative opioids on outcomes after primary TJA. A limited number of direct meta-analyses were performed due to inconsistency in outcomes reported and the timepoints at which these outcomes were reported. Eight studies evaluated the postoperative consumption of opioids for breakthrough pain either delivered orally or with patient controlled analgesia between patients who received scheduled opioids postoperatively and patients who received placebo. All eight studies found that the administration of scheduled opioids postoperatively reduced the consumption of opioids.

### Understanding the number needed to treat [^d75bb01d]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2024). Medium credibility.

The number needed to treat (NNT) is the inverse of the absolute risk difference, which is used as a secondary outcome to clinical trials as a measure relevant to a positive trial, supplementing statistical significance. The NNT requires dichotomous outcomes and is influenced by the baseline disease or symptom severity, the particular population, the type and intensity of the interventional, the duration of treatment, the time period to assessment of response, and the comparator response. Confidence intervals should always accompany NNT for the precision of its estimate. In this review, three meta-analyses are reviewed, which included the NNT in the analysis of response.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate [^9a1562ef]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1. Conversion factors to hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets (Not Equianalgesic Doses)

To calculate the estimated total hydrocodone daily dose using Table 1:

For patients on a single opioid, sum the current total daily dose of the opioid and then multiply the total daily dose by the approximate oral conversion factor to calculate the approximate oral hydrocodone daily dose.
For patients on a regimen of more than one opioid, calculate the approximate oral hydrocodone dose for each opioid and sum the totals to obtain the approximate oral hydrocodone daily dose.
For patients on a regimen of fixed-ratio opioid/non-opioid analgesic products, use only the opioid component of these products in the conversion.
Reduce the calculated daily oral hydrocodone dose by 25%.

Always round the dose down, if necessary, to the nearest hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablet strength available and initiate therapy with that dose. If the converted hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets dose using Table 1 is less than 20 mg, initiate therapy with hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets 20 mg.

Example conversion from a single opioid to hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets: For example, a total daily dose of oxycodone 50 mg would be converted to hydrocodone 50 mg based on the table above, and then multiplied by 0.75 (i.e., take a 25% reduction) resulting in a dose of 37.5 mg hydrocodone. Round this down to the nearest dose strength available, hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets 30 mg, to initiate therapy.

### Preventable medication harm across health care settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8dd1b4ef]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study selection and data extraction

The titles and abstracts of all identified citations as well as potentially eligible full texts were screened independently by two reviewers (AH, MP), using pre-defined criteria. Disagreements were settled through consultation with a third team member (RNK). For eligible studies, we used a pilot-tested extraction spreadsheet, to extract descriptive data on study characteristics (e.g. number and age of participants, research design, systems used for data collection, assessment and preventability) and quantitative outcomes (prevalence, severity, medical care setting, the medication group and stage of medication use of preventable medication harm). Two independent researchers (AH and NT) performed the data extraction with disagreements resolved by discussion within the wider team (MP, RNK, DMA).

Risk of bias assessment

The quality of the studies was evaluated by two independent reviewers (AH and NT) using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cross-sectional and cohort studies. This assessed the representativeness of the sample size, response rate, ascertainment of the exposure, control of confounding variables, assessment of preventability and timing and appropriate statistical analysis, which provided a score ranging from 0 (lowest grade) to 10 (highest grade). A higher grade indicated a lower risk of bias. For our analyses, studies scoring 7 or above were considered as low risk, whereas studies scoring below 7 were considered as high risk of bias.

Data analysis

Prevalence of preventable medication harm was pooled using random-effects models with the DerSimonian-Laird approach. Secondary analysis looked at WHO priority areas including the healthcare system setting (i.e.g.eneral hospital/internal medicine; emergency department or ICU; highly specialised or surgical care — which included hospitals with long-term acute care facilities for dealing with certain disease categories such as cardiac, oncology, or orthopaedic problems; care units for paediatric patients, including neonatal intensive care units; and elderly patients, including geriatric patients aged above 64 years), the severity (i.e. mild, moderate, severe/life-threatening), stage of medication (i.e. using the US Pharmacopeia five major steps: prescribing, transcribing and documenting, dispensing, administering and monitoring), patient age distribution (new born (less than 3 years), adolescents (3 to 18 years), adults (19 to 69 years), elder (70 years or above)) based on mean or median and medication group according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System.

### Use of a novel standardized administration protocol reduces agitation pro Re nata (PRN) medication requirements: the birmingham agitation management (BAM) initiative [^9265fe76]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Agitation management is a principal challenge on inpatient psychiatric units. Overreliance on common prescribing strategies of pro re nata (PRN) medication administration is problematic, given the tendencies to have overlapping or unclear indications.

Objective

Piloted project to determine whether a standardized protocol for agitation intervention may reduce PRN medication administration.

Methods

The Birmingham Agitation Management (BAM) interdisciplinary team uniquely connected the Brøset Violence Checklist (BVC) for assessment of agitation severity to a standardized PRN medication order set. Nurses on the piloted unit were trained on how to score the BVC and administer medications. Patients were assessed by the BVC every 4 hours and, based on their score, would receive no medication, low-dose benzodiazepine, high-dose benzodiazepine, or high-dose benzodiazepine plus antipsychotic. The primary end point compared the number of PRNs administered after novel protocol implementation with a retrospective cohort. Secondary measures included analysis of medication-related effects, seclusion, and physical restraint rates.

Results

377 patients were included in the final analyses (184 pre-BAM, 193 BAM intervention group). No significant differences were seen in patient characteristics between groups. The total number of PRNs administered decreased by 42.5%, with both the mean and median number of administrations decreasing significantly (95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.68–5.75]; P < 0.001). A trend was noted between the number of PRNs administered and seclusion rates, but did not reach statistical significance (95% CI = [-7.28 to 60.31]; P = 0.124).

Conclusions

In seemingly the first initiative of its kind, we found that a standardized agitation management protocol can help decrease the total number of PRN administrations for agitation without worsening of restraint rates and may possibly reduce the risk of adverse effects. These results require validation in specific, larger populations.

### The rising cost of commonly used emergency department medications (2006–15) [^225e7a65]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

We determine how aggregate costs have changed for commonly used emergency department (ED) medications, and assess drivers of cost increases.

Methods

Using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), we identified the top 150 ED medications administered and prescribed at discharge in 2015. We used average wholesale prices (AWP) for each year from 2006 to 15 from the Red Book (Truven Health Analytics Inc.). Average wholesale price per patient (AWPP) was calculated by dividing AWP by drug uses. This was then multiplied by the total drug administrations or prescriptions to estimate the total cost in a given the year. All prices were converted to 2015 dollars.

Results

Aggregate costs of drugs administered in the ED increased from $688.7 million in 2006 to $882.4 million in 2015. For discharge prescriptions, aggregate costs increased from $2.031 billion in 2006 to $4.572 billion in 2015. AWPP for drugs administered in the ED in 2015 was 14.5% higher than in 2006 and 24.3% higher at discharge. The largest absolute increase in AWPP for drugs administered was for glucagon, which increased from $111 in 2006 to $235 in 2015. The largest AWPP increase at discharge was for epinephrine auto-injector, which increased from $124 in 2006 and to $481 in 2015.

Conclusion

Over the course of the study period, the aggregate costs of the most common medications administered in the ED increased by 28% while the costs of medications prescribed at discharge increased 125%.

### Waste and cost assessment of total intravenous anaesthesia in the context of environmental sustainability: insights from a Dutch academic hospital [^b968848f]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Editor,

Healthcare accounts for 7.3% of the total carbon footprint in the Netherlands, and operating rooms are among the most polluting departments in hospitals. One of the most impactful strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of the operating room is to minimise the use and waste of products. In addition, such reductions often result in financial benefits, which is a major motivator for change. Previous studies have shown that volatile anaesthetics have a larger carbon footprint than intravenous anaesthesia using propofol. Consequently, total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) has become the preferred choice for most anaesthetic procedures in the Netherlands. This study aims to provide empirical data to quantify the waste of leftover TIVA medications and materials.

As the study did not use human or animal material or data, ethics committee approval was not necessary. This prospective observational study was performed at the Erasmus Medical Centre (Erasmus MC) in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Annually, this tertiary academic teaching hospital performs approximately 25 000 surgical and 2000 sedation procedures. Data collection was performed over seven consecutive days from the 8th April up to and including the 14th of April, 2024. Patients who underwent cardiothoracic or paediatric surgery were excluded.

Bins were placed at the recovery rooms to collect leftover syringes used for propofol 50 mL (20 mg mL −1), remifentanil 20 mL (100 μg mL −1), sufentanil 20 mL (5 μg mL −1) and norepinephrine 50 mL (20 μg mL −1) at all general operating rooms and sedation locations. Leftovers were defined as syringes containing residual medications that were not administered. We ensured that all leftover syringes were thrown away in the research bins by providing appropriate instructions and daily reminders to anaesthesiologists, anaesthesia nurses, residents, sedationists and recovery nurses. During the data collection week, the number of syringes and the volumes of various medications in millilitres were recorded (Fig. 1). The exact volume administered to patients was extracted from our Healthcare Information eXchange system (HiX) 6.2 ChipsSoft. The data were reported as the total volume of waste per medication and as a percentage of the total volume of medication (wasted + administered) used during the same week.

### Effectiveness of double checking to reduce medication administration errors: a systematic review [^132aa774]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This review includes potential limitations. First, non–English-language studies were not searched, which may lead to publication bias. As only three of the 14 reviewed studies were rated as good quality, methodological limitations can also affect the collective findings. For example, five studies partially or completely relied on self-report to measure MAEs. Self-report likely resulted in under-ascertainment of MAEs, limiting the studies' findings. Decreased power may arise if under ascertainment was equal across all administrations, or bias, if under-ascertainment was systematically different across double-checked and single-checked administrations. Many studies also had insufficient sample sizes resulting in inadequate power to evaluate the association between double checking and medication errors. In addition, many studies only conducted basic bivariate analysis which may not properly account for potential confounding and other biases. Reviewed studies were also heterogeneous in their statistical analyses and reporting methods, making quantitative comparisons such as a meta-analysis infeasible. Lastly, inter-reviewer reliability was not formally estimated since consensus between two reviewers was reached. Conversely, a particular strength of this review is that it provides much updated evidence on the effectiveness of double checking, reviewing an additional 12 quantitative studies published since a prior systematic review.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Administer one tablet under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. Allow tablet to dissolve without swallowing. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. No more than three tablets are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, seek prompt medical attention.

NITROSTAT may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack.

For patients with xerostomia, a small sip of water prior to placing the tablet under the tongue may help maintain mucosal hydration and aid dissolution of the tablet.

Administer NITROSTAT at rest, preferably in the sitting position.

At the onset of an attack, administer one tablet under the tongue or buccal pouch. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes as needed. No more than 3 total tablets are recommended within a 15 minute period. (2)
If chest pain persists after three tablets, seek prompt medical attention. (2)

### Hydromorphone hydrochloride (Exalgo) [^18d9dba3]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Example conversion from a single opioid to EXALGO:

Step 1: Sum the total daily dose of the opioid

30 mg of oxycodone twice daily equals a total daily dose of 60 mg of oxycodone

Step 2: Calculate the approximately equivalent dose of oral hydromorphone based on the total daily dose of the opioid

Multiply the 60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone by the conversion factor of 0.4 for a result of 24 mg of oral hydromorphone

Step 3: Calculate the starting dose of EXALGO, which is 50% of the calculated oral hydromorphone dose

50% of 24 mg results in an initial dose of 12 mg of EXALGO once daily
Adjust individually for each patient

Table 1. Conversion Ratios to EXALGO*

* The conversion ratios and approximate equivalent doses in this conversion table are only to be used for the conversion from current opioid therapy to EXALGO.

It is extremely important to monitor all patients closely when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and tends to accumulate in the plasma.

Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to EXALGO

Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, EXALGO treatment can be initiated. For each 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal dose, the equianalgesic dose of EXALGO is 12 mg every 24 hours. An appropriate starting dose of EXALGO is 50% of the calculated total daily dose every 24 hours.

Aim

To evaluate the effectiveness of a 'Do not interrupt' bundled intervention to reduce non-medication-related interruptions to nurses during medication administration.

Methods

A parallel eight cluster randomised controlled study was conducted in a major teaching hospital in Adelaide, Australia. Four wards were randomised to the intervention which comprised wearing a vest when administering medications; strategies for diverting interruptions; clinician and patient education; and reminders. Control wards were blinded to the intervention. Structured direct observations of medication administration processes were conducted. The primary outcome was non-medication-related interruptions during individual medication dose administrations. The secondary outcomes were total interruption and multitasking rates. A survey of nurses' experiences was administered.

Results

Over 8 weeks and 364.7hours, 227 nurses were observed administering 4781 medications. At baseline, nurses experienced 57 interruptions/100 administrations, 87.9% were unrelated to the medication task being observed. Intervention wards experienced a significant reduction in non-medication-related interruptions from 50/100 administrations (95% CI 45 to 55) to 34/100 (95% CI 30 to 38). Controlling for clustering, ward type and medication route showed a significant reduction of 15 non-medication-related interruptions/100 administrations compared with control wards. A total of 88 nurses (38.8%) completed the poststudy survey. Intervention ward nurses reported that vests were time consuming, cumbersome and hot. Only 48% indicated that they would support the intervention becoming hospital policy.

Discussion

Nurses experienced a high rate of interruptions. Few were related to the medication task, demonstrating considerable scope to reduce unnecessary interruptions. While the intervention was associated with a statistically significant decline in non-medication-related interruptions, the magnitude of this reduction and its likely impact on error rates should be considered, relative to the effectiveness of alternate interventions, associated costs, likely acceptability and long-term sustainability of such interventions.

### The efficacy and safety of opioids in total joint arthroplasty: systematic review and direct meta-analysis [^3f8edb0b]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). High credibility.

Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) opioid safety — It is the opinion of the workgroup that opioids pose significant risks to patients when not safely administered. The cumulative dose of opioids administered as well as the timing between opioid doses must be carefully monitored in TJA patients. Patients who receive excess opioid pain medication are at significant risk for adverse events such as sedation and respiratory depression. It is the recommendation of the workgroup that extended release opioids should be avoided to help mitigate this risk. In addition, it is the opinion of the workgroup that the lowest clinically effective dose of opioids be prescribed and administered to patients to help curb these adverse events in addition to the risk for chronic opioid dependence. Given the inconsistency in results with regards to postoperative pain as well as complications associated with postoperative opioid use this recommendation was downgraded from strong to moderate.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^324c03cf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO EMS pain management — patient safety considerations: All patients should have drug allergies identified prior to administration of pain medication. Administer opioids with caution to patients with Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) less than 15, hypotension, identified medication allergy, hypoxia (SPO2 less than 90%) after maximal supplemental oxygen therapy, or signs of hypoventilation. Opioids are contraindicated for patients who have taken monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) during the previous 14 days. Avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen and ketorolac in patients with NSAID allergy, aspirin-sensitive asthma, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, or known peptic ulcer disease. Ketorolac should not be used in patients with hypotension (due to renal toxicity). Use of splinting techniques and application of ice should be done to reduce the total amount of medication used to keep the patient comfortable.

### Epinephrine, albuterol sulfate, nitroglycerin, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, aspirin (deluxe dental emergency kit) [^ae2a8270]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Administer one tablet under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. Allow tablet to dissolve without swallowing. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. No more than three tablets are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, seek prompt medical attention.

Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack.

For patients with xerostomia, a small sip of water prior to placing the tablet under the tongue may help maintain mucosal hydration and aid dissolution of the tablet.

Administer nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at rest, preferably in the sitting position.

At the onset of an attack, administer one tablet under the tongue or buccal pouch. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes as needed. No more than 3 total tablets are recommended within a 15 minute period. (2)
If chest pain persists after three tablets, seek prompt medical attention. (2)
May be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. (2)

### Assessing the clinical, economic, and health resource utilization impacts of prefilled syringes versus conventional medication administration methods: results from a systematic literature review [^47ad984d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this systematic review was to assess the clinical, economic, and health resource utilization outcomes associated with the use of prefilled syringes in medication administration compared with traditional preparation methods.

Data Sources

We conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate outcomes such as medication errors, wastage, time savings, and contamination in prefilled syringes. Our search encompassed multiple databases, including PubMed and Embase, for studies published between January 1, 2017, and November 1, 2022.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Peer-reviewed publications meeting our inclusion criteria underwent rigorous screening, including title, abstract, and full-text article assessments, performed by two reviewers.

Data Synthesis

Among reviewed articles, 24 met our eligibility criteria. Selected studies were primarily observational (46%) and conducted in Europe (46%). Our findings indicated that prefilled syringes consistently reduced medication errors (by 10%-73%), adverse events (from 1.1 to 0.275 per 100 administrations), wastage (by up to 80% of drug), and preparation time (from 4.0 to 338.0 seconds) (ranges varied by drug type, setting, and dosage). However, there was limited data on contamination. Economically, prefilled syringes reduced waste and error rates, which may translate into overall savings.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This review highlights the value of prefilled syringes, which can streamline medication delivery, save nursing time, and reduce preventable medication errors. Moreover, prefilled syringes have the potential to minimize medication wastage, optimizing resource utilization and efficiency in health care settings.

Conclusion and Relevance

Our findings provide new insights into clinical and economic benefits of prefilled syringe adoption. These benefits include improved medication delivery and safety, which can lead to time and cost reductions for health care departments, hospitals, and health systems. However, further real-world research on clinical and economic outcomes, especially in contamination, is needed to better understand the benefits of prefilled syringes.

### Preventing home medication administration errors [^8252cd48]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Impact of health care provider prescribing and pharmacy dispensing practices — prescribing can contribute to errors when orders are unclear and when unsafe formats are used. Health care provider prescribing practices contribute to medication errors; providers can prescribe in ways that can make medication administration by caregivers and patients easier or more complex. Missing or unclear information (eg, related to route, frequency, duration, indication) can affect the understandability of medication instructions. Providers may not follow safe prescribing practices recommended by The Joint Commission, whose standards recommend inclusion of leading zeros (eg, 0.X), avoidance of trailing zeros (eg, X.0), and avoidance of confusing abbreviations such as U (unit) and QD (daily) when prescriptions are ordered. Weight-based pediatric prescribing and milligram orders can yield complex converted volumes (eg, 4.8 mL) rather than simpler whole-number volumes (eg, 5 mL). Pediatric providers may also use multiple units of measurement and may believe caregivers are more comfortable with teaspoon or tablespoon terms.

### Medication adherence: a call for action [^81378b5e]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Poor adherence to efficacious cardiovascular-related medications has led to considerable morbidity, mortality, and avoidable health care costs. This article provides results of a recent think-tank meeting in which various stakeholder groups representing key experts from consumers, community health providers, the academic community, decision-making government officials (Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, etc), and industry scientists met to evaluate the current status of medication adherence and provide recommendations for improving outcomes. Below, we review the magnitude of the problem of medication adherence, prevalence, impact, and cost. We then summarize proven effective approaches and conclude with a discussion of recommendations to address this growing and significant public health issue of medication nonadherence.

Adjunctive medications for type 1 diabetes (T1D) include pramlintide and metformin: The amylin analog pramlintide, the only other medication approved for the treatment of T1D, is administered with prandial insulin; A1C reductions are consistently modest, mild weight loss is common, nausea is a common adverse effect, and there is a potential risk of severe hypoglycemia if prandial insulin dosage is not appropriately reduced. There has been much interest in metformin as adjunctive therapy for T1D, and a meta-analysis of 13 randomized placebo-controlled trials with 1183 participants with T1D reported small reductions in BMI, insulin requirements, total and LDL-C.

### Drug dosing adjustments in patients with chronic kidney disease [^a0d047e9]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects renal drug elimination and other pharmacokinetic processes involved in drug disposition (e.g., absorption, drug distribution, nonrenal clearance [metabolism]). Drug dosing errors are common in patients with renal impairment and can cause adverse effects and poor outcomes. Dosages of drugs cleared renally should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate and should be calculated using online or electronic calculators. Recommended methods for maintenance dosing adjustments are dose reductions, lengthening the dosing interval, or both. Physicians should be familiar with commonly used medications that require dosage adjustments. Resources are available to assist in dosing decisions for patients with chronic kidney disease.

The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Medium credibility.

Guideline Question 3 — Dose amount of tranexamic acid (TXA) in primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA): Within the context of the TXA doses used in primary TJA, the dose amount of TXA was not found to significantly affect its reduction of calculated blood loss or the need for transfusion during the perioperative episode of a primary TJA. The strength of recommendation is Strong. Supporting details note that network meta-analysis demonstrates no additional reduction in blood loss with high-dose intravenous (IV) TXA compared to low-dose IV TXA and that analyses of topical TXA reported no statistical difference between low-dose and high-dose regimens. Reported dose ranges in the network meta-analysis include IV TXA at 10 mg/kg and 3 doses of 15 mg/kg, and topical TXA between 0.5 g and 3 g.

### The efficacy and safety of opioids in total joint arthroplasty: systematic review and direct meta-analysis [^1a823713]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). High credibility.

Areas for future research in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) opioids emphasize that The best available evidence includes high and moderate quality data, however, there remain many limitations in the formulation of the clinical practice guidelines on the use of opioids after primary TJA. Given the poor outcomes after primary TJA among patients who take chronic opioids prior surgery, we recommend future research on innovative and effective ways at reducing chronic opioid use prior to TJA. Future research should evaluate whether reducing chronic preoperative opioid use leads to improved postoperative outcomes including postoperative pain, opioid consumption, opioid dependence, and functional outcomes. Opioids administered during the perioperative period (e.g. immediately preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively) reduce the need for additional opioid consumption and postoperative pain, yet there is significant heterogeneity in the route, dose, frequency, and type of opioids administered in the current literature and In addition, many of the studies included did not utilize a multimodal analgesic regimen. For preoperative use, in the studies reporting on opioids administered preoperatively, most investigate transdermal fentanyl while only two other studies evaluate intravenous and oral opioids. Future research should focus on determining the role of opioids in a modern multimodal anesthesia and analgesia protocol after TJA, including This would include determining what opioids should be administered, the route, dose, frequency, and duration of treatment, and Future research should also focus on how many pills should be prescribed after discharge and ways to help patients wean from taking opioids after surgery. With the advent of the opioid crisis in the United States, tramadol has been considered a safer alternative to other traditional opioid pain medications for treatment of postoperative pain.

### Bupivacaine [^5ae8aac4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

However, to reflect the current standard of care of postsurgical multimodal therapy, all patients received cyclobenzaprine (a single dose of 10 mg orally or as needed) and acetaminophen/paracetamol (up to 1,000 mg orally or IV every 8 hours for a maximum total daily dose of 3000 mg) postsurgically.

In this study there were no statistically significant treatment effects for the bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension group compared to the placebo group in cumulative pain intensity scores or total opioid consumption. All patients in the bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension and placebo treatment groups required opioid rescue medication over 72 hours. The median Tmax of bupivacaine observed in this study was 72 hours with a range of 2.5 to 108 hours. Similar to Study 6, patient falls only occurred in the bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension-treated patients and not the placebo-treated patients.

Study 8: Lack of Efficacy in Intercostal Nerve Block for Posterolateral Thoracotomy

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 191 adult patients undergoing posterolateral thoracotomy under general anesthesia (NCT01802411) (Study 8). The mean age was 58 years (range 18 to 82).

After the surgical procedure was completed but prior to the surgical site closure, 266 mg (20 mL) of bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension was administered by the surgeon as an intercostal nerve block divided into three equal doses in three syringes of approximately 88 mg in 6.6 mL volume per nerve, and administered to each of three nerve segments (index nerve, nerve above, and nerve below). Postsurgically, patients were allowed opioid rescue medication administered initially by intravenous fentanyl 100 mcg, which was to be administered once via bolus only. For the US sites, the second rescue medication was to be PCA-administered morphine or hydromorphone. For the European sites, the second rescue medication was to be intramuscular administered morphine up to 10 mg every 4 hours. At all sites, once a patient was tolerating oral medication, oral immediate-release oxycodone was administered (but not more than 10 mg every 4 hours). Patients who did not achieve adequate pain relief with this regimen were to be withdrawn from the study and followed for safety only.

The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). High credibility.

Intravenous ketorolac in total joint arthroplasty — evidence and dosing guidance: The direct meta-analysis of opioid consumption significantly favored IV ketorolac compared to placebo with limited heterogeneity, with no significant increase of medical complications such as adverse events, nausea/vomiting, blood loss, pruritus, urinary retention, or respiratory depression. Among the included studies, the total dosage of IV ketorolac administered to patients ranged between 15 mg and 150 mg given within the first 24 hours after surgery. Only one high quality study compared low- and high-doses and demonstrated no difference between a single postoperative dose of 15 mg or 30 mg of IV ketorolac. The workgroup suggests the use of minimally effective doses to diminish the risk of medical complications such as acute kidney failure.

### Preventing home medication administration errors [^fd3c91f5]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Medication system and dispensing contributors to pediatric home dosing errors include electronic health record (EHR) instructions that may not allow rounding or default to multiple units, complex regimens that providers can simplify by avoiding nonessential medications and deprescribing, and pharmacy practices in which prescription units are frequently changed or different strengths/concentrations are dispensed without clear caregiver notification. Error reduction approaches include use of pharmacy software to support safe dispensing, adoption of a universal formulary that limits available medication concentrations, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-funded Standardize 4 Safety initiative led by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists to create national standards for intravenous and oral medication concentrations to reduce risk.

### Medication review in hospitalised patients to reduce morbidity and mortality [^52c08dbb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A medication review can be defined as a structured evaluation of a patient's medication conducted by healthcare professionals with the aim of optimising medication use and improving health outcomes. Optimising medication therapy though medication reviews may benefit hospitalised patients.

Objectives

We examined the effects of medication review interventions in hospitalised adult patients compared to standard care or to other types of medication reviews on all-cause mortality, hospital readmissions, emergency department contacts and health-related quality of life.

Search Methods

In this Cochrane Review update, we searched for new published and unpublished trials using the following electronic databases from 1 January 2014 to 17 January 2022 without language restrictions: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). To identify additional trials, we searched the reference lists of included trials and other publications by lead trial authors, and contacted experts.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of medication reviews delivered by healthcare professionals for hospitalised adult patients. We excluded trials including outpatients and paediatric patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for data clarification and relevant unpublished data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous data (with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)). We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

In this updated review, we included a total of 25 trials (15,076 participants), of which 15 were new trials (11,501 participants). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 20 months. We found that medication reviews in hospitalised adults may have little to no effect on mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.05; 18 trials, 10,108 participants; low-certainty evidence); likely reduce hospital readmissions (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; 17 trials, 9561 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); may reduce emergency department contacts (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.03; 8 trials, 3527 participants; low-certainty evidence) and have very uncertain effects on health-related quality of life (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.30; 4 trials, 392 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Medication reviews in hospitalised adult patients likely reduce hospital readmissions and may reduce emergency department contacts. The evidence suggests that mediation reviews may have little to no effect on mortality, while the effect on health-related quality of life is very uncertain. Almost all trials included elderly polypharmacy patients, which limits the generalisability of the results beyond this population.

Bedaquiline dosing and regimen role in adults with pulmonary MDR-TB — use, dose, and recommendation strength are specified. Bedaquiline is customarily used as part of combination therapy (minimum four-drug therapy) for adults aged ≥ 18 years when an effective regimen cannot otherwise be provided. The recommended adult dose is 400 mg orally once daily for 2 weeks, then 200 mg orally three times weekly, for a total of 24 weeks. For regimen composition, bedaquiline should be included to achieve a total of five effective drugs for MDR-TB, and the recommendation for routine use is strong despite very low certainty in the evidence.

### Medication adherence measurement methods in registration trials supporting the approval of new medicines: a cross-sectional analysis of centralized procedures in the European union 2010–2020 [^8003bded]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

The frequency of trials measuring adherence was reported in absolute numbers and percentages for the full study sample and stratified by year of approval, by therapeutic area (diabetes, respiratory conditions, cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, and oncology), by route of administration (oral, injection, and inhalation) and by primary dosing regimen (once daily, twice daily, multiple times daily, once weekly, and twice monthly). For the subset of trials measuring adherence, we reported on how frequently different methods were used for measuring adherence (pill/dose count, patient diary/report, electronic methods, bioanalytical methods, questionnaire, or other methods) again in absolute numbers and percentages for all trials and stratified by therapeutic area, by route of administration, and by dosing regimen. Finally, we reported overall adherence rate as the crude pooled mean adherence rates in the subset of trials that reported adherence rate as descriptive summary statistics. Adherence rates were stratified by therapeutic area.

### Reducing medication errors for adults in hospital settings [^3940d192]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Medication errors are preventable events that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the healthcare professional or patient. Medication errors in hospitalised adults may cause harm, additional costs, and even death.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of interventions to reduce medication errors in adults in hospital settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and two trials registers on 16 January 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and interrupted time series (ITS) studies investigating interventions aimed at reducing medication errors in hospitalised adults, compared with usual care or other interventions. Outcome measures included adverse drug events (ADEs), potential ADEs, preventable ADEs, medication errors, mortality, morbidity, length of stay, quality of life and identified/solved discrepancies. We included any hospital setting, such as inpatient care units, outpatient care settings, and accident and emergency departments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group. Where necessary, we extracted and reanalysed ITS study data using piecewise linear regression, corrected for autocorrelation and seasonality, where possible. MAIN RESULTS: We included 65 studies: 51 RCTs and 14 ITS studies, involving 110,875 participants. About half of trials gave rise to 'some concerns' for risk of bias during the randomisation process and one-third lacked blinding of outcome assessment. Most ITS studies presented low risk of bias. Most studies came from high-income countries or high-resource settings. Medication reconciliation -the process of comparing a patient's medication orders to the medications that the patient has been taking- was the most common type of intervention studied. Electronic prescribing systems, barcoding for correct administering of medications, organisational changes, feedback on medication errors, education of professionals and improved medication dispensing systems were other interventions studied. Medication reconciliation Low-certainty evidence suggests that medication reconciliation (MR) versus no-MR may reduce medication errors (odds ratio [OR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 1.74; 3 studies; n = 379). Compared to no-MR, MR probably reduces ADEs (OR 0.38, 95%CI 0.18 to 0.80; 3 studies, n = 1336; moderate-certainty evidence), but has little to no effect on length of stay (mean difference (MD) -0.30 days, 95%CI -1.93 to 1.33 days; 3 studies, n = 527) and quality of life (MD -1.51, 95%CI -10.04 to 7.02; 1 study, n = 131). Low-certainty evidence suggests that, compared to MR by other professionals, MR by pharmacists may reduce medication errors (OR 0.21, 95%CI 0.09 to 0.48; 8 studies, n = 2648) and may increase ADEs (OR 1.34, 95%CI 0.73 to 2.44; 3 studies, n = 2873). Compared to MR by other professionals, MR by pharmacists may have little to no effect on length of stay (MD -0.25, 95%CI -1.05 to 0.56; 6 studies, 3983). Moderate-certainty evidence shows that this intervention probably has little to no effect on mortality during hospitalisation (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95%CI 0.57 to 1.7; 2 studies, n = 1000), and on readmissions at one month (RR 0.93, 95%CI 0.76 to 1.14; 2 studies, n = 997); and low-certainty evidence suggests that the intervention may have little to no effect on quality of life (MD 0.00, 95%CI -14.09 to 14.09; 1 study, n = 724). Low-certainty evidence suggests that database-assisted MR conducted by pharmacists, versus unassisted MR conducted by pharmacists, may reduce potential ADEs (OR 0.26, 95%CI 0.10 to 0.64; 2 studies, n = 3326), and may have no effect on length of stay (MD 1.00, 95%CI -0.17 to 2.17; 1 study, n = 311). Low-certainty evidence suggests that MR performed by trained pharmacist technicians, versus pharmacists, may have little to no difference on length of stay (MD -0.30, 95%CI -2.12 to 1.52; 1 study, n = 183). However, the CI is compatible with important beneficial and detrimental effects. Low-certainty evidence suggests that MR before admission may increase the identification of discrepancies compared with MR after admission (MD 1.27, 95%CI 0.46 to 2.08; 1 study, n = 307). However, the CI is compatible with important beneficial and detrimental effects. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that multimodal interventions probably increase discrepancy resolutions compared to usual care (RR 2.14, 95%CI 1.81 to 2.53; 1 study, n = 487). Computerised physician order entry (CPOE)/clinical decision support systems (CDSS) Moderate-certainty evidence shows that CPOE/CDSS probably reduce medication errors compared to paper-based systems (OR 0.74, 95%CI 0.31 to 1.79; 2 studies, n = 88). Moderate-certainty evidence shows that, compared with standard CPOE/CDSS, improved CPOE/CDSS probably reduce medication errors (OR 0.85, 95%CI 0.74 to 0.97; 2 studies, n = 630). Low-certainty evidence suggests that prioritised alerts provided by CPOE/CDSS may prevent ADEs compared to non-prioritised (inconsequential) alerts (MD 1.98, 95%CI 1.65 to 2.31; 1 study; participant numbers unavailable). Barcode identification of participants/medications Low-certainty evidence suggests that barcoding may reduce medication errors (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.59 to 0.79; 2 studies, n = 50,545). Reduced working hours Low-certainty evidence suggests that reduced working hours may reduce serious medication errors (RR 0.83, 95%CI 0.63 to 1.09; 1 study, n = 634). However, the CI is compatible with important beneficial and detrimental effects. Feedback on prescribing errors Low-certainty evidence suggests that feedback on prescribing errors may reduce medication errors (OR 0.47, 95%CI 0.33 to 0.67; 4 studies, n = 384). Dispensing system Low-certainty evidence suggests that dispensing systems in surgical wards may reduce medication errors (OR 0.61, 95%CI 0.47 to 0.79; 2 studies, n = 1775).

Authors' Conclusions

Low- to moderate-certainty evidence suggests that, compared to usual care, medication reconciliation, CPOE/CDSS, barcoding, feedback and dispensing systems in surgical wards may reduce medication errors and ADEs. However, the results are imprecise for some outcomes related to medication reconciliation and CPOE/CDSS. The evidence for other interventions is very uncertain. Powered and methodologically sound studies are needed to address the identified evidence gaps. Innovative, synergistic strategies -including those that involve patients- should also be evaluated.

### Medication review in hospitalised patients to reduce morbidity and mortality [^ae125e7d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacotherapy in the elderly population is complicated by several factors that increase the risk of drug-related harms and less favourable effectiveness. The concept of medication review is a key element in improving the quality of prescribing and in preventing adverse drug events. Although there is no generally accepted definition of medication review, it can be broadly defined as a systematic assessment of pharmacotherapy for an individual patient that aims to optimise patient medication by providing a recommendation or by making a direct change. Medication review performed in adult hospitalised patients may lead to better patient outcomes.

Objectives

We examined whether delivery of a medication review by a physician, pharmacist or other healthcare professional leads to improvement in health outcomes of hospitalised adult patients compared with standard care.

Search Methods

We searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) to November 2014, as well as International Pharmaceutical Abstracts and Web of Science to May 2015. In addition, we searched reference lists of included trials and relevant reviews. We searched trials registries and contacted experts to identify additional published and unpublished trials. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of medication review in hospitalised adult patients. We excluded trials of outclinic and paediatric patients. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes included hospital readmissions, emergency department contacts and adverse drug events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently included trials, extracted data and assessed trials for risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for clarification of data and for additional unpublished data. We calculated risk ratios for dichotomous data and mean differences for continuous data (with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)). The GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to assess the overall certainty of evidence for the most important outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 6600 references (4647 references in our initial review) and included 10 trials (3575 participants). Follow-up ranged from 30 days to one year. Nine trials provided mortality data (3218 participants, 466 events), with a risk ratio of 1.02 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.19) (low-certainty evidence). Seven trials provided hospital readmission data (2843 participants, 1043 events) with a risk ratio of 0.95 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.04) (high-certainty evidence). Four trials provided emergency department contact data (1442 participants, 244 events) with a risk ratio of 0.73 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.03) (low-certainty evidence). The estimated reduction in emergency department contacts of 27% (with a CI ranging from 48% reduction to 3% increase in contacts) corresponds to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 37 for a low-risk population and 12 for a high-risk population over one year. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not significantly alter our results.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence that medication review reduces mortality or hospital readmissions, although we did find evidence that medication review may reduce emergency department contacts. However, because of short follow-up ranging from 30 days to one year, important treatment effects may have been overlooked. High-quality trials with long-term follow-up (i.e. at least up to a year) are needed to provide more definitive evidence for the effect of medication review on clinically important outcomes such as mortality, readmissions and emergency department contacts, and on outcomes such as adverse events. Therefore, if used in clinical practice, medication reviews should be undertaken as part of a clinical trial with long-term follow-up.

### Preventing home medication administration errors [^ce95c53b]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Role of health literacy and limited English proficiency — impact and mitigation: Nearly 30% of parents in the United States, or approximately 21 million US parents, have low health literacy, and only 15% of parents are considered proficient; limited health literacy has been linked to increased odds of liquid medication dosing errors by 1.5-fold to 2.5-fold. Approximately 12% of US adults have limited English proficiency, and patients with limited English proficiency are at increased risk for misunderstanding instructions and making errors, particularly when information is not provided in their preferred language or translations are poor. Provision of instructions in the caregiver's and/or patient's native or preferred language is considered to be an essential first step to achieving understanding of medication instructions, and use of trained interpreters and certified translation experts is necessary to facilitate high-quality translation and interpretation; however, suboptimal access to high-quality medical interpretation and pharmacy label translations is common and can have important clinical consequences.

### Adverse drug events caused by serious medication administration errors [^7ae12309]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2012). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine how often serious or life-threatening medication administration errors with the potential to cause harm (potential adverse drug events) result in actual harm (adverse drug events (ADEs)) in the hospital setting.

Design

Retrospective chart review of clinical events following observed medication administration errors.

Background

Medication errors are common at the medication administration stage for inpatients. While many errors can cause harm, it is unclear exactly how often.

Methods

In a previous study where 14 041 medication administrations were directly observed, 1271 medication administration errors were discovered, of which 133 had the potential to cause serious or life-threatening harm and were considered serious or life-threatening potential adverse drug events. As a follow-up, clinical reviewers conducted detailed chart review of serious or life-threatening potential ADEs to determine if they caused an ADE. Reviewers assessed severity of the ADE and attribution to the error.

Results

Ten (7.5% (95% CI 6.98 to 8.01)) actual ADEs resulted from the 133 serious and life-threatening potential ADEs, of which 6 resulted in significant, three in serious, and one life threatening injury. Therefore 4 (3% (95% CI 2.12 to 3.6)) of serious or life threatening potential ADEs led to serious or life threatening ADEs. Half of the ADEs were caused by dosage or monitoring errors for anti-hypertensives.

Conclusions

Unintercepted potential ADEs at the medication administration stage can cause serious patient harm. At hospitals where 6 million doses are administered per year, about 4000 preventable ADEs would be attributable to medication administration errors annually.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for rapid sequence intubation in the critically ill adult patient [^841e64d6]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Medication-assisted preoxygenation (delayed sequence intubation) in agitated, delirious, or uncooperative adults undergoing rapid sequence intubation (RSI) — conditional guidance and limited observational data are presented. We suggest using medication-assisted preoxygenation to improve preoxygenation in patients undergoing RSI who are not able to tolerate a face mask, NIPPV, or HFNO because of agitation, delirium, or combative behavior (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Medication-assisted preoxygenation modifies RSI so that the sedative-hypnotic agent and NMBA are not administered in rapid succession, but a sedative-hypnotic agent is administered to facilitate preoxygenation and once the clinician is satisfied that the patient is adequately preoxygenated, then the NMBA is administered followed by intubation. In a multicenter ED observation, a mean oxygenation saturation increase of 8.9% (95% CI, 6.4–10.9%) occurred after ketamine infusion (initial dose 1 mg/kg with 0.5 mg/kg doses until a dissociative state was achieved; mean total dose 1.4 mg/kg), with a higher oxygen saturation level at the time of NMBA administration (98.9% compared with 89.9%). A retrospective observational study in a helicopter-based emergency medical service unit reported intubation-related outcomes (85% FPS rate, 5% desaturation rate, 5% hypotension rate) with ketamine 1.5 mg/kg (3 min before NMBA administration), but there was no comparison group. Although the overall body of literature is of very low quality, medication-assisted preoxygenation may be useful in a select group of high-risk patients who cannot tolerate a face mask, NIPPV, or HFNO, and there is insufficient evidence to suggest using medication-assisted preoxygenation for any other critically ill patient population.

### Fast and accurate medication identification [^88ad0418]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Breakthroughs in prescription medication are among the reasons we live longer. For example, HIV is today a chronic disease, while it was a fatal diagnosis in the 1980s. Meanwhile, there is an increasing number of medications, both branded and generic on the market as the number of FDA-approved drugs continues to increase. At the same time, prescription medication usage is increasing; over 4 billion prescriptions were filled in 2017. In a given week, four out of five people take prescription, over-the-counter, and supplementary medications, and one-third of people will take five or more. Medication usage is increasing across age groups, particularly among the elderly. Of people aged 65 and above, nine of ten were on prescription medications within the last 30 days. In the same age group, the consumption of multiple medications is common. Despite high rates of medication usage, as a population, we are getting sicker. In 2012, about half of the Americans had at least one chronic condition, and one in four had multiple chronic conditions, a growing population that frequently requires multiple medications. Thus, increasing medication usage across the population puts additional responsibility on patients to take medications as prescribed and making medication errors more likely outside hospital settings. Between 2003 and 2007, there was a 44% increase in calls to poison control centerswith most of the increased calls relating to pill identification. From 2000 through 2012, Poison Control Centers in the United States received data on 67,603 exposures related to unintentional therapeutic pharmaceutical errors that occurred outside of healthcare facilities that resulted in serious medical outcomes. The overall average rate of these medication errors was 1.73 per 100,000 population, resulting in 414 deaths, and there was an increase from 3065 to 6855 during the 13-year study period. In 2012, nearly 300 k people called poison control regarding medication error, 16% for taking the wrong medication.

### Treatment patterns and medication adherence of patients with glaucoma in south Korea [^9a462127]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background/aims

This study aimed to investigate treatment patterns and medication adherence of glaucoma. It also identified key factors associated with non-adherence.

Methods

It was a cross-sectional, observational study. Patients who use eye-drops for ≤ 2 years were recruited at 15 eye clinics from March to November 2013. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires and medical chart review. Medication adherence was evaluated using patients' self-report on pill count and defined as patients' administering drug for ≥ 80% of prescribed days. Medication adherence rate was calculated by dividing actual number of administration from total prescribed number of administration for 7 days. Patients whose self-reported prescription was different from total daily doses of physicians' prescription were considered as non-adherent.

Results

A total of 1050 patients included, and medication adherence rate was evaluated in 1046 patients whose verification of adherence was available. Of the total, 27.4% were non-adherent, and the medication adherence rates of the total, the adherent, and the non-adherent were 90.6 ± 17.8%, 96.8 ± 5.5% and 56.6 ± 24.7%, respectively. The most commonly used medication was prostaglandin (PGA) alone and the second was combination of two-class (β-blocker and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (CAI)) and three-class combination of PGA, β-blocker and CAI followed. In multivariate analysis, the risk of non-adherence was 1.466 times greater in males than in females (95% CI 1.106 to 1.943) and 1.328-fold greater as the daily number of administration was increased (95% CI 1.186 to 1.487).

Conclusion

Approximately, one-third of the patients were non-adherent, and males and increased daily number of administration were associated with non-adherence. It highlights that more systematic treatment strategies should be considered for better medication adherence, leading to effective glaucoma management.

### Impact of individual and treatment characteristics on wearable sensor-based digital biomarkers of opioid use [^c0de33cd]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Model performance stratified by treatment characteristics

Treatment characteristics explored included predominant type of opioid administered, total MME administered over the study course, and duration of hospitalization. The impact of concomitantly administered medications from classes of particular interest (beta-adrenergic antagonists (or beta-blockers), calcium channel blockers (CCB), sedatives, stimulants, and non-narcotic analgesics) were also evaluated.

Model metrics were negatively correlated with both total MME administered (Fig. 5) and total duration of hospitalization (Fig. 6). Specificity and accuracy showed a significant downward trend as total MME increased. Similarly, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy all decreased significantly as length of hospitalization increased. No significant differences were noted based on predominant opioid type administered.

The impact of concomitantly administered medications from other classes was evaluated by considering opioid detection model metrics for each participant-day, stratified by whether a given class of medication was co-administered on that day. Model metrics by daily co-administered medication administration status are shown in Fig. 7. Accuracy and specificity were significantly decreased on study days where a non-narcotic analgesic was co-administered (74% vs. 66%, and 72% vs. 62%, respectively). Sensitivity decreased significantly on days when a sedative was co-administered (75.5% vs. 61.0%). Model metrics (sensitivity and accuracy) decreased on days where participants received a calcium channel blocker or stimulant in addition to opioid analgesics compared to those that did not; however, these differences in model performance were not statistically significant. There was no change in model performance based on beta-blocker co-administration.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in total joint arthroplasty: the clinical practice guidelines of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, hip society, and knee society [^352abeec]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). High credibility.

Primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA) — perioperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) compared with placebo: Oral or IV NSAIDs administered preoperatively, intraoperatively, or postoperatively do not appear to increase the risk of medical complications following primary TJA, and providers should consider patient comorbidities, the type of NSAID administered, dose, and duration of administration. Strength of Recommendation: Limited. Among randomized clinical trials comparing perioperative oral NSAIDs and placebo, twelve studies reported on medical complications, and qualitative examination demonstrated no consistent difference between oral selective COX-2 agents (including Celecoxib and Meloxicam), oral non-selective NSAIDs, and placebo, with the exception of a lower incidence of postoperative fever with patients receiving an oral NSAID.

### Preparation / administration of push-dose versus continuous infusion epinephrine and phenylephrine: a simulation [^d9ef375b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypotension is a common problem in the emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU) and can increase risk for poor outcomes. Many EDs/ICUs utilize epinephrine and phenylephrine to treat hypotension and these medications are most often administered as a continuous infusion (CI). Push-dose (PD) is the administration of small medication doses as intermittent intravenous pushes (IVPs). There is limited information comparing the time required to prepare and administer PD versus CI and errors have been reported when preparing and administering these medications at bedside. This simulation study sought to estimate preparation and administration times and preparation and errors with PD and CI epinephrine and phenylephrine when prepared by an ED/ICU pharmacist.

Methods

This crossover simulation study took place in a simulation center at an academic medical center and utilized a multi-venous intravenous training arm kit equip with an 18-gauge intravenous line, an extension tubing set, and a luer-lock adapter. The primary outcome was total preparation and administration time in seconds. The secondary outcome was major preparation and administration errors, defined as errors causing a five-fold or greater overdose.

Results

In total, 16 pharmacists participated, including nine ED and seven ICU pharmacists. PD had faster total preparation and administration time and administration time, but not preparation time; PD showed an approximate 70 s decrease in total preparation and administration time versus CI. PD had more major preparation and administration errors and six PD preparations (18.8%, 6/32) had at least one major preparation and administration error. CI, on the other hand, had no major preparation and administration errors.

Discussion

This simulation found faster total preparation and administration time with PD versus CI epinephrine and phenylephrine, but also found that PD had more major preparation and administration errors. Dilutional errors during medication preparation were the cause of 83.3% (5/6) of our overdoses.

Conclusion

This simulation study showed that ED/ICU pharmacists had faster median total preparation and administration times for PD epinephrine and phenylephrine versus CI, but PD also had more preparation and administration errors.

### Deprescribing medications among older adults from end of hospitalization through postacute care: a shed-MEDS randomized clinical trial [^a7c9d9c1]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Deprescribing is a promising approach to addressing the burden of polypharmacy. Few studies have initiated comprehensive deprescribing in the hospital setting among older patients requiring ongoing care in a postacute care (PAC) facility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of a patient-centered deprescribing intervention among hospitalized older adults transitioning or being discharged to a PAC facility.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial of the Shed-MEDS (Best Possible Medication History, Evaluate, Deprescribing Recommendations, and Synthesis) deprescribing intervention was conducted between March 2016 and October 2020. Patients who were admitted to an academic medical center and discharged to 1 of 22 PAC facilities affiliated with the medical center were recruited. Patients who were 50 years or older and had 5 or more prehospital medications were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to the intervention group or control group. Patients who were non-English speaking, were unhoused, were long-stay residents of nursing homes, or had less than 6 months of life expectancy were excluded. An intention-to-treat approach was used.

Interventions

The intervention group received the Shed-MEDS intervention, which consisted of a pharmacist- or nurse practitioner-led comprehensive medication review, patient or surrogate-approved deprescribing recommendations, and deprescribing actions that were initiated in the hospital and continued throughout the PAC facility stay. The control group received usual care at the hospital and PAC facility.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the total medication count at hospital discharge and PAC facility discharge, with follow-up assessments during the 90-day period after PAC facility discharge. Secondary outcomes included the total number of potentially inappropriate medications at each time point, the Drug Burden Index, and adverse events.

Results

A total of 372 participants (mean [SD] age, 76.2 [10.7] years; 229 females [62%]) were randomized to the intervention or control groups. Of these participants, 284 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (142 in the intervention group and 142 in the control group). Overall, there was a statistically significant treatment effect, with patients in the intervention group taking a mean of 14% fewer medications at PAC facility discharge (mean ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.93; P < .001) and 15% fewer medications at the 90-day follow-up (mean ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78–0.92; P < .001) compared with the control group. The intervention additionally reduced patient exposure to potentially inappropriate medications and Drug Burden Index. Adverse drug event rates were similar between the intervention and control groups (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.52–1.30).

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this trial showed that the Shed-MEDS patient-centered deprescribing intervention was safe and effective in reducing the total medication burden at PAC facility discharge and 90 days after discharge. Future studies are needed to examine the effect of this intervention on patient-reported and long-term clinical outcomes.

### Use of pediatric injectable medicines guidelines and associated medication administration errors: a human reliability analysis [^509e5955]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Overall, there were 6 discrepancies that made a major contribution to a clinically significant MAE and 4 that made a major contribution to a large-magnitude MAE (Table 1). These are described in more detail in Table 2. This is equivalent to 27% and 15% of all clinically significant and large-magnitude medication errors observed in the original study, respectively. All discrepancies making a major contribution to a large-magnitude administration error arose at the step of accessing the pediatric intravenous guide (step 1.1). A further 2 clinically significant administration errors arose from misreading the method of administration of a medication (step 2.2).

### Estimating global, regional, and national daily and cumulative infections with SARS-CoV-2 through nov 14, 2021: a statistical analysis [^5284c7ec]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

R effective estimation in the past

Using daily infections, we directly estimated R effective in the past by location and day, where R effective at time t is:

The assumptions required for this estimation are the duration from infection to being infectious and the period of infectiousness, collectively represented as θ. We used ranges of 3–5 days for both assumptions to generate estimates of R effective in the past. These estimates are useful for identifying the effect of different non-pharmaceutical interventions on transmission in different settings. An R effective lower than 1·0 indicates that the epidemic is shrinking, whereas an R effective higher than 1·0 indicates that the epidemic is growing.

We compared R effective to an estimate of total immunity in the population of location l at time t (presented as weekly averages), where this value is calculated as:

The proportion of the population effectively vaccinated is a function of doses administered and brand-specific efficacy and is discounted for existing natural immunity at the time of delivery.

Role of the funding source

The funders of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or the writing of the report.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: uses and pitfalls [^ff53a0ec]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is a formal method of comparing alternative medical interventions with regard to their resource utilization (costs) and outcomes (effectiveness). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is an informative measure generated from such an analysis and represents the ratio of the difference in cost between two medical interventions to the difference in outcomes between the two interventions. Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio summarizes the additional cost per unit of health benefit gained in switching from one medical intervention to another. Although incremental cost-effectiveness ratios have limitations, when used in the proper context, these ratios serve as one of the important tools needed to help guide decisions about allocating scarce resources across competing medical programmes.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (5.1, 7.1).
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (5.2).
Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage (2.3, 5.3).

### Cost-effectiveness analysis for clinicians [^6438d463]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The current economic news is bad. Expenditure on health care is under scrutiny in every country and with predictions of another economic crash comes pressure on the funding of health care systems - systems that, according to the World Health Organizationare meant to deliver quality service to all people, when and where they need them.

At the same time, new products - pharmaceuticals, diagnostic tests, new technologies - continue to be developed and launched. Health care systems are under pressure to pay for all of the potential hope that these provide, sometimes with good reason, sometimes without. This is where cost-effectiveness analysis comes in.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^a092b483]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis perspectives — Table 1 delineates cost components and examples by perspective (Health Care Sector, "Modified Societal", Full Societal). Components and examples include health care costs paid by third-party payers (drug/device costs, hospital services, physician services, home care services, allied health), costs paid out-of-pocket by patients (drug copayment/coinsurance and user fees), patient-time costs (time spent seeking care), unpaid caregiver-time costs (time spent in caregiving), and productivity losses (formal/informal labor earnings lost, cost of unpaid lost productivity due to illness, cost of uncompensated household production). Broader sectors listed include social services, housing, legal or criminal justice, education, and environmental. Footnotes instruct that analysts should attempt to capture all relevant costs from a societal perspective and describe a "modified" societal perspective that includes some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but excludes costs from other sectors of the economy.

### Associations between double-checking and medication administration errors: a direct observational study of paediatric inpatients [^87da9b2d]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

Medication administration errors

MAEs were defined as administrations which deviated from: the prescriber's medication order documented in the patient's chart; the manufacturers' preparation/administration instructions; or relevant hospital medication administration policies. To identify MAEs, observational data of medications administered were compared with medications recorded on patients' medication charts by a reviewer blinded to information about double-checking status. Fifteen MAE categories were applied (online supplementary appendix 3) including: incorrect drug, strength, formulation, dose, route, IV rate. These categories have been defined and applied in previous studies. Medication timing errors were excluded.

The potential harm severity of each error identified was rated by the reviewer. If multiple errors occurred in the same dose administration, potential harm severity was based on the cumulative effect of all errors. A severity scale, adapted from the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Preventionwas used (online supplementary appendix 3).

### Zolpidem tartrate [^f00ea222]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The following table was derived from results of 11 placebo-controlled short-term U.S. efficacy trials involving zolpidem in doses ranging from 1.25 to 20 mg. The table is limited to data from doses up to and including 10 mg, the highest dose recommended for use.

The following table was derived from results of three placebo-controlled long-term efficacy trials involving zolpidem tartrate tablets. These trials involved patients with chronic insomnia who were treated for 28 to 35 nights with zolpidem at doses of 5, 10, or 15 mg. The table is limited to data from doses up to and including 10 mg, the highest dose recommended for use. The table includes only adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 1% for zolpidem patients.

Dose Relationship for Adverse Reactions

There is evidence from dose comparison trials suggesting a dose relationship for many of the adverse reactions associated with zolpidem use, particularly for certain CNS and gastrointestinal adverse events.

Adverse Event Incidence Across the Entire Preapproval Database

Zolpidem tartrate tablets were administered to 3,660 subjects in clinical trials throughout the U.S. Canada, and Europe. Treatment-emergent adverse events associated with clinical trial participation were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events, similar types of untoward events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized event categories and classified utilizing a modified World Health Organization (WHO) dictionary of preferred terms.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness threshold for U.S. clinical guidelines — the writing committee "recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines", with the threshold to be "periodically reexamined", "not be adjusted annually for inflation", and "revised every 10 years (or sooner…)". Supporting estimates include a 2024 Personal Consumption Expenditure update that "suggests a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY", a welfare economics approach indicating willingness to pay tied to income ("per capita disposable income of $60 300… approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY"), and a population-level framework using World Bank data estimating "$95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY", translating to "$112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY" after GDP growth; while "no single method… can be considered the 'gold standard'", these three approaches "produced similar results".
