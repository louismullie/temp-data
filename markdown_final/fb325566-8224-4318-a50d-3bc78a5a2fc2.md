## Question

Patient comes in with joint pain and difficulty walking

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing a patient who presents with joint pain and difficulty walking. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage for red flags and whether the patient can bear weight. Then, I should localize the pain generator by joint and pattern. Next, I will classify the pain as inflammatory versus noninflammatory and consider systemic features. After that, I will outline the focused history, physical examination, and targeted imaging strategy. Finally, I will prioritize the differential diagnosis, initiate evidence-based management, and set reassessment checkpoints with escalation criteria, ensuring I verify each step against guidelines and high-quality evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the need for urgent triage: inability to bear weight, acute trauma, fever, or systemic illness mandate expedited evaluation for fracture, infection, or other emergencies, so I should not delay those workups while I sort through chronic differentials [^28f1e13c] [^54b3c001].

> Wait, let me verify the weight-bearing status because it changes the imaging pathway. In acute knee trauma, the ACR recommends radiography when patients cannot walk, whereas in chronic hip pain, plain radiographs are generally first-line after clinical assessment, so I need to align imaging with acuity and suspected joint involved [^f3c9c7c7] [^51b82cac].

> Next, I should localize the pain generator by joint and pattern. Hip pain often localizes to the groin or anterior thigh and can refer to the knee, whereas knee pain is typically anterior or peri-patellar and activity-related, and foot or ankle pain may present as metatarsalgia or hindfoot pain that worsens with weight-bearing, so I need to map the pain distribution carefully before jumping ahead [^4c7a08b7] [^6b062f25] [^0affa0a9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology until I classify the pain phenotype. Inflammatory pain tends to be morning-predominant, symmetric, and associated with stiffness, warmth, or swelling, whereas noninflammatory pain is activity-related, brief morning stiffness, and often mechanical. I should also screen for systemic features such as fever, weight loss, rash, or ocular symptoms that would pivot me toward rheumatologic or infectious causes [^29c176ff] [^23d0b37a].

> I will now examine the focused history elements I must capture: onset and tempo, trauma, exact pain location and radiation, aggravating and relieving factors, morning stiffness duration, swelling or warmth, systemic symptoms, comorbidities, medications, and functional impact including gait, stairs, and assistive devices. I should double-check that I ask about referred pain patterns, because groin pain suggests hip pathology and anterior knee pain with squats suggests patellofemoral pain, which will refine pretest probabilities [^4c7a08b7] [^6b062f25].

> Let me think about the physical examination sequence. I should inspect gait for antalgic, waddling, or abductor-deficient patterns, assess posture and alignment, palpate the symptomatic joint and adjacent structures, and measure active and passive range of motion, paying special attention to hip internal rotation and flexion for OA, and perform targeted special tests such as FADIR and FABER for hip pathology, McMurray and joint line tenderness for meniscal disease, and patellofemoral tests when indicated. I need to ensure I also screen the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints when the clinical picture suggests a spinal pain generator [^1d3e689e] [^6b062f25] [^64ae64a1].

> But wait, what if the gait looks incongruent or variable over time? I should consider functional gait disorders and look for inconsistency and incongruity on repeated observation, because recognizing positive signs of functional gait can prevent unnecessary invasive workups while still excluding organic disease when appropriate [^79fd2898] [^5434be41].

> Next, I should review the imaging strategy and confirm it matches the clinical question. For chronic hip pain, weight-bearing AP pelvis and lateral radiographs are first-line to confirm OA or identify alternative pathology. For chronic knee pain, radiographs are not routinely indicated unless atypical features or surgical planning are in play. For acute knee trauma, obtain radiographs if the patient cannot bear weight or has focal tenderness or effusion. For suspected sacroiliac pain, image-guided diagnostic blocks are the reference standard when provocative maneuvers are inconclusive. And for suspected foot or ankle OA, start with radiographs and escalate to MRI or CT if surgery is contemplated or the diagnosis remains uncertain [^51b82cac] [^6b062f25] [^f3c9c7c7] [^4e09f295] [^a94f593f] [^abb208b4].

> I should double-check the differential diagnosis and prioritize it by prevalence and severity. In adults over 45, osteoarthritis is the most common cause of activity-related joint pain with brief morning stiffness, whereas in younger or highly active patients, patellofemoral pain and meniscal pathology are more frequent. Inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis should be considered with polyarticular, symmetric, or dactylitic presentations. Less common but critical mimics include avascular necrosis, septic arthritis, malignancy, and metabolic bone disease, so I need to keep a low threshold for red flags and atypical features [^6b062f25] [^29c176ff] [^23d0b37a].

> Let me verify the management framework for osteoarthritis, since it is the leading cause of joint pain and walking difficulty. Core nonpharmacologic therapy includes education, weight loss if overweight, and exercise, with tai chi and structured programs showing durable benefits. Walking aids such as canes should be prescribed and trained by physical therapy when hip OA impairs ambulation. Pharmacologic options include NSAIDs and short-course intra-articular corticosteroids for flares, while avoiding ineffective or harmful modalities. If symptoms persist after a structured conservative program, obtain weight-bearing radiographs and refer for surgical evaluation, ideally using shared decision-making to align treatment with patient goals [^4a75207e] [^6a2e5e41] [^99d447cc] [^54ffe1d8] [^d90e78a6].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of exercise intensity and expectations. Programs like GLA:D demonstrate that more than half of patients with baseline moderate to severe walking difficulty improve to no or slight difficulty at 12 months, with better outcomes in those with higher self-efficacy, lower BMI, and less severe baseline pain, which supports prescribing structured, supervised exercise and setting realistic timelines for improvement [^8cc474a1].

> For patellofemoral pain, I need to ensure I emphasize hip and quadriceps strengthening, movement retraining, and foot orthoses or taping rather than surgery, and I should screen for serious knee pathology at baseline and throughout care to avoid missing meniscal tears or inflammatory disease that would change management [^6b062f25] [^3dac00a7].

> For suspected inflammatory arthritis, I should confirm the diagnosis with appropriate serologies and, when indicated, synovial fluid analysis, and initiate guideline-directed disease-modifying therapy while coordinating rheumatology follow-up, because early control of inflammation improves function and may reverse walking disability when tenosynovitis is present [^29c176ff] [^23d0b37a] [^fe595d8b].

> I need to ensure I set reassessment checkpoints and escalation criteria. A reasonable approach is to reassess at 6 to 12 weeks after initiating conservative therapy, escalate to formal physical therapy or combination pharmacotherapy if there is minimal improvement, and consider imaging and surgical referral after about 3 months of optimized nonoperative care if pain and function remain unacceptable, adjusting the timeline to severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^54ffe1d8] [^0a8c8483].

> Let me reconsider any gaps in my plan. I initially thought to obtain routine radiographs for all chronic joint pain, but wait, I should correct that and avoid unnecessary imaging in straightforward OA presentations, reserving radiographs for atypical features, refractory symptoms, or pre-surgical planning, which aligns with contemporary primary care and rheumatology guidance [^6b062f25] [^51b82cac].

> Finally, I should confirm that my documentation captures pain location, functional limitations, gait analysis, examination findings, shared decision-making discussions, and the rationale for imaging or referral, because clear documentation supports continuity of care, quality metrics, and appropriate resource utilization across the continuum of care [^notfound].

Joint pain with difficulty walking most often reflects **hip or knee osteoarthritis** [^b2bede2e] [^6b062f25], but the differential is broad and includes inflammatory arthritis, meniscal or ligament injury, bursitis, and systemic or neurologic causes [^29c176ff] [^6b062f25]. A **focused history and exam** — pain location, morning stiffness, trauma, systemic features, gait, and joint-specific tests — narrows the diagnosis [^77d2b510] [^6b062f25]. Initial imaging is typically **plain radiography** for suspected OA or fracture; MRI is reserved for refractory or unclear cases [^51b82cac] [^6b062f25]. Management is **stepwise**: core nonpharmacologic care (education, weight loss, exercise) [^6a2e5e41], then NSAIDs or acetaminophen, and intra-articular corticosteroids if needed [^6a2e5e41]; refer to orthopedics or rheumatology for refractory symptoms, red flags, or surgical candidacy [^54ffe1d8] [^29c176ff].

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Characterize pain by location, onset, duration, and quality; assess morning stiffness (> 30 minutes suggests inflammatory arthritis) [^29c176ff]; identify aggravating factors (weight-bearing, stairs, squatting) and relieving factors (rest, NSAIDs) [^358e69cd]; screen for trauma or repetitive use; review systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, fatigue, skin changes) [^29c176ff]; and document functional impact, including gait disturbance, assistive device use, and activity limitation [^4c7a08b7].

---

### Physical examination

- **Gait analysis**: Antalgic, waddling, or Trendelenburg patterns suggest hip pathology [^1d3e689e].
- **Joint inspection**: Swelling, erythema, deformity, crepitus [^23d0b37a].
- **Range of motion**: Reduced ROM, pain with movement [^1d3e689e].
- **Palpation**: Tenderness, warmth, effusion [^23d0b37a].
- **Special tests**: McMurray (meniscus), Lachman (ACL), FABER/FADIR (hip) [^6b062f25] [^64ae64a1].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

- **Plain radiography**: First-line for suspected OA, fracture, or deformity [^51b82cac] [^6b062f25].
- **MRI**: For soft tissue injury, refractory symptoms, or when radiographs are inconclusive [^51b82cac] [^6b062f25].
- **CT**: Complex fractures or bony detail [^notfound].
- **Ultrasound**: Guided injections or soft tissue assessment [^6a2e5e41].

---

## Management strategies

### Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic care is **first-line** and includes patient education, weight loss, and exercise (aerobic, resistance, flexibility) [^6a2e5e41] [^4a75207e]. Physical therapy provides gait training, balance, and strength programs [^4abe9a96] [^5f69666f]. Assistive devices such as canes, crutches, or walkers improve mobility and reduce pain [^4a75207e] [^99d447cc].

---

### Pharmacologic interventions

- **NSAIDs**: First-line for pain and inflammation [^notfound].
- **Acetaminophen**: Alternative for mild pain or NSAID intolerance [^notfound].
- **Topical NSAIDs**: For localized knee or hand OA [^notfound].
- **Intra-articular corticosteroids**: Short-term relief for persistent symptoms [^6a2e5e41].

---

### Surgical interventions

Consider **joint replacement** for end-stage OA with refractory pain and functional limitation [^6b062f25] [^d90e78a6]. Arthroscopy is reserved for specific intra-articular pathology, and debridement or repair may be indicated for meniscal or ligamentous injury [^6b062f25].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

- **Persistent symptoms**: Despite conservative care [^54ffe1d8].
- **Red flags**: Rapid progression, systemic symptoms, neurologic deficits [^notfound].
- **Surgical candidacy**: End-stage OA or complex cases [^6b062f25].

---

## Prognosis and functional outcomes

OA is a **chronic, progressive** condition with fluctuating symptoms [^0eeb508b]; early diagnosis and management improve outcomes [^49463101]. Exercise and weight loss improve pain, function, and quality of life [^6a2e5e41] [^8cc474a1]. Severe cases may require surgery, with generally favorable outcomes [^6b062f25].

---

Joint pain with difficulty walking spans degenerative, inflammatory, traumatic, and systemic causes; a **structured evaluation** and stepwise management — nonpharmacologic care first, then medications, and surgery when indicated — yields the best outcomes, with referral for refractory or atypical cases [^6b062f25] [^54ffe1d8].

### Impact of osteoarthritis on difficulty walking: a population-based study [^b2bede2e]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the relationship of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) to walking difficulty.

Methods

A population cohort ages ≤ 55 years recruited from 1996 to 1998 (n = 28,451) completed a standardized questionnaire assessing demographics, health conditions, joint symptoms, and functional limitations, including difficulty walking in the past 3 months. Survey data were linked to health administrative databases; self-report and administrative data were used to identify health conditions. Hip/knee OA was defined as self-reported swelling, pain, or stiffness in a hip or knee lasting ≥ 6 weeks in the past 3 months without an inflammatory arthritis diagnosis. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined the determinants of walking difficulty and constructed a clinical nomogram.

Results

A total of 18,490 cohort participants were eligible (mean age 68 years, 60% women), and 25% reported difficulty walking. Difficulty walking was significantly and independently associated with older age, female sex, body mass index, and several health conditions. Of the conditions examined, the likelihood of walking difficulty was greatest with hip and knee OA and increased with the number of hip/knee joints affected. The predicted probability of difficulty walking for a 60-year-old middle-income, normal-weight woman was 5–10% with no health conditions, 10–20% with diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular (CV) disease, 40% with OA in 2 hips/knees, 60–70% with diabetes mellitus, CV disease, and OA in 2 hips/knees, and 80% with diabetes mellitus, CV disease, and OA in all hips/knees.

Conclusion

In a population cohort, symptomatic hip/knee OA was the strongest contributor to walking difficulty. Given the importance of walking to engagement in physical activity for chronic disease management, greater attention to OA is warranted.

### Does this patient have hip osteoarthritis? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^77d2b510]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hip osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of pain and disability.

Objective

To identify the clinical findings that are most strongly associated with hip OA.

Data Sources

Systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception until November 2019.

Study Selection

Included studies (1) quantified the accuracy of clinical findings (history, physical examination, or simple tests) and (2) used plain radiographs as the reference standard for diagnosing hip OA.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Studies were assigned levels of evidence using the Rational Clinical Examination scale and assessed for risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Data were extracted using individual hips as the unit of analysis and only pooled when findings were reported in 3 or more studies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs).

Results

Six studies were included, with data from 1110 patients and 1324 hips, of which 509 (38%) showed radiographic evidence of OA. Among patients presenting to primary care physicians with hip or groin pain, the affected hip showed radiographic evidence of OA in 34% of cases. A family history of OA, personal history of knee OA, or pain on climbing stairs or walking up slopes all had LRs of 2.1 (sensitivity range, 33%-68%; specificity range, 68%-84%; broadest LR range: 95% CI, 1.1–3.8). To identify patients most likely to have OA, the most useful findings were squat causing posterior pain (sensitivity, 24%; specificity, 96%; LR, 6.1 [95% CI, 1.3–29]), groin pain on passive abduction or adduction (sensitivity, 33%; specificity, 94%; LR, 5.7 [95% CI, 1.6–20]), abductor weakness (sensitivity, 44%; specificity, 90%; LR, 4.5 [95% CI, 2.4–8.4]), and decreased passive hip adduction (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 81%; LR, 4.2 [95% CI, 3.0–6.0]) or internal rotation (sensitivity, 66%; specificity, 79%; LR, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.7–6.0]) as measured by a goniometer or compared with the contralateral leg. The presence of normal passive hip adduction was most useful for suggesting the absence of OA (negative LR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.11–0.54]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Simple tests of hip motion and observing for pain during that motion were helpful in distinguishing patients most likely to have OA on plain radiography from those who will not. A combination of findings efficiently detects those most likely to have severe hip OA.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^358e69cd]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Knee osteoarthritis patient history — patients typically present with activity-related knee pain often relieved by rest and joint stiffness of limited duration notably after inactivity. Pain is often described as a deep, aching pain that can be localized or diffuse. Additional complaints may include crepitus, bony tenderness, reduced range of motion, swelling, and/or joint instability, buckling, or giving way, with exacerbation or difficulty during activities that stress the joint such as standing, squatting, kneeling, walking, and stair climbing.

### A case report of infectious sacroiliitis in an adult presenting to the emergency department with inability to walk [^f39faa98]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Infectious sacroiliitis (ISI) is an uncommon cause of back and hip pain in which the sacroiliac joint, either unilateral or bilateral, is inflamed from an infectious source. Historically, this has been an easily missed diagnosis due to nonspecific presenting symptoms along with subtle nondistinguishable laboratory abnormalities.

Case Report

We describe an injection drug user presenting with right-sided ISI who presented with hip and back pain and inability to walk. The patient had tenderness over his right sacroiliac joint, and despite negative plain radiographs, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was obtained from the Emergency Department (ED) given the patient's risk factors for infection. Concerning findings of ISI on this MRI led to a computed tomography-guided biopsy during the patient's hospital admission, which revealed alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus as the responsible pathogen. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Infectious sacroiliitis is a rare condition that is difficult to diagnose, and carries increasing morbidity when diagnosis is delayed. We aim to increase awareness through a case report of a patient encountered in the ED.

### Hip fractures in adults [^28f1e13c]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with hip fracture typically present to the emergency department or their physician's office after a fall. They are often unable to walk, and they may exhibit shortening and external rotation of the affected limb. Frequently, they have hip pain. In some instances, however, patients with hip fracture may complain only of vague pain in their buttocks, knees, thighs, groin, or back. Their ability to walk may be unaffected, and initial radiographic findings may be indeterminate. In these patients, additional studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging or bone scanning, may be necessary to confirm the presence of hip fracture. A high index of suspicion often is required for prompt diagnosis and treatment of an occult hip fracture. Even when a patient is able to walk and has no documented trauma, localized hip pain, or typical shortening and malrotation deformity, the family physician should be alert to the possibility of hip fracture, particularly in a patient who is older than 65 years, presents with nonspecific leg discomfort, and complains of difficulty bearing weight on the affected limb. A heightened suspicion for hip fracture should lead to further diagnostic evaluation, especially if the patient has additional risk factors, such as use of a complicated drug regimen, impaired vision, physical or neurologic impairment, or comorbid condition (e.g., osteoporosis, malignancy). When hip fracture is detected early, appropriate treatment can minimize morbidity and mortality and prevent the rapid decline in quality of life that often is associated with this injury.

### Osteoarthritis management: updated guidelines from the American… [^6a2e5e41]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Weight loss, exercise, tai chi, and patient-directed activity programs can improve pain and function in knee and hip OA.
- In knee and hip OA, intra-articular corticosteroid injections and oral and topical NSAIDs improve pain and function only over the short term.
- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, immunomodulators, glucosamine, and biologic injection therapies should be avoided in OA.
- Cognitive behavior therapy and balance training appear to improve pain in OA; acupuncture and thermal interventions slightly improve pain and function. From the AFP Editors Affecting more than 300 million people worldwide, osteoarthritis is common and difficult to manage. Although OA can involve any joint, the knee, hip, and hand are most commonly affected. The 2019 American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation guidelines reviewed the effectiveness of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for OA in the knee, hip, and hand.

Recommended Treatments NONPHARMACOLOGIC The guideline recommends exercise, tai chi, and self-efficacy or self-management programs as first-line treatments. Exercise and tai chi slightly improve pain and function in knee and hip OA. No particular exercise is superior, although most studies used aerobic exercise. The benefit from tai chi lasts for at least 24 weeks, whereas exercise is beneficial for up to one year. Pain in OA is related to weight, and even a 5% weight loss provides notable improvement in knee and hip pain. Patient-directed activities, such as using activity trackers, online modules, cognitive behavior therapy, and goal setting consistently demonstrate small improvements in function and pain. A few treatments are effective for OA in specific joints. For knee OA, tibiofemoral knee braces reduce pain and improve walking speed. Hand orthoses appear to improve pain and function for OA in the first carpometacarpal joint.

Short-term improvement in pain and function for knee and hip OA is expected with the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections. Ultrasound guidance during knee and hip injections has been shown to improve patient pain scores during the procedure and in the weeks following the injection. Treatments Recommended Against NONPHARMACOLOGIC Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation should not be recommended because it does not improve pain or function in knee OA. The guideline recommends against several biologic injection therapies that have safety concerns and have failed to demonstrate clinical benefit, including platelet-rich plasma, stem cells, and hyaluronic acid.

### ANCA associated vasculitis [^a08f5a41]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

What symptoms do patients develop?

AAV may present with constitutional symptoms suggestive of chronic inflammatory disease (fatigue, weight loss, fever, night sweats, myalgia, or polyarthralgia) or with specific features of end-organ involvement. Almost any part of the body can be affected, but the most commonly affected systems are the upper airways, lungs, kidneys, eyes, and peripheral nerves. Therefore, presenting symptoms include sinus pain, nasal discharge, or crusting, ear pain, or deafness (from upper airways involvement), cough, shortness of breath, wheeze or haemoptysis (from lung involvement), and painful, red eyes (from scleritis). Some patients may have weakness, numbness, or difficulty walking, but many patients do not mention these symptoms, and signs of peripheral neuropathy — such as foot drop or wrist drop — should be specifically sought on examination. A classic "vasculitic" purpuric skin rash is present in a minority of patients. Common presenting symptoms are listed in box 1.

Box 1
When to consider ANCA associated vasculitis

Consider a diagnosis of AAV in the following clinical circumstances. Any of these features should prompt consideration of AAV; multiple features are strongly suggestive of AAV. Figures in parentheses are the approximate proportion of incident cases exhibiting each feature.

### EULAR recommendations for the health professional's approach to pain management in inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis [^4c9abaf3]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ankle osteoarthritis, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, EULAR 2018 guidelines recommend to assess for the following as part of the initial evaluation of patients with OA:

- patient's needs, preferences, and priorities regarding pain management and important activities, values, and goals in daily life

- patient's pain characteristics, including severity, type, spread, and quality

- previous and ongoing pain treatments and the perceived efficacy

- current inflammation and joint damage as sources of pain, and whether these are adequately treated

- pain-related factors that might need attention, including the nature and extent of pain-related disability, beliefs and emotions about pain and pain-related disability, social influences related to pain and its consequences, sleep problems, and obesity.

### Interventions for idiopathic toe walking [^e05dee9c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic toe walking (ITW) is an exclusionary diagnosis given to healthy children who persist in walking on their toes after they should typically have achieved a heel-toe gait. The literature discusses conservative and surgical interventions using a variety of treatment modalities. Young children and children without a limitation in ankle dorsiflexion (the upwards movement of the foot towards the shin of the leg) are commonly treated with conservative interventions. Older children who continue toe walking and present with limitations in ankle dorsiflexion are sometimes treated with surgical procedures. This systematic review is needed to evaluate the evidence for any intervention for the treatment of ITW. The conclusions of this review may support decision making by clinicians caring for children with ITW. It may also assist families when deciding on treatment options for their children with ITW. Many of the treatments employed have financial implications for parents or healthcare services. This review also aims to highlight any deficits in the current research base.

Objectives

To assess the effects of conservative and surgical interventions in children with ITW, specifically effects on gait normalisation, ankle range of motion, pain, frequency of recurrence, and any adverse effects.

Search Methods

On 29 April 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and PEDro. We searched the following registers of clinical trials for ongoing and recently completed trials: the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, apps.who.int/trialsearch), and ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov). We searched conference proceedings and other grey literature in the BIOSIS databases and System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenGrey, opengrey.eu). We searched guidelines via the Turning Research Into Practice database (TRIP, tripdatabase.com) and National Guideline Clearinghouse (guideline.gov). We did not apply language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised or quasi-randomised trials for inclusion in the review if they involved participants diagnosed with ITW gait in the absence of a medical condition known to cause toe walking, or associated with toe walking. As there is no universally accepted age group for ITW, this review includes ITW at any age, who have been toe walking for more than six months, who can or cannot walk with a heel-toe gait, and who may or may not have limited dorsiflexion of the ankle joint.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcome was improvement in toe walking (defined as greater than 50% of time spent heel-toe walking). Secondary outcomes were active and passive range of motion of the ankle joint, pain, recurrence of ITW after treatment, and adverse events. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE framework.

Main Results

Four studies, comprising 104 participants, met the inclusion criteria. One study did not report data within the appropriate follow-up timeframe and data from two studies were insufficient for analysis. The single study from which we extracted data had 47 participants and was a randomised, controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in Sweden. It tested the hypothesis that combined treatment with serial casting and botulinum toxin type A (BTX) was more effective than serial casting alone in reducing ITW gait. This study found that more participants treated with BTX improved (defined as toe walking less than 50% of the time, as reported by parents) (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 2.55; 1 trial, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, there was little or no difference between groups in passive ankle joint dorsiflexion range of movement on the right with the knee extended (mean difference (MD) -1.48º, 95% CI -4.13 to 1.16; 1 trial, 47 participants), on the right with the knee flexed (MD -0.04º, 95% CI -1.80 to 1.73; 1 trial, 46 participants), on the left with the knee flexed (MD 1.07, 95% CI -1.22 to 3.37), or on the left with the knee extended (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.91 to 1.91). Nor was there a clear difference between the groups in recurrence of toe-walking gait (assessed via severity of toe walking (graded 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe)) on gait analysis, analysed as continuous data: MD 0.34 points, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.78; 46 participants). In principle, MDs greater than zero (i.e.) positive values) would favour BTX and casting and negative values would favour casting alone. We have not reported effects as better or worse because all results were from evidence of very low certainty. We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of study limitations (outcome assessment was not blinded) and imprecision. Outcomes of pain and active range of motion were not reported in the included study. In terms of adverse events, calf pain was reported twice in the casting-only group and three times in the BTX group. There were three minor skin problems in each group and one reported case of pain directly after BTX injection. The report did not state if calf pain and skin irritation were from the same or different participants. The study authors reported that adverse events did not alter treatment adherence.

Authors' Conclusions

The certainty of evidence from one study, which compared serial casting with serial casting with BTX for ITW in children, was too low for conclusions to be drawn. A further three studies reported outcomes relating to BTX, footwear, exercises, and different types of orthoses as interventions, however the outcome data were too limited to assess their effects.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary management of osteoarthritis of the hip [^d90e78a6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

Hip OA treatment benefits, harms, and decision-making — patients with OA of the hip present with increased pain, decreased mobility, decreased function, and decreased quality of life. The aim of treatment of OA of the hip is to reduce pain, improve function, and secondarily improve quality of life. All treatments are associated with risks for adverse outcomes, especially operative intervention, and must be considered for each patient; contraindications and risks vary widely by treatment. When possible, modifiable risk factors should be addressed as reducing risks improve treatment efficacy, and treatment decisions for OA of the hip should be made through a shared decision-making process with the physician and patient.

### Joint hypermobility syndrome in childhood. A not so benign multisystem disorder? [^84924588]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Joint hypermobility (JH) or "ligamentous laxity" is felt to be an underlying risk factor for many types of musculoskeletal presentation in paediatrics, and joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) describes such disorders where symptoms become chronic, often more generalized and associated with functional impairment. Clinical features are felt to have much in common with more severe disorders, including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), osteogenesis imperfecta and Marfan syndrome, although this has not been formally studied in children. We defined the clinical characteristics of all patients with joint hypermobility-related presentations seen from 1999 to 2002 in a tertiary referral paediatric rheumatology unit.

Methods

Patients were identified and recruited from paediatric rheumatology clinic and ward, and a dedicated paediatric rheumatology hypermobility clinic at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Data were collected retrospectively on the patients from the paediatric rheumatology clinics (1999–2002) and prospectively on patients seen in the hypermobility clinic (2000–2002). Specifically, historical details of developmental milestones, musculoskeletal or soft tissue diagnoses and symptoms, and significant past medical history were recorded. Examination features sought included measurements of joint and soft tissue laxity, and associated conditions such as scoliosis, dysmorphic features, cardiac murmurs and eye problems.

Results

One hundred and twenty-five children (64 females) were included on whom sufficient clinical data could be identified and who had clinical problems ascribed to JH present for longer than 3 months. Sixty-four were from the paediatric rheumatology clinic and 61 from the hypermobility clinic. No differences were found in any of the measures between the two populations and results are presented in a combined fashion. Three-quarters of referrals came from paediatricians and general practitioners but in only 10% was hypermobility recognized as a possible cause of joint complaint. The average age at onset of symptoms was 6.2 yr and age at diagnosis 9.0 yr, indicating a 2- to 3-yr delay in diagnosis. The major presenting complaint was arthralgia in 74%, abnormal gait in 10%, apparent joint deformity in 10% and back pain in 6%. Mean age at first walking was 15.0 months; 48% were considered "clumsy" and 36% as having poor coordination in early childhood. Twelve per cent had "clicky" hips at birth and 4% actual congenital dislocatable hip. Urinary tract infections were present in 13 and 6% of the female and male cases, respectively. Thirteen and 14%, respectively, had speech and learning difficulties diagnosed. A history of recurrent joint sprains was seen in 20% and actual subluxation/dislocation of joints in 10%. Forty per cent had experienced problems with handwriting tasks, 48% had major limitations of school-based physical education activities, 67% other physical activities and 41% had missed significant periods of schooling because of symptoms. Forty-three per cent described a history of easy bruising. Examination revealed that 94% scored ≥ 4/9 on the Beighton scale for generalized hypermobility, with knees (92%), elbows (87%), wrists (82%), hand metacarpophalangeal joints (79%), and ankles (75%) being most frequently involved.

Conclusions

JHS is poorly recognized in children with a long delay in the time to diagnosis. Although there is a referral bias towards joint symptoms, a surprisingly large proportion is associated with significant neuromuscular and motor development problems. Our patients with JHS also show many overlap features with genetic disorders such as EDS and Marfan syndrome. The delay in diagnosis results in poor control of pain and disruption of normal home life, schooling and physical activities. Knowledge of the diagnosis and simple interventions are likely to be highly effective in reducing the morbidity and cost to the health and social services.

### Pathogenesis and management of pain in osteoarthritis [^3daaf747]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

The term osteoarthritis describes a common, age-related, heterogeneous group of disorders characterised pathologically by focal areas of loss of articular cartilage in synovial joints, associated with varying degrees of osteophyte formation, subchondral bone change, and synovitis. Joint damage is caused by a mixture of systemic factors that predispose to the disease, and local mechanical factors that dictate its distribution and severity. Various genetic abnormalities have been described, but most sporadic osteoarthritis probably depends on minor contributions from several genetic loci. Osteoarthritic joint damage may be associated with clinical problems, but the severity of joint disease is only weakly related to that of the clinical problem. For this reason the associations and pathogenesis of pain are in as much need of investigation as joint damage. Subchondral bone and synovium may be responsible for nociceptive stimuli, and peripheral neuronal sensitisation is an important feature, and can result in normal activities (such as walking) causing pain. Central pain sensitisation can also occur, and psychosocial factors are important determinants of pain severity. We present a stepwise approach to the management of osteoarthritis.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^c948eb65]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Arthritides in heel pain (Pathway 4) — systemic causes and adjunct testing may be relevant: Most cases of heel pain encountered in clinical practice are likely to have a biomechanical etiology and respond to recommended therapy, but the clinician should consider that various systemic arthritides are also capable of presentation as heel pain, including the seronegative arthritides, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's disease, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and gout. Patients with arthritides and heel pain may have other joint symptoms and should be questioned regarding concomitant arthralgias, and careful radiographic evaluation and laboratory testing may assist in determining the correct diagnosis and proper treatment for these unresponsive patients. Occasionally, scintigraphy may be useful in the diagnosis process because a pattern of joint involvement will be evidenced; radiographs of the heel may show erosions or proliferative changes specific to one of these diseases, and rheumatologic consultation may be useful in determining the diagnosis and treatment.

### Defining an international standard set of outcome measures for patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis: consensus of the international consortium for health outcomes measurement hip and knee osteoarthritis working group [^894ac48f]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Total expenditures on health care as a percentage of the gross domestic product continue to rise worldwide 1. Yet the World Health Organization estimates that 20–40% of health care costs are unnecessary 2. Uncertainty about health outcomes combined with increasing costs has driven interest in value‐based health care (i.e. the idea of competition on value rather than volume in health care), where value is defined as the ratio between patient outcomes and the costs necessary to achieve those outcomes. By focusing on the measurement and reporting of outcomes that matter to patients over the full cycle of care, value‐based health care empowers patients to make informed choices about their care and enables providers to improve outcomes, increase efficiency, streamline care processes, and decrease the costly and inefficient fragmentation of care delivery 3. Currently, a major challenge in measuring value in health care is the lack of universal metrics for defining value. Therefore, in an effort to facilitate the transition to value‐based health care, the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) convenes international working groups to develop standardized and concise outcome measure sets for specific medical conditions, with a focus on the outcomes that matter most to patients.

Box 1
Significance & Innovations

Hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) are among the leading causes of global disability, with an aging and increasingly obese population worldwide likely to increase its prevalence 4. The total annual cost of OA per patient has been estimated to be as much as $5,700 in the US 5. Pain and impaired joint function are the main limiting symptoms affecting patients with OA, which typically develops over the course of many years, with varying symptom intensity over time 6. The modern management of symptomatic hip or knee OA involves holistic assessment and selection of therapies from a wide range of options, ranging from lifestyle interventions and education to oral medication and joint replacement surgery 7. All patients should be offered basic treatment options such as lifestyle interventions and education 8. Many patients will require options such as physiotherapy, walking aids, oral medication, or intraarticular injections. If nonsurgical treatment alternatives are insufficient to control symptoms, a smaller group of patients may be candidates for joint replacement or other surgical interventions.

### GLA: D to be walking better: change in self-reported difficulty walking after exercise therapy and education in persons with knee osteoarthritis [^8cc474a1]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Difficulty walking is a primary reason that individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) seek care. We examined the change in self-reported difficulty walking after participating in the Good Life With Osteoarthritis in Denmark (GLA:D) 8-week education and exercise program and assessed patient factors associated with improvement in difficulty walking.

Methods

This was a registry-based cohort study of individuals in Denmark with knee OA who enrolled in GLA:D. Assessments were administered at baseline, program completion (~3 months), and 12 months. Our prespecified primary outcome was change in self-reported difficulty walking assessed using the EuroQol 5-dimension 5-level walking item. Exposures included sociodemographic factors, measures of OA illness severity, comorbidities, and psychological factors. In those with baseline moderate/severe difficulty walking, using multivariable regression analysis, we assessed the relationship between exposures of interest and improvement to no/slight difficulty walking.

Results

We included 5262 participants. Of 2178 (41.4%) individuals with baseline moderate/severe difficulty walking, 51.4% and 58.3% reported no/slight difficulty walking at 3 and 12 months, respectively. Greater self-efficacy, younger age, female sex, lower BMI, less intense knee pain, and better function at baseline were associated with greater likelihood of improvement in difficulty walking, whereas severe difficulty walking at baseline and back pain intensity were associated with decreased likelihood of improvement.

Conclusion

More than half of those with baseline difficulty walking experienced substantial improvement after completing GLA:D and this improvement was maintained at 12 months. Several patient factors were associated with the outcome, suggesting that some individuals may require additional support and extended treatment.

### A young skier with leg pain [^a9db1206]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ) dislocation is a rare injury that can disrupt the proximal tibia-fibula joint. The abnormalities in knee x-ray imaging can be subtle and difficult to detect, requiring careful assessment. This rare cause of lateral knee pain requires a high level of suspicion for diagnosis. Treatment is closed reduction; unstable PTFJ dislocations often require surgical intervention.

Case Report

A 17-year-old young man presented to the emergency department (ED) with right lateral knee pain and difficulty walking after colliding with another skier 2 days prior. The examination showed right lateral ecchymosis and tenderness over the lateral proximal fibula. He remained neurovascularly intact with a full passive and active range of motion. X-ray studies were obtained. The patient was referred by his outpatient orthopedic surgeon after the initial knee x-ray study was concerning for PTFJ dislocation and unsuccessful reduction. In the ED, the patient underwent moderate sedation and successful orthopedic-guided reduction via medial force on the lateral fibular head, while hyper-flexing the knee and holding the foot dorsiflexed and everted. Post-reduction radiographs showed improved proximal tibiofibular alignment without fracture. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? PTFJ dislocation is a rare injury that can be missed easily and requires a high level of suspicion when presented with an acute traumatic knee pain. Closed reduction of PTFJ dislocation can be achieved in the ED and early identification can prevent long-term sequelae.

Conclusion

We have described a sign-based approach to better diagnose functional gait disorders. In this sign-based approach, presenting gait signs are taken as the starting point for a tailored search into the origin of the gait disorder. After identification of the presenting gait signs, clinical tests can subsequently bring out inconsistencies and incongruencies that may point out to a functional gait disorder. We hope that this will help clinicians during the diagnostic process in their daily clinical practice.

### Difficult to think about but easy to treat: scurvy [^7085ddba]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Severe vitamin C deficiency, or scurvy, presents as a syndrome of multisystem abnormalities associated with defective collagen synthesis and antioxidative functions. The many clinical features of scurvy lead to frequent misdiagnoses, as they can often point to other diseases, such as vasculitis, venous thrombosis and musculoskeletal disorders. As such, an extensive workup is recommended in cases in which scurvy is suspected.

Case Presentation

A 21-month-old male patient and a 36-month-old female patient presented with difficulty in walking, painful joint movements, irritability, gingival hypertrophy and bleeding. After exhaustive investigations and risky invasive procedures, vitamin C deficiency was diagnosed in both cases, and the symptoms improved dramatically with vitamin C treatment.

Conclusions

The importance of taking a dietary history in pediatric patients is highly recommended. In cases where scurvy is considered, serum ascorbic acid levels should be checked to confirm the diagnosis prior to conducting invasive tests.

### Strategies to improve equitable access to early osteoarthritis diagnosis and management: an updated review [^49463101]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) affects more than 300 million people worldwide, causing chronic joint pain and stiffness in areas such as the hands, lower back, neck, knees, hips, and feet, often impeding activities of daily living. OA is a debilitating disease that can lead to depression, diabetes, heart disease, and poor quality of life. Early diagnosis and management are key to preventing decline and optimizing patient health and quality of life. Though OA guidelines differ in treatment recommendations and what is considered early versus later intervention, first‐line therapy for OA may include education, self‐management (eg, physical activity and weight loss), pain management, and physiotherapy, and after trial of first‐line therapies, second‐line therapy may include injections and joint replacement.

Intersectional factors, including social determinants, are associated with having chronic diseases and receiving recommended management. This is also true of OA. In a systematic review, fewer than half of 16,103 patients with OA received early diagnosis or management. Another review found that, of patients undergoing joint replacement, only 36% had been prescribed or advised of first‐line therapy. Considerable accumulated research shows that age, race, gender, and rurality contribute to inequitable OA care. Women are far more likely than men to develop hand, knee, and hip OA; experience greater OA severity, pain, and disability; and suffer from a greater number and prevalence of OA‐related comorbidities such as depression or hypertension. Furthermore, women are less likely to receive guideline‐concordant OA care. Reviews of published research and analysis of population‐based data in Canada and the United States found that women, particularly women who are racialized with less education or income (henceforth, diverse women), were less likely than men to undergo physical therapy, be on a wait list for joint replacement, or undergo joint replacement. Hence, insight is needed on how to support equitable early diagnosis and management of OA among disadvantaged groups including diverse women.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^f37da3ab]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.6.2 Ischiofemoral impingement

In this condition, patients experience pain arising from compression of the quadratus femoris muscle between the ischial tuberosity and the lesser trochanter of femur. Clinically, patients present with gradual onset of posterior and/or posteromedial buttock pain with or without radiation to the posterior thigh that is worse with hip extension, adduction, and external rotation. A positive long stride walking test is supportive of the diagnosis.MRI to evaluate for signs of focal edema in the quadratus femoris muscle can aid in diagnosis.

4.6.3 Ischiogluteal bursitis

Often termed a "pain in the arse" for its clinical symptoms and difficulty to diagnose, ischiogluteal bursitis presents with central buttock pain that radiates down the posterior thigh. The precise epidemiology is unknown. Experts have long opined that ischiogluteal bursitis, also referred to as weavers' bottom, is rare but likely underdiagnosed, in part because it is easily confused for a variety of other conditions, including soft tissue tumors and radiculopathy. Ischiogluteal bursitis refers to inflammation of the ischial bursa, which lies between the ischial tuberosity and gluteus maximus muscle in standing, and between the ischial tuberosity and the skin in sitting.

On history, patients may report pain that is excruciating when sitting and patients may report being unable to sit. Ischiogluteal bursitis develops at the ischial tuberosity, where the hamstring tendons originate, and so patients may also report pain with actions that involve hamstring contraction, such as running, jumping, or kicking. On physical examination, the vast majority of patients will present with pain reproducible by palpating the ischial tuberosity (Figure 2). Diagnosis may be difficult to make clinically, and experts advocate for image‐guided diagnostic/therapeutic injection, US, or MRI to improve diagnostic accuracy.

### Polyarticular joint pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^29c176ff]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Polyarticular joint pain involves five or more joints and can be inflammatory or noninflammatory. Two of the most common causes of chronic polyarthritis are osteoarthritis, especially in older patients, and rheumatoid arthritis, which affects at least 0.25% of adults worldwide. The initial evaluation should include a detailed history of the patient's symptoms, with a focus on inflammation, location of pain, duration of symptoms, the presence of systemic symptoms, and any exposures to pathogens that could cause arthritis. Redness, warmth, or swelling in a joint is suggestive of synovitis and joint inflammation. A systematic approach to the physical examination that assesses for a pattern of joint involvement and presence of synovitis can help narrow the differential diagnosis. Laboratory tests, joint aspiration, and imaging studies should be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis. Rheumatoid factor and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody tests are helpful when there is concern for rheumatoid arthritis. Although magnetic resonance imaging is highly sensitive in identifying erosive bony changes and inflammation, conventional radiography remains the standard for the initial imaging evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis. Point-of-care musculoskeletal ultrasonography can also be a useful tool to detect findings that support a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis.

### Diagnosing and managing sacroiliac joint pain [^4e09f295]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Sacroiliac joint pain commonly occurs because of anatomic disruption within the joint. Sacroiliac joint pain and sacroiliac joint mimics create a broad differential, adding difficulty to diagnosis. Clinically, this disruption presents with a mobility limitation relative to baseline and sharp pain inferolateral to the posterior superior iliac spine. While attempting to rule out other causes of low back pain, provocation tests such as FABRE, distraction, thigh thrust, sacral compression, Gaenslen's, and sacral thrust can be a useful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint pain. Although recently, the provocation tests' validity has been challenged. Currently, the most accurate way to assess sacroiliac joint pain is with image-guided injections of local anesthetic. Pain reduction after the injection indicates the pain originating from the sacroiliac joint. Once confirmed, it is recommended to use a patient-centered approach that focuses on pain control, followed by restoration of function through noninvasive measures such as therapeutic exercise, manual medicine, sacroiliac joint belts, and orthotics. If these noninvasive procedures have not provided adequate treatment, then more invasive procedures should be considered.

### Walking disabilities in association with tenosynovitis at the metatarsophalangeal joints: a longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging study in early arthritis [^b31c27a3]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease that involves the small joints of the hands and feet. The focus in research, however, has primarily been on the hands, though 80% of patients report disease‐related foot problems and 71% report walking difficulties. These difficulties have an important impact on the quality of life of patients that is often underestimated by clinicians and is associated with clinical factors such as inflammation, pain, and duration of disease.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Walking disability at diagnosis is associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inflammation at metatarsophalangeal joints; this association was strongest for tenosynovitis.
A treatment‐induced decrease of MRI inflammation, particularly tenosynovitis, is associated with a reduction in walking disabilities.
This study increases our understanding of the nature of walking impairments in early arthritis.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used in RA research, as it sensitively detects inflammation, defined as tenosynovitis, synovitis, and osteitis. The association between walking difficulties and MRI inflammation has not been fully explored for the forefoot. Two previous reports have included MRI data of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints, but these were not contrast‐enhanced, and tenosynovitis at the MTP joints was not included. Additionally, the reports were cross‐sectional and thus did not study whether change in MRI inflammation over time related to change in disability.

Therefore, with the aim to increase our understanding of the role of inflammation at the MTP joints in functional disability, we set up a cross‐sectional and longitudinal study in early arthritis patients to evaluate the association of walking disabilities with MRI inflammation, defined as tenosynovitis, synovitis, and osteitis at the MTP joints.

### Joint hypermobility syndrome: recognizing a commonly overlooked cause of chronic pain [^c62a0457]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Joint hypermobility syndrome, also known as benign hypermobility syndrome, is a connective tissue disease characterized by joint instability, chronic pain, and minor skin changes. It shares many clinical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Hypermobility Type; enough so that many authorities consider them as one disease process. Approximately 3% of the general population is believed to have joint hypermobility syndrome, but despite this high prevalence, due to lack of awareness, heterogeneity of clinical presentation, and reliance on physical examination for diagnosis, it is largely overlooked by primary care physicians as well as by specialists. This leads to delayed or missed opportunities for diagnosis, and inappropriate interventions that frustrate both providers and patients. We review the literature regarding the pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis of joint hypermobility syndrome, and advocate for primary care physicians to consider it in the differential diagnosis of patients with chronic pain.

### Nonarthritic hip joint pain [^3a4b5ac3]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — diagnosis/classification and risk factors: Clinicians should consider the presence of osseous abnormalities, local or global ligamentous laxity, connective tissue disorders, and nature of the patient's activity and participation as risk factors for hip joint pathology (Recommendation based on expert opinion.). Clinicians should use the clinical findings of anterior groin or lateral hip pain or generalized hip joint pain that is reproduced with the hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation (FADIR) test or the hip flexion, abduction, external rotation (FABER) test, along with consistent imaging findings, to classify a patient with hip pain into the ICD categories of M25.5 Pain in joint, M24.7 Protrusio acetabula, M24.0 Loose body in joint, and M24.2 Disorder of ligament, and the associated ICF impairment-based categories of hip pain (b28016 Pain in joints) and mobility impairments (b7100 Mobility of a single joint; b7150 Stability of a single joint) (Recommendation based on weak evidence.). Clinicians should consider diagnostic categories other than nonarthritic joint pain when the patient's history, reported activity limitations, or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the Diagnosis/Classification section or when the patient's symptoms are not diminishing with interventions aimed at normalization of the impairments of body function (Recommendation based on expert opinion.).

Introduction: Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by non-inflammatory progressive arthropathy. A genetic defect causes progressive degeneration in joint cartilage (1). Typically starting with symmetric joint swelling and pain in childhood, PPD is often confused with more common pediatric rheumatic diseases such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis due to clinical similarities (2). Radiographic findings typically display characteristic changes like vertebral flattening and peripheral metaphyseal widening, which are important for distinguishing PPD from other conditions. This disease leads to progressive cartilage loss, joint stiffness, joint enlargement, and skeletal abnormalities, without the systemic inflammatory features typical of JIA.

Objectives: Misdiagnosis of PPD can lead to inappropriate treatments. Here, we present two siblings diagnosed with PPD to highlight the need for a genetic approach in cases of arthropathy with atypical courses.

Methods: Case 1 (17-year-old male): The patient first presented at the age of 7–8 with swelling in the fingers, leg deformities, later immobility, and a history of corrective orthopedic surgery. He had previously received treatments for JIA, which had not been beneficial. It was noted that his parents were related. Physical examination revealed bilateral metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joint swelling, pronounced kyphosis, deformities in the lower extremities, muscle atrophy, and swelling in both knees and toes, resulting in the inability to walk and reliance on a wheelchair. Despite these findings, he reported no significant pain. The patient's growth metrics were significantly below the standard percentile for his age. Acute phase reactants were normal, and radiographic examinations showed epiphyseal widening in the hand joints. MRI also displayed similar changes, indicating a non-inflammatory polyarticular process. Case 2 (9-year-old male): The younger brother of Case 1 presented with swelling in the fingers, wrists, and knees, and difficulty walking. Despite sharing similar clinical features, he did not have the advanced orthopedic complications seen in his older brother. Family history, radiological, and clinical findings prompted genetic testing of the patients.

### Successful diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^41521f1a]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The diagnosis of SIJ pain is a multifaceted process that involves a careful assessment. The practitioner must first focus on the history, observe the gait pattern, and perform the key points of the physical exam including provocative maneuvers. A thorough review of the imaging should be performed. SIJ diagnostic blocks will confirm the diagnosis. It is essential to rule out other concomitant pathologies. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, long-term solutions may exist, such as SIJ ablation, or posterior or lateral SIJ fusion. In addition, long-term spinal comorbidities often accompany SIJ dysfunction and should be reassessed frequently in those who suffer from other pain pathologies.

### Polyarticular joint pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^23d0b37a]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Physical Examination Assessment for warmth, redness, and swelling in addition to joint pain is important on examination of a joint. Redness is frequently seen with crystalline and infectious arthritis. Patients with arthritis may also have limited range of motion in the joint as well as decreased muscle strength around the joint. Patients with joint inflammation may hold the joint in partial flexion to reduce the joint volume and thus pain in the joint. SMALL JOINTS Many polyarticular processes involve small joints, and a systematic approach to their evaluation is prudent. The initial inspection should assess for evidence of swelling, erythema, synovitis, or dactylitis. The presence of skin findings such as psoriatic plaques or dystrophic nails should be noted. Examination of strength and active and passive range of motion can help assess functional impairment.

Special tests such as the log roll in the hip examination can help evaluate hip pathology, and the Lachman test in the knee examination can evaluate for anterior cruciate ligament injury, thus narrowing the differential diagnosis. Polyarticular gout can present a diagnostic dilemma, especially when involving atypical joints. 34 It is often associated with comorbidities and untreated disease. 35 Careful attention to a history of intermittent arthritis and a physical examination for tophi are imperative. 36 In gout and pseudogout, the presence of crystals in synovial fluid is considered the diagnostic standard. Therefore, effort should be made to obtain a synovial fluid specimen for analysis.

Radiographic findings suggestive of osteoarthritis include marginal osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cysts, and joint space narrowing. 43 Early changes of RA include soft tissue swelling and juxta-articular osteopenia. The earliest erosions in the metacarpophalangeal joints occur where the joint capsule synovium directly contacts the bone, often referred to as a marginal erosion 44. Late changes include diffuse osteoporosis, large subchondral erosions, uniform joint space loss, and joint subluxation.

### Evaluation and treatment of knee pain: a review [^6b062f25]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 5% of all primary care visits in adults are related to knee pain. Osteoarthritis (OA), patellofemoral pain, and meniscal tears are among the most common causes of knee pain.

Observations

Knee OA, affecting an estimated 654 million people worldwide, is the most likely diagnosis of knee pain in patients aged 45 years or older who present with activity-related knee joint pain with no or less than 30 minutes of morning stiffness (95% sensitivity; 69% specificity). Patellofemoral pain typically affects people younger than 40 years who are physically active and has a lifetime prevalence of approximately 25%. The presence of anterior knee pain during a squat is approximately 91% sensitive and 50% specific for patellofemoral pain. Meniscal tears affect an estimated 12% of the adult population and can occur following acute trauma (eg, twisting injury) in people younger than 40 years. Alternatively, a meniscal tear may be a degenerative condition present in patients with knee OA who are aged 40 years or older. The McMurray test, consisting of concurrent knee rotation (internal or external to test lateral or medial meniscus, respectively) and extension (61% sensitivity; 84% specificity), and joint line tenderness (83% sensitivity; 83% specificity) assist diagnosis of meniscal tears. Radiographic imaging of all patients with possible knee OA is not recommended. First-line management of OA comprises exercise therapy, weight loss (if overweight), education, and self-management programs to empower patients to better manage their condition. Surgical referral for knee joint replacement can be considered for patients with end-stage OA (ie, no or minimal joint space with inability to cope with pain) after using all appropriate conservative options. For patellofemoral pain, hip and knee strengthening exercises in combination with foot orthoses or patellar taping are recommended, with no indication for surgery. Conservative management (exercise therapy for 4–6 weeks) is also appropriate for most meniscal tears. For severe traumatic (eg, bucket-handle) tears, consisting of displaced meniscal tissue, surgery is likely required. For degenerative meniscal tears, exercise therapy is first-line treatment; surgery is not indicated even in the presence of mechanical symptoms (eg, locking, catching).

Conclusions and Relevance

Knee OA, patellofemoral pain, and meniscal tears are common causes of knee pain, can be diagnosed clinically, and can be associated with significant disability. First-line treatment for each condition consists of conservative management, with a focus on exercise, education, and self-management.

### Knee pain in children: part I: evaluation [^9e042a3f]. Pediatrics in Review (2016). Low credibility.

- On the basis of primarily consensus, due to lack of relevant clinical studies, the information obtained from the history and physical examination is the key to establishing a diagnosis and directing initial management of knee pain.
- By applying history and physical examination findings to a diagnosis and management algorithm, clinicians can efficiently and effectively determine the potential cause of the knee pain.
- On the basis of primarily consensus, due to lack of relevant clinical studies, the most important step of the evaluation of knee pain is to identify emergent conditions, including limb- and life-threatening conditions (eg, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and malignancy), hip pathology, or conditions associated with effusions.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic hip pain: 2022 update [^51b82cac]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic hip pain is a frequent chief complaint for adult patients who present for evaluation in a variety of clinical practice settings. Following a targeted history and physical examination, imaging plays a vital role in elucidating the etiologies of a patient's symptoms, as a wide spectrum of pathological entities may cause chronic hip pain. Radiography is usually the appropriate initial imaging test following a clinical examination. Depending on the clinical picture, advanced cross-sectional imaging may be subsequently performed for further evaluation. This documents provides best practice for the imaging workup of chronic hip pain in patients presenting with a variety of clinical scenarios. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Central metatarsalgia and walking on pebbles: beyond morton neuroma [^0affa0a9]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Central metatarsalgia relates to abnormalities of the second, third, and fourth metatarsals and their respective metatarsophalangeal joints. A variety of disorders present with central forefoot pain; they range from traumatic lesions (acute or chronic repetitive), inflammatory and infective disorders, nonneoplastic soft-tissue lesions, and benign tumors to malignant lesions. Patients often present with symptoms of localized pain in the forefoot that worsens on weight bearing (walking or running), which can be sharp or dull and often is perceived as a lump felt inside or underneath the foot and described as walking on a marble or pebbles. These patients are labeled as having central metatarsalgia and are further evaluated with ultrasound or MRI to establish a diagnosis.

Conclusion

In this article, we review metatarsal and intermetatarsal lesions of the foot that present with central forefoot pain and a sensation of walking on pebbles, focusing on conditions mimicking Morton neuroma clinically or on imaging. We also briefly review some other plantar lesions and arthropathy that can present with awareness of lump underneath the foot.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for patellofemoral pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to classification, APTA 2019 guidelines recommend to consider using the proposed impairment/function-based PFPS classification system to guide management:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Overuse/overload without other impairment|- Patients presenting with a history suggesting an increase in magnitude and/or frequency of patellofemoral joint loading at a rate surpassing the ability of patellofemoral joint tissues to recovery|
|Muscle performance deficits|- Patients presenting with lower extremity muscle performance deficits in the hip and quadriceps < br > - Patients may respond favorably to hip and knee resistance exercises|
|Movement coordination deficits|- Patients presenting with excessive or poorly controlled knee valgus during a dynamic task, but not necessarily due to weakness of the lower extremity musculature < br > - Patients may respond favorably to gait retraining and movement re-education interventions leading to improvements in lower extremity kinematics and pain, suggesting the importance of assessing dynamic knee valgus during movement|
|Mobility impairments|- Patients presenting with higher than normal foot mobility and/or flexibility deficits of ≥ 1 of the following structures|

### Osteoarthritis: an update with relevance for clinical practice [^0eeb508b]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Osteoarthritis is thought to be the most prevalent chronic joint disease. The incidence of osteoarthritis is rising because of the ageing population and the epidemic of obesity. Pain and loss of function are the main clinical features that lead to treatment, including non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical approaches. Clinicians recognise that the diagnosis of osteoarthritis is established late in the disease process, maybe too late to expect much help from disease-modifying drugs. Despite efforts over the past decades to develop markers of disease, still-imaging procedures and biochemical marker analyses need to be improved and possibly extended with more specific and sensitive methods to reliably describe disease processes, to diagnose the disease at an early stage, to classify patients according to their prognosis, and to follow the course of disease and treatment effectiveness. In the coming years, a better definition of osteoarthritis is expected by delineating different phenotypes of the disease. Treatment targeted more specifically at these phenotypes might lead to improved outcomes.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) medical screening and referral — Medical screening incorporates the findings of the history and physical examination to determine whether the patient's symptoms originate from a condition that requires referral to another health care provider, and prior to diagnosing a person with PFP, it is necessary to rule out all other possible medical conditions. Clinicians should recognize the key signs and symptoms associated with serious pathological knee conditions, continually screen for the presence of these conditions throughout treatment, and immediately initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner when a potentially serious medical condition is suspected, and medical conditions for which physical therapy is not indicated must be considered as possible etiologies of a patient's symptoms.

Results

Patients with CSA

Baseline characteristics of the 241 patients included are shown in table 1. The mean age was 44.3 years, 78% were female. The median HAQ score of the total group of patients at baseline was 0.50 (IQR: 0.25–0.88). Thirty-three patients reported the use of extra devices for certain HAQ activities, mostly for the categories arising, walking and grip.

Table 1
Patient characteristics at baseline presentation with CSA

HAQ score and MRI-detected subclinical inflammation at presentation

The association between severity of MRI-detected subclinical inflammation and functional disability was corrected for age. Patients with CSA who presented with higher total MRI-inflammation scores had higher HAQ scores (β = 0.017, 95% CI = 0.004 to 0.030, p = 0.010); β indicates the per point increase in MRI-inflammation score, the HAQ score increased with 0.017 (for interpretation the MRI-inflammation score ranges between 0 and 189). The synovitis, tenosynovitis and bone marrow oedema scores were also studied separately. Of the individual types of inflammation, the tenosynovitis score showed the strongest association with functional disability (β = 0.046, 95% CI = 0.017 to 0.076) vs β = 0.024, 95% CI = −0.008 to 0.057) and β = 0.026 (95% CI = −0.004 to 0.057) for synovitis and bone marrow oedema, respectively.

HAQ scores at presentation and progression to clinical arthritis

During a median follow-up period of 103 weeks, 44 patients progressed to clinical arthritis. The patients who progressed presented with higher baseline HAQ scores than patients with CSA who did not progress (median 0.88 vs 0.50). Four subgroups with equal numbers were created to study the association between HAQ scores and progression to clinical arthritis in more detail (the quartiles contained four groups with HAQ scores of < 0.25, 0.25–0.50, 0.63–0.88 and ≥ 1.0, see online supplementary file 3). Patients with HAQ scores ≥ 1.0 had a significantly increased hazard on developing clinical arthritis (HR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.03 to 6.10), compared with the patients with HAQ scores < 0.25 (figure 1).

### How does hip osteoarthritis differ from knee osteoarthritis? [^65e7607d]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2022). Medium credibility.

Hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) are leading causes of global disability. Most research to date has focused on the knee, with results often extrapolated to the hip, and this extends to treatment recommendations in clinical guidelines. Extrapolating results from research on knee OA may limit our understanding of disease characteristics specific to hip OA, thereby constraining development and implementation of effective treatments. This review highlights differences between hip and knee OA with respect to prevalence, prognosis, epigenetics, pathophysiology, anatomical and biomechanical factors, clinical presentation, pain and non-surgical treatment recommendations and management.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study design and participants

This was a diagnostic accuracy cross‐sectional study nested within a larger multicenter, cross‐sectional study of individuals with type 2 diabetes. For the larger study, we recruited participants age ≥ 45 years with type 2 diabetes who actively received care for type 2 diabetes (at least one visit within the past year) from endocrinology clinics at three academic hospitals in Toronto, Canada, between March 2022 and August 2023. We invited a subset of these participants with and without self‐reported knee pain to participate (aiming for 50% with/without) in this diagnostic accuracy substudy. We invited consenting participants to attend a hospital outpatient appointment where they completed a self‐administered questionnaire evaluating the NICE criteria (index test) immediately followed by clinical evaluation by a rheumatologist (reference standard). The near simultaneous assessment was to avoid biases caused by changes in participant disease status. A flow chart is shown in Figure 1. Demographic characteristics and medical history were assessed via online questionnaires as part of the larger cross‐sectional study.

We received research ethics approval from the Women's College Hospital Research Ethics Board (REB #2020‐0129‐E) and the University of Toronto Office of Research Ethics (#40735). We followed the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy reporting guideline.

Index test:criteria for knee

The NICE guideline on OA states that "adults aged ≥ 45 years should be diagnosed with OA clinically without investigations if they have activity‐related joint pain and either no morning joint stiffness or morning stiffness that lasts less than 30 minutes". The guidance advises against further evaluation with imaging to diagnose OA unless there are atypical features or features that suggest an alternative or additional diagnosis.

To assess the NICE criteria for knee OA, participants self‐completed a paper questionnaire that ascertained the presence of activity‐related joint pain ("Do you have pain or aching in one or both of your knee joints that comes on, or is made worse by, activities such as standing, walking, or climbing stairs", yes/no) and the presence of morning joint stiffness ≤ 30 minutes ("Do you have stiffness in your knee(s) after waking up in the morning?", no/yes, up to 30 minutes/yes, 30 to 60 minute/yes, more than 60 minutes).

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^c59f29f8]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Making and giving a diagnosis of OA

In primary care adults 45 years and over consulting with joint pain and limitations in everyday activity are more likely to receive NICE recommendations if a diagnosis of OA has been recorded in the medical electronic record. Delay in diagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment and suboptimal care. Overuse of imaging has prompted NICE to highlight the recommendation for diagnosing OA on clinical grounds and set a quality standard to audit this approach.

Diagnosis and subsequent treatment are often focused on a single, most painful joint rather than multisite joint problems. Yet multisite joint pain is the most common presentation in consultations in primary care, and having more joint sites affected leads to more health care consultations irrespective of specialty or site. As summarized in a recent systematic review, there is a paucity of evidence to guide the practitioner regarding treatment of multisite joint pain, with few studies describing interventions for considering OA in all affected joints. Comorbidities also often go under-recognized in primary care and the community, which further hampers the holistic assessment recommended by NICE.

Reports have highlighted the impact of language when giving the diagnosis of OA. Health Care Professionals' views can be perceived to be negative, for example, 'nothing can be done' and 'it's your age'. Unhelpful descriptions and terminology can easily transfer from the X-ray report into the consultation, with people with OA concerned for their 'degenerative meniscal tear'. Use of language to talk about OA that offers more positive and supportive messages, such as 'wear' and 'remodelling', can enhance understanding of prognosis when verbal messages are backed up by written patient information. Explaining that OA is part of a process of repair rather than degeneration can introduce a sense of optimism and reassurance because it offers a more positive outlook to life with OA, and can change patients' and carers' perceptions that OA inevitably leads to persistent pain, disability and joint replacement.

### Gait and balance disorders in older adults [^713eb56a]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Gait and balance disorders are common in older adults and are a major cause of falls in this population. They are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, as well as reduced level of function. Common causes include arthritis and orthostatic hypotension; however, most gait and balance disorders involve multiple contributing factors. Most changes in gait are related to underlying medical conditions and should not be considered an inevitable consequence of aging. Physicians caring for older patients should ask at least annually about falls, and should ask about or examine for difficulties with gait and balance at least once. For older adults who report a fall, physicians should ask about difficulties with gait and balance, and should observe for any gait or balance dysfunctions. The Timed Up and Go test is a fast and reliable diagnostic tool. Persons who have difficulty or demonstrate unsteadiness performing the Timed Up and Go test require further assessment, usually with a physical therapist, to help elucidate gait impairments and related functional limitations. The most effective strategy for falls prevention involves a multifactorial evaluation followed by targeted interventions for identified contributing factors. Evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for gait and balance disorders is limited because of the lack of standardized outcome measures determining gait and balance abilities. However, effective options for patients with gait and balance disorders include exercise and physical therapy.

### Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for facet joint interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines facet joint interventions 2020 guidelines [^95f8519b]. Pain Physician (2020). High credibility.

Facet joint pain — history, physical examination, and imaging are used to screen and inform testing, but clinical criteria have limited diagnostic accuracy. Many researchers have attempted to develop a series of diagnostic clinical criteria to establish the diagnosis of facet joint pain as cause of axial spinal pain, including unilateral or bilateral axial spinal pain associations, pseudoradicular pain, morning stiffness, pain on extension and rotation, negative neurological examination, and normal gait; however, the sensitivity and specificity of these criteria are very low. Even then, history and physical examination continue to be the fundamental for screening patients with low back pain, even though they cannot establish facet joint diagnosis as the specific cause of the pain, but provide suspicion of the diagnosis. Imaging is not very useful in identifying facet pain; however, imaging is necessary and useful in identifying red flags, disc herniation, and discogenic pain. A systematic review and pilot study to create a clinical diagnosis scale included 6 phases, utilizing a total of 36 signs and symptoms, and a total of 12, with 8 symptoms and 4 signs were included in the final survey.

### Severe hypophosphatemic osteomalacia secondary to Fanconi syndrome due to adefovir: a case report [^45cf7f68]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Generalized proximal, type 2, renal tubular acidosis, also known as Fanconi syndrome, is a generalized dysfunction of the proximal renal tubule characterized by impaired reabsorption and increased urinary loss of phosphate and other solutes, such as uric acid, glucose, amino acids, and bicarbonate. Chronic hypophosphatemia is the second most common cause of osteomalacia after vitamin D deficiency in adult patients and can have a heterogeneous presentation, ranging from mild symptoms such as muscle weakness and skeletal pain to more severe presentation, such as disabling myopathy, severe bone and joint pain, difficulty walking, and even bone fractures.

Methods

This report describes a case of severe hypophosphatemic osteomalacia with multiple fragility fractures induced by adefovir, which was worsened and confounded by a previous treatment with zoledronic acid and required prolonged intravenous potassium phosphate administration.

Results

We highlight the limited diagnostic value of dual X-ray absorptiometry and bone scintigraphy in this challenging diagnosis. Bone metabolism should always be assessed in patients treated with adefovir for early detection of osteomalacia due to Fanconi syndrome.

Conclusion

Although rare, this condition may be life-threatening and mimic other bone metabolic disorders that are treated with drugs that may further impair phosphate balance.

### Patellofemoral pain [^cef2199b]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) impairment-based classification and re-evaluation — Differential evaluation of musculoskeletal clinical findings determines the most relevant physical impairments associated with the patient's reported activity limitations and medical diagnosis, and clusters of these clinical findings are described as impairment patterns labeled according to the key impairment(s) of body function. The authors propose a classification system for PFP with subcategories named according to the primary impairments, and impairment-based classification is critical for matching the intervention strategy that is most likely to provide the optimal outcome for a patient's clinical findings. The impairment pattern and associated intervention strategies often change during the patient's episode of care, so continual re-evaluation of the patient's response to treatment and emerging clinical findings is important for providing optimal interventions throughout the patient's episode of care.

### Characteristics associated between the incidence of hip osteoarthritis and early hip complaints (CHECK study) within 10 years [^371dfc1e]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study is one of the first to describe which baseline variables are associated with incidence of hip OA during a 10-year follow-up in first presenters with hip complaints in primary care. The PCA analysis showed that the data may be reduced to four independent underlying dimensions (components). In this cohort study it was observed that component 3 was positively associated with incidence of hip OA in first presenters with hip complaints when the different definitions of hip OA were combined. Component 3 could be interpreted as follows: participants with positive values have relatively high levels of pain during shopping/walking combined with less difficulty with putting socks on/off and rising from bed; participants with negative values have relatively more difficulty with putting socks on/off and rising from bed compared with pain during shopping/walking.

Comparison of main findings with other studies

To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies in primary care have examined the association between baseline characteristics (history taking, WOMAC questions and physical examination) and incident hip OA as outcome measurement. Studies on incident hip OA are scarce. Most studies have examined associations between history taking or physical examination variables and progression of hip OA. Those studies showed that restrictions in movement (range of motion), particularly internal rotation, are predictors for progression of hip OA.

Decades ago, studies showed that in general most diagnoses were made based on history taking, and that physical examination and laboratory tests made a smaller contribution to the diagnosis. The studies reported that the physicians' confidence in the correct diagnosis increased after physical examination and laboratory tests, but led to fewer diagnoses. The present study showed that mainly the patients' history variables are associated with incident hip OA, compared with physical examination variables. No association was found between elements of physical examination and incident hip OA; this is in line with others. An earlier study examined the functional impact of hip pain in older persons and found that those reporting hip pain were more likely to report disability in shopping than persons without hip pain. Our finding of an association between component 3 and incident hip OA is in line with this. Also, our finding that fewer comorbidities and higher age are associated with receiving a HR is also in line with others. Better health and higher age are reported to be associated with a greater probability of undergoing total joint replacement. Persons with fewer comorbidities are more likely to have an operation, because they have a better long-term outcome after HR. Older age and number of comorbidities were also associated with the risk of an adverse event or complication.

Case presentation

Case history

The 22-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital on August 25, 2021 with the chief complaint of "double knee joints pain for 10+ years, aggravation for 2+ months, accompanied by groin pain for 2+ weeks". 10+ years ago, she had recurrent pain in both knees without obvious inducement, occasionally with knee valgus and knee dislocation. 2+ years ago, she developed low back pain which was relieved after rest, but the spine moved freely. 1+ years ago, she experienced severe pain in her low back and loss of mobility. She needed help to get up and down stairs, usually could only walk slowly. 2+ months ago, the pain became progressively worse and she developed pain in the groin area and the right 12th rib after a tumble. MRI showed bone marrow edema in the right intertrochanteric, femoral neck, lower left femur, and tibial intercondylar crest. 2+ weeks ago, she had occasional wandering pain of joints all over the body, accompanied by difficulty in walking and increased pain after weight bearing. Biochemical tests revealed hypophosphatemia (0.47 mmol/L), high serum alkaline phosphatase (257 IU/L), low 25-OH Vit D (41.1 nmol/L), and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) demonstrated reduced bone density. Then she was admitted into the Department of Endocrinology of our hospital for further treatment. She had lost 3 cm in height over 10 years. Her medical history included polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) for nearly 3 years, with irregular menstruation. Deny bad eating habits, long-term absence from sunlight, chronic diarrhea and the history of taking adefovir dipivoxil or other drugs. No history of recurrent skin hemorrhages or tooth loss or fracture. No family history of skeletal, metabolic or hormonal disorders.

### Pain deterioration within 1 year predicts future decline of walking ability: a 7-year prospective observational study of elderly female patients with knee osteoarthritis living in a rural district [^c43bbc45]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this study were: (1) patients whose knee pain deteriorated within 1 year also reported whose physical function score of JKOM at the time of 1-year follow-up; (2) deterioration of pain score, compared with baseline, was observed in patients whose walking ability deteriorated by the time of 7-year follow-up; and (3) over 40% of the patients whose knee pain deteriorated by the 1-year follow-up were unable to walk by the 7-year follow-up.

There are currently only a few reports about the natural course of KOA. Thorstensson et al described that 90% of the patients with clinical KOA and 78% without clinical KOA developed tibiofemoral OA over a 12-year follow-up period. Felson et al noted that bone marrow edema was a risk factor for deterioration in patients with KOA. However, the above studies did not focus on clinical findings, but rather on radiological evaluations. There are no studies of how short-term changes in pain perception affect walking ability after longer follow-up. This might be because the majority of patients with painful KOA tend to have elective orthopedic surgery. In our study, over 40% of the patients whose knee pain worsened within 1-year follow-up were unable to walk by the 7-year follow-up, even though they had not developed any other additional diseases. The average pain score on the JKOM for group B was 18.3 and pain deterioration in group B was nearly 5 points. This change means many patients went from best to worst score on one question as the pain score in the JKOM varies from 8 (best) to 40 (worst). Wright et al found that the density of orthopedic surgeons and referring physicians was the dominant factor that affected care for patients with KOA. So general physicians in areas where the density of orthopedic and referring physicians is low should pay careful attention to their patients' perceived pain levels and refer rapidly deteriorating patients to orthopedic surgeons for further management. However, in developing countries, it can be difficult for patients or general physicians to locate a specialist, particularly orthopedic surgeons. Consequently, orthopedic surgeons and referring physicians should also inform patients and general physicians of the importance of early interventions such as physiotherapy or elective surgery if needed for the patients with KOA who complain of worsening pain within the short term and the efficacy of early intervention to prevent declination of ADL is our future interest.

Post-Surgical Knee Pain (PSKP)

Background: PSKP can be a difficult condition to diagnose, especially in the acute phase, as reports of pain after surgery are to be expected – it is not until several weeks, or even months, into the postoperative period that a practitioner will begin to suspect something is "wrong". Even then, once any complications with the surgery (ie, infection, prosthesis malfunction, fracture, etc) have been ruled out, the usual assumptions are either malingering or drug seeking. For these reasons, PSKP tends to be underdiagnosed and its true incidence is difficult to measure as many patients reporting symptoms of PSKP are simply taken back to the operating room for subsequent surgeries. For example, many patients who undergo arthroscopic knee surgeries for knee OA eventually undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A systematic review reports the overall incidence of TKA after knee arthroscopy is 2.62% and increases to 3.98% when selecting for older patients. The mean and median time from arthroscopy to TKA was 3.4 and 2.0 years, respectively. Annual revision rates of TKA are 0.49%, compared to revision rates of medial unicompartmental arthroscopy (1.07%), lateral unicompartmental arthroscopy (1.13%), and patellofemoral arthroscopy (1.75%). Nearly 20% of the patients experience suboptimal results following TKA, and residual post-TKA pain is a common complaint. Predictors of increased residual post-TKA pain include other pain sites, catastrophizing, and depression.
Etiology: Post-TKA pain can be caused by intrinsic or extrinsic etiologies. Table 8 outlines the possible causes.
Diagnostic criteria: Assessment of residual post-TKA pain includes detailed history, review of surgical reports, and physical exam. Acuity, onset, nature, exacerbating factors can help distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic causes. Physical exam includes visual inspection including joint alignment, palpation, range of motion, patellar tracking and stability in coronal/sagittal planes during range of motion, gait, and exam of the hip and spine. Preoperative and postoperative radiologic images should be reviewed. Obtain weight bearing anterior-posterior, lateral, and merchant views of the knee. Additionally, weightbearing films of the entire leg, hip, and ankle will assess varus or valgus abnormalities. Diagnostic intra-articular local anesthetic injection will support diagnosis of intra-articular source if pain is relieved within a few minutes of injection.
Treatment: Treating knee pain secondary to surgery can be extremely complicate given the fact that it may not be readily apparent what the pain is consequential to. Is it merely postsurgical discomfort that is taking longer than expected to heal, is it the result of a nerve injury (ie, CRPS Type II), a new pathology created by the surgery itself, or something else entirely? An unfortunate confounding factor that negatively impacts these situations is the presence of opioids as these patients will all inevitably be taking due to their having just had a surgical procedure. As such, multimodal analgesia is the optimal perioperative pain control regimen and reduces long-term opioid use with improved patient outcomes. This includes a combination of preemptive analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia, peripheral nerve blockade, patient controlled analgesia, local infiltration analgesia, and oral opioid/non-opioid medications. Yu et al report discontinuing patient-controlled analgesia and femoral nerve blocks from the multimodal regimen and replacing them with liposomal bupivacaine resulted in less overall opioid consumption, with no difference in functional recovery or reported pain control. In patients with centrally sensitized knee pain prior to TKA, duloxetine should be considered to minimize post-TKA pain. For patients with persistent post-TKA pain, physical therapy, range of motion, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) are conservative measures that are effective. Interventional therapies to consider include nerve blockade, peripheral nerve neuromodulation, and dorsal root ganglion neuromodulation.

Knee osteoarthritis neuromuscular training — Neuromuscular training (i.e. balance, agility, coordination) programs in combination with traditional exercise could be used to improve performance-based function and walking speed for treatment of knee osteoarthritis, with Strength of Recommendation: Moderate ★★★ (downgrade). There were no differences in knee pain reported between groups in any of the studies, and there were mixed results on function measures with reports of greater improvements in self-reported function and walking speed for the neuromuscular training group. The Neuromuscular training recommendation has been downgraded one level because of inconsistent evidence. Some patients can expect an improvement in function and walking speed with neuromuscular training, though some patients may experience a temporary increase in knee pain or muscle soreness when engaging in the exercise program. Neuromuscular exercise programs would be considered feasible; however, some patients may have difficulty with access to supervised exercise due to travel or co-pay concerns. Given the mixed results between exercise programs with and without neuromuscular exercise programs, it would be beneficial for future research to identify factors that would discriminate between patients who would have better success with a neuromuscular exercise program versus those who would have better success with a traditional strength and joint mobility exercise program.

### Imaging in osteoarthritis [^325748e3]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Conventional radiography is still the first and most important imaging examination in a clinical setting when evaluating a patient with a known or suspected diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA). In research and clinical trials, it still is a valuable tool for stratifying patients who have OA into different categories for inclusion criteria and eligibility. MRI has become crucial in understanding the natural history of the disease and in guiding future therapies because of its ability to image the knee as a whole organ and to assess cartilage morphology and composition directly and in a three-dimensional manner. The other modalities discussed in this article are valuable additional techniques indicated on a case-by-case basis.

The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis — imaging studies and radiographic criteria: Imaging studies, specifically plain film radiographs, are confirmatory for moderate to severe hip OA; however, radiographs are less useful in demonstrating early osteoarthritic joint changes, and joint space narrowing detected on radiographs may be a relatively late stage phenomenon of OA. Joint space narrowing has been advocated as the best indicator and best predictor of arthritic change in patients with hip OA. The normal hip joint space is 3 to 5 mm, and a reduction of greater than or equal to 0.5 mm represents a clinically relevant and significant reduction in joint space width. Hip joint OA is considered moderate when joint space is less than 2.5 mm and severe when joint space is less than 1.5 mm. The development of newer imaging techniques, such as gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, has been suggested as a method to detect deficiencies in cartilage structure that may represent early arthritic changes in young patients. In addition to joint space narrowing, other criteria, including osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis, also are used to identify patients with hip OA, and the Kellgren/Lawrence scale has been used to classify degenerative findings associated with hip OA. The scale consists of 4 grades: grade 1, no radiographic evidence of OA; grade 2, doubtful narrowing of joint space and possible (minute) osteophytes; grade 3, moderate definite osteophytes, definite moderate narrowing of joint space; grade 4, large osteophytes, severe joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and definite deformity of bone contour; a potential caveat when using the Kellgren/Lawrence scale is spurs or osteophytes are emphasized and not all patients with hip OA have osteophytes.

### Functional gait disorders: a sign-based approach [^79fd2898]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Functional gait disorders are common in clinical practice. They are also usually disabling for affected individuals. The diagnosis is challenging because no single walking pattern is pathognomonic for a functional gait disorder. Establishing a diagnosis is based not primarily on excluding organic gait disorders but instead predominantly on recognizing positive clinical features of functional gait disorders, such as an antalgic, a buckling, or a waddling gait. However, these features can resemble and overlap with organic gait disorders. It is therefore necessary to also look for inconsistency (variations in clinical presentation that cannot be reconciled with an organic lesion) and incongruity (combination of symptoms and signs that is not seen with organic lesions). Yet, these features also have potential pitfalls as inconsistency can occur in patients with dystonic gait or those with freezing of gait. Similarly, patients with dystonia or chorea can present with bizarre gait patterns that may falsely be interpreted as incongruity. A further complicating factor is that functional and organic gait disorders may coexist within the same patient. To improve the diagnostic process, we present a sign-based approach — supported by videos — that incorporates the diverse clinical spectrum of functional gait disorders. We identify 7 groups of supportive gait signs that can signal the presence of functional gait disorders. For each group of signs, we highlight how specific clinical tests can bring out the inconsistencies and incongruencies that further point to a functional gait disorder.

### Functional gait disorders: a sign-based approach [^5434be41]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing a functional gait disorder

Diagnosing a functional gait disorder is challenging for several reasons. First, there is not a single pathognomonic gait pattern. Functional gait disorders are often equated with bizarre clinical features, but this is a diagnostic pitfall because organic gait disorders can also produce bizarre gait patterns, as may occur in patients with choreatic or dystonic gait. Second, functional gait disorders can present with clinical features that resemble organic gait disorders. For example, a buckling gait (the knees giving way) is a common phenotype of a functional gait, but can also occur in patients with negative myoclonus of the lower extremities. Third, the presence of an organic gait disorder does not exclude the coexistence of a superimposed functional component and vice versa; when there is an obvious functional gait disorder, there might be some underlying organic disease as well. It can therefore be helpful to perform ancillary testing to rule out concurrent underlying organic neurologic disorders. However, the diagnosis of a clinically established functional movement disorder itself relies primarily on recognizing characteristic supportive features, which includes an inconsistency and incongruence with organic gait disorders, and not by simply ruling out, to the extent possible, an organic gait disorder.

An example of inconsistency is an unexplained variability in gait disorder severity over time. Some patients can walk in daily life situations but are unable to walk during the physical examination. Family members may sometimes comment about a different walking pattern they are seeing during the examination compared with the gait pattern that is present at home. In addition, some patients manifest marked walking difficulties while being observed, but move remarkably better during spontaneous movements, e.g. in the examination roomof while getting dressed or undressed. Unexplained variability also includes spontaneous remissions or exacerbations over time and a lack of falls despite severe gait impairments. Another example of inconsistency is a mismatch between the objectively visible severity of the gait impairments and any self-reported limitations during activities of daily living. This discrepancy can be in either direction, i.e. severe gait impairment may be present during examination but without any limitations during activities of daily living, or severe restrictions in daily life activities may be reported in the presence of mild gait impairments.

### Successful diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^a8d3bea9]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain is one of the most common causes of low back pain, accounting for 15 to 30% of all cases. Although SIJ dysfunction accounts for a large portion of chronic low back pain prevalence, it is often overlooked or under diagnosed and subsequently under treated. The purpose of this review was to establish a best practices model to effectively diagnose SIJ pain through detailed history, physical exam, review of imaging, and diagnostic block.

Methods

A literature search was performed on the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint pain and sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The authors proposed diagnostic recommendations based upon the available literature and a detailed understanding of diagnosing SIJ pain.

Results

The practitioner must focus on the history, location of pain, observed gait pattern, and perform key points of the physical exam including sacroiliac provocative maneuvers. If the patient exhibits at least three provocative maneuvers then the SIJ may be considered as a possible source of pain. Additionally, a thorough review of the imaging should be performed to rule out other etiologies of low back pain. In the absence of any pathognomonic tests or examination findings, diagnostic SIJ blocks have evolved as the diagnostic standard.

Conclusion

The diagnosis of SIJ pain is a multifaceted process that involves a careful assessment including differentiating other pain generators in the region. This involves careful history taking, appropriate physical examination including provocative maneuvers and diagnostic injections. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, long-term solutions may be considered, including recent advances in sacral lateral branch denervation and sacroiliac joint fusion.

### Walking disabilities in association with tenosynovitis at the metatarsophalangeal joints: a longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging study in early arthritis [^fe595d8b]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The relationship between functional disability and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inflammation has been studied for the hands, but has not been well established for the feet, even though walking difficulties are common. Therefore, our objective was to study whether walking difficulties were associated with MRI inflammation at metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints in early arthritis patients, at diagnosis and during 24 months of follow‐up.

Methods

A total of 532 consecutive patients presenting with early arthritis reported on the presence and severity of walking difficulties (Health Assessment Questionnaire question 4a, scale 0–3), and underwent unilateral contrast‐enhanced MRI of MTP joints 1–5 at baseline. In total, 107 patients had clinical and MRI data at follow‐up (4, 12, and 24 months). MRI inflammation (synovitis, tenosynovitis, and osteitis) was scored in line with the Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scoring system. At baseline, the association of walking disability with MRI inflammation was assessed using regression. Longitudinally, the association between a change in walking disability with a change in MRI inflammation was studied with linear mixed models.

Results

At baseline, 81% of patients with walking disabilities had MRI inflammation at MTP joints, versus 68% without walking disabilities (P < 0.001). Total MRI inflammation (i.e. the sum of tenosynovitis, synovitis, and osteitis) was associated with severity of walking disability (β = 0.023, P < 0.001). Studying the MRI features separately, tenosynovitis, synovitis, and osteitis were all univariably associated with severity of walking disability (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.014, respectively). In multivariable analysis, the association was strongest for tenosynovitis. During follow‐up, a decrease in MTP inflammation was associated with a decrease in walking disability (β = 0.029, P = 0.001); in multivariable analyses only, tenosynovitis was independently associated (β = 0.073, P = 0.049).

Conclusion

Of the different inflamed tissues in MTP joints, predominantly MRI‐detected tenosynovitis was associated with walking disabilities. Likewise a reduction in tenosynovitis related to a decrease in walking disabilities. These results increase our understanding of the involvement of tenosynovitis in walking disabilities in early arthritis.

### Effect of tanezumab on joint pain, physical function, and patient global assessment of osteoarthritis… [^2a715980]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with moderate to severe OA of the knee or hip and inadequate response to standard analgesics, tanezumab, compared with placebo, resulted in statistically significant improvements in scores assessing pain and physical function, and in PGA-OA, although the improvements were modest and tanezumab-treated patients had more joint safety events and total joint replacements. Further research is needed to determine the clinical importance of these efficacy and adverse event findings. Patients recorded daily average index joint pain and weekly average nonindex joint pain via eDiary during the treatment period using an 11-point numeric rating scale. Weekly average pain was recorded for all joints during the safety follow-up period.

Investigators evaluated patients reporting increased severe persistent pain via eDiary lasting 2 or more weeks to determine whether additional follow-up was needed. Both rapidly progressive OA type 2 events occurred in index joints that were Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4 at screening, and neither patient reported NSAID use during the study. In 1 rapidly progressive OA type 2 case, the screening radiographs adjudicated after study completion suggested that this patient had atrophic OA and possible osteonecrosis before tanezumab treatment. All total joint replacements occurred in joints that were Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3 to 4 at screening. Most patients underwent total joint replacements that were of the index joint, elective, adjudicated as normal OA progression, and occurred after the treatment period. Two tanezumab-treated patients had total joint replacements and adjudicated rapidly progressive OA. In this clinical trial of patients with moderate to severe OA of the knee or hip and inadequate treatment response to standard analgesics, subcutaneous tanezumab demonstrated statistically significant improvements over placebo in pain, physical function, and PGA-OA at week 16; approximately 85% of patients had knee index joints. Forced titration of tanezumab from 2. 5 mg to 5 mg resulted in nominally greater improvements compared with patients who continued taking tanezumab,
2. 5 mg. A significant.

Patient #1: a longstanding disease with multiple system involvement and a dramatic response to vemurafenib

A 39 year-old woman of Turkish-Iraqi descent presented in September 2007 to the emergency department with low grade fever, signs of weakness and difficulty walking due to diffuse bone pain mostly in the knees and both pectoral and pelvic girdles. Shortly before her admission the patient began experiencing alternating hot flashes and cold bouts disproportionate to the weather or clothing and suffered from frequent night sweats. Approximately six months prior to this incident, fatigue and leg pain slowly developed. The pain originally began as a tingling sensation, accompanied by paresthesia. It had escalated over several months and progressed to fully fledged bone pain. At the time of presentation, the pain was described as initiating at rest and constant, occasionally accompanied by episodes of fever. The patient was admitted for several consecutive hospitalizations. Upon inspection of her face, both exophthalmos and yellowish peri-orbital xanthelasmae-like lesions were apparent. The remainder of her physical examination was unremarkable, without deformation or bony swelling and without neurological deficits. It is noteworthy that the patient was polydypsic and polyuric for approximately five years prior to the onset of bone pain, consuming and excreting up to 12 liters of water per day. Despite this, a diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus was established and treatment with intranasal desmopressin initiated only upon hospitalization, presumably due to the patient's adjustment to the gradual changes in water metabolism over the years. Apart from her known iron deficiency anemia, laboratory studies revealed increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP: 70 mg/L) and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR: 72 mm/hour). A broad panel of immunologic studies, including rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-nuclear antibodies was unremarkable. Negative blood and urine cultures ruled out an infectious etiology. Protein electrophoresis (PEP) yielded no monoclonal spike and the oncological markers were found to be within normal limits. Further investigations included radiography, which revealed bilateral sclerotic changes in the femoral and tibial bones and electromyography, which demonstrated normal muscle and nerve functionality. A subsequent 99m Tc bone scintigraphy demonstrated increased tracer uptake in the superior aspect of both orbits, the central sphenoidal region, left humeral head, right femoral greater trochanter and lateral superior aspect of the left iliac crest as well as diffuse, symmetric, bilateral increased tracer uptake in the femurs and tibiae enveloping both knees (Figure 1 A). A CT of the femurs and tibiae exhibited an irregular osseous texture demonstrating bones riddled with mixed patchy lesions of sclerotic and lytic nature. This was suggestive of either a metabolic, malignant or granulomatous process. An additional CT of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis revealed congestion of both renal sinuses with slightly distended ureters (Figure 2 A). CT and later MRI of the brain revealed bilateral retro-orbital nodular lesions (Figure 3 A), diffuse thickening and tortuosity of the optic nerves, enlargement of both lacrimal glands and soft tissue fullness of the sphenoid sinus (Figure 3 C). An MRI dedicated to the pituitary revealed no deviation from the normal anatomy. Over the two week period between two consecutive hospitalizations papilledema developed, accompanied by headaches, blurred vision and nausea. A lumbar puncture revealed an increased opening pressure of 44 cmH₂O. Treatment with acetazolamide (250 mg X3 daily) was initiated, the increased intracranial pressure normalized and related symptoms abated. Biopsies were obtained from the tibial bone marrow and from a lacrimal gland. A microscopic examination of the tibial biopsy revealed bony trabeculae separated by a xanthomatous, diffuse spindle cell macrophage population with few interspersed giant cells (Figure 4 A). The spindle cells stained relatively uniformly for the presence of CD163, and in a more patchy fashion but quite strongly for factor XIIIa (Figure 4 C), surface staining for CD14 and granular intense staining for CD68 (Figure 4 B). CD1a and S-100 staining were globally negative (Figure 4 D) except for one focus of S-100(+) cells, suggesting infiltration of the marrow with Langerhans cells. Overall, these findings were most consistent with a diagnosis of ECD with a component of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Over the five years pursuant to her diagnosis on May 2007, the patient was treated with several treatment protocols. At first, steroids (prednisone, 60 mg/day) provided a temporary relief - a marked decrease in bone pain, decrease in CRP levels and normalization of fever. Two months later vinblastine (6 mg/m²/week) was introduced as a steroid sparing agent. This protocol failed to evoke a favorable long lasting response and was substituted for treatment with interferon-α. Since then, interferon-α has served as the primary therapeutic agent administered at dosages as low as 3 × 10⁶ IU X 3 times weekly and as high as 6 × 10⁶ IU X 5 times weekly. Initially, interferon-α was administered as a single agent. Later on, it was complemented by vinblastine (8 mg/1 to 4 months) and by pamidronic acid (60 mg/1 to 3 months) in order to better control the lytic lesions. It is noteworthy that this patient continued to deteriorate neurologically even at the highest doses of interferon-α administered (6 × 10 6 IU X 5 times weekly). However, the addition of vinblastine to this regimen succeeded in stabilizing the patient clinically and allowed for a gradual decrease in the dosage of interferon-α to a maintenance dose of 6 × 10⁶ IU X 2 times weekly over a two year period. Three years after the diagnosis of ECD, a four-month trial of anakinra (100 mg/day) was attempted, mainly due to multifocal disease progression. However, this agent yielded unsatisfactory results. This attempt was followed by a five-month trial of cladribine (0.14 mg/kg/day for five consecutive days, every four weeks), a drug which yielded no apparent benefit to the patient and was very poorly tolerated. By this time, the patient's neurological symptoms, vis-à-vis her lingual and motor capabilities, had deteriorated greatly once again. She was markedly dysarthric and confined to a wheelchair. Consequently, a biopsy obtained from the peri-renal mass was attempted and found to contain ECD histiocytes which harbor the V600E BRAF mutation. After receiving proper counseling and signing an informed consent, treatment with vemurafenib (1,920 mg/day later tapered to 960 mg/day) was initiated with no less than a spectacular improvement. After two weeks of treatment the patient began to exhibit clinical improvement. Ultimately, following treatment with this agent, the patient regained her ability to walk distances of up to 500 meters and recovered her ability to speak fluently.

### Hip osteoarthritis: what the radiologist wants to know [^a21a7300]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common disease of the hip joint seen in adults. The diagnosis of OA is based on a combination of radiographic findings of joint degeneration and characteristic subjective symptoms. The lack of a radiographic consensus definition has resulted in a variation of the published incidences and prevalence of OA. The chronological sequence of degeneration includes the following plain radiographic findings: joint space narrowing, development of osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, and cyst formation. There are cases though, that plain radiographs show minor changes and the clinical suspicion of early disease can be confirmed with more sophisticated imaging methods, such as multi-detector computed tomography and MR imaging. The present article will review all the clinical information on the hip OA together with an updated radiological approach, with emphasis on the early depiction and the differential diagnosis of the disease.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^0a8c8483]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Management and Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Hip and/or the Knee — algorithm narrative describes a sequence beginning with diagnosis, initial assessment, core non-surgical planning, and iterative re-evaluation of pain or function. The pathway begins with "Patient diagnosed with OA of the hip and/or knee", then "Assess pain, severity, and functional limitations", followed by "Develop individualized treatment plan with core non-surgical management approaches (see Sidebar 1)". At each checkpoint the question is "Has the patient's pain or functional limitation improved on re-evaluation?" If yes, proceed to "Continue long-term management of OA and reassess annually or as needed". If no after the first re-evaluation, proceed to "Offer referral to physical therapy and/or combination pharmacotherapy (see Sidebars 2 and 3)". If no after the second re-evaluation, proceed to "Referral for additional physical therapy". If no after the third re-evaluation, proceed to "Obtain weight-bearing plain radiographs prior to referral for surgical consultation (see Appendix K)", which leads to "Refer for surgical consultation".

### Osteoarthritis: all types of trouble – defining OA in the genomic era [^104b4b35]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2011). Medium credibility.

OA is not a disease in short supply of phenotypic definitions. Indeed, numerous classification options complicate the design of genetic studies seeking associations within the obscuring array of heterogeneity. New recommendations offer some progress toward clarifying OA definitions, but much-needed guidelines are wanting.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^901a5cd0]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Acute Charcot arthropathy — clinical diagnosis relies on characteristic unilateral inflammatory changes in an insensate foot, frequent pain despite neuropathy, and awareness of ulceration that can mimic osteomyelitis. The initial diagnosis is often clinical, based on profound unilateral swelling, increased skin temperature, erythema, joint effusion, and bone resorption in an insensate foot; these characteristics in the presence of intact skin are often pathognomonic of acute neuroarthropathy. In more than 75% of cases, the patient will present with some degree of pain in an otherwise insensate extremity, and diagnosis can be complicated when patients first present with a concomitant ulceration, raising questions of potential contiguous osteomyelitis.

Case presentation

A 25-year-old man with no significant medical history presents to the office for a complaint of right ankle pain, worsening gait and increasing difficulty ambulating for the last 14 months following a sports-related injury. He attributed his symptoms to an amateur wrestling match during which he felt a sudden pain in the lateral side of the right ankle after his body rolled over his ankle while the foot was in complete dorsiflexion and inversion. The pain was described as sharp, constant and non-radiating, localised to the lateral side of the right ankle, and was rated as an 'eight' on a scale of 1–10. The next morning, the site of injury was swollen, minimally improved with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the patient required a cane for ambulating. The patient sought medical attention at a local outpatient clinic and had an X-ray of the right foot and ankle which demonstrated no fractures. The pain improved over the next few weeks with ice, mobility exercises and NSAIDs, but the patient noticed that his activities slowly decreased over the next 9 months. At first, the pain was only present during light outdoor jogs but over time had progressed to walking and only improved with rest. The quality of pain changed to a dull, 'gnawing' pain associated with reduction in range of motion in the ankle joint. The patient sought further medical therapy 7 months postinjury with intra-articular corticosteroids and weekly physical therapy, with minimal improvement. An MRI of the joint showed a 'cartilage defect with mild adjacent subchondral marrow edema in the far lateral aspect of the talar dome', as well as 'a small amount of tibiotalar joint fluid'. These findings were consistent with a 'talar-dome lesion' and signs of osteoarthritis. The patient was referred to a podiatrist for further recommendations based on the MRI findings.

### Diagnosing heel pain in adults [^7f6fa270]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Heel pain is a common condition in adults that may cause significant discomfort and disability. A variety of soft tissue, osseous, and systemic disorders can cause heel pain. Narrowing the differential diagnosis begins with a history and physical examination of the lower extremity to pinpoint the anatomic origin of the heel pain. The most common cause of heel pain in adults is plantar fasciitis. Patients with plantar fasciitis report increased heel pain with their first steps in the morning or when they stand up after prolonged sitting. Tenderness at the calcaneal tuberosity usually is apparent on examination and is increased with passive dorsiflexion of the toes. Tendonitis also may cause heel pain. Achilles tendonitis is associated with posterior heel pain. Bursae adjacent to the Achilles tendon insertion may become inflamed and cause pain. Calcaneal stress fractures are more likely to occur in athletes who participate in sports that require running and jumping. Patients with plantar heel pain accompanied by tingling, burning, or numbness may have tarsal tunnel syndrome. Heel pad atrophy may present with diffuse plantar heel pain, especially in patients who are older and obese. Less common causes of heel pain, which should be considered when symptoms are prolonged or unexplained, include osteomyelitis, bony abnormalities (such as calcaneal stress fracture), or tumor. Heel pain rarely is a presenting symptom in patients with systemic illnesses, but the latter may be a factor in persons with bilateral heel pain, pain in other joints, or known inflammatory arthritis conditions.
