## Question

treatment for rhinovirus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for rhinovirus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and natural history of rhinovirus. Then, I should verify the current standard of care and what high-quality guidelines say. Next, I will examine antiviral therapies that have been tested, including pleconaril and interferon-based approaches. After that, I need to review immunomodulatory strategies, especially in asthma and COPD. I will then assess adjunctive and preventive measures, including hand hygiene, probiotics, and zinc. Finally, I should identify special populations and unmet needs, and synthesize a practical, evidence-based algorithm for clinicians, making sure I double-check each claim against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and natural history so I don't jump to conclusions. Rhinovirus is the most common cause of acute upper respiratory infections, with symptoms typically peaking at 2–3 days and resolving within about a week, though a quarter last longer, and it can precipitate lower respiratory complications in susceptible hosts, including asthma and COPD exacerbations and even pneumonia in high-risk groups, so I need to keep severity and host factors front and center when recommending therapy [^115q3tXt] [^11784iaW] [^114ybevr].

> I should confirm the current standard of care before discussing experimental options. Wait, let me verify guideline-aligned management: for otherwise healthy patients, supportive care remains the cornerstone — analgesics/antipyretics, hydration, rest, and targeted symptom relief — while antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated viral URIs and should be avoided to limit resistance and harm. This is consistent with primary care guidance and broader stewardship principles [^1151CgAt] [^112WnXrG].

> Next, I will examine antiviral therapies, but I need to be careful not to overstate benefits. Pleconaril, a capsid-binding inhibitor, shortened illness by about one day and reduced viral titers in randomized trials, yet it was not approved due to CYP3A interactions and modest effect size; I initially thought it might be available off-label, but hold on, I should verify — no, it is not licensed for clinical use, so it remains investigational despite those signals [^112mKLdf] [^112puGvh]. Interferon-alpha delivered intranasally in combination with antihistamine and ibuprofen reduced symptom scores and viral load in experimental infection, but translation to natural colds is uncertain and tolerability with intranasal interferon remains a concern, so I should not generalize this to routine care yet [^114RUbbL]. Inhaled interferon-beta improved peak flow recovery and reduced need for additional treatment in a subset of difficult-to-treat asthmatics during viral colds, though the primary endpoint was not met; this suggests a niche role rather than broad applicability pending larger trials [^111XyArb].

> I will now examine immunomodulatory strategies in asthma, since that's where the clinical yield may be greatest. Omalizumab reduced the frequency and duration of rhinovirus illnesses and lowered peak viral shedding in children with allergic asthma during the fall viral season; this aligns with the concept that IgE-mediated pathways and type 2 inflammation impair antiviral immunity, so blocking IgE can restore host defenses during viral triggers, which I should emphasize as disease-modifying prevention rather than acute treatment [^116h31Qx] [^113JhFnZ]. But wait, what about type 2–targeted small molecules? CRTH2 antagonism with timapiprant did not attenuate experimental rhinovirus-induced asthma symptoms or pathophysiology in a controlled challenge study, despite mechanistic plausibility, so I should caution against assuming class benefit here [^113fFeQp]. Systemic corticosteroids during acute asthma exacerbations are standard, and observational pediatric data suggest longer steroid courses (6–8 vs 3–5 days) after HRV exacerbations associate with better post-exacerbation lung function, but I need to note confounding and the absence of randomized confirmation before recommending routine prolongation [^115yf178].

> Let me consider COPD, where viral exacerbations are common and mechanistically relevant. Experimental rhinovirus infection in COPD patients worsens symptoms and airflow, supporting a causal role and the rationale for antiviral strategies. However, no licensed antiviral exists for rhinovirus in COPD, so management remains supportive with bronchodilators and systemic steroids as indicated, while research into antiviral prophylaxis or early therapy is ongoing but not yet practice-changing [^1148DRNe] [^114g3cge].

> I should double-check adjunctive and preventive measures that patients often ask about. Hand hygiene is sensible, but a randomized trial of a citric/malic acid hand disinfectant did not reduce rhinovirus infection or colds in a natural setting, so I should not overpromise on antiseptic hand gels for prevention [^115vah2f]. Probiotics such as Bifidobacterium lactis Bl-04 showed no benefit in a well-controlled rhinovirus challenge study, despite earlier signals, so routine probiotic use for cold prevention or treatment is not supported here [^112grETp]. Zinc has inconsistent and largely negative results in rigorously conducted studies, including lack of benefit for intranasal zinc gluconate in experimental infection, so I should advise against zinc for colds outside of trials [^116zAUg4]. Iota-carrageenan nasal spray has biologic plausibility for blocking viral attachment and showed trends in early treatment trials, but effects are modest and heterogeneous; given low risk, it may be reasonable for some patients, yet I should frame it as unproven and not a substitute for standard care [^1145xTYi] [^1171ujF7].

> Now, I need to ensure I address special populations and unmet needs. In immunocompromised hosts, including HCT recipients, progression from upper to lower tract disease carries high morbidity; ribavirin is sometimes used off-label for noninfluenza respiratory viruses, but evidence for rhinovirus is limited and quality low, so decisions should be individualized and ideally made in consultation with infectious diseases specialists, and I should be explicit about the uncertainty [^117BVisL]. In infants and young children, rhinovirus causes a large share of acute respiratory illnesses and antibiotic exposure, underscoring the need for judicious prescribing and supportive care pathways; bronchiolitis care remains supportive, with emerging evidence that phenotypes may respond differently, but no rhinovirus-specific therapy is available in pediatrics yet [^113DT8V1] [^116EtQZz]. In older adults and those with cardiorespiratory comorbidity, rhinovirus is increasingly recognized as a driver of severe lower respiratory disease, so I should maintain a low threshold to evaluate for complications and escalate care as needed [^114ybevr].

> Hold on, I should verify the status of vaccines and truly targeted antivirals before concluding. There are no licensed rhinovirus vaccines, largely due to the extraordinary serotype diversity and receptor heterogeneity, and no approved rhinovirus-specific antivirals, though capsid binders, protease inhibitors, and receptor-targeted strategies remain under investigation; this remains a major unmet medical need and justifies continued research but not off-label clinical use at this time [^112TruRN] [^113C35pB].

> Let me synthesize a practical, evidence-based approach and make sure I haven't missed anything critical. For otherwise healthy patients, prioritize education on the self-limited nature of illness, hydration, rest, and targeted symptom control with analgesics, nasal decongestants, and ipratropium for troublesome rhinorrhea or cough; avoid antibiotics unless bacterial complications are suspected, and set expectations that most colds resolve within a week [^1151CgAt]. For patients with asthma, optimize controller therapy and consider omalizumab in those with allergic phenotypes to reduce viral-triggered exacerbations; during acute viral colds, intensify monitoring and consider early escalation of bronchodilators and systemic steroids if exacerbation risk is high, recognizing that evidence for interferon-beta is suggestive but not definitive for broad use [^116Vjt2M] [^116h31Qx] [^111XyArb]. For COPD, manage exacerbations per standard pathways with bronchodilators and systemic steroids, and enroll patients in clinical trials when available to advance antiviral strategies [^114g3cge]. Across all settings, avoid unproven supplements like routine zinc or echinacea, and counsel on hand hygiene without over-reliance on antiseptic gels for rhinovirus prevention [^116zAUg4] [^112CZF5h] [^115vah2f].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. There is no licensed antiviral or vaccine for rhinovirus. Management is supportive, with the most compelling disease-specific advance being anti-IgE therapy to reduce susceptibility and severity of rhinovirus illnesses in allergic asthma, while investigational antivirals and immunomodulators require larger, definitive trials before routine adoption. I need to emphasize this limitation clearly to avoid therapeutic overreach [^112puGvh] [^116h31Qx] [^113C35pB].

There is **no approved antiviral therapy** for rhinovirus; management is supportive, with analgesics, antipyretics, and decongestants for symptom relief [^1151CgAt]. Antibiotics are not indicated unless bacterial co-infection is suspected [^112WnXrG]. In patients with asthma or COPD, optimize chronic therapy and use bronchodilators and corticosteroids as indicated for exacerbations [^111NVk2M] [^114g3cge]. Experimental antivirals (e.g. pleconaril, vapendavir) and interferon-beta have shown limited or no clinical benefit and are not approved [^113C35pB] [^111XyArb]. Prevention relies on hand hygiene and avoiding close contact; no vaccine exists [^1151CgAt] [^112TruRN].

---

## Symptomatic treatment

Symptomatic care is the **mainstay of therapy**, aiming to relieve discomfort while the immune system clears the virus:

- **Analgesics and antipyretics**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen reduce fever, headache, and body aches [^1151CgAt].

- **Nasal decongestants**: Short-term use of topical decongestants (e.g. oxymetazoline) or oral antihistamines can relieve nasal congestion and rhinorrhea [^1151CgAt].

- **Cough management**: Dextromethorphan or codeine-containing products may reduce cough frequency, though efficacy is limited and side effects (sedation, constipation) can occur [^113KthhB].

- **Hydration and rest**: Adequate fluid intake and rest support recovery and symptom control [^notfound].

---

## Management of complications

Rhinovirus can exacerbate underlying respiratory conditions, notably asthma and COPD; **management should be tailored**:

- **Asthma exacerbations**: Optimize inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and add short-acting bronchodilators; systemic corticosteroids are indicated for moderate-to-severe exacerbations [^notfound].

- **COPD exacerbations**: Use bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids as indicated; antibiotics only if bacterial infection is suspected [^114g3cge].

- **Secondary bacterial infections**: Antibiotics are reserved for documented bacterial co-infection (e.g. acute bacterial sinusitis, otitis media) [^112WnXrG].

---

## Experimental and investigational therapies

Several antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies have been studied, but none are approved for rhinovirus:

| **Therapy** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical trial results** | **Status** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Pleconaril | Capsid-binding inhibitor | Reduced illness duration by ~1 day in adults; not approved due to CYP3A interactions | Not approved [^113C35pB] |
| Vapendavir | Capsid-binding inhibitor | Reduced viral load in challenge studies; no significant symptom benefit | Not approved [^113C35pB] |
| Interferon-beta | Antiviral cytokine | Enhanced antiviral responses; limited clinical benefit | Not approved [^113C35pB] |
| Omalizumab | Anti-IgE antibody | Reduced RV illnesses and shedding in allergic asthma | Not approved for RV [^114aLHnq] |

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention focuses on reducing transmission through **hand hygiene** — frequent handwashing with soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizers — and **avoidance of close contact** with symptomatic individuals. No vaccine is available, largely due to the high number of rhinovirus serotypes [^113C35pB].

---

## Special populations

Certain populations require **tailored management**:

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Supportive care remains primary; antivirals (e.g. ribavirin) may be considered case-by-case, though evidence is limited [^117BVisL].

- **Pediatric patients**: Supportive care is mainstay; avoid aspirin due to Reye syndrome risk; monitor for secondary bacterial infections [^1151CgAt].

- **Elderly patients**: Monitor closely for complications; consider early intervention for exacerbations [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no approved antiviral therapy** for rhinovirus; management is supportive, with symptom control and complication prevention. Antibiotics are not indicated without bacterial co-infection. Experimental therapies remain investigational, and prevention relies on hygiene and avoidance of close contact.

### Effect ofspp. Bl-04 on rhinovirus-induced colds: a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center, phase II trial in healthy volunteers [^112grETp]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study using the RV challenge model found no effect of oral administration of Bl-04 on RV infection or illness. These results are similar to the outcome of a previous study using the challenge model. However, in contrast to the results of our previous study, we also found no substantial evidence of an effect of probiotic administration on the innate inflammatory response in the nose or on virus shedding. Similarly, an exploratory analysis in our previous study found evidence of an interaction between the nasal microbiome and clinical, virologic and immunologic responses to the virus infection that were not fully replicated in the current study.

The challenge model has been used for decades for the study of pathogenesis and treatment of viral respiratory infection in general and RV infection in particular and has proven to be a sensitive tool for detecting the effect of various treatments and a reliable predictor of the results in subsequent field trials. The challenge model is limited by the fact that the route of inoculation is artificial and only a single serotype of rhinovirus is tested. Although a previous field trial found a modest effect of Bl-04 on the incidence of viral respiratory illness, that study did not characterize the infection status of the ill subjects. Previous experience with the challenge model suggests that it is unlikely that an effect would be found in a field trial directed at rhinovirus infections and illness.

Many clinical trials have explored the effect of probiotics on URTI. However, most clinical trials have been conducted in children and the low number of studies in adults have made systematic comparison challenging. Although some of these trials have reported beneficial effects, the results have been inconsistent. Many of the studies have not included viral diagnostics and the reported effects, whether frequency of illness, duration of illness, or severity of illness vary from study-to-study. Furthermore, there is little information about probiotic strain-specific effects, optimal dose, and potential mechanisms of action. Reviews of these studies have concluded that the usefulness of probiotics in viral upper respiratory disease is uncertain and more studies are needed to clarify the effectiveness of probiotics in healthy adults. Our study was designed to address some of the deficiencies in the earlier studies by using a well-defined and well-controlled model involving documented infection with single pathogen and an adequate sample size to detect a meaningful effect. The study also included extensive analysis by virologic, immunologic, transcriptomic, and microbiomic assays to assess the clinical and biologic effects of probiotic administration and interaction with viral infection.

### Hidden in plain sight: the impact of human rhinovirus infection in adults [^114ybevr]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

HRV is not merely the ubiquitous agent of the common cold; it is a predominant pathogen in adults presenting with ARI in diverse healthcare settings — from primary care to intensive care units (Fig. 3). This pathogen significantly influences morbidity, mortality, and hospital stay duration across a wide spectrum of adult populations. Elderly, immunocompromised, and individuals with cardiorespiratory comorbidities are particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes. HRV transmission through aerosolisation contributes to its persistence and prevalence throughout the year. The dogma that HRV infection is confined to mild upper respiratory infections should be challenged, as HRV is frequently implicated in severe lower respiratory conditions, even in immunocompetent adults, including pneumonia and exacerbations of asthma and COPD.

Fig. 3
Impact of rhinovirus infection in adults. HRV is a major global pathogen and is detected throughout the year. Upper respiratory manifestations, including the common cold, are the most common manifestation and while self-limiting are associated with a considerable societal cost. It is now increasingly apparent that HRV is a driver of severe lower respiratory manifestations in adults, including exacerbations of airway disease and pneumonia, on a scale comparable to that of other respiratory viruses. The severity of infection is determined by the complex interaction of host factors such as age, multimorbidity and immune dysfunction alongside other factors such as viral characteristics and the presence of bacterial co-infection. There is an urgent need for novel treatment options, as options currently available are merely supportive in nature

Given its extensive impact, it is important to improve our understanding of HRV epidemiology, comparable to SARS-CoV-2, to enhance our understanding of the strain-specific severity of infections. More prospective observational studies and continuous surveillance are needed, particularly among community care homes and among hospitalised adults. This approach would not only facilitate the identification of high-risk HRV strains to guide vaccine development but also aid in precisely determining factors that influence the severity of infections and host‒pathogen interactions.

Such data are essential for developing effective intervention strategies, including targeted antiviral therapies and vaccines. Given the scale of HRV infection, the use of digital tools to assist with the design of future care pathways and clinical trials may be valuable. Moreover, improving methods for detecting bacterial coinfection is critical, as they could guide appropriate antibiotic prescriptions and potentially reduce the burden of severe infections.

### What is the role of respiratory viruses in community-acquired pneumonia? what is the best therapy for influenza and other viral causes of community-acquired pneumonia? [^116vXYfv]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Respiratory viruses have long been appreciated as a cause of community acquired pneumonia (CAP), particularly among children, people with serious medical comorbidities, and military recruits. They are increasingly recognized as a cause of CAP among adults. Polymerase chain reaction-based testing has allowed detection of newer agents and improved the ability to detect such viral infections as influenza virus and rhinovirus. Coinfection with viruses and bacteria is common and it remains challenging to determine which patients have only viral infection as the cause of CAP. Better ways to diagnose viral CAP and to integrate detection into management, and better treatment options for noninfluenza respiratory viral infections are needed.

### Clinical significance and pathogenesis of viral respiratory infections [^115q3tXt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Viral respiratory tract infections, also known as colds, are the most common infection in humans. The majority of these infections are caused by rhinoviruses. Rhinovirus deposition in the nose or the eye initiates infection. The virus attaches to the host cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) receptors in the back of the throat. Subsequent viral replication triggers the release of inflammatory mediators and activation of neurogenic pathways, which lead to symptoms. Symptoms occur within 10 to 16 hours after virus entry into the nose and peak on days 2 to 3 of infection. Symptom duration is typically 1 week, although 25% of cases last longer. Understanding the chronology of these events is important in the timing of treatment. Because of the rapidity of symptom onset, early treatment is the key to reducing viral replication and illness. Also, early treatment may reduce the risk of transmission.

### Diagnosis and treatment of rhinovirus respiratory infections [^112puGvh]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Acute upper viral respiratory infection (VRI) is the number one cause of illness for which patients seek medical care in the United States. Rhinoviruses, members of the family Picornaviridae, are the causative pathogens in more than half of VRIs, and they are associated with acute exacerbations of respiratory disease, including asthma, sinusitis, otitis media, and COPD. Owing to the lack of commercial availability of rapid and cost-effective laboratory tests to confirm the presence of VRI, the diagnosis is most commonly made empirically, based on patient history and physical examination. Currently, no antiviral agents that are active against picornaviruses are available for clinical use. Antimicrobial agents, frequently prescribed for VRIs, are not active against viruses, and their inappropriate and widespread use has contributed to an increase in antimicrobial resistance among bacteria commonly involved in respiratory tract infections. Several newer antiviral agents are being evaluated for treatment of VRIs. Although a variety of mechanisms and agents have been tested, few have shown significant clinical benefit in human trials. The most advanced antiviral agent in clinical trials is pleconaril, a novel viral capsid-binding inhibitor with potent and highly specific in vitro activity against the majority of serotypes of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Clinical trials of pleconaril for the treatment of VRIs have been conducted, and the role of pleconaril in patients with chronic lung disease is being evaluated.

### How rhinovirus infections cause exacerbations of asthma [^117QucVX]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Rhinovirus (RV) infections are closely linked to exacerbations of asthma, and yet most RV infections of patients with asthma cause only upper respiratory symptoms. These findings suggest that RV and other viral infections contribute to the causation of acute exacerbations of asthma, but that additional cofactors are generally required. In fact, factors related to the host, virus, and environment have been identified that affect the severity of RV infections, and propensity to develop lower respiratory tract symptoms. This review will discuss these factors and how their effects may act alone or in combination to increase the probability of RV-induced exacerbations of asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116Vjt2M]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Prevention and comorbidities — Updates include more information about vaccinations against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), pneumococcus and pertussis and interventions to reduce RSV infections in infants; information about treatment outcomes in patients with both asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis has been updated; and a new section on prevention of occupational asthma has been added in primary prevention.

### Efficacy and safety of iota-carrageenan nasal spray versus placebo in early treatment of the common cold in adults: the ICICC trial [^1145xTYi]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is caused by a variety of respiratory viruses, such as human rhinoviruses (HRV), coronaviruses, human enteroviruses (HEV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, or influenza viruses. Rhinoviruses are the most common cause of respiratory tract infections in individuals of all ages. In adults, rhinoviruses cause approximately 50% of common colds and up to 90% of colds during the autumn epidemic season. Common colds are frequent illnesses in both children and adults; on average, adults report 2.5 episodes per year. It has been estimated that the total economic impact of non–influenza-related viral upper respiratory tract infections approaches $40 billion annually, and such infections can result in serious and even life-threatening sequelae in patients with underlying illnesses such as asthma, COPD or immune compromise. With the exception of influenza and RSV, there are no vaccinations or anti-viral medicinal products available for treatment of infection with the viruses that cause the common cold.

Iota-carrageenan (I-C) — a sulfated polysaccharide found in some species of red seaweed (Chondrus crispus) — has demonstrated antiviral activity against respiratory viruses in cell culture and in animal models. The I-C polymer seems to bind directly to viruses, preventing viral attachment to host cells. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of I-C against several viruses such as HRV and influenza A. In vitro tests have established that I-C does not penetrate freshly excised bovine nasal mucosa, and therefore is not absorbed systemically (data on file, Marinomed Biotechnology GmbH). Carrageenan is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food and topical applications. Because the primary site of infection and replication of most cold-causing viruses is the nasal mucosa, it was speculated that early and targeted treatment of the nasal mucosa with I-C may block viral entry at the level of the respiratory mucosa, and interfere locally with the propagation of viral replication.

### Respiratory illness caused by picornavirus infection: a review of clinical outcomes [^114EoaF8]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory infections result from invasion of the respiratory tract, mainly by viruses, and are the leading cause of acute morbidity in individuals of all ages worldwide. During peak season, picornaviruses cause 82% of all episodes of acute nasopharyngitis (the common cold), the most frequent manifestation of acute respiratory infection, and produce more restriction of activity and physician consultations annually than any other viral or bacterial source of respiratory illness.

Objective

This article reviews the clinical impact and outcomes of picornavirus-induced respiratory infections in specific populations at risk for complications. It also discusses the potential economic impact of the morbidity associated with picornavirus-induced respiratory infection.

Methods

Relevant literature was identified through searches of MEDLINE, OVID, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Lexis-Nexis. The search terms used were picornavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, viral respiratory infection, upper respiratory infection, disease burden, economic, cost, complications, asthma, COPD, immunocompromised, elderly otitis media, and sinusitis. Additional publications were identified from the reference lists of the retrieved articles.

Conclusions

Based on the clinical literature, picornavirus infections are associated with severe morbidity as well as considerable economic and societal costs. Future research should focus on identifying patterns of illness and the costs associated with management of these infections. New treatments should be assessed not only in terms of their ability to produce the desired clinical outcome, but also in terms of their ability to reduce the burden of disease, decrease health care costs, and improve productivity.

### An evaluation of echinacea angustifolia in experimental rhinovirus infections [^112CZF5h]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Echinacea has been widely used as an herbal remedy for the common cold, but efficacy studies have produced conflicting results, and there are a variety of echinacea products on the market with different phytochemical compositions. We evaluated the effect of chemically defined extracts from Echinacea angustifolia roots on rhinovirus infection.

Methods

Three preparations of echinacea, with distinct phytochemical profiles, were produced by extraction from E. angustifolia roots with supercritical carbon dioxide, 60 percent ethanol, or 20 percent ethanol. A total of 437 volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either prophylaxis (beginning seven days before the virus challenge) or treatment (beginning at the time of the challenge) either with one of these preparations or with placebo. The results for 399 volunteers who were challenged with rhinovirus type 39 and observed in a sequestered setting for five days were included in the data analysis.

Results

There were no statistically significant effects of the three echinacea extracts on rates of infection or severity of symptoms. Similarly, there were no significant effects of treatment on the volume of nasal secretions, on polymorphonuclear leukocyte or interleukin-8 concentrations in nasal-lavage specimens, or on quantitative-virus titer.

Conclusions

The results of this study indicate that extracts of E. angustifolia root, either alone or in combination, do not have clinically significant effects on infection with a rhinovirus or on the clinical illness that results from it.

Infection-mediated traits

Viral infections

Viral infections such as rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus have been associated with early-onset asthma development, and they are among the leading causes of acute asthma exacerbations. This is supported by early reports of a reduction in asthma exacerbations during the COVID-19 pandemic, as social distancing and hygiene measures reduced viral spread through populations. Although the mechanisms driving viral-exacerbated asthma likely vary depending on the infection and presence of NK cells, there may be a subgroup of patients who are more susceptible to virus-induced exacerbations; these patients experience more exacerbations, perhaps on account of interactions between the IgE-mediated allergen response and the viral infection. In a study of 183 patients with asthma who were 6 to 17 years old, an increase in both total IgE levels and allergen-specific IgE levels was associated with an increase in the severity of RV-triggered asthma exacerbations. Separately, 2 parallel studies demonstrated that adults with both asthma and high levels of total serum IgE had worse lower respiratory tract symptoms, lower lung function, and increased eosinophil levels compared with healthy participants 2 to 3 days after RV infection. The same studies demonstrated that anti-IgE treatment with omalizumab improved lung function and asthma control during the first 4 days of infection in adult patients with asthma versus in those who received placebo. Other studies have indicated that omalizumab has a positive impact on RV-induced exacerbations in children. In 1 study, omalizumab was shown to reduce seasonal exacerbations in children, adolescents, and young adults during the autumn (a time associated with viral infection and increased allergen levels). In a more recent study, when compared with standard asthma care, add-on omalizumab was associated with a decrease in duration of RV infections, viral shedding, and the risk of RV illnesses in children with allergic asthma. These results further support the existence of an association between allergic IgE-mediated asthma and viral-exacerbated asthma in some patients, who may therefore be at increased risk of exacerbations than their counterparts without allergy.

There is also potential to treat viral-induced asthma by boosting antiviral immunity. Studies have shown that patients with asthma are susceptible to viral infection due to deficiencies in interferon production. In a randomized study of 147 patients with asthma, treatment with IFN-β ameliorated airway response to viral infection and enhanced morning peak expiratory flow recovery. These studies suggest a possible therapeutic benefit of IFN-β for targeting virus-induced asthma, and they support the need for further investigation.

### Effect of CRTH2 antagonism on the response to experimental rhinovirus infection in asthma: a pilot randomised controlled trial [^114BYkUb]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting 240–300 million people worldwide with ~49 million deaths in 2017. Most of the morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs associated with asthma are due to acute increases in symptomatology called exacerbations, episodes commonly triggered by respiratory viruses, particularly rhinoviruses (RVs). Despite treatment, almost half of patients with asthma continue to experience exacerbations. These are often associated with an acute rise in 'type 2' inflammation, as demonstrated by increases in the type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)−4, IL-5 and IL-13 in airways samples, which correlate with symptom severity. Type 2 inflammation has been shown to impair antiviral immunity, thus suppressing type 2 inflammation may confer beneficial effects on host immunity and exacerbation susceptibility. Recent clinical trial and real-world data confirm that targeting type 2 inflammatory pathways is effective in reducing asthma exacerbations.

### Human rhinovirus infection blocks severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 replication within the respiratory epithelium: implications for COVID-19 epidemiology [^116aQerb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Respiratory explants and ALI-cultures of human airway epithelium provide a highly controlled cellular environment that mimics to a considerable extent the natural site of infection and thus enables us to model the impact of virus tropism and innate immune responses on within-host infection dynamics. Here we showed that HRV infection impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread within the human respiratory epithelium. Our study shows that HRV exerts an indirect negative interaction, with a dominant inhibitory phenotype against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, we showed that HRV triggers an IFN response that makes most cells nonpermissive to SARS-Cov-2 infection, while HRV is unaffected by the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to the IFN response is illustrated by the number of genes present in its genome that are devoted to overcome the innate immune response (reviewed in).

We also showed that HRV hampers SARS-CoV-2 replication, even when the former was inoculated 24 hours after SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our results demonstrate that viral interference interactions induced by HRV infection can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in the respiratory epithelium and builds on previous epidemiological, modeling, and experimental work on virus-virus interactions. Future studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of viral interference could enable us to wield virus-virus interactions to our advantage and use them as control strategies or therapeutic measures. For example, screening for HRV-induced genes with anti–SARS-CoV-2 activity might constitute a future research avenue to develop antiviral therapies against coronaviruses.

Recently, Wu et al showed that the IFN response triggered by HRV also interferes with IAV replication. Our combined studies suggest that viruses that stimulate an IFN response in the respiratory epithelium might interfere with SARS-CoV-2 and IAVs. These findings have important implications, as they suggest that immune-mediated effects induced by mild, common cold virus infections, including HRV, might confer some level of protection against SARS-CoV-2, potentially attenuating the severity of COVID-19. Given the high transmissibility and prevalence of HRV, this effect might have an impact on the disease burden caused by COVID-19 at the population scale, with expected heterogeneities depending on HRV prevalence among different age groups. For example, this interference effect can contribute to differences in SARS-CoV-2 transmission between school-aged children (with high prevalence of HRV) and adult populations (with comparatively lower HRV prevalence).

Rhinovirus infections can cause wheezing illnesses in all age groups. In preschool children, rhinovirus infections frequently initiate acute wheezing illnesses. Children who wheeze with rhinoviruses are at increased risk to go on to develop asthma. Once asthma is established, rhinovirus infections are potent triggers for acute airway obstruction and exacerbations in children and adults. Paradoxically, for most individuals, rhinovirus infections commonly cause cold symptoms with little or no involvement of the lower airways. This paradox has led investigators to identify specific risk factors and mechanisms for rhinovirus wheezing, and this review will outline progress in 3 main areas. First, the 3 species of rhinoviruses have different patterns of infection and virulence. Second, personal factors such as lung function and immunity influence lower respiratory outcomes of rhinovirus infection. The mucosal immune response is critical, and the quality of the interferon response and allergic inflammation interacts to determine the risk for rhinovirus wheezing. Finally, rhinovirus infections can promote pathogen-dominated airway microbiota that increase the risk for wheezing. Although specific antivirals for rhinovirus are still not available, identifying risk factors for wheezing illnesses has provided several other potential targets and strategies for reducing the risk of rhinovirus-induced wheezing and exacerbations of asthma.

### How does rhinovirus cause the common cold cough? [^113KthhB]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary

A postviral cough is generally unresponsive to conventional pharmacological intervention, but has shown limited responsiveness to the anticholinergic drug, tiotropium, which leaves a major hole in our therapeutic armamentarium. Currently, treatment merely consists of dampening the inflammatory response with the use of antiinflammatories (such as naproxen), and cough suppressants (codeine-containing products and dextromethorphan), in the hope of reducing the frequency, severity and transmission of cough. Opiates, although commonly prescribed, are not generally recommended for viral cough due to their poor efficacy and significant adverse effect profile.

The multiple mechanisms described above provide a confusing and inter-related 'soup' of potential therapeutic targets, dissecting which, are the key players involved in this common affliction that will be challenging. We suggest that modulation of the afferent neuronal hypersensitivity will provide the most fruitful target in what is essentially a benign and self-limiting disease. Other strategies, such as systemic immune modulation, run the risk of generating unforeseen off-target effects. The rewards for understanding the mechanism of viral-induced cough will have enormous impact on human morbidity.

### Toward personalization of asthma treatment according to trigger factors [^111muSDg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a severe and chronic disabling disease affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. Although in the past few drugs for the treatment of asthma were available, new treatment options are currently emerging, which appear to be highly effective in certain subgroups of patients. Accordingly, there is a need for biomarkers that allow selection of patients for refined and personalized treatment strategies. Recently, serological chip tests based on microarrayed allergen molecules and peptides derived from the most common rhinovirus strains have been developed, which may discriminate 2 of the most common forms of asthma, that is, allergen- and virus-triggered asthma. In this perspective, we argue that classification of patients with asthma according to these common trigger factors may open new possibilities for personalized management of asthma.

### Role of viral infections, atopy and antiviral immunity in the etiology of wheezing exacerbations among children and young adults [^111m2c7E]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

At least 101 serotypes of rhinoviruses have been identified. Rhinoviruses have often been associated with trivial upper respiratory infections but more recent evidence suggests that they play a significant role in the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations.

Methods

The impact of rhinoviruses as a cause of respiratory morbidity in infancy and the role of rhinoviruses in causing asthma exacerbations in the children and adult population is discussed. Past and current experimental and epidemiologic evidence was assessed to suggest a causal role rather than just an association. Mechanism of susceptibility to virus infection in asthmatics were discussed, as were data indicating important interactions between allergic sensitization and rhinovirus infections in risk of asthma exacerbations.

Results

Asthmatic individuals have increased severity and duration of lower airway symptoms and greater declines in lung function upon infection with rhinovirus, suggesting greater susceptibility to rhinovirus infection because of impaired antiviral immunity. Early virus-induced apoptosis, which aborts virus replication, was impaired in asthmatics. Treating allergic airway inflammation may reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms triggered by rhinoviruses.

Conclusions

The evidence in children and young adults suggests that atopy and allergic inflammation in the airways may be critical determinants of an adverse response to rhinovirus. Increased awareness of the spectrum of age groups that are affected by rhinoviruses is needed to encourage the development of new treatments and strategies that may be helpful in reducing the frequency and severity of symptoms triggered by rhinoviruses.

### Understanding the asthmatic response to an experimental rhinovirus infection: exploring the effects of blocking IgE [^112Nmv5Q]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhinovirus frequently causes asthma exacerbations among children and young adults who are allergic. The interaction between allergen and rhinovirus-induced symptoms and inflammation over time is unclear.

Objective

Our aim was to compare the response to an experimental inoculation with rhinovirus-16 in allergic asthmatics with the response in healthy controls and to evaluate the effects of administrating omalizumab before and during the infection.

Methods

Two clinical trials were run in parallel. In one of these trials, the response to an experimental inoculation with rhinovirus-16 among asthmatics with high levels of total IgE was compared to the response in healthy controls. The other trial compared the effects of administering omalizumab versus placebo to asthmatics in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled investigation. The primary outcome for both trials compared lower respiratory tract symptoms (LRTSs) between study groups over the first 4 days of infection.

Results

Frequent comparisons of symptoms, lung function, and blood eosinophil counts revealed differences that were more pronounced among allergic asthmatics than among controls by days 2 and 3 after virus inoculation. Additionally, an augmentation of upper respiratory tract symptom scores and LRTS scores occurred among the atopic asthmatics versus the controls during the resolution of symptoms (P < .01 for upper respiratory symptom tract scores and P < .001 for LRTS scores). The beneficial effects of administering omalizumab on reducing LRTSs and improving lung function were strongest over the first 4 days.

Conclusions

LRTSs and blood eosinophil counts were augmented and lung function was reduced among allergic asthmatics early after rhinovirus inoculation but increased late in the infection during symptom resolution. The effect of administering omalizumab on the response to rhinovirus was most pronounced during the early/innate phase of the infection.

### Viral infections and wheezing in preschool children [^116vLmPk]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Wheezing is common in childhood, although only a small percentage of these children develop asthma. The child's wheezing phenotype and asthma predictive indices help predict the likelihood of a future asthma diagnosis. Viral infections are common in childhood with most wheezing episodes due to respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus. Many treatment options exist for wheezing children including both those who wheeze persistently and those who wheeze intermittently due to viral infections.

### A narrative review and expert opinion on immunity-targeted approaches in the management of viral upper respiratory tract infections [^114cuM7R]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations of current vaccination strategies for upper respiratory tract infections

While vaccination is a cornerstone in preventing URTIs, several limitations hinder its comprehensive efficacy. One significant constraint is the limited induction of mucosal immunity by traditional intramuscular vaccines. These vaccines primarily stimulate systemic immune responses but may not elicit robust immunity at mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa, which are primary entry points for respiratory pathogens. This limitation can result in reduced effectiveness in preventing initial infection and transmission of respiratory viruses. Additionally, the specificity of vaccines to pathogens means they may not protect against the wide array of viruses responsible for URTIs. For instance, while vaccines exist for influenza and SARS-CoV-2, there are currently no approved vaccines for common URTI-causing viruses like rhinoviruses and certain coronaviruses. This gap leaves individuals susceptible to infections from these prevalent pathogens. Furthermore, vaccine efficacy can be compromised in certain populations. Elderly individuals and those with immunocompromising conditions often exhibit diminished immune responses to vaccination, leading to lower levels of protection. This is particularly concerning given that these groups are at higher risk for severe outcomes from URTIs. These limitations underscore the need for complementary strategies to enhance protection against URTIs.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment of URTIs are vital components that have a significant impact on the evolution of diseases and overall health conditions in patients of all age groups. Receiving an immunity enhancer with an antiviral effect early has the potential to not only reduce the risk of recurrence and complications, but also help reduce antibiotic consumption. Any reasonable solution that can result in a reduction in antibiotic consumption among the population is considered favorable. To tackle this growing resistance, it is vital to use antibiotics appropriately at the necessary times, including the use of suitable dose intervals and for the relevant duration.

Therapeutic approaches targeted at improving and modulating immunity are appropriate not only for the effective treatment of persisting infections of the upper respiratory tract but also for the prevention of recurrence and upcoming complications. The use of antibiotics in an irrational manner not only leads to antibiotic resistance but may also have negative and even occasionally irreversible effects on the intestinal microbiota. Maintaining and protecting the intestinal microbiota and avoiding its alteration are crucial steps toward effective URTI treatment.

### Corticosteroids for the common cold [^113WJypp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is a frequent illness, which, although benign and self-limiting, results in many consultations to primary care and considerable loss of school or work days. Current symptomatic treatments have limited benefit. Corticosteroids are an effective treatment in other upper respiratory tract infections and their anti-inflammatory effects may also be beneficial in the common cold.

Objectives

To compare corticosteroids versus usual care for the common cold on clinical response rates in children and adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2012, Issue 5 which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE) 2012, Issue 4 and the NHS Health Economics Database 2012, Issue 5; MEDLINE (1948 to May week 2, 2012) and EMBASE (January 2010 to May 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, controlled trials comparing corticosteroids to placebo or to standard clinical management.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We were unable to perform meta-analysis and instead analysed results using narrative description of the available evidence.

Main Results

We included two trials (253 participants). Both compared intranasal corticosteroids to placebo; no trials studied oral corticosteroids. No benefit of intranasal corticosteroids was demonstrated for duration or severity of symptoms. In one trial of 54 participants, the number of symptomatic days was 10.3 in the placebo group, compared to 10.7 in those using intranasal corticosteroids (P = 0.72). A second trial of 199 participants reported no significant differences in duration of symptoms. There were no differences reported in terms of: adverse events; complications (one case of sinusitis, one case of acute otitis media, both in corticosteroid groups); presence of rhinovirus in nasal aspirates; or treatment for secondary infections. Neither trial reported our primary outcome measure of percentage of participants with resolution at different time points. A lack of comparable outcome measures meant we were unable to combine the data.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not support the use of intranasal corticosteroids for symptomatic relief from the common cold. However, there were only two trials and limited statistical power. Further large randomised placebo-controlled trials in adults and children are required to answer this question.

### Treatment of the common cold [^1151CgAt]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute upper respiratory tract infections are extremely common in adults and children, but only a few safe and effective treatments are available. Patients typically present with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, general malaise, and/or low-grade fever. Informing patients about the self-limited nature of the common cold can help manage expectations, limit antibiotic use, and avoid over-the-counter purchases that may not help. Treatments with proven effectiveness for cold symptoms in adults include over-the-counter analgesics, zinc, nasal decongestants with or without antihistamines, and ipratropium for cough. Lower-quality evidence suggests that Lactobacillus casei may be beneficial in older adults. The only established safe and effective treatments for children are acetylcysteine, honey (for children one year and older), nasal saline irrigation, intranasal ipratropium, and topical application of ointment containing camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus oils. Over-the-counter cold medications should not be used in children younger than four years. Counseling patients about the importance of good hand hygiene is the best way to prevent transmission of cold viruses.

### The human viral challenge model: accelerating the evaluation of respiratory antivirals, vaccines and novel diagnostics [^115pdBKe]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Rhinovirus (the "common" cold)

HRV infections, often considered trivial can significantly contribute to missed days from work and school, though infections are typically self-limiting. HRV infections throughout the year and in many cases, manifest with symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, sore throat, and cough. HRV is known to be the primary cause of ARI and a severe contributing factor in exacerbations of atopic disease, e.g. asthma as well other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

HRV infections are associated with significant economic implications as well as being an important contributor to sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis and primary pneumonia. HRV is a considerable cause of morbidity in specific at-risk groups such as infants, the elderly, immunocompromised, and, as already mentioned, chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD and cystic fibrosis. At present, HRV is considered the number one cause of asthma exacerbations.

Asthma is a complex disease, characterised by chronic airway inflammation, and a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough. Over time these symptoms can vary in their intensity. Each year over 300 million people worldwide are affected by asthma: approximately 250,000 people die as a result. Many deaths are due to suboptimal long-term medical care and delay in obtaining help during severe exacerbations of the disease. Treatments to prevent worsening of symptoms and other therapies for mild to moderate asthma that avert relapse, i.e. the symptoms worsen again when the treatment stops, are significant unmet medical needs.

The human challenge model has been used to investigate the viral pathogenicity and recent publications on the asthma challenge model have focused on how the asthmatic host responds to HRV infection. Work is ongoing as to susceptibility to viral induced asthma worsening innate immune dysregulation and induction of innate, and type 2 responses in nasal and bronchial epithelial secretions.

### Lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus: current management and new therapeutics [^116wwwXB]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age. Evidence-based management guidelines suggest that there is no effective treatment for RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and that supportive care, ie, hydration and oxygenation, remains the cornerstone of clinical management. However, RSV treatments in development in the past decade include 10 vaccines and 11 therapeutic agents in active clinical trials. Maternal vaccination is particularly relevant because the most severe disease occurs within the first 6 months of life, when children are unlikely to benefit from active immunisation. We must optimise the implementation of novel RSV therapeutics by understanding the target populations, showing safety, and striving for acceptable pricing in the context of this worldwide health problem. In this Review, we outline the limitations of RSV LRTI management, the drugs in development, and the remaining challenges related to study design, regulatory approval, and implementation.

### Rhinovirus respiratory infections and asthma [^115FgdWb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Viral infections, particularly respiratory illnesses caused by rhinovirus, are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations in children and contribute in large part to asthma morbidity in adults. Epidemiologic studies and increasingly sophisticated viral detection methodologies have helped to define the role of rhinovirus as a potential causative agent in asthma exacerbations. Rhinovirus-induced lung disease is multifaceted and can be characterized in terms of a variety of physiologic, immunologic, and viral processes. The precise direct and indirect mechanisms of viral contribution to exacerbations must still be elucidated. Understanding them will have an impact on the design of future treatment modalities.

### Promising approaches for the treatment and prevention of viral respiratory illnesses [^111EeZ4p]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Viral respiratory tract infections are the most common human ailments, leading to enormous health and economic burden. Hundreds of viral species and subtypes have been associated with these conditions, with influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinoviruses being the most frequent and with the highest burden. When considering prevention or treatment of viral respiratory tract infections, potential targets include the causative pathogens themselves but also the immune response, disease transmission, or even just the symptoms. Strategies targeting all these aspects are developing concurrently, and several novel and promising approaches are emerging. In this perspective we overview the entire range of options and highlight some of the most promising approaches, including new antiviral agents, symptomatic or immunomodulatory drugs, the re-emergence of natural remedies, and vaccines and public health policies toward prevention. Wide-scale prevention through immunization appears to be within reach for respiratory syncytial virus and promising for influenza virus, whereas additional effort is needed in regard to rhinovirus, as well as other respiratory tract viruses.

### Mouse models of rhinovirus-induced disease and exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation [^112kkoGd]. Nature Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

Rhinoviruses cause serious morbidity and mortality as the major etiological agents of asthma exacerbations and the common cold. A major obstacle to understanding disease pathogenesis and to the development of effective therapies has been the lack of a small-animal model for rhinovirus infection. Of the 100 known rhinovirus serotypes, 90% (the major group) use human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as their cellular receptor and do not bind mouse ICAM-1; the remaining 10% (the minor group) use a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family and can bind the mouse counterpart. Here we describe three novel mouse models of rhinovirus infection: minor-group rhinovirus infection of BALB/c mice, major-group rhinovirus infection of transgenic BALB/c mice expressing a mouse-human ICAM-1 chimera and rhinovirus-induced exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation. These models have features similar to those observed in rhinovirus infection in humans, including augmentation of allergic airway inflammation, and will be useful in the development of future therapies for colds and asthma exacerbations.

### Cost burden of viral respiratory infections: issues for formulary decision makers [^113fso53]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Viral respiratory infections (VRIs) are a common malady associated with considerable costs in terms of decreased productivity and time lost from work or school, visits to health-care providers, and the amount of drugs prescribed. Both total respiratory illness and rhinovirus infection peak during the fall and spring seasons, although the average percentage of office visits by patients with a rhinovirus infection is moderately high throughout the year. Most common cold remedies are relatively ineffective and may produce side effects that contribute to increased health-care costs. Antibiotic therapy is widely overused and misused despite evidence that antibiotics fail to treat the cause of VRI or prevent secondary bacterial infections. Increasing use of antibiotics has a significant impact on health-care costs and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Reasons for overprescribing antibiotics are varied, but they often involve physician and patient attitudes and expectations. Although treatment of VRIs poses challenges for effective formulary management, several steps can be taken to facilitate the introduction of antiviral agents, including patient and provider education, the development of rapid diagnostic tests, and medical-economics studies to determine the true cost of antiviral therapy.

### Effect of CRTH2 antagonism on the response to experimental rhinovirus infection in asthma: a pilot randomised controlled trial [^113fFeQp]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and aims

The chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on T helper type 2 cells (CRTH2) antagonist timapiprant improved lung function and asthma control in a phase 2 study, with evidence suggesting reduced exacerbations. We aimed to assess whether timapiprant attenuated or prevented asthma exacerbations induced by experimental rhinovirus (RV) infection. We furthermore hypothesised that timapiprant would dampen RV-induced type 2 inflammation and consequently improve antiviral immune responses.

Methods

Atopic patients with partially controlled asthma on maintenance inhaled corticosteroids were randomised to timapiprant (n = 22) or placebo (n = 22) and challenged with RV-A16 3 weeks later. The primary endpoint was the cumulative lower respiratory symptom score over the 14 days post infection. Upper respiratory symptoms, spirometry, airway hyperresponsiveness, exhaled nitric oxide, RV-A16 virus load and soluble mediators in upper and lower airways samples, and CRTH2 staining in bronchial biopsies were additionally assessed before and during RV-A16 infection.

Results

Six subjects discontinued the study and eight were not infected; outcomes were assessed in 16 timapiprant-treated and 14 placebo-treated, successfully infected subjects. There were no differences between treatment groups in clinical exacerbation severity including cumulative lower respiratory symptom score day 0–14 (difference 3.0 (95% CI −29.0 to 17.0), p = 0.78), virus load, antiviral immune responses, or RV-A16-induced airway inflammation other than in the bronchial biopsies, where CRTH2 staining was increased during RV-A16 infection in the placebo-treated but not the timapiprant-treated group. Timapiprant had a favourable safety profile, with no deaths, serious adverse events or drug-related withdrawals.

Conclusion

Timapiprant treatment had little impact on the clinicopathological changes induced by RV-A16 infection in partially controlled asthma.

### Antihistamines for the common cold [^111maPqm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is an upper respiratory tract infection, most commonly caused by a rhinovirus. It affects people of all age groups and although in most cases it is self limiting, the common cold still causes significant morbidity. Antihistamines are commonly offered over the counter to relieve symptoms for patients affected by the common cold, however there is not much evidence of their efficacy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antihistamines on the common cold.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1948 to July week 4, 2015), EMBASE (2010 to August 2015), CINAHL (1981 to August 2015), LILACS (1982 to August 2015) and Biosis Previews (1985 to August 2015).

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using antihistamines as monotherapy for the common cold. We excluded any studies with combination therapy or using antihistamines in patients with an allergic component in their illness.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We collected adverse effects information from the included trials.

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs, which were reported in 17 publications (one publication reports on two trials) with 4342 participants (of which 212 were children) suffering from the common cold, both naturally occurring and experimentally induced. The interventions consisted of an antihistamine as monotherapy compared with placebo. In adults there was a short-term beneficial effect of antihistamines on severity of overall symptoms: on day one or two of treatment 45% had a beneficial effect with antihistamines versus 38% with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.92). However, there was no difference between antihistamines and placebo in the mid term (three to four days) to long term (six to 10 days). When evaluating individual symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing, there was some beneficial effect of the sedating antihistamines compared to placebo (e.g. rhinorrhoea on day three: mean difference (MD) -0.23, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.06 on a four- or five-point severity scale; sneezing on day three: MD -0.35, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.20 on a four-point severity scale), but this effect is clinically non-significant. Adverse events such as sedation were more commonly reported with sedating antihistamines although the differences were not statistically significant. Only two trials included children and the results were conflicting. The majority of the trials had a low risk of bias although some lacked sufficient trial quality information.

Authors' Conclusions

Antihistamines have a limited short-term (days one and two of treatment) beneficial effect on severity of overall symptoms but not in the mid to long term. There is no clinically significant effect on nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea or sneezing. Although side effects are more common with sedating antihistamines, the difference is not statistically significant. There is no evidence of effectiveness of antihistamines in children.

### Effects of montelukast on patients with asthma after experimental inoculation with human rhinovirus 16 [^115AsCZC]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Leukotrienes are induced by viral infections.

Objectives

To determine whether treatment with montelukast would improve asthma disease control in patients with mild allergic asthma during an experimentally induced rhinovirus infection.

Methods

Patients with mild allergic asthma were randomized to receive treatment with either montelukast or placebo, and 7 days later both groups were inoculated with human rhinovirus 16. Patients were evaluated at baseline, during the acute infection phase, and during the recovery phase for asthma and cold symptoms by questionnaire. Sputum, nasal lavage fluid, and blood were analyzed for viral shedding and cellular inflammation, and peak expiratory flow was measured daily.

Results

A total of 19 patients (11 in the placebo group and 8 in the active group) completed the study. No significant differences were found in asthma control and cold symptom scores between the control and treatment groups. The change in peak expiratory flow from the randomization to acute illness phase was greater in the placebo group than the treatment group (mean, -22 vs 0 L/min; p = 0.05). During the recovery phase, the percentage of sputum eosinophils increased in the placebo group and remained at baseline levels in the montelukast group (median, 2.7% vs 0.2%; p = 0.05 between groups).

Conclusions

In this pilot study, montelukast did not improve asthma control or cold symptom scores caused by experimental rhinovirus infection. Analysis of secondary outcomes suggests that montelukast may prevent reductions in lung function and increases in sputum eosinophils caused by common cold infections. Further studies are needed to determine whether these effects are associated with clinically significant improvements in health outcomes during natural colds.

### Ineffectiveness of intranasal zinc gluconate for prevention of experimental rhinovirus colds [^116zAUg4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Zinc has generally been administered by the oral route in studies of prevention or treatment of the common cold. The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the effectiveness of intranasal zinc gluconate for prevention of experimental rhinovirus infection and illness. Ninety-one volunteers, 41 treated with active medication and 50 treated with placebo, received study medication for 3 days, were inoculated with rhinovirus, and then were treated with study medication for an additional 6 days. Rhinovirus infection was documented in 37 (74%) of the 50 placebo-treated volunteers and in 32 (78%) of the 41 volunteers treated with active medication. Zinc treatment had no effect on total symptom score, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, or the proportion of infected volunteers who developed clinical colds. These data do not support a role for intranasal zinc gluconate for prevention or treatment of the common cold.

### The seasonality of rhinovirus infections and its implications for clinical recognition [^114vUEb6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Rhinoviruses are the most common cause of acute respiratory infections. Isolation of rhinoviruses occurs in a distinct and consistent seasonal pattern that can be used to help determine whether an acute respiratory illness is caused by a rhinovirus.

Objective

This article reviews information on the seasonality of rhinovirus infection derived from early and recent studies of rhinovirus occurrence and treatment.

Methods

PubMed was searched from 1965 to the present to identify all potentially relevant papers. The search terms used were rhinovirus and seasonality. A total of 1998 papers were screened.

Results

Rhinoviruses comprise more than three quarters of viruses circulating in early autumn. In some years and perhaps some geographic areas, spring is an even more important time for rhinovirus transmission. Although overall rates of respiratory illness are lower in summer, rhinoviruses are the most frequently isolated virus at this time of year. Other viral agents, including influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (particularly with parainfluenza virus), predominate in the winter. Thus, for most of the year, rhinoviruses are the cause of the majority of acute viral respiratory infections.

Conclusion

Understanding the seasonal incidence of rhinovirus infection may help determine how best to employ currently available antirhinoviral agents in patients presenting with symptoms of an acute viral respiratory infection.

### Host immune responses to rhinovirus: mechanisms in asthma [^115AhMzr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Viral respiratory infections can have a profound effect on many aspects of asthma including its inception, exacerbations, and, possibly, severity. Of the many viral respiratory infections that influence asthma, the common cold virus, rhinovirus, has emerged as the most frequent illness associated with exacerbations and other aspects of asthma. The mechanisms by which rhinovirus influences asthma are not fully established, but current evidence indicates that the immune response to this virus is critical in this process. Many airway cell types are involved in the immune response to rhinovirus, but most important are respiratory epithelial cells and possibly macrophages. Infection of epithelial cells generates a variety of proinflammatory mediators to attract inflammatory cells to the airway with a subsequent worsening of underlying disease. Furthermore, there is evidence that the epithelial airway antiviral response to rhinovirus may be defective in asthma. Therefore, understanding the immune response to rhinovirus is a key step in defining mechanisms of asthma, exacerbations, and, perhaps most importantly, improved treatment.

### Toward antiviral therapy / prophylaxis for rhinovirus-induced exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: challenges, opportunities, and strategies [^114g3cge]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a life-threatening lung illness characterized by persistent and progressive airflow limitation. Exacerbations of COPD contribute to the severity of this pathology and accelerate disease progression. To date, pharmacological treatment of both stable COPD patients and patients experiencing exacerbations is mainly symptomatic with bronchodilators and steroids as the mainstay of therapy. Bacteria trigger such exacerbations in a number of cases; hence, antibiotics might be included in the treatment as well. Several respiratory viruses are frequently detected in sputum from patients during COPD exacerbations. These include influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and, most often, rhinoviruses. In this review, we discuss the potential use of an anti-rhinovirus drug for the treatment and prophylaxis of rhinovirus-induced COPD exacerbations and the path forward toward the development and use of such a drug.

### Effect ofspp. Bl-04 on rhinovirus-induced colds: a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center, phase II trial in healthy volunteers [^117TRKZF]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Probiotics, "live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host" are among the most commonly consumed dietary supplements. A variety of probiotic preparations have been studied for different human illnesses with some evidence of a beneficial effect on various diarrheal and gastrointestinal disorders. The results of studies using probiotics for the treatment or prevention of viral respiratory illnesses have; however, been inconsistent. These inconsistent results may be due to the variable quality of the study designs and results reporting of the clinical trials. These trials have generally not addressed potential mechanisms of action in humans, and the proposed mechanism of action of probiotics as treatment for viral respiratory disease have been based primarily on animal models.

The experimental RV challenge model has been used for many years as a tool for the exploration of pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of these infections in human volunteers in a well-controlled, clinically relevant setting. Previous studies of a probiotic, Bifidobacterium animalis, subsp. lactis Bl-04 (Bl-04), in the experimental challenge model were directed at examining the effect of the probiotic on the nasal innate immune response to the viral infection. Modest but inconsistent immune effects were noted and associated exploratory analyses suggested effects on viral shedding. Another exploratory analysis from the study found apparent effects of the nasal microbiota, unrelated to probiotic consumption, on the clinical and immunologic response to the RV infection. The purpose of the present study was to further explore in a larger challenge study the effects of Bl-04 on clinical outcomes associated with RV infection as well as assess the virologic, immunologic, and microbiomic basis for any observed effect.

### Effect of CRTH2 antagonism on the response to experimental rhinovirus infection in asthma: a pilot randomised controlled trial [^111aLhPp]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

The dose administered appeared well justified as the same dose-ranging study of timapiprant found plasma levels well in excess of the equilibrium dissociation constant (K_B) at the lowest dose, 25 mg once a day, when first measured after 2 weeks treatment. Treatment with 50 mg once a day for 3 weeks prior to RV inoculation, as employed in this study, substantially exceeds this. Moreover, there appeared to be a treatment effect on RV-induced recruitment of CRTH2⁺ cells to the airway wall (recruitment was observed in placebo-treated but not in timapiprant-treated patients), suggesting 3 weeks treatment was sufficient to impact CRTH2⁺ cell recruitment.

There are several explanations for the lack of effect observed in our study. The subjects in this study had moderate rather than severe asthma and the exacerbations were relatively mild, not requiring oral corticosteroids or nebulised bronchodilators. There may therefore have been insufficient inflammation to detect an effect of the drug. In particular, PGD₂ levels in airway secretions were not increased during infection contrary to the only previous study to measure this. There were nonetheless readily quantifiable levels of PGD₂ in the airways to serve as a target for timapiprant. Furthermore, our results are consistent with two recent phase 3 clinical trials that found the CRTH2 antagonist fevipiprant did not reduce the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids in patients with severe asthma, including a subgroup with raised blood eosinophils indicative of ongoing type 2 inflammation. Our study highlights that controlled experimental RV challenge studies can be used to study the effects of novel therapies using smaller numbers of patients and provide results that are consistent with larger scale trials. The predictive value of this model is currently being directly tested in an ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of timapiprant (EudraCT 2018–003548–22).

### Treatment of potentially life-threatening enterovirus infections with pleconaril [^117RQqfe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Enteroviruses usually cause self-limited disease that, although associated with high morbidity, is rarely fatal. In certain patient populations, however, the enteroviruses may cause potentially life-threatening infections. Pleconaril is a novel compound that integrates into the capsid of picornaviruses, including enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, preventing the virus from attaching to cellular receptors and uncoating to release RNA into the cell. Pleconaril was used on a compassionate-release basis to treat patients with potentially life-threatening enterovirus infections, and for 38 of these patients sufficient follow-up data were available for determining responses to therapy. Response was evaluated in 4 categories: clinical, virological, laboratory, and radiological. Most patients (28 [78%] of 36), including 12 of 16 with chronic enterovirus meningoencephalitis, were judged to have a clinical response temporally associated with pleconaril therapy. Similarly, nearly all patients whose virological responses (12 [92%] of 13), laboratory responses (14 [88%] of 16), and radiological responses (3 [60%] of 5) could be evaluated were judged to have responded favorably to a course of pleconaril treatment. Adverse effects were minimal and the drug was generally well-tolerated.

### Viral respiratory infection therapy: historical perspectives and current trials [^111XSQGi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Attempts to relieve the misery of the common cold have been made since long before current understanding of its viral origin. Although current symptomatic therapies provide some relief, any effective treatment must incorporate an antiviral to address the infection. Symptom production is related not only to viral cytopathic effect but also to the early activation of several inflammatory pathways. Antiviral treatment alone may not be able to prevent these events. Combining an antiviral with selected therapeutic agents that block these inflammatory pathways has been shown to improve the effectiveness of cold treatment. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment combined with regular dosing until symptoms subside appears to be the most effective treatment strategy to maximize therapeutic outcomes. This strategy reduces viral shedding in nasal fluid, provides treatment for the period of maximum symptom burden, and may reduce the frequency and severity of the sinus disease that accompanies colds.

### The infectious march: the complex interaction between microbes and the immune system in asthma [^1172hxDP]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

There has been significant progress in our knowledge about the relationship between infectious disease and the immune system in relation to asthma, but many unanswered questions still remain. Respiratory tract infections such as those caused by respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus during the first 2 years of life are still clearly associated with later wheezing and asthma, but the mechanism has not been completely worked out. Is there an "infectious march" triggered by infection in infancy that progresses to disease pathology or are infants who contract respiratory infections predisposed to developing asthma? This review focuses on the common themes in the interaction between microbes and the immune system, and presents a critical appraisal of the evidence to date. The various mechanisms whereby microbes alter the immune response and how this might influence asthma are discussed along with new and promising clinical practices for prevention and therapy. Recent advances in using sensitive polymerase chain reaction detection methods have allowed more rigorous testing of the causality hypothesis of virus infection leading to asthma, but the evidence is still equivocal. Various exceptions and inconsistencies in the clinical trials are discussed in light of new guidelines for subject inclusion/exclusion in hopes of providing some standardization. Despite past failures in vaccination and disappointing results of some clinical trials, the new strategies for prophylaxis including RNA interference and targeted delivery of microbicides offer a large dose of hope to a world suffering from an increasing incidence of asthma as well as a huge burden of health care cost and loss of quality of life.

### How I treat respiratory viral infections in the setting of intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation [^117BVisL]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

The widespread use of multiplex molecular diagnostics has led to a significant increase in the detection of respiratory viruses in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Respiratory viruses initially infect the upper respiratory tract and then progress to lower respiratory tract disease in a subset of patients. Lower respiratory tract disease can manifest itself as airflow obstruction or viral pneumonia, which can be fatal. Infection in HCT candidates may require delay of transplantation. The risk of progression differs between viruses and immunosuppressive regimens. Risk factors for progression and severity scores have been described, which may allow targeting treatment to high-risk patients. Ribavirin is the only antiviral treatment option for noninfluenza respiratory viruses; however, high-quality data demonstrating its efficacy and relative advantages of the aerosolized versus oral form are lacking. There are significant unmet needs, including data defining the virologic characteristics and clinical significance of human rhinoviruses, human coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, and human bocavirus, as well as the need for new treatment and preventative options.

### Efficacy and safety of iota-carrageenan nasal spray versus placebo in early treatment of the common cold in adults: the ICICC trial [^1171ujF7]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Published clinical evidence concerning the frequencies of detectable viruses varies but with modern techniques, viruses (particularly rhinoviruses) have been found in up to 90% of patients suffering from cold symptoms. It can therefore be expected that in real-life conditions patients/consumers who empirically choose to use the I-C spray have a relatively high likelihood of being infected with rhinovirus or one of a variety of respiratory viruses that manifest with the common cold symptoms. The uncertainty of true infection in such a setting is counter-balanced by the very low intolerance and toxicity rates of the I-C spray and its relative inexpensiveness, thus giving favorable potential benefit-risk and benefit-cost ratios to the empiric use of the I-C spray.

In clinical trials of cough & cold, a substantial proportion of studies demonstrate trends but may not reach statistically significant efficacy outcomes. This observation may be due to the large variability in the disease severity between native infection and patients recruited in the early stages of a cold. When a controlled clinical trial tries to recruit patients at the earliest stages of a common cold - when symptoms are still emerging and are mild - patients may incorrectly believe they are coming down with a cold, prior to full blown cold symptoms. The relatively low frequency of rhinovirus-positive patients in the ICICC study demonstrates that there is often a trade-off when this standard design is used for cold studies. The peculiarities of the outcome of the ICICC study are also useful in that they may trigger a discussion among the scientific community about more suitable study designs to investigate common cold treatments.

Furthermore, the results of the ICICC study are in line with many other common cold studies which showed relatively small effects of treatment on symptom severity or duration. One example is the study by Barrett et al. on Echinacea which showed as well trends in the direction of benefit, amounting to an average half day reduction in the duration of a week-long cold, or an approximate 10% reduction in overall severity. The authors concluded that "while these results do not allow us to reject the null hypothesis and confidently claim evidence-of-benefit, data are also insufficient to exclude the possibility of a clinically significant effect".

Although not addressed in the ICICC trial, I-C's antiviral properties lead to speculation that its use might decrease cold transmission to patients' family members and other social contacts.

### Respiratory syncytial virus prevention and therapy: past, present, and future [^111E8MfX]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2011). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common respiratory pathogen in infants and young children worldwide. More than 50 years after its discovery, and despite relentless attempts to identify pharmacological therapies to improve the clinical course and outcomes of this disease, the most effective therapy remains supportive care. Although the quest for a safe and effective vaccine remains unsuccessful, pediatricians practicing during the past decade have been able to protect at least the more vulnerable patients with safe and effective passive prophylaxis. This review summarizes the history, microbiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations of this infection in order to provide the reader with the background information necessary to fully appreciate the many challenges presented by the clinical management of young children with bronchiolitis. The last part of this article attempts an evidence-based review of the pharmacologic strategies currently available and those being evaluated, intentionally omitting highly experimental approaches not yet tested in clinical trials and, therefore, not likely to become available in the foreseeable future.

### Could nasal nitric oxide help to mitigate the severity of COVID-19? [^114zgGA1]. Microbes and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

The nasal cavity and turbinates play important physiological functions by filtering, warming and humidifying inhaled air. Paranasal sinuses continually produce nitric oxide (NO), a reactive oxygen species that diffuses to the bronchi and lungs to produce bronchodilatory and vasodilatory effects. Studies indicate that NO may also help to reduce respiratory tract infection by inactivating viruses and inhibiting their replication in epithelial cells. In view of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), clinical trials have been designed to examine the effects of inhaled nitric oxide in COVID-19 subjects. We discuss here additional lifestyle factors such as mouth breathing which may affect the antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 by bypassing the filtering effect of the nose and by decreasing NO levels in the airways. Simple devices that promote nasal breathing during sleep may help prevent the common cold, suggesting potential benefits against coronavirus infection. In the absence of effective treatments against COVID-19, the alternative strategies proposed here should be considered and studied in more detail.

### Comparing the clinical courses of children with human rhinovirus / enterovirus to children with other respiratory viruses in the outpatient setting [^117CFVTx]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

While infections caused by rhinoviruses and enteroviruses are common among children, the entirety of their clinical impact remains elusive. We compared the clinical outcomes of children with rhinovirus/enterovirus infections to other common respiratory viruses in outpatient settings.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of nasopharyngeal samples singly positive for human rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/ENT), influenza A/B (FLU) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) from patients ≤ 17 years submitted for clinical testing via multiplex polymerase chain reaction between 2016 and 2019. We evaluated the following outpatient outcomes: days of respiratory symptoms before testing; visits for respiratory symptoms; receipt of a breathing treatment; receipt of antibiotics and hospital admission. Statistical analyses were conducted controlling for age and comorbid conditions.

Results

There were 1355 positive samples included in this analysis (HRV/ENT: n = 743, FLU: n = 303 and RSV: n = 309). Compared to HRV/ENT, children with FLU had 28% fewer days of respiratory symptoms (β: -0.32; 95% confidence interval: -0.46 to -0.18; P < 0.001), fewer visits for respiratory symptoms, and significantly decreased odds of receiving a breathing treatment or antibiotics, and admission to the hospital. Children with RSV had a similar number of days of respiratory symptoms, outpatient visits and odds of hospital admission, but significantly increased odds of receiving a breathing treatment and antibiotics compared to those with HRV/ENT.

Conclusion

Clinicians should have a high level of vigilance when managing children with positive respiratory viral testing for HRV/ENT given the potential for clinical outcomes similar to and, in some instances, worse than known highly pathogenic viruses.

### Rhinovirus and the lower respiratory tract [^115WBDXT]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2004). Low credibility.

Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are well-recognised causes of common colds and associated upper respiratory tract complications such as sinusitis and otitis media. This article reviews information linking HRV infection to illness in the lower respiratory tract. HRVs are capable of efficient replication in vitro at temperatures present in the tracheobronchial tree and have been shown to cause productive infection, elaboration of cytokines and chemokines, and up-regulation of cell surface markers in human bronchial epithelial cells. In situ hybridisation studies have proven that HRV infection occurs in the tracheobronchial tree following experimental infection. Clinical studies report that HRV infection is the second most frequently recognised agent associated with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants and young children and commonly causes exacerbations of pre-existing airways disease in those with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cystic fibrosis. HRV infection is associated with one-third to one-half of asthma exacerbations depending on age and is linked to asthma hospitalisations in both adults and children. Limited information implicates HRV infection as a cause of severe lower respiratory tract illness in older adults and in highly immunocompromised hosts, particularly bone marrow transplant recipients. More information is needed about the pathogenesis of HRV infection with regard to lower respiratory tract complications in these diverse patient groups. Given the large unmet medical need associated with HRV infections, safe and effective antiviral agents are needed for both prevention and treatment of these infections.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, initiation, ACP/CDC 2016 guidelines recommend to reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis in patients with persistent symptoms for > 10 days, onset of severe symptoms or signs of high fever (> 39 °C) and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting ≥ 3 consecutive days, or onset of worsening symptoms following a typical viral illness lasted 5 days that was initially improving (double sickening).

### Mechanisms of virus-induced asthma exacerbations: state-of-the-art. A GA2LEN and interAirways document [^116GXpHE]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Viral infections of the respiratory tract are the most common precipitants of acute asthma exacerbations. Exacerbations are only poorly responsive to current asthma therapies and new approaches to therapy are needed. Viruses, most frequently human rhinoviruses (RV), infect the airway epithelium, generate local and systemic immune responses, as well as neural responses, inducing inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Using in vitro and in vivo experimental models the role of various proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators, antiviral responses and molecular pathways that lead from infection to symptoms has been partly unravelled. In particular, mechanisms of susceptibility to viral infection have been identified and the bronchial epithelium appeared to be a key player. Nevertheless, additional understanding of the integration between the diverse elements of the antiviral response, especially in the context of allergic airway inflammation, as well as the interactions between viral infections and other stimuli that affect airway inflammation and responsiveness may lead to novel strategies in treating and/or preventing asthma exacerbations. This review presents the current knowledge and highlights areas in need of further research.

### Effects of omalizumab on rhinovirus infections, illnesses, and exacerbations of asthma [^116h31Qx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

Allergic inflammation has been linked to increased susceptibility to viral illnesses, but it is unclear whether this association is causal.

Objectives

To test whether omalizumab treatment to reduce IgE would shorten the frequency and duration of rhinovirus (RV) illnesses in children with allergic asthma.

Methods

In the PROSE (Preventative Omalizumab or Step-up Therapy for Severe Fall Exacerbations) study, we examined children with allergic asthma (aged 6–17 yr; n = 478) from low-income census tracts in eight U.S. cities, and we analyzed virology for the groups randomized to treatment with guidelines-based asthma care (n = 89) or add-on omalizumab (n = 259). Weekly nasal mucus samples were analyzed for RVs, and respiratory symptoms and asthma exacerbations were recorded over a 90-day period during the fall seasons of 2012 or 2013. Adjusted illness rates (illnesses per sample) by treatment arm were calculated using Poisson regression.

Measurements and Main Results

RVs were detected in 97 (57%) of 171 exacerbation samples and 2,150 (36%) of 5,959 nonexacerbation samples (OR, 2.32; P < 0.001). Exacerbations were significantly associated with detection of rhinovirus C (OR, 2.85; P < 0.001) and rhinovirus A (OR, 2.92; P < 0.001), as well as, to a lesser extent, rhinovirus B (OR, 1.98; P = 0.019). Omalizumab decreased the duration of RV infection (11.2 d vs. 12.4 d; P = 0.03) and reduced peak RV shedding by 0.4 log units (95% confidence interval, -0.77 to -0.02; P = 0.04). Finally, omalizumab decreased the frequency of RV illnesses (risk ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.84).

Conclusions

In children with allergic asthma, treatment with omalizumab decreased the duration of RV infections, viral shedding, and the risk of RV illnesses. These findings provide direct evidence that blocking IgE decreases susceptibility to RV infections and illness. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01430403).

### Effect of CRTH2 antagonism on the response to experimental rhinovirus infection in asthma: a pilot randomised controlled trial [^115aN9WY]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the CRTH2 antagonist timapiprant did not attenuate RV-induced increases in symptoms and asthma pathophysiology in a group of ICS-treated subjects with partially controlled asthma. The results of the ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of timapiprant in asthma are awaited with interest.

### Rhinovirus infections in the first 2 years of life [^113DT8V1]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Rhinoviruses frequently cause respiratory infections in young children. We aimed to establish the burden of acute respiratory infections caused by rhinovirus during the first 2 years of life.

Methods

In this prospective birth cohort study, we followed 923 children for acute respiratory infections from birth to 2 years of age. Data on respiratory infections were collected by daily symptom diaries, study clinic visits, and from electronic registries. Respiratory viruses were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and antigen assays during respiratory infections and at the age of 2, 13, and 24 months. The rates of rhinovirus infections and associated morbidities were determined.

Results

We documented 8847 episodes of acute respiratory infections, with an annual rate of 5.9 per child (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.7–6.1). Rhinovirus was detected in 59% of acute respiratory infections analyzed for viruses. Rhinovirus was associated with 50% of acute otitis media episodes, 41% of wheezing illnesses, 49% of antibiotic treatments, and 48% of outpatient office visits for acute respiratory infections. The estimated mean annual rate of rhinovirus infections was 3.5 per child (95% CI, 3.3–3.6), 47 per 100 children (95% CI, 42–52) for rhinovirus-associated acute otitis media, and 61 per 100 children (95% CI, 55–68) for rhinovirus-associated antibiotic treatment. The prevalence of rhinovirus at 2, 13, or 24 months of age was 14 to 24%, and 9% of asymptomatic children were positive for rhinovirus.

Conclusions

Rhinovirus infections impose a major burden of acute respiratory illness and antibiotic use on young children.

### Efficacy and safety of oral pleconaril for treatment of colds due to picornaviruses in adults: results of 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials [^112mKLdf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The novel capsid-binding antiviral pleconaril inhibits in vitro replication of most rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Oral pleconaril treatment was studied in 2 parallel randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Among 1363 picornavirus-infected participants (65%) in the studies combined, the median time to alleviation of illness was 1 day shorter for pleconaril recipients than for placebo recipients (P < .001). Cold symptom scores and frequency of picornavirus cultured from nasal mucus specimens were lower among pleconaril recipients by day 2 of treatment. No treatment effects were seen in those without picornavirus infection. Pleconaril was associated with a higher incidence of nausea (6% vs. 4%) and diarrhea (9% vs. 7%) and with small increases in mean serum cholesterol levels and platelet counts, compared with baseline measurements. A subsequent 6-week prophylaxis study found that pleconaril induces cytochrome P-450 3A enzymes, which metabolize a variety of drugs, including ethinyl estradiol. Early pleconaril treatment was well tolerated and significantly reduced the duration and severity of colds due to picornaviruses in adults.

### Combined antiviral-antimediator treatment for the common cold [^114RUbbL]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

A randomized, controlled, double-masked clinical trial was conducted with a combination antiviral-antimediator treatment for experimental rhinovirus colds. In all, 150 healthy men and women (aged 18–51 years) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: intranasal interferon (IFN)-alpha2b (6 × 10⁶ U every 12 h × 3) plus oral chlorpheniramine (12 mg extended release) and ibuprofen (400 mg) every 12 h for 4.5 days (n = 59 subjects); intranasal placebo plus oral chlorpheniramine and ibuprofen (n = 61 subjects); or intranasal and oral placebos (n = 30 subjects). Treatment was started 24 h after intranasal viral challenge. During the 4.5 days of treatment with IFN-alpha2b, chlorpheniramine, and ibuprofen, the daily mean total symptom score was reduced by 33%-73%, compared with placebo. Treatment reduced the severity of rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal obstruction, sore throat, cough, and headache and reduced nasal mucus production, nasal tissue use, and virus concentrations in nasal secretions. IFN-alpha2b added to the effectiveness of chlorpheniramine and ibuprofen and was well tolerated.

### Effects of treatment with corticosteroids on human rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations in pediatric inpatients: a prospective observational study [^112JtkZJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) infection is a common cause of exacerbations in pediatric patients with asthma. However, the effects of corticosteroids on HRV-induced exacerbations in pediatric asthma are unknown. We conducted a prospective observational study to determine the viral pathogens in school-age pediatric inpatients with asthma exacerbations. We assessed the effects of maintenance inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) on the detection rates of HRV species and treatment periods of systemic corticosteroids during exacerbations on pulmonary lung function after exacerbations.

Methods

Nasopharyngeal samples and clinical information were collected from 59 patients with asthma exacerbations between April 2018 and March 2020. Pulmonary function tests were carried out 3 months after exacerbations in 18 HRV-positive patients. Changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁)% predicted from baseline in a stable state were compared according to the treatment periods of systemic corticosteroids.

Results

Fifty-four samples collected from hospitalized patients were analyzed, and viral pathogens were identified in 45 patients (83.3%) using multiplex PCR assay. HRV-A, −B, and -C were detected in 16 (29.6%), one (1.9%), and 16 (29.6%) patients, respectively. The detection rates of HRV-C were lower in the ICS-treated group compared with those in the ICS-untreated group (p = 0.01), whereas maintenance ICS treatment did not affect the detection rate for viral pathogens in total and HRV-A. Changes in FEV₁% predicted in patients treated with systemic corticosteroids for 6–8 days (n = 10; median, 4.90%) were higher than those in patients treated for 3–5 days (n = 8; median, − 10.25%) (p = 0.0085).

Conclusions

Maintenance ICS reduced the detection rates of HRV (mainly HRV-C) in school-age inpatients with asthma exacerbations, and the treatment periods of systemic corticosteroids during exacerbations affected lung function after HRV-induced exacerbations. The protective effects of corticosteroids on virus-induced asthma exacerbations may be dependent upon the types of viral pathogen.

### Severe respiratory viral infections: new evidence and changing paradigms [^114xGXEM]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Lower respiratory tract infection is a leading cause of death in the United States. Advances in diagnostic testing have improved our ability to detect pathogens. Viral pathogens are important causal pathogens in immunocompetent patients. As the number of elderly adults and those with chronic medical conditions increases, the burden of viral respiratory infections will increase. Clinicians must be familiar with the characteristics of rhinovirus, human adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus. Major challenges include distinguishing true infection from asymptomatic carriage and characterizing patients admitted with severe lower respiratory tract infection who do not have a causative pathogen identified.

### Human rhinoviruses [^11485gcs]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Human rhinoviruses are the most important causative agents of upper respiratory infections and are also implicated in more severe clinical entities. Although often present, very little is known about human rhinoviruses. Molecular methods have been used in the classification of this large group of viruses into two separate clades. In addition, one known serotype was found to be a member of enterovirus group D. Laboratory diagnosis of human rhinovirus infection is based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction methods or the more tedious virus culture but a rapid "bedside" method is unavailable. Anti-rhinoviral therapy has been under extensive study over the past few decades but symptomatic treatment of the common cold is still the only useful approach in clinical use. More data on circulating human rhinovirus strains would facilitate both detection and treatment of these common pathogens.

### Effect of CRTH2 antagonism on the response to experimental rhinovirus infection in asthma: a pilot randomised controlled trial [^112tHkJa]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on T helper type 2 cells (CRTH2) antagonist timapiprant improved lung function and asthma control in a phase 2 study, with evidence suggesting reduced exacerbations. We aimed to assess whether timapiprant attenuated or prevented asthma exacerbations induced by experimental rhinovirus (RV) infection. We furthermore hypothesised that timapiprant would dampen RV-induced type 2 inflammation and consequently improve antiviral immune responses.

Methods

Atopic patients with partially controlled asthma on maintenance inhaled corticosteroids were randomised to timapiprant (n = 22) or placebo (n = 22) and challenged with RV-A16 3weeks later. The primary endpoint was the cumulative lower respiratory symptom score over the 14 days post infection. Upper respiratory symptoms, spirometry, airway hyperresponsiveness, exhaled nitric oxide, RV-A16 virus load and soluble mediators in upper and lower airways samples, and CRTH2 staining in bronchial biopsies were additionally assessed before and during RV-A16 infection.

Results

Six subjects discontinued the study and eight were not infected; outcomes were assessed in 16 timapiprant-treated and 14 placebo-treated, successfully infected subjects. There were no differences between treatment groups in clinical exacerbation severity including cumulative lower respiratory symptom score day 0–14 (difference 3.0 (95% CI -29.0 to 17.0), p = 0.78), virus load, antiviral immune responses, or RV-A16-induced airway inflammation other than in the bronchial biopsies, where CRTH2 staining was increased during RV-A16 infection in the placebo-treated but not the timapiprant-treated group. Timapiprant had a favourable safety profile, with no deaths, serious adverse events or drug-related withdrawals.

Conclusion

Timapiprant treatment had little impact on the clinicopathological changes induced by RV-A16 infection in partially controlled asthma.

### Palivizumab: where to from here? [^115e8i1i]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of respiratory tract infections. In severely immunosuppressed patients RSV can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The only FDA-approved drug for RSV is aerosolized ribavirin. Given the high morbidity and mortality in high-risk populations and inconsistent results with aerosolized ribavirin, new strategies for prevention and treatment of RSV are being sought. Palivizumab is an RSV-specific monoclonal antibody. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study showed significant reduction in hospitalization rates among children at high risk of RSV infection who had been given prophylactic palivizumab; these findings led to palivizumab's approval by the FDA in June 1998. Palivizumab also has a role in prevention of severe respiratory tract infections in high-risk infants. In immunocompromised patients, palivizumab has an excellent safety profile and may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of RSV infections; however, clinical trials are needed to determine its effectiveness. In this article, we review the role of palivizumab in prevention and treatment of RSV infections in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients.

### Pharmacologic advances in the treatment and prevention of respiratory syncytial virus [^114r5edJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Currently, only 2 drugs have been approved for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSV in high-risk children. Ribavirin is approved for treatment of severe RSV disease; however, its effectiveness in improving outcomes is questionable. During the past 40 years, many obstacles have delayed the development of safe and effective vaccines and treatment regimens. This article reviews these obstacles and presents the novel development strategies used to overcome many of them. Also discussed are promising new antiviral treatment candidates and their associated mechanism of action, the significant advances made in vaccine development, and exciting, new studies directed at improving outcomes through pharmacologic manipulation of the host response to RSV disease.

### Effects of treatment with corticosteroids on human rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations in pediatric inpatients: a prospective observational study [^115yf178]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

HRV-A and HRV-C are associated mainly with asthma exacerbations in hospitalized school-age children. Maintenance ICS reduces the detection rates of HRV-C but not HRV-A. The treatment periods of systemic corticosteroids during exacerbations affect lung function after HRV-induced exacerbations. The present study suggests that the protective effects of corticosteroids on virus-induced asthma exacerbations may be dependent upon underlying species-specific factors.

### New paradigms in acute viral bronchiolitis: is it time to change our approach? [^116EtQZz]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Viral bronchiolitis is the most common pediatric acute respiratory infection leading to hospitalization, and it causes a significant healthcare burden worldwide. Current guidelines recommend supportive management after many clinical trials on specific therapies failed to demonstrate benefits. However, several studies in the past decade have revealed that bronchiolitis may not be a homogeneous disease, but instead may constitute an umbrella comprised of different "endotypes" and "phenotypes" based on patient characteristics, etiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and clinical presentation. In this extensive review, we summarize the current evidence that several different types of bronchiolitis ("bronchiolitides") coexist, with different short- and long-term consequences on respiratory health and the risk of asthma development. Disease pathobiology, immune response, and clinical characteristics may differ between the two most prevalent viral agents, respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus. Recent randomized trials have shown that some subgroups of children may benefit from the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators. These findings also suggest that some children may benefit from individualized therapeutical approaches for viral bronchiolitis rather than following broad recommendations for treating all patients uniformly using only supportive management.

### Bronchiolitis needs a revisit: distinguishing between virus entities and their treatments [^1149YRXD]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhinovirus belonging to the Enterovirus genus in the Picornaviridae family is a nonenveloped single‐stranded RNA virus, and it comprises a genetically diverse group of viruses. It has three distinct subgroups, A, B, and C, which consist of 83, 32, and 55 genotypes, respectively. 1, 13 This antigenic diversity presents a major challenge when establishing protective immunity and developing vaccines. 14 Risk factors for RV‐induced bronchiolitis include T helper 2 polarized immune responses, allergen exposure, impaired epithelial barrier, deficient interferon responses, and diminished lung function. 1, 15

### Toward personalization of asthma treatment according to trigger factors [^113NWfuC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a health problem of increasing importance, affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. It is estimated that asthma contributes to approximately 0.4 million deaths every year and the mortality might be even increased in high-risk patients. The number of disability-adjusted life-years due to asthma is approximately 23 million per year, and asthma thus accounts for approximately 1% of all disability-adjusted life-years lost. A considerable proportion of the asthma burden is attributed to acute exacerbations, which are associated with high morbidity and can lead to death. Acute exacerbations of asthma are an enormous problem to both adults and children, and account for approximately 50% of asthma health care costs. The rising prevalence of asthma and its accompanying health care costs are therefore major health and socioeconomic concerns.

Patients suffering from asthma are often treated according to management strategies suggested by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), which are regularly revised.GINA defines asthma as "a heterogeneous disease usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation with a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitations". GINA is useful because it advocates management of asthma and respiratory disease according to published "good quality" evidence; however, suggested treatment options are limited to few drugs with little recommendations regarding the use of new biologics and other treatment options such as allergen-specific immunotherapy.

Furthermore, GINA does not discriminate asthma according to the underlying trigger factors, which most certainly contribute to the phenotypic heterogeneity of asthma. Allergen exposure is a major asthma trigger factor for patients suffering from IgE-associated allergy. Likewise, viral respiratory infections, particularly those caused by rhinoviruses (RVs), represent frequent triggers for acute asthma exacerbations in allergic as well as in nonallergic subjects. –

Recently, new biomarkers have been developed for the diagnosis of specific IgE sensitization toward a large variety of individual allergen molecules and for the detection of RV strain–specific IgG antibody responses.

### The common cold [^11784iaW]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Despite great advances in medicine, the common cold continues to be a great burden on society in terms of human suffering and economic losses. Of the several viruses that cause the disease, the role of rhinoviruses is most prominent. About a quarter of all colds are still without proven cause, and the recent discovery of human metapneumovirus suggests that other viruses could remain undiscovered. Research into the inflammatory mechanisms of the common cold has elucidated the complexity of the virus-host relation. Increasing evidence is also available for the central role of viruses in predisposing to complications. New antivirals for the treatment of colds are being developed, but optimum use of these agents would require rapid detection of the specific virus causing the infection. Although vaccines against many respiratory viruses could also become available, the ultimate prevention of the common cold seems to remain a distant aim.

### Rhinovirus and asthma exacerbations [^114Q1P6A]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhinovirus (RV) is ubiquitous and typically causes only minor upper respiratory symptoms. However, especially in children and adolescent asthmatics, RV is responsible for most exacerbations. This ability of RV to drive exacerbations typically requires the concomitant presence of exposure to a bystander allergen. Susceptibility to RV-mediated exacerbations is also related to the genetic background of the host, which contributes to greater infectivity, more severe infections, altered immune responses, and to greater inflammation and loss of asthma control. Given these responses, there are several treatments available or being developed that should improve the control of exacerbations related to RV infection.

### Budesonide and formoterol effects on rhinovirus replication and epithelial cell cytokine responses [^111NVk2M]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Infections with human rhinoviruses (RVs) are commonly associated with increased symptoms and acute exacerbations of asthma that require treatment in the emergency department or hospitalization. In fact, RV infections are more often detected during acute exacerbations than any other respiratory virus. This close association has led to research efforts directed at identifying treatment to prevent RV-induced exacerbations of asthma.

Several medications have shown efficacy for prevention of asthma exacerbations in general. Combination therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) together with long-acting beta agonist (LABA) is particularly effective at preventing exacerbations. Results of clinical studies also suggest that both ICS and combination medications prevent exacerbations during the common cold season, and exacerbations that are associated with symptoms of the common cold.

Defining mechanisms of these effects is important to improving the efficacy of medications that prevent exacerbations, and several mechanisms have been proposed. First, RVs initiate infections by first binding to cell surface receptors on airway epithelial cells. Notably, ICS can downregulate in vitro expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), which is the cellular receptor for 89 of the 100 canonical RV-A and RV-B types; however, glucocorticoid treatment did not prevent the increased ICAM-1 expression after experimental RV-16 infection. Second, RVs cause illnesses in part by inducing release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines from infected epithelial cells. These factors include chemoattractants for neutrophils (e.g. CXCL8), mononuclear cells and T cells (e.g. CXCL10), and cytokines such as TNFα that can potentiate inflammatory cell functions. ICS can inhibit the RV-induced production of both pro-inflammatory mediators and type I interferons (e.g. IFN-α) that have antiviral effects. Clinical studies have shown evidence of this effect in vivo in that either systemic or topical corticosteroids were associated with increased RV replication after experimental inoculation with virus; however, cold severity was not affected.

We hypothesized that the combination of budesonide and formoterol would inhibit virus-induced inflammatory responses of primary airway epithelial cells in vitro. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments with bronchial epithelial (BE) cells that were obtained from subjects with or without allergic asthma. As a secondary objective, we compared viral replication and RV-induced responses in cells from subjects with and without allergic asthma.

### An experimental model of rhinovirus induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a pilot study [^1148DRNe]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

We report the first study to experimentally infect COPD patients with a respiratory virus. Our aim was to assess the feasibility and safety of developing a human experimental model of virus-induced COPD exacerbation, and to provide preliminary evidence for a causative role for virus infection in exacerbations. We demonstrated that experimental rhinovirus inoculation of subjects with underlying COPD results in clinical colds, together with increased lower respiratory tract symptoms and falls in PEF.

These data provide preliminary evidence of safety for this experimental model and suggest that it is feasible to further develop the model in larger numbers of subjects. They also provide preliminary evidence for a causal role for virus infections in inducing exacerbations of COPD.

In order to develop new therapies for COPD exacerbations a detailed understanding of the causes of exacerbations, as well as the pathogenic mechanisms is needed. Since studying naturally occurring exacerbations is extremely difficult, development of an experimental model in which causation could be confirmed and in which detailed clinical studies on mechanisms of disease could be carried out, would be a major step forward. Experimental virus infection has been used extensively in both healthy volunteers and asthmatics to study the pathogenesis of the common cold and virus-induced asthma exacerbations, as well as to identify and evaluate potential new treatments for these conditions. Respiratory virus infections are associated with between 40% and 65% of COPD exacerbations, and rhinoviruses are the most common virus type detected. However the safety of experimental rhinovirus infection in COPD patients has never been evaluated.

### The effect of inhaled IFN-β on worsening of asthma symptoms caused by viral infections. A randomized trial [^111XyArb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale

Ex vivo, bronchial epithelial cells from people with asthma are more susceptible to rhinovirus infection caused by deficient induction of the antiviral protein, IFN-β. Exogenous IFN-β restores antiviral activity.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of inhaled IFN-β with placebo administered to people with asthma after onset of cold symptoms to prevent or attenuate asthma symptoms caused by respiratory viruses.

Methods

A total of 147 people with asthma on inhaled corticosteroids (British Thoracic Society Steps 2–5), with a history of virus-associated exacerbations, were randomized to 14-day treatment with inhaled IFN-β (n = 72) or placebo (n = 75) within 24 hours of developing cold symptoms and were assessed clinically, with relevant samples collected to assess virus infection and antiviral responses.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 91% of randomized patients developed a defined cold. In this modified intention-to-treat population, asthma symptoms did not get clinically significantly worse (mean change in six-item Asthma Control Questionnaire < 0.5) and IFN-β treatment had no significant effect on this primary endpoint, although it enhanced morning peak expiratory flow recovery (P = 0.033), reduced the need for additional treatment, and boosted innate immunity as assessed by blood and sputum biomarkers. In an exploratory analysis of the subset of more difficult-to-treat, Step 4–5 people with asthma (n = 27 IFN-β; n = 31 placebo), Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 increased significantly on placebo; this was prevented by IFN-β (P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Although the trial did not meet its primary endpoint, it suggests that inhaled IFN-β is a potential treatment for virus-induced deteriorations of asthma in difficult-to-treat people with asthma and supports the need for further, adequately powered, trials in this population. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01126177).

### Symptomatic viral infection is associated with impaired response to treatment in children with acute asthma [^117FC3pC]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the influence of viral respiratory infection (VRI) on treatment response in acute asthma in children.

Study Design

A total of 218 children (mean age, 6.6 years) with acute asthma were recruited. Symptoms were recorded, an asthma severity score was determined, and whenever possible, a per-nasal aspirate was obtained for detection of viruses. Each child's response to inhaled β₂-agonists was assessed after 6, 12, and 24 hours.

Results

The 168 children with VRI symptoms received more treatment with inhaled β₂-agonists after 6 hours (P = 0.010), 12 hours (P = 0.002), and 24 hours (P = 0.0005) compared with the 50 children without such symptoms. Asthma severity did not differ between the 2 groups. A per-nasal aspirate was obtained from 77% of the children. The most frequently identified virus was rhinovirus (61.4%). Among children with symptoms of a VRI, those with rhinovirus had an impaired response to β₂-agonists at 6 hours (P = 0.032).

Conclusion

Children with acute asthma and symptoms of VRI respond less effectively to β(2)-agonists after 6, 12, or 24 hours and thus may benefit from more intense therapy and monitoring.

### Viral respiratory infections in association with asthma and sinusitis: a review [^111tCcJB]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Viral respiratory infections (VRIs) commonly precede asthma exacerbations in both children and adults. Likewise, VRIs may affect the paranasal sinuses, predisposing infected individuals to the development of subsequent acute bacterial sinusitis. This article discusses the role that viruses play in both the development of asthma and in acute asthma exacerbations. Mechanisms by which viral infections provoke asthma exacerbations are reviewed, and treatment of such episodes is discussed. The pathogenesis of sinusitis and association with VRIs is reviewed along with treatment recommendations.

Data Sources

Relevant articles in the medical literature were reviewed with sources including randomized, controlled clinical trials, review articles, epidemiologic studies, and standard textbooks in allergy and immunology.

Conclusions

This review highlights the prominent role that viral pathogens (especially rhinovirus) play in exacerbation of asthma and in the development of sinus disease. The specific mechanisms whereby viral infection leads to an acute asthma exacerbation or to subsequent bacterial sinusitis are described. Treatment options are outlined including the potential future application of antiviral compounds.

### Development of a predictive index for picornavirus infections [^1115RAFr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

To create a clinical prediction index that aids in the diagnosis of picornavirus respiratory infections, we analyzed patients from 5 clinical trials designed to evaluate the efficacy of an antiviral treatment for respiratory infections. Logistic regression was used to determine which baseline symptoms and patient characteristics best predicted picornavirus infection. Parameter estimates were then used to create a predictive index for estimating the probability of picornavirus infection on the basis of cold symptoms. The presence at baseline of rhinorrhea (odds ratio [OR], 2.73), nasal congestion (OR, 1.63), and sore throat (OR, 1.37) increased the likelihood of picornavirus infection; the presence of myalgia (OR, 0.71) and fever (OR, 0.59) decreased the likelihood. The positive and negative predictive values of the model were 61.5% and 64.4%, respectively. The model was simplified for clinical use by creating a whole-number index: the lowest possible score (-3) indicates a 15% chance of picornavirus infection and the highest (7) indicates a 69% chance of picornavirus infection.

### Rhinovirus and asthma: challenges and opportunities [^115gzAF6]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The respiratory viruses that have been linked with asthma exacerbations include rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enterovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and coronavirus. It is relevant to distinguish the type of respiratory infection considering the ongoing concerns with the COVID‐19 virus pandemic. Common human coronaviruses — not to be confused with the novel coronavirus, or SARS‐CoV‐2, currently circulating — can cause mild to moderate upper‐respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold. In fact, the majority of people will get infected with one or more of these viruses at some point in their lives; four common human coronaviruses cause 15%–30% of common colds.

Human RVs are small (27 nm), non‐enveloped, ssRNA viruses of the Picornaviridae family genus Enterovirus. The prevalence and spectrum of viral‐triggered exacerbations vary according to patient age and seasonality. Viral infection accounts for as many as 80% of exacerbations in childrenand more than 50% in adults. The prevalence of RV‐induced wheezing will likely continue to increase considering the prevalence of asthma, with an allergic component accounting for the majority of cases. It is important to emphasize that respiratory viruses act as triggers of wheezing. Despite improvements in asthma management and advances in therapeutics, the reported incidence of asthma exacerbations has not declined. Data from controlled clinical trials indicate that the development of asthma exacerbations in children as well as in adults are predictive of future exacerbations. Therefore, strategies enabling the management and control of viral‐induced events represent a priority to counter exacerbations linked to viral disease.

### Rhinovirus and asthma: challenges and opportunities [^116HQMQC]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

Human rhinoviruses (RVs) are the primary aetiological agent of the common cold. Generally, the associated infection is mild and self‐limiting, but may also be associated with bronchiolitis in infants, pneumonia in the immunocompromised and exacerbation in patients with pulmonary conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Viral infection accounts for as many as two thirds of asthma exacerbations in children and more than half in adults. Allergy and asthma are major risk factors for more frequent and severe RV‐related illnesses. The prevalence of RV‐induced wheezing will likely continue to increase given that asthma affects a significant proportion of the population, with allergic asthma accounting for the majority. Several new respiratory viruses and their subgroups have been discovered, with various degrees of relevance. This review will focus on RV infection in the context of the epidemiologic evidence, genetic variability, pathobiology, clinical studies in the context of asthma, differences with other viruses including COVID‐19 and current treatment interventions.

### Rhinoviruses and their receptors [^112TruRN]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Human rhinoviruses (RVs) are picornaviruses that can cause a variety of upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses, including the common cold, bronchitis, pneumonia, and exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma. There are currently > 160 known types of RVs classified into three species (A, B, and C) that use three different cellular membrane glycoproteins expressed in the respiratory epithelium to enter the host cell. These viral receptors are intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (used by the majority of RV-A and all RV-B types), low-density lipoprotein receptor family members (used by 12 RV-A types), and cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3; used by RV-C). RV-A and RV-B interactions with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and low-density lipoprotein receptor glycoproteins are well defined and their cellular functions have been described, whereas the mechanisms of the RV-C interaction with CDHR3 and its cellular functions are being studied. A single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6967330) in CDHR3 increases cell surface expression of this protein and, as a result, also promotes RV-C infections and illnesses. There are currently no approved vaccines or antiviral therapies available to treat or prevent RV infections, which is a major unmet medical need. Understanding interactions between RV and cellular receptors could lead to new insights into the pathogenesis of respiratory illnesses as well as lead to new approaches to control respiratory illnesses caused by RV infections.

### Rhinovirus and asthma: challenges and opportunities [^114aLHnq]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

8 CONCLUSIONS

At present there are no licensed antibodies for clinical use in RV infection, underscoring the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Many viruses, including RV, for which vaccines are not available, produce a significant impact on public health. Many of these viral targets could be classified as 'difficult' based on the fact that: (i) infection is not self‐limited, is associated with a high frequency of severe disease, and often leads to persistence; (ii) the virus has developed multiple mechanisms to alter and evade host immune responses, (iii) the host can be re‐infected; (iv) there is significant genetic variation; (v) the site of infection is the same as the major target organ for disease; (vi) there is integration of the viral genome or sequestration of the virus making it less accessible to immune effectors; (vii) animal models fail to recapitulate pathogenesis of human disease and (viii) there is a long delay between initiation of infection and onset of adaptive cellular immunity. Today we face global challenges with emerging viral diseases for which vaccines or antibody‐specific therapies would substantially benefit the public health. In particular, the current pandemic with COVID‐19 has tremendously accelerated the understanding of the science around viral disease, including the biology, diagnostics and antibody and vaccine development technologies. There is need for primary prevention through development of immuno‐prophylaxis interventions for patients with asthma and other respiratory diseases. In addition, drug‐discovery research must be accelerated to identify effective interventions that prevent RV infections and provide more practical approaches to disease prevention. Early detection of patients at risk as well as better understanding of the interactions between viral infection and the host is paramount. Designing novel treatments or preventive strategies for virus‐induced exacerbations across respiratory diseases could provide an invaluable therapeutic avenue for addressing a current unmet medical need.

### Heated, humidified air for the common cold [^1131rAXH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Heated, humidified air is used by common cold sufferers since the invention of the steam kettle. There is scientific literature available investigating this mode of therapy using a rhinotherm. The present reviews addresses to the use of hot, humid air in common cold.

Objectives

To assess the effects of inhaling heated water vapour with the help of a rhinotherm (an equipment designed to deliver heated water vapour to a person's nasal cavity), in the treatment of the common cold by comparing a. symptoms b. viral shedding c. nasal resistance after a natural or experimentally induced common cold.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE with MeSH headings: common cold, rhinopharyngitis, inhalation, steam, heated vapour, rhinothermy, till July 1999. EMBASE, Current Contents, review articles, cross references were also searched. Attempts were also made to contact the manufacturers for any unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials using heated water vapour in a standardized way in patients with the common cold or volunteers with experimental induction of rhinovirus infection were included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

All the articles retrieved were initially subjected to a review for inclusion / exclusion criteria. Review articles, editorials, abstracts with inadequate outcome description were excluded. Studies selected for inclusion were subjected to a methodological assessment.

Main Results

The results of a systematic review of six trials with 319 participants, support the use of warm vapour inhalations in the common cold in terms of relief of symptoms (Odds Ratio with 95% CI 0.31, 0.16–0.60, Relative risk 0.56, 0.4–0.79). Results on symptom score indices were equivocal. None of the studies demonstrated a worsening of clinical symptom scores. One study demonstrated increased nasal resistance one week after steam inhalation in contrast to an earlier study which showed improvement in the nasal resistance. There was no evidence of decreased viral shedding measured by virus isolation in the nasal secretions or measurement of viral titres in nasal washings among treatment group. The rhinovirus titres in the nasal washings from the treatment group were the same as those of the placebo group on day one prior to the treatment and on all four days after the treatment. The area under curve was also similar in the placebo and treatment groups for titres of virus in the nasal washings as were the average viral titres across five days of follow up, the maximum values after treatment, and viral shedding velocity i.e. amount of virus shed per day. Minor side effects due to thermal stress were reported in all the studies.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Three trials demonstrated beneficial effects on the symptoms of the common cold. One study from Israel showed a decrease in nasal resistance measured by peak nasal expiratory and inspiratory flow rate. Studies done in North America failed to show any objective improvement in outcome measures with the study intervention. A multi-centre double blind randomised controlled trial testing this therapy with uniform outcome measures is recommended.

### The human viral challenge model: accelerating the evaluation of respiratory antivirals, vaccines and novel diagnostics [^113C35pB]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of rhinoviral infection, along with other ARIs, in exacerbations of airway disease, has been investigated extensively. Impaired host responses to virus infection, a better understanding of the mechanisms of abnormal immune responses and the potential to develop novel therapeutic targets for virus-induced exacerbations have all used the HVC model.

Despite previous research work on multiple small molecule antivirals, such as pleconaril which have been tested using both the experimental challenge model and field studies, there is currently no licensed treatment for HRV infections Other compounds have been tested against HRV, such as Vapendavir (BTA798) which prevented the release of viral RNA into the target cell and demonstrated a reduction in peak viral load in the HVC model. A subsequent study in asthmatics was completed and although not published the compound did have a limited effect.

Pirodavir an intranasal capsid-binding molecule reached phase 3 clinical trials for HRV prevention and treatment in the 1990s. Although the compound decreased viral replication and shedding, it failed to show a significant reduction in the duration or severity of symptoms.

A Protease inhibitor, rupintrivir thats prevents cleavage of viral proteins required for replication was tested in an HRV challenge trial. Rupintrivir was well tolerated and reduced viral loads and respiratory symptoms. However, in studies of natural infection, it did not significantly affect viral loads or symptom severity.

Treatments such as zinc-containing products are now widely discredited as demonstrated by the withdrawal of a Cochrane report and JAMA editorial.

Current treatment of HRV infections primarily consists of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines to manage symptoms. There is also no licensed vaccine, and while there has been some progress on developing multivalent vaccines, development in this area is hampered by the sheer number of serotypes that need to be covered (at present over 160). Despite HRV being associated with up to 50% of adult asthma exacerbations and up to 80% of childhood exacerbations, there are no HRV-specific asthma therapies.

### Azelastine nasal spray for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^113QoozN]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In addition to SARS-CoV-2, azelastine nasal spray showed efficacy against symptomatic rhinovirus infection, the most frequently identified non–SARS-CoV-2 pathogen in this trial. Pharmacological evidence suggests that this effect may be mediated through inhibition of ICAM-1, a major receptor for rhinoviruses. Despite the significant effects of rhinovirus infection on global health, including causing upper respiratory infections and acute exacerbations of chronic pulmonary diseases, there are currently no therapies to treat or prevent rhinovirus infections.

Although the overall incidence of confirmed infections caused by other respiratory pathogens was low in this trial, the pooled analyses of human coronaviruses and all detected respiratory viruses suggest broader antiviral effects of azelastine. In-vitro studies provide evidence of the antiviral activity of azelastine beyond SARS-CoV-2, including endemic coronavirus, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. Although several modes of action have been described for direct anti–SARS-CoV-2 activities, including interactions with the host cells ACE2- and σ-1 receptors as well as the SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro, a specific panviral mechanism of action remains unknown and indeed a complex interplay of direct and indirect host-cell mediated inhibitory effects seems more likely. The nasal epithelium, as the primary site of viral entry and replication, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections. The ability of locally applied and locally acting azelastine nasal spray to significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 and overall upper respiratory tract infections underscores the efficacy of topical nasal interventions.

### A randomized trial of the efficacy of hand disinfection for prevention of rhinovirus infection [^115vah2f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hand disinfection is frequently recommended for prevention of rhinovirus (RV) infection and RV-associated common colds. The effectiveness of this intervention has not been established in a natural setting. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of hand disinfection on RV infection and RV-associated common cold illness in a natural setting.

Methods

A controlled clinical trial was done in young adult volunteers during 9 weeks of the fall 2009 RV season. Volunteers were randomized to either an antiviral hand treatment containing 2% citric acid and 2% malic acid in 62% ethanol (n = 116) or to a no-treatment control group (n = 96). The hand treatment was applied every 3 hours while the subjects were awake. All volunteers kept a daily diary of symptoms and had a nasal lavage for polymerase chain reaction once each week and 2 additional lavages around the time of each common cold illness. The primary endpoint was the number of RV-associated illnesses. The incidence of RV infection and of common cold illnesses were evaluated as secondary endpoints.

Results

The hand treatment did not significantly reduce RV infection or RV-related common cold illnesses. The total number of common cold illnesses was significantly reduced in the intent-to-treat analysis, but this effect was not seen in the per protocol analysis.

Conclusions

In this study, hand disinfection did not reduce RV infection or RV-related common cold illnesses.

### How does rhinovirus cause the common cold cough? [^111Qx1fp]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cough is a common symptom associated with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). In some patients, coughing can persist leading to a syndrome known as postviral or postinfectious cough which is arbitrarily defined as lasting from 3 to 8 weeks, with normal chest radiograph findings. In some individuals, cough persists even longer, when it is termed a chronic cough. While a normal cough is a vital protective reflex preventing aspiration, cough hypersensitivity is the mechanism thought to underlie almost all types of pathological cough. This has been demonstrated in URTI.

Cough causes a plethora of complications affecting the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and respiratory systems, with far-reaching psychological, neurological and musculoskeletal effects. While there are many agents on the market to reduce the frequency of cough and aid in the clearance of mucus, a systematic review of over-the-counter preparations failed to recommend any available treatment. For example, the use of codeine in respiratory tract infection-associated cough was found to be no more effective than its vehicle, and prescription-only medications are often unsuitable for certain groups of individuals.

There are three metrics which are used to study cough: cough challenge, cough counting, and subjective end points such as visual analogue scale or quality of life. Cough challenge studies include the use of pro-tussive agents, such as capsaicin and citric acid, which stimulate transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels to induce cough.TRP channels have been popularised as pro-tussive irritant receptors. However, on account of repeated clinical trial failures in patients with chronic cough using both cough counting and subjective measures, TRPV1 and A1 antagonists as anti-tussives have failed to reach the clinic, and an unpublished RCT of inhaled TRPA1 antagonist GRC 17536 (personal communication AHM, 2015). A recent shift of focus now proposes that other channels and receptors, such as P2X receptors, different TRP channels including TRPV4 and TRPM8may be responsible for the observed hypersensitivity. It seems unlikely that one single channel, or receptor, is responsible for causing cough hypersensitivity in all participants in cases of postviral and chronic cough.

### A narrative review and expert opinion on immunity-targeted approaches in the management of viral upper respiratory tract infections [^117Kg3rv]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunomodulation needs to be discussed as it holds the potential of preventing the development of severe viral infections alongside their complications, primarily relating to microbial infections, as demonstrated in randomized clinical trials evaluating its preventive efficacy in populations with recurrent respiratory infections. This consensus paper has its strengths and limitations. The main strength of the present paper is that a board of international experts reviewed existing clinical literature and formulated a list of consensus statements that are scientifically and clinically relevant and valid. Additionally, the diverse clinical backgrounds of the expert group was another strength of this review, as the clinicians' expertise provides reliability to the consensus provided. The recommendations by this review are valuable as they have the potential to guide clinicians in their daily clinical practice to optimize treatment and thereby likely improve outcomes. The limitations of this review are that we reviewed and summarized a specific number of studies, no complete Cochrane-type literature search or AI analysis was performed. Furthermore, no animal experiments or in vitro studies were reviewed.

### Immunoglobulin treatment for hospitalised infants and young children with respiratory syncytial virus infection [^112k1tqw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Millions of children are hospitalised due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection every year. Treatment is supportive, and current therapies (e.g. inhaled bronchodilators, epinephrine, nebulised hypertonic saline, and corticosteroids) are ineffective or have limited effect. Respiratory syncytial virus immunoglobulin may be used prophylactically to prevent hospital admission from RSV-related illness. It may be considered for the treatment of established severe RSV infection or for treatment in an immunocompromised host, although it is not licensed for this purpose. It is unclear whether immunoglobulins improve outcomes when used as a treatment for established RSV infection in infants and young children admitted to hospital. This is an update of a review first published in 2019.

Objectives

To assess the effects of immunoglobulins for the treatment of RSV-proven lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children aged up to three years, admitted to hospital.

Search Methods

For this 2022 update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Specialised Register, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science (from inception to 2 December 2022) with no restrictions. We searched two trial registries for ongoing trials (to 2 December 2022) and checked the reference lists of reviews and included articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing immunoglobulins with placebo in hospitalised infants and children aged up to three years with laboratory-diagnosed RSV lower respiratory tract infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We assessed evidence certainty using GRADE.

Main Results

In total, we included eight trials involving 906 infants and children aged up to three years. We included one new trial in this update. The immunoglobulin preparations used in these trials included anti-RSV immunoglobulin and the monoclonal antibody preparations palivizumab and motavizumab. Five trials were conducted at single or multiple sites within a single high-income country (four in the USA, one in Qatar). Three trials included study sites in different countries. All three of these trials included study sites in one or more high-income countries (USA, Chile, New Zealand, Australia, Qatar), with two trials also including a study site in a middle-income country (Panama). Five of the eight trials were "supported" or "sponsored" by the trial drug manufacturers. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of immunoglobulins on mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 5.27; 4 studies, 309 participants). There were four deaths - two amongst 98 children receiving immunoglobulins, and two amongst 98 children receiving placebo. One additional death occurred in a fourth trial, however the study group of the child was not known and the data were not included in the analysis (very low-certainty evidence). The use of immunoglobulins in infants and children admitted to hospital with RSV proven LRTI probably results in little to no difference in the length of hospitalisation (mean difference (MD) -0.13 days, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.12; 6 studies, 737 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Immunoglobulins may result in little to no difference in the number of children who experience one or more adverse events of any severity or seriousness compared to placebo (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.78; 5 studies, 340 participants; low-certainty evidence) or the number of children who experience one or more adverse events judged by study investigators to be serious in nature, compared to placebo (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.79; 4 studies, 238 participants; low-certainty evidence). Certainty of evidence for secondary outcomes was low. This evidence suggests that use of immunoglobulins results in little to no difference in the need for, or duration of, mechanical ventilation and the need for, or duration of, supplemental oxygen. The use of immunoglobulins does not reduce the need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and when children are admitted to the ICU results in little to no difference in the duration of ICU stay.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain about the effect of immunoglobulins on mortality. We are moderately certain that use of immunoglobulins in hospitalised infants and children may result in little to no difference in the length of hospitalisation. Immunoglobulins may result in little to no difference in adverse events, the need for or duration of mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen, or admission to the intensive care unit, though we are less certain about this evidence and the true effect of immunoglobulins on these outcomes may differ markedly from the estimated effect observed in this review. All trials were conducted in high-income countries, and data from populations in which the rate of death from RSV infection is higher are lacking.

### Vaccines for the common cold [^111veCRt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We did not apply limits with respect to follow‐up periods. In future updates, we will consider at least 60 days of follow‐up. We only included RCTs that reported data about the incidence of the common cold.

Types of participants

Healthy people aged between 6 months and 90 years.

Types of interventions

Any vaccine that prevents the common cold, which protects against RSV, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, or adenovirus (non‐polio), irrespective of dose, schedule, or administration route, versus placebo. We excluded trials on the prevention of influenza A and B because influenza and the common cold are two different diseases (Jefferson 2012). See Appendix 3 for details.

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

Incidence of the common cold after vaccination, regardless of the causal agent determined by laboratory or clinical examination. In future updates, we will consider the incidence of the common cold as one of the primary outcomes, measured 60 days after the last dose of the vaccine.
Vaccine safety, i.e. adverse events ("any untoward medical occurrence that may present during treatment with a pharmaceutical product but which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment") and adverse drug reactions ("a response to a drug which is noxious, uninitiated and which occurs at doses normally used in men for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease, or for the modification of physiologic functions") (Nebeker 2004).
Mortality: vaccine related and all cause.

Secondary outcomes

We did not consider any secondary outcomes. In future updates, we will consider mortality as a secondary outcome.

### A narrative review and expert opinion on immunity-targeted approaches in the management of viral upper respiratory tract infections [^112RtWXY]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), such as rhinitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, and nasopharyngitis, are among the most widespread diseases in primary medical care. The primary causes of URTIs are viruses, including multiple strains of rhinovirus, influenza virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and enterovirus.

Each respiratory virus elicits a distinct immune response, influenced by its unique structural and functional characteristics. Figure 1 presents a comparative analysis of the immune responses elicited by the influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2.

Approximately 200 viral strains cause URTI, with viral incubation usually lasting two to four days. Bacterial colonization can follow a viral infection, aggravating the disease and resulting in a lengthened recovery period and evolution with complications.

The most prevalent symptoms of URTIs are cough, sore throat, nasal obstruction, fever and headache. Despite such conditions being mainly self-limiting and nonfatal, the accompanying symptoms can cause significant impairment to one's productivity and quality of life. Recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) are typical clinical conditions in adults and children.

URTIs are more prevalent during winter months, as the causative pathogens are transmitted either via aerosolized droplets or contaminated secretions, which can subsequently invade one's eyes or the respiratory epithelium. Crowded places, such as schools or daycare facilities, are therefore favorable environments for transmitting respiratory pathogens.

Considering the widespread effects of URTIs on the well-being and quality of life of adults and children around the world, a narrative review and expert opinion on approaches to their management is warranted. In the present review, a multinational group of experts in the field of viral infections of the respiratory tract has investigated these diseases and proposed treatments that may reduce the negative clinical and monetary impact of URTIs on children, adults, and society.

### Challenges and opportunities in developing respiratory syncytial virus therapeutics [^1137BFnb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

RSV infections are a leading cause of acute and chronic disease in children and adults. Compared with those for HIV and hepatitis C virus, industry explorations of therapies for RSV infections have been limited. Several potent and selective antiviral compounds have been identified but generally have yet to pass through phase II trials to show antiviral evidence in humans. Development may have been slowed by a range of mistaken assumptions and dogma, for example, about the size and fragmentation of the potential market, the presumed difficulty of diagnosis, and the unfortunate previous belief that antivirals will not work because RSV disease is driven by delayed host inflammatory processes. The complexity of the route to market and the lack of a pathfinder are also potential obstacles. On the other hand, the absence of an existing RSV antiviral therapy and the large unmet medical need provides opportunity and the freedom to establish new pathways of evaluation and study.
