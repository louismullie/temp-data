## Question

What is the dose of tenecteplase in 80 yo male with STEMI, weight 66 kg

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate tenecteplase dose for an 80-year-old male with STEMI who weighs 66 kg. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard weight-based dosing for STEMI. Then, I should verify how age modifies dosing, especially in patients 75 years and older. Next, I will calculate the exact dose for 66 kg and confirm the administration details. Finally, I should review the supporting evidence and reconcile any conflicting guidance, including antithrombotic co-therapy considerations.

> Let me first confirm the standard weight-based dosing for STEMI. Tenecteplase is dosed as a single IV bolus according to weight bands: 30 mg if less than 60 kg, 35 mg if 60–69 kg, 40 mg if 70–79 kg, 45 mg if 80–89 kg, and 50 mg if 90 kg or more, with a maximum of 50 mg, and it is administered over 5 seconds [^113QuHCj] [^115W3bw7] [^115W3bw7].

> Wait, let me verify the age-related modification. In patients aged 75 years or older, the risk of intracranial hemorrhage with full-dose fibrinolysis is increased, so guidelines and pivotal trials recommend reducing the tenecteplase dose by 50% in this population to mitigate bleeding risk while preserving efficacy in a pharmaco-invasive strategy [^1157vMhN] [^112u5HuF] [^116QjjFu].

> I should double-check the exact calculation for 66 kg. At 66 kg, the standard full dose would be 35 mg. Applying the 50% reduction for age 80 years, the correct dose is 17.5 mg as a single IV bolus over 5 seconds [^113QuHCj] [^115W3bw7] [^1157vMhN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about administration details. I need to ensure antithrombotic co-therapy is aligned with best practice. Aspirin 150–325 mg should be given as soon as possible, followed by 150–325 mg daily, and unfractionated heparin should be administered with weight-adjusted dosing: 4000 units IV bolus then 800 units per hour if 67 kg or less, or 5000 units IV bolus then 1000 units per hour if greater than 67 kg, with infusion continued 48–72 hours and aPTT titrated to 50–75 seconds [^115W3bw7] [^113kDp29].

> Let me consider the evidence base supporting half-dose in the elderly. The STREAM trial demonstrated that halving the tenecteplase dose in patients 75 years or older reduced intracranial hemorrhage from 7.1% to 0% without compromising ST-resolution or clinical outcomes, and STREAM-2 confirmed comparable efficacy and safety of a half-dose pharmaco-invasive strategy versus primary PCI in older adults, albeit with a small absolute increase in ICH risk that was largely attributable to protocol violations and excess anticoagulation [^112u5HuF] [^116Dsc6S] [^117SaWfx].

> But wait, what if I mistakenly applied the stroke dosing schema instead of STEMI dosing. I should confirm that stroke dosing is entirely different and not relevant here; stroke uses 0.25 mg/kg with a maximum of 25 mg, which would be about 16.5 mg in a 66 kg patient, but that is not the correct regimen for STEMI, where the weight-band dosing with age-based reduction applies [^115W3bw7] [^117WMmTL].

> Final answer: For an 80-year-old male with STEMI weighing 66 kg, the recommended tenecteplase dose is 17.5 mg IV as a single bolus over 5 seconds, with aspirin and weight-adjusted unfractionated heparin per protocol, and this strategy balances efficacy and safety in elderly patients when timely primary PCI is not available [^113QuHCj] [^112H6H8T] [^1157vMhN] [^115W3bw7].

---

The recommended tenecteplase dose for an 80-year-old male with STEMI and a weight of 66 kg is **17.5 mg IV bolus** [^113QuHCj] [^112H6H8T], administered as a single bolus over 5 seconds [^115W3bw7]. This is a **half-dose regimen** [^1157vMhN] because patients aged ≥ 75 years have an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage with full-dose fibrinolysis [^112u5HuF]; the half-dose maintains efficacy while reducing bleeding risk [^117SaWfx]. Ensure concurrent aspirin and anticoagulation per protocol, and proceed to coronary angiography with PCI as indicated [^115W3bw7] [^116QjjFu].

## Standard dosing protocol for tenecteplase in STEMI

Tenecteplase dosing for STEMI is **weight-based** [^115W3bw7], with the following standard regimen:

| **Patient weight** | **Tenecteplase dose** |
|-|-|
| < 60 kg | 30 mg |
| 60–69 kg | 35 mg |
| 70–79 kg | 40 mg |
| 80–89 kg | 45 mg |
| ≥ 90 kg | 50 mg |

---

Maximum dose: 50 mg [^115W3bw7]. Administration: single IV bolus over 5 seconds [^115W3bw7].

---

## Age-related dose adjustment

Patients aged ≥ 75 years have a higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with fibrinolytic therapy [^112u5HuF]. To mitigate this risk, **guidelines recommend reducing the tenecteplase dose by 50%** in this population [^1157vMhN] [^117SaWfx]. This adjustment balances efficacy and safety, maintaining reperfusion benefits while significantly reducing bleeding complications [^116Dsc6S].

---

## Calculation of tenecteplase dose for the patient

Given the patient's weight of 66 kg, the standard full dose would be **35 mg** [^113QuHCj]. Applying the 50% reduction for age ≥ 75 years, the adjusted dose is **17.5 mg** [^1157vMhN].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dose adjustment

The STREAM trial demonstrated that **half-dose tenecteplase** in patients aged ≥ 75 years reduced intracranial hemorrhage from 7.1% to 0% without compromising reperfusion efficacy or clinical outcomes [^112u5HuF]. Subsequent analyses confirmed comparable efficacy between half-dose and full-dose regimens in elderly patients, with improved safety profiles [^117SaWfx].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and precautions

- **Aspirin**: 150–325 mg as soon as possible, followed by 150–325 mg daily [^115W3bw7].
- **Anticoagulation**: unfractionated heparin (UFH) or enoxaparin is recommended concurrently with tenecteplase to prevent reocclusion [^115W3bw7] [^116ytMN3].
- **Monitoring**: close observation for bleeding complications, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, is essential [^115hYbdf].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Tenecteplase dose**: 17.5 mg IV bolus over 5 seconds [^115W3bw7].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: aspirin and anticoagulation per protocol [^115W3bw7].
- **Follow-up**: immediate transfer for coronary angiography and PCI as indicated [^116QjjFu].

---

The recommended tenecteplase dose for an 80-year-old male with STEMI and a weight of 66 kg is **17.5 mg IV bolus** [^113QuHCj], reflecting a 50% dose reduction to minimize intracranial hemorrhage risk in elderly patients [^1157vMhN]. This approach is supported by clinical evidence demonstrating maintained efficacy with improved safety [^117SaWfx].

### Tenecteplase for treatment of acute myocardial infarction [^1158G1PR]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of tenecteplase in reducing mortality associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Data Sources

Published articles were identified from MEDLINE (from 1966 to December 2000) and Current Contents (all sections) searches.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Dose-ranging and pivotal studies were included for analysis in the clinical trials section.

Data Synthesis

Tenecteplase is a third-generation thrombolytic indicated for the reduction of mortality associated with AMI. Tenecteplase has a longer half-life that allows for single-dose, intravenous bolus administration. Data from clinical trials support that tenecteplase is similar to alteplase in reducing 30-day mortality rates in patients who have had an AMI. In the ASSENT-2 (Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic) trial, patients treated with tenecteplase required fewer blood transfusions and experienced fewer episodes of noncerebral bleeding compared with those treated with alteplase.

Conclusions

Tenecteplase is an effective thrombolytic agent for the treatment of AMI. It can be given as a single weight-based dose; however, it appears to offer no significant advantage over other agents in terms of its efficacy or rate of intracranial hemorrhage.

### Reduced dose tenecteplase and outcomes in elderly ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients: insights from the STrategic reperfusion early after myocardial infarction trial [^112u5HuF]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Elderly patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have worse outcomes and a greater risk of intracranial bleeding than nonelderly patients. Baseline characteristics, clinical outcomes, and the relationship of the tenecteplase (TNK) dose reduction to the efficacy, safety, and electrocardiographic indicators of reperfusion efficacy were evaluated in STEMI patients ≥ 75 years.

Methods

The STREAM trial evaluated early presenting STEMI patients who could not undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention within 1 hour of first medical contact. Because of excess intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients ≥ 75 years, the dose of TNK was reduced by 50%.

Results

Before dose amendment, there were 3 (7.1%) of 42 elderly patients with ICH; 2 of these were fatal, whereas no ICH occurred in the 93 elderly patients who received half-dose TNK postamendment. The median extent of ST-segment elevation resolution (≥ 50%) and proportion of patients with ≥ 2 mm in the electrocardiogram lead with greatest ST-segment elevation was comparable in elderly patients preamendment and postamendment (63.2% vs 56.0% and 43.6% vs 40.0%, respectively). Patients requiring rescue coronary intervention after TNK was also similar (42.9% vs 44.1%). The primary composite end point (30-day all-cause death, cardiogenic shock, congestive heart failure, and reinfarction) was 31.0% before versus 24.7% postamendment.

Conclusions

Our data, from a modest-sized population of elderly STEMI patients, indicate that half-dose TNK reduces the likelihood of ICH without compromising reperfusion efficacy. These observations are hypothesis generating and warrant further confirmation in randomized clinical trials in the elderly.

12. 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution In patients with STEMI, TNKase administered as a single IV bolus exhibits a biphasic disposition from the plasma. Volume of distribution at central compartment ranges from 4. 22 to
5. 43 L. approximating plasma volume. Steady-state volume of distribution was approximately 50% greater, suggestive of some extravascular distribution.

Elimination After IV bolus administration, the terminal phase half-life of tenecteplase was 90 to 130. All patients were to receive 150–325 mg of aspirin administered as soon as possible, followed by 150–325 mg daily. Intravenous heparin was to be administered as soon as possible: for patients weighing ≤ 67 kg, heparin was administered as a 4000-. unit IV bolus followed by infusion at 800 U/hr; for patients weighing > 67 kg, heparin was administered as a 5000-unit IV bolus followed by infusion at 1000 U/hr. Heparin was continued for 48 to 72 hours with infusion adjusted to maintain aPTT at 50–75 seconds. additional uncontrolled safety study of 3, 235 TNKase-treated patients, provided the framework to develop a weight-tiered TNKase dose regimen. Exploratory analyses suggested that a weight-adjusted dose of 0. 5 to
0. 6 mg/kg of TNKase resulted in a better patency to bleeding relationship than fixed doses of TNKase across a broad range.

### STREAM-2: half-dose tenecteplase or primary percutaneous coronary intervention in older patients with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a randomized, open-label trial [^116Dsc6S]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) guidelines recommend pharmaco-invasive treatment if timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is unavailable. Full-dose tenecteplase is associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage in older patients. Whether pharmaco-invasive treatment with half-dose tenecteplase is effective and safe in older patients with STEMI is unknown.

Methods

STREAM-2 (Strategic Reperfusion in Elderly Patients Early After Myocardial Infarction) was an investigator-initiated, open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients ≥ 60 years of age with ≥ 2 mm ST-segment elevation in 2 contiguous leads, unable to undergo primary PCI within 1 hour, were randomly assigned (2:1) to half-dose tenecteplase followed by coronary angiography and PCI (if indicated) 6 to 24 hours after randomization, or to primary PCI. Efficacy end points of primary interest were ST resolution and the 30-day composite of death, shock, heart failure, or reinfarction. Safety assessments included stroke and nonintracranial bleeding.

Results

Patients were assigned to pharmaco-invasive treatment (n = 401) or primary PCI (n = 203). Median times from randomization to tenecteplase or sheath insertion were 10 and 81 minutes, respectively. After last angiography, 85.2% of patients undergoing pharmaco-invasive treatment and 78.4% of patients undergoing primary PCI had ≥ 50% resolution of ST-segment elevation; their residual median sums of ST deviations were 4.5 versus 5.5 mm, respectively. Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3 at last angiography was ≈87% in both groups. The composite clinical end point occurred in 12.8% (51/400) of patients undergoing pharmaco-invasive treatment and 13.3% (27/203) of patients undergoing primary PCI (relative risk, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.62–1.48]). Six intracranial hemorrhages occurred in the pharmaco-invasive arm (1.5%): 3 were protocol violations (excess anticoagulation in 2 and uncontrolled hypertension in 1). No intracranial bleeding occurred in the primary PCI arm. The incidence of major nonintracranial bleeding was low in both groups (< 1.5%).

Conclusions

Halving the dose of tenecteplase in a pharmaco-invasive strategy in this early-presenting, older STEMI population was associated with electrocardiographic changes that were at least comparable to those after primary PCI. Similar clinical efficacy and angiographic end points occurred in both treatment groups. The risk of intracranial hemorrhage was higher with half-dose tenecteplase than with primary PCI. If timely PCI is unavailable, this pharmaco-invasive strategy is a reasonable alternative, provided that contraindications to fibrinolysis are observed and excess anticoagulation is avoided.

### Safety of the weight-adjusted dosing regimen of tenecteplase in the ASSENT-trial [^117KeQ5s]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

The results of the ASsessment of Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic agent (ASSENT-2) trial revealed that tenecteplase (TNK) is equivalent to tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) for treating myocardial infarction. Because careful consideration of safety is important with all agents, including the newer bolus therapies, and across a range of doses, this study evaluated the safety of TNK compared with t-PA across a range of weight and dose categories. The 5 doses of TNK ranged from 30 to 50 mg and were adjusted for estimated weight. Rates of death and intracranial hemorrhage were determined among patients receiving TNK and t-PA in ASSENT-2, stratified by categories of estimated weight corresponding to each TNK dose. Respective rates of death with TNK versus t-PA were not significantly different in any estimated weight category: < 60 kg (12.54% vs 11.46%), 60 to 69 kg (8.22% vs. 8.97%), 70 to 79 kg (5.57% vs 5.48%), 80 to 89 kg (4.66% vs 5.36%), and ≥ 90 kg (4.91% vs. 3.96%, all p ≥ 0.26). Respective rates of intracranial hemorrhage were also not significantly different: < 60 kg (2.20% vs. 2.29%), 60 to 69 kg (0.97% vs. 1.33%), 70 to 79 kg (1.15% vs. 1.10%), 80 to 89 kg (0.73% vs 0.49%), and ≥ 90 kg (0.47% vs 0.47%, all p ≥ 0.33). Adjustment for small baseline differences in this randomized sample did not change the results. Thus, across the range of estimated weight categories corresponding to each TNK dose, TNK is as safe and effective as t-PA.

### Issues in the assessment of the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase (TNK-tPA) [^111yKJuv]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

While thrombolytic agents have demonstrated improved mortality over the use of placebo, this has come at the expense of bleeding complications such as intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Tenecteplase (TNK-tPA) is a novel thrombolytic agent engineered to improve upon the ease of use and safety of alteplase (t-PA). Given its longer half-life, TNK-tPA can be administered as a single bolus. The dosing of TNK-tPA has been weight optimized to enhance both safety and efficacy outcomes. Weight-optimized TNK-tPA dosing requires body weight estimation, which may introduce the potential for medication error. However, data from TNK-tPA clinical trials suggest that body weight estimates can err by up to 20 kg (44 lb) without an increased risk of ICH or death. Furthermore, the results of TNK-tPA clinical trials showed that even at the highest weight-optimized dosage of 50 mg, ICH rates were among the lowest reported in clinical trials of thrombolytics for acute myocardial infarction. In elderly female patients of low body weight, the use of weight-optimized TNK-tPA lowered the risk of ICH compared with the use of t-PA, expanding the potential use of thrombolytics to this high-risk patient population. Tenecteplase has demonstrated clinical equivalence to t-PA, but with a wider therapeutic margin of safety.

ASSENT-2

The Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic (ASSENT-2) study was an international, randomized, double-blind trial that compared 30-day mortality rates in 16,949 patients assigned to receive an IV bolus dose of TNKase or an accelerated infusion of Activase®(alteplase). Eligibility criteria included onset of chest pain within 6 hours of randomization and ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram (ECG). Patients were to be excluded from the trial if they received GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors within the previous 12 hours. TNKase was dosed using actual or estimated weight in a weight-tiered fashion as described in Dosage and Administration (2.1). All patients were to receive 150–325 mg of aspirin administered as soon as possible, followed by 150–325 mg daily. Intravenous heparin was to be administered as soon as possible: for patients weighing ≤ 67 kg, heparin was administered as a 4000-unit IV bolus followed by infusion at 800 U/hr; for patients weighing > 67 kg, heparin was administered as a 5000-unit IV bolus followed by infusion at 1000 U/hr. Heparin was continued for 48 to 72 hours with infusion adjusted to maintain aPTT at 50–75 seconds. The use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors was discouraged for the first 24 hours following randomization. The results of the primary endpoint (30-day mortality rates with non-parametric adjustment for the covariates of age, Killip class, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and infarct location) along with selected other 30-day endpoints are shown in Table 2.

Rates of mortality and the combined endpoint of death or stroke among pre-specified subgroups, including age, gender, time to treatment, infarct location, and history of previous myocardial infarction, demonstrate consistent relative risks across these subgroups. There was insufficient enrollment of non-Caucasian patients to draw any conclusions regarding relative efficacy in racial subsets.

Rates of in-hospital procedures, including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), stent placement, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) use, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, were similar between the TNKase and Activase (alteplase) groups.

Results

Study Population

A total of 205 patients (phase 1b: 48, phase 2a: 157; median [IQR] age, 71 [60–77] years; 92 female [44.9%]; 113 male [55.1%]) were enrolled and analyzed. Between July 2023 and December 2023, 48 patients were enrolled in phase 1b at 7 sites and assigned to receive the dose-escalation groups. Fourteen patients were enrolled for the first tier and received a tenecteplase dose of 0.0313 mg/kg; 1 patient experienced sICH within 24 hours. Therefore, the next dose level of 0.0625 mg/kg was implemented, enrolling 14 patients. However, 2 of 14 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity. Subsequently, 8 additional patients were enrolled at the same dose, and no sICH occurred. When increasing the dose to 0.1250 mg/kg, 3 of 12 enrolled participants experienced sICH. Having exceeded the safety threshold, that dose was deemed not tolerated, and the immediately preceding dose was deemed the estimated maximum tolerated dose. Accordingly, the tenecteplase doses of 0.0313 mg/kg and 0.0625 mg/kg advanced to exploration in phase 2a. Patients flows for both study phases are shown in Figure 1, and the characteristics of the phase 1b population by group are listed in eTable 1 in Supplement 3. Baseline characteristics of the pooled analysis are in eTable 2 in Supplement 3.

### Efficacy and safety of two unfractionated heparin dosing strategies with tenecteplase in acute myocardial infarction (results from assessment of the safety and efficacy of a new thrombolytic regimens 2 and 3) [^116b5Tg3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

We investigated the effect of smaller dose, weight-adjusted heparin with earlier monitoring of activated partial thromboplastin time on the incidence of ischemic and hemorrhagic complications in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with full-dose tenecteplase. We compared the outcomes of patients enrolled in the Second Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic Regimen (ASSENT-2; n = 8,461) who received heparin stratified by weight (patients weighing > 67 kg received a 5,000-U bolus plus infusion at 1,000 U/hour; those weighing ≤ 67 kg received a 4,000-U bolus plus infusion at 800 U/hour) with patients in ASSENT-3 who received weight-adjusted heparin (60-U/kg bolus, maximum 4,000 U/hour, followed by a 12-U/kg/hour infusion, maximum 1,000 U/hour). Compared with patients in ASSENT-2, those in ASSENT-3 had similar rates of 30-day mortality, recurrent infarction, and intracranial hemorrhage, less major bleeding (2.2% vs 4.7%, p < 0.001), and less refractory ischemia (6.5% vs 8.6%, p < 0.001). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, patients in ASSENT-3 had similar rates of 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.19) and intracranial hemorrhage (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.69) but less major bleeding (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.67) than did patients in ASSENT-2. These findings support the use of smaller dose, weight-adjusted heparin in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with tenecteplase.

### Efficacy and safety of tenecteplase in combination with the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin in the prehospital setting: the assessment of the safety and efficacy of a new thrombolytic regimen (ASSENT)-3 PLUS randomized trial in acute myocardial infarction [^112GD5PS]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The combination of a single-bolus fibrinolytic and a low-molecular-weight heparin may facilitate prehospital reperfusion and further improve clinical outcome in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

Methods and Results

In the prehospital setting, 1639 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were randomly assigned to treatment with tenecteplase and either (1) intravenous bolus of 30 mg enoxaparin (ENOX) followed by 1 mg/kg subcutaneously BID for a maximum of 7 days or (2) weight-adjusted unfractionated heparin (UFH) for 48 hours. The median treatment delay was 115 minutes after symptom onset (53% within 2 hours). ENOX tended to reduce the composite of 30-day mortality or in-hospital reinfarction, or in-hospital refractory ischemia to 14.2% versus 17.4% for UFH (P = 0.080), although there was no difference for this composite end point plus in-hospital intracranial hemorrhage or major bleeding (18.3% versus 20.3%, P = 0.30). Correspondingly, there were reductions in in-hospital reinfarction (3.5% versus 5.8%, P = 0.028) and refractory ischemia (4.4% versus 6.5%, P = 0.067) but increases in total stroke (2.9% versus 1.3%, P = 0.026) and intracranial hemorrhage (2.20% versus 0.97%, P = 0.047). The increase in intracranial hemorrhage was seen in patients > 75 years of age.

Conclusions

Prehospital fibrinolysis allows 53% of patients to receive reperfusion treatment within 2 hours after symptom onset. The combination of tenecteplase with ENOX reduces early ischemic events, but lower doses of ENOX need to be tested in elderly patients. At present, therefore, tenecteplase and UFH are recommended as the routine pharmacological reperfusion treatment in the prehospital setting.

### Primary angioplasty vs. fibrinolysis in very old patients with acute myocardial infarction: TRIANA (TRatamiento del infarto agudo de miocardio eN ancianos) randomized trial and pooled analysis with previous studies [^117Qwrqu]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Fibrinolysis group

Immediately after randomization, a weight-adjusted single intravenous dose of tenecteplase (TNK) was given ranging from 30 mg in patients < 60 kg to 50 mg in those weighting ≥ 90 kg. Simultaneously, a 60 units/kg bolus of unfractionated heparin was administered up to a maximum of 4000 units followed by an infusion of 12 units/kg/h (up to a maximum of 1000 units/h) with an initial adjustment to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time 1.5–2 times the upper normal limit. Based on the results of the COMMIT trial, clopidogrel 75 mg daily without loading dose was added since January 2007. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was routinely performed 90 min after lytic administration, and urgent coronary angiography indicated if there were no signs of coronary reperfusion. The use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was discouraged if rescue PCI was needed. After reperfusion, the use of coronary angiography was recommended only when there was evidence of spontaneous or induced recurrent myocardial ischaemia.

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention group

Patients were transferred to the cath lab as soon as possible. Both coronary arteries were visualized; left ventriculography was not performed routinely. Coronary angioplasty was performed at the investigator's discretion using any approved techniques and devices. Only the culprit vessel was targeted for pPCI. At the beginning of the procedure, a bolus of 60 units/kg of unfractionated heparin (with a maximum of 4000 units) was administered. Patients who received a stent were treated with clopidogrel, 300 mg loading dose given immediately before implantation, and 75 mg daily with a variable duration according to the type of stent. Use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was discretionary. Concomitant medication such as aspirin, β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, statins, or others were given according to the guidelines.

The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of the combination of all-cause mortality, re-infarction, or disabling stroke at 30 days after randomization. Secondary endpoints were the incidences of major bleeding, recurrent ischaemia requiring urgent catheterization, all-cause mortality, and cause of death at 30 days, and time elapsed until presentation of any component of the composite endpoint at 12 months.

Event adjudication and operational definitions

All major events were centrally adjudicated by an independent expert committee (Appendix 1) blinded to the treatment received by the patients, using standardized definitions (Appendix 2).

Reperfusion therapy

Reperfusion strategy is defined as the therapy within 24 h of presentation (only one of the following may be recorded for any patient): No reperfusion therapy — when the patient does not receive any primary reperfusion (no PPCI and no Fibrinolytic); Fibrinolytic –when the patient receives fibrinolytic agent as a reperfusion strategy; PPCI — when the patient receives cardiac catheterisation with the intent to conduct PPCI including patients who were sent for angiogram but were unable to receive stent or balloon inflation.

All patients receive a loading dose of acetylsalicylic acid (> 160 mg). For the Fibrinolytic strategy: weight-adjusted tenecteplase (TNK), clopidogrel 300 mg loading dose (75 mg daily), and enoxaparin (30 mg intravenous and 1 mg/kg subcutaneous) are given. For patients ≥ 75 years the loading dose of clopidogrel and the intravenous enoxaparin are omitted, and the subcutaneous dose of enoxaparin is reduced to 0.75 mg/kg. For patients assigned to primary PCI clopidogrel 600 mg is given. Prehospital diagnosed and treated patients receive intravenous (30 mg) and subcutaneous (1 mg/kg) enoxaparin, and patients diagnosed in hospital typically receive unfractionated heparin (70 U/kg intravenous).

Study protocol

Data were collected by personnel who were blinded to the study objectives and recorded the same in specially designed electronic case report form (eCRF). Each patient was given a screening number to maintain anonymity. Demographic details and baseline characteristics of the patient population were documented meticulously. Relevant medical history, salient clinical examination findings, laboratory investigations including cardiac biomarkers, ECG and echocardiogram findings were noted. Details of medication prescribed were also collected. Patients who were fibrinolysed with TNK were in group A and patients who underwent primary PCI formed group B. Figure 1 depicts the study flow. In group A, the timing and dosage of TNK was documented, and TNK was administered as per the recommended dosage based on the body weight of the patient, 30 mg if the weight is < 60 kg, 35 mg if the weight is 60–70 kg, 40 mg if the weight is 70–80 kg, 45 mg if the weight is 80–90 kg and 50 mg if the weight is > 90 kg. In case of failed thrombolysis, rescue PCI was performed at the investigator's discretion. The time to a coronary angiogram (CAG) with or without intervention, time from symptom onset to hospital presentation, door-to-balloon time, door-to-needle time and total ischaemic time were documented. During the procedure, the access site, whether or not thrombosuction was performed, the number of vessels diseased, the number of vessels stented, the type of stent used, the reasons for not performing angioplasty if the procedure was not conducted, the procedure complications if any, the adjuvant medication, the use of intra-aortic balloon pulsation and the outcome of the procedure were noted. The IRA patency, TIMI flow in IRA preprocedure and postprocedure, thrombus burden and procedure success were evaluated by a blinded investigator. Bleeding events were classified using TIMI bleeding criteria.

### Tenecteplase (Tnkase) [^115CfYT5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Tenecteplase is a modified form of human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that binds to fibrin and converts plasminogen to plasmin. In the presence of fibrin, in vitro studies demonstrate that tenecteplase-mediated conversion of plasminogen to plasmin is increased relative to its conversion in the absence of fibrin. This fibrin specificity decreases systemic activation of plasminogen and the resulting degradation of circulating fibrinogen as compared to a molecule lacking this property. The clinical significance of fibrin-specificity on safety (e.g., bleeding) or efficacy has not been established.

12.2	Pharmacodynamics

Following administration of 30, 40, or 50 mg of TNKase, there are decreases in circulating fibrinogen (4%–15%) and plasminogen (11%–24%).

12.3	Pharmacokinetics

Distribution

In patients with STEMI, TNKase administered as a single IV bolus exhibits a biphasic disposition from the plasma.

Volume of distribution at central compartment ranges from 4.22 to 5.43 L, approximating plasma volume. Steady-state volume of distribution was approximately 50% greater (6.12 to 8.01 L), suggestive of some extravascular distribution.

Elimination

After IV bolus administration, the terminal phase half-life of tenecteplase was 90 to 130 minutes. In 99 of 104 patients treated with TNKase, TNKase has linear PK with mean maximum concentrations increased in a dose-proportional manner and mean plasma clearance was similar for the 30, 40, and 50 mg doses ranging from 99 to 119 mL/min.

Metabolism

Liver metabolism is the major clearance mechanism for tenecteplase.

Body weight

A stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that total body weight explained 19% of the variability in plasma clearance and 11% of the variability in volume of distribution.

Emergency CABG and rescue PCI in STEMI — supportive text: The document states that "The mortality rate associated with emergency CABG and surgical management of a mechanical complication of STEMI remains high", yet "CABG and these associated procedures may be necessary to treat the mechanical complications of STEMI or cardiogenic shock in the emergency setting". It further notes, "No RCT has examined the benefit of adding CABG at the time of emergent cardiac surgery for treatment of a mechanical complication of STEMI versus emergent surgery for the treatment of a mechanical complication alone", and "no RCT has examined the benefit of emergent cardiac surgery… versus initial medical stabilization and delayed surgery". For failed fibrinolysis, "Rescue PCI performed in patients with evidence of failed reperfusion after fibrinolytic therapy has been associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events, when compared with conservative care or repeat fibrinolysis", though "patients randomized to rescue PCI had higher rates of bleeding and cerebrovascular accident". These studies were in the "era of femoral artery access", and concerns "could be mitigated by using half-dose tenecteplase in patients > 75 years of age", by radial access, or by eliminating routine glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors.

### Tenecteplase (Tnkase) [^113d6oHp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ASSENT 4 PCI

The Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Treatment Strategy with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (ASSENT 4 PCI) was a phase IIIb/IV study designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of a strategy of administering full dose TNKase with a single bolus of 4000 U of unfractionated heparin in patients with STEMI, in whom primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was planned, but in whom a delay of 1–3 hours was anticipated before PCI. The trial was prematurely terminated with 1667 randomized patients (75 of whom were in the United States) due to a numerically higher mortality in the patients receiving TNKase prior to primary PCI versus PCI without TNKase (median time from randomization to balloon was 115 minutes in patients who were treated with TNKase plus PCI versus 107 minutes in patients who were treated with PCI alone). The incidence of the 90-day primary endpoint, a composite of death or cardiogenic shock or congestive heart failure (CHF) within 90 days, was 18.6% in patients treated with TNKase plus PCI versus 13.4% in those treated with PCI alone (p = 0.0045; RR 1.39 (95% CI 1.11–1.74)).

There were trends toward worse outcomes in the individual components of the primary endpoint between TNKase plus PCI versus PCI alone (mortality 6.7% vs. 4.9%, respectively; cardiogenic shock 6.3% vs. 4.8%, respectively; and CHF 12.0% vs. 9.2%, respectively). In addition, there were trends towards worse outcomes in recurrent MI (6.1% vs. 3.7%, respectively; p = 0.03) and repeat target vessel revascularization (6.6% vs. 3.4%, respectively; p = 0.004) in patients receiving TNKase plus PCI versus PCI alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

There was no difference in in-hospital major bleeding between the two groups (5.6% vs. 4.4% for TNKase plus PCI vs. PCI alone, respectively). For patients treated with TNKase plus PCI, in-hospital rates of intracranial hemorrhage and total stroke were similar to those observed in previous trials (0.97% and 1.8%, respectively); however, none of the patients treated with PCI alone experienced a stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic or other).

### Primary versus tenecteplase-facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (ASSENT-4 PCI): randomised trial [^111tggrE]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is more effective than fibrinolytic therapy for ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI), but time to intervention can be considerable. Our aim was to investigate whether the administration of full-dose tenecteplase before a delayed PCI could mitigate the negative effect of this delay.

Methods

We did a randomised study in which we assigned patients with STEMI of less than 6 h duration (scheduled to undergo primary PCI with an anticipated delay of 1–3 h) to standard PCI (n = 838) or PCI preceded by administration of full-dose tenecteplase (n = 829). All patients received aspirin and a bolus, without an infusion, of unfractionated heparin. Our primary endpoint was death or congestive heart failure or shock within 90 days. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with, number NCT00168792.

Findings

We planned to enroll 4000 patients, but early cessation of enrollment was recommended by the data and safety monitoring board because of a higher in-hospital mortality in the facilitated than in the standard PCI group (6% [43 of 664] vs 3% [22 of 656], p = 0.0105). Of those enrolled, six were lost to follow-up in the facilitated PCI group and seven in the other group. Median time from randomisation to first balloon inflation was similar in both groups. The median time from bolus tenecteplase to first balloon inflation was 104 min. We noted the primary endpoint in 19% (151 of 810) of patients assigned facilitated PCI versus 13% (110 of 819) of those randomised to primary PCI (relative risk 1.39, 95% CI 1.11–1.74; p = 0.0045). During hospital stay, significantly more strokes (1.8% [15 of 829] vs 0, p < 0.0001), but not major non-cerebral bleeding complications (6% [46 of 829] vs 4% [37 of 838], p = 0.3118), were reported in patients assigned facilitated rather than standard PCI. We also noted more ischaemic cardiac complications, such as reinfarction (6% [49 of 805] vs 4% [30 of 820], p = 0.0279) or repeat target vessel revascularisation (7% [53 of 805] vs 3% [28 of 818], p = 0.0041) within 90 days in this study group.

Interpretation

A strategy of full-dose tenecteplase with antithrombotic co-therapy, as used in this study and preceding PCI by 1–3 h, was associated with more major adverse events than PCI alone in STEMI and cannot be recommended.

### Tenecteplase and tirofiban in ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction: results of a randomized trial [^1119Nk8d]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The combination of older reduced-dose fibrinolytic agents and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors has shown modest improvements in reperfusion and more striking improvements in ST-segment resolution after acute myocardial infarction. We performed a multicenter dose-ranging study of reduced doses of a newer fibrinolytic (tenecteplase) combined with tirofiban, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.

Methods

The first goal of the trial was to identify a dose or doses of tirofiban that, when combined with reduced-dose tenecteplase, would result in a higher incidence of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow at 60 minutes versus full-dose tenecteplase alone. The second goal was to assess whether the optimum dose(s) from the first stage also would result in greater resolution of ST-segment elevation.

Results

In all, 409 patients aged 18 to 75 years with myocardial infarction were enrolled. The incidence of TIMI grade 3 flow at 60 minutes did not differ significantly among dose groups, ranging from 50% to 68%. The corrected TIMI frame count likewise did not differ substantially (range 34–42). More patients given combined therapy had complete resolution of ST-segment elevation at 60 minutes compared with patients given tenecteplase alone. Major bleeding was infrequent, and no strokes occurred. Based on angiographic results of the first stage, the second planned stage of the study was not performed.

Conclusions

Although combination therapies were not associated with increased reperfusion compared with full-dose tenecteplase alone, similar TIMI flow grades were achieved despite reductions in tenecteplase doses. ST-segment resolution was more rapid and complete with combination therapy versus full-dose tenecteplase, suggesting enhanced microcirculatory perfusion to the infarct zone in this dose-ranging trial.

### Pharmaco-invasive strategy with half-dose tenecteplase in patients with STEMI: prespecified pooled analysis of patients aged ≥ 75 years in STREAM-1 and 2 [^117SaWfx]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In STREAM-1 (Strategic Reperfusion Early After Myocardial Infarction), excess intracranial hemorrhage occurred in patients aged ≥ 75 years receiving full-dose tenecteplase as part of a pharmaco-invasive strategy, whereas no further intracranial hemorrhage occurred after halving the tenecteplase dose. In STREAM-2 (Second Strategic Reperfusion Early After Myocardial Infarction), half-dose tenecteplase was an effective and safe pharmaco-invasive strategy in older patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction presenting within < 3 hours, compared with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We prespecified evaluating the efficacy and safety of a half-dose versus full-dose pharmaco-invasive strategy and compared the half-dose pharmaco-invasive strategy to primary PCI in patients aged ≥ 75 years.

Methods

We pooled data sets in patients aged ≥ 75 years from STREAM-1 and STREAM-2 receiving a pharmaco-invasive strategy versus primary PCI. Resolution of ST-segment-elevation after fibrinolysis and angiography was assessed, as was the relative risk of the primary composite of 30-day all-cause death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and shock, along with bleeding.

Results

A total of 390 patients were included: 42 patients were randomized to full-dose pharmaco-invasive treatment, 205 patients to half-dose pharmaco-invasive treatment, and 143 patients to primary PCI. Half-dose versus full-dose pharmaco-invasive treatment resulted in similar proportions of patients achieving ≥ 50% ST-segment resolution posttenecteplase (63.2% versus 62.6%), with reduced intracranial hemorrhage (7.1% versus 0%, respectively). Half-dose pharmaco-invasive treatment and primary PCI also had similar proportions of patients with ≥ 50% ST-segment resolution postangiography (77.9% versus 72.4%; P = 0.277) and comparable composite end points (23.4% versus 28.0%; relative risk, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.62–1.30]; P = 0.567) without occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage.

Conclusions

Comparable efficacy exists between half- and full-dose tenecteplase pharmaco-invasive treatments with improved safety in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction aged ≥ 75 years. Half-dose pharmaco-invasive therapy is a legitimate therapeutic option for elderly patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction unable to access timely primary PCI.

### Multicenter randomized trial of facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention with low-dose tenecteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction: the athens PCI trial [^113D8ju6]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the safety and efficacy of low-dose tenecteplase, administered before facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 2 or 3 blood flow in the infarct related artery (IRA) in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) scheduled to undergo PCI with a shortest anticipated delay of 30 min.

Background

PCI preceded by administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, full-dose thrombolytics, or both, is associated with no benefit or a higher incidence of adverse events than PCI alone.

Methods

Patients with STEMI < 6 hr in duration were randomly assigned to PCI preceded by tenecteplase, 10 mg (facilitated PCI group, n = 143) versus standard PCI (control group, n = 141). All patients received aspirin and unfractionated heparin (70 IU/kg bolus) at time of randomization. Both groups received IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the catheterization laboratory and for at least 20 hr after PCI.

Results

The median door-to-balloon time was 122 min (91–175) in the facilitated PCI versus 120 min (89–175) in the control group. IRA patency on arrival in the catheterization laboratory was 59.5% in the facilitated PCI (24% TIMI-2, 35% TIMI-3), versus 37% in the control (8% TIMI-2, 29% TIMI-3) group (P = 0.0001). During hospitalization, 9 patients (6%) died in the facilitated PCI versus 5 patients (3.5%) in the control group (P = 0.572). A single patient in the facilitated PCI group suffered a non-fatal ischemic stroke.

Conclusions

Facilitated PCI with low-dose tenecteplase in patients presenting with STEMI was associated with a high IRA patency rate before PCI.

### Efficacy and safety of tenecteplase in combination with enoxaparin, abciximab, or unfractionated heparin: the ASSENT-3 randomised trial in acute myocardial infarction [^116ytMN3]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Current fibrinolytic therapies fail to achieve optimum reperfusion in many patients. Low-molecular-weight heparins and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors have shown the potential to improve pharmacological reperfusion therapy. We did a randomised, open-label trial to compare the efficacy and safety of tenecteplase plus enoxaparin or abciximab, with that of tenecteplase plus weight-adjusted unfractionated heparin in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Methods

6095 patients with acute myocardial infarction of less than 6 h were randomly assigned one of three regimens: full-dose tenecteplase and enoxaparin for a maximum of 7 days (enoxaparin group; n = 2040), half-dose tenecteplase with weight-adjusted low-dose unfractionated heparin and a 12-h infusion of abciximab (abciximab group; n = 2017), or full-dose tenecteplase with weight-adjusted unfractionated heparin for 48 h (unfractionated heparin group; n = 2038). The primary endpoints were the composites of 30-day mortality, in-hospital reinfarction, or in-hospital refractory ischaemia (efficacy endpoint), and the above endpoint plus in-hospital intracranial haemorrhage or in-hospital major bleeding complications (efficacy plus safety endpoint). Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings

There were significantly fewer efficacy endpoints in the enoxaparin and abciximab groups than in the unfractionated heparin group: 233/2037 (11.4%) versus 315/2038 (15.4%; relative risk 0.74 [95% CI 0.63–0.87], p = 0.0002) for enoxaparin, and 223/2017 (11.1%) versus 315/2038 (15.4%; 0.72 [0.61–0.84], p < 0.0001) for abciximab. The same was true for the efficacy plus safety endpoint: 280/2037 (13.7%) versus 347/2036 (17.0%; 0.81 [0.70–0.93], p = 0.0037) for enoxaparin, and 287/2016 (14.2%) versus 347/2036 (17.0%; 0.84 [0.72–0.96], p = 0.01416) for abciximab.

Interpretation

The tenecteplase plus enoxaparin or abciximab regimens studied here reduce the frequency of ischaemic complications of an acute myocardial infarction. In light of its ease of administration, tenecteplase plus enoxaparin seems to be an attractive alternative reperfusion regimen that warrants further study.

### Thrombolytic therapy in patients of female gender [^114HuHmR]. Thrombosis Research (2001). Low credibility.

Results of surveys and clinical trials have indicated that prognosis of female patients with acute myocardial infarction is worse than prognosis of male patients. Female patients are on average older than male patients, have a longer patient delay, present more often with equivocal ECG abnormalities, and have more often contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Thrombolytic therapy is given less often to female patients with acute myocardial infarction than to male patients of the same age. This is only partly due to the absence of an indication for thrombolytic therapy or the presence of a contraindication. If thrombolytic therapy is given to female patients with acute myocardial infarction, this results in the same patency rate as in male patients. In the meta-analysis of the Fibrinolytic Therapy Trialists' Collaboration Group that included all randomised clinical trials that compared thrombolytic therapy with a placebo or control group, the absolute benefit of thrombolytic therapy with regard to 35-day mortality was 2.2% in female patients, higher than the observed absolute difference of 1.9% in male patients. In several studies age, gender, and body weight were identified as independent risk factors for the occurrence of stroke and bleeding complications after administration of thrombolytic therapy. Results of the ASSENT-2 study indicated that total stroke rate and 30-day mortality was lower in female patients over 75 years of age treated with tenecteplase than in those treated with alteplase, albeit that the difference was statistically not significant. With the data presently available it can be stated that female patients and patients over 75 years of age will probably benefit more from a thrombolytic agent that is given according to a weight-adjusted dose regimen, e.g., tenecteplase.

### Comparison of tenecteplase versus alteplase in STEMI patients treated with ticagrelor: a cross-sectional study [^111eSZze]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The effectiveness and safety of administration of ticagrelor simultaneously with fibrinolytic agents in STEMI patients remain unclear.

Objective

This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of tenecteplase against alteplase in patients with STEMI receiving a loading dose of ticagrelor.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional study in patients with STEMI who were reperfused with fibrinolytic. The study included 150 patients (ages 18 to 75 years) administered tenecteplase or alteplase and concomitantly given ticagrelor [180 mg loading dose, 90 mg bid (bis in die)]. Patients who had active major bleeding, died, and who were decided to have a CABG surgery as a result of coronary angiography were excluded. Patients who underwent facilitated-PCI with fibrinolysis continued to receive ticagrelor without switching to clopidogrel. The MACE (in-hospital death, TIMI flow grade, major bleeding) rates of the two groups were compared.

Results

The study consisted of 150 patients, comprising 99 (66%) men and 51 women (34%) with a mean age of 60,33 ± 13,83 years. Patients were divided into two groups according to the thrombolytic therapy: alteplase (n = 60) and tenecteplase (n = 90). The major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (45% vs 22.2%), bleeding (11.7% vs 2.2%), hypertension (51.7% vs 30%), atrial fibrillation (26.7% vs 12.2%), left ventricular hypertrophy (26.7% vs 10%), CRP (p < 0.001) were significantly higher and the recanalization (66.7% vs 85.4%), hematocrit (p = 0.03) were significantly lower in the alteplase group compared to the tenecteplase group. No significant differences were found between the two groups about in-hospital mortality (p = 0.151). Kaplan Meier analysis was performed in terms of MACE (TIMI flow grade 1, major bleeding, in-hospital mortality) rates during the follow-up period (Log-rank test, p = 0.032). Patients who received tenecteplase treatment had a lower MACE, according to a Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Conclusions

The administration of tenecteplase in STEMI patients who received a loading dose with ticagrelor resulted in a significant reduction in MACE compared to alteplase. Larger multi-center studies are warranted to investigate the effect of tenecteplase treatment on clinical results.

Timing and choice of fibrinolytic therapy in STEMI note that primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) remains the reperfusion modality of choice when it can be rapidly achieved, whereas the benefits of fibrinolytic therapy are well established with a time-dependent reduction in both mortality and morbidity during the initial 12 hours after symptom onset; the benefit in patients who present > 12 hours after symptom onset has not been established, although consideration should be given to administering a fibrinolytic agent in symptomatic patients presenting > 12 hours after symptom onset of STEMI with a large area of myocardium at risk or hemodynamic instability if PCI is unavailable; fibrin-specific fibrinolytic therapies are preferred over non–fibrin-specific agents; in a large randomized trial of acute myocardial infarction, tenecteplase and alteplase were equivalent for 30-day mortality, but tenecteplase was associated with reduced noncerebral bleeding.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to evaluate combinations of eptifibatide with reduced-dose tenecteplase (TNK) in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Background

Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors enhance thrombolysis. The role of combination therapy in clinical practice remains to be established.

Methods

Patients (n = 438) with STEMI < 6 h were enrolled. In dose-finding, 189 patients were randomized to different combinations of double-bolus eptifibatide and reduced-dose TNK. In dose-confirmation, 249 patients were randomized 1:1 to eptifibatide 180 microg/kg bolus, 2 microg/kg/min infusion, and 180 microg/kg bolus 10 min later (180/2/180) plus half-dose TNK (0.27 mg/kg) or standard-dose (0.53 mg/kg) TNK monotherapy. All patients received aspirin and unfractionated heparin (60 U/kg bolus; infusion 7 U/kg/h [combination], 12 U/kg/h [monotherapy]). The primary end point was Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 epicardial flow at 60 min.

Results

In dose-finding, TIMI grade 3 flow rates were similar across groups (64% to 68%). Arterial patency was highest for eptifibatide 180/2/180 plus half-dose TNK (96%, p = 0.02 vs. eptifibatide 180/2/90 plus half-dose TNK). In dose-confirmation, this combination, compared with TNK monotherapy, tended to achieve more TIMI 3 flow (59% vs. 49%, p = 0.15), arterial patency (85% vs. 77%, p = 0.17), and ST-segment resolution (median 71% vs. 61%, p = 0.08) but was associated with more major hemorrhage (7.6% vs. 2.5%, p = 0.14) and transfusions (13.4% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.02). Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 1.0%, 0.6%, and 1.7% of patients treated with any combination, eptifibatide 180/2/180 and half-dose TNK, and TNK monotherapy, respectively.

Conclusions

Double-bolus eptifibatide (180/2/180) plus half-dose TNK tended to improve angiographic flow and ST-segment resolution compared with TNK monotherapy but was associated with more transfusions and non-cerebral bleeding. Further study is needed before this combination can be recommended for general use.

### One-year follow-up of the ASSENT-2 trial: a double-blind, randomized comparison of single-bolus tenecteplase and front-loaded alteplase in 16, 949 patients with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction [^1129xvUz]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Single-bolus tenecteplase and accelerated alteplase were shown to be equivalent for 30-day mortality rates in the double-blind Assessment of the Safety of a New Thrombolytic (ASSENT-2) study. The aim of this study is to assess mortality rates after 1-year follow-up.

Methods and Results

One-year vital status was obtained from 92.8% of the patients initially enrolled in the ASSENT-2 trial. Completeness of follow-up was similar for both groups. At 1 year, mortality rates were 9.1% for alteplase and 9.2% for tenecteplase (risk ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.91–1.12). The mortality rate between 30 and 365 days after enrollment was 2.6% for alteplase and 2.8% for tenecteplase (risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.88–1.30). A lower 30-day mortality rate in patients treated with tenecteplase after 4 hours of symptom-onset persisted at 1-year follow-up (10.9% vs 12.6% for alteplase), but was no longer statistically significant. There were also no significant differences in mortality rates between the 2 treatments in other major subgroups. In a Cox regression model, no significant interaction was observed between treatment assignment and age, sex, time-to-treatment, Killip class, body weight, and history of previous myocardial infarction, infarction location, systolic blood pressure, or heart rate.

Conclusions

One year after randomization, mortality rates remain similar in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with an accelerated infusion of alteplase or a single bolus of tenecteplase.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Timing and choice of fibrinolytic therapy — PPCI remains the reperfusion modality of choice when it can be rapidly achieved in a patient with STEMI. When timely PPCI is not possible, fibrinolytic therapy has well-established benefits with a time-dependent reduction in both mortality and morbidity during the initial 12 hours after symptom onset. The benefit > 12 hours after symptom onset has not been established, although consideration should be given to administering a fibrinolytic agent in symptomatic patients presenting > 12 hours with a large area of myocardium at risk or hemodynamic instability if PCI is unavailable. Fibrin-specific fibrinolytic therapies are preferred over non–fibrin-specific agents due to superior patency rates and less immunogenicity, and in a large randomized trial in AMI, tenecteplase and alteplase were equivalent for 30-day mortality rates, but tenecteplase was associated with reduced noncerebral bleeding.

8	USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1	Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are risks to the mother and fetus from acute ST elevation myocardial infarction, which is a medical emergency in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated (see Clinical Considerations). Published data consisting of a small number of case reports involving the use of related thrombolytic agents in pregnant women have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects. There are no data on the use of tenecteplase during pregnancy to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

TNKase does not elicit maternal and direct embryo toxicity in rabbits following a single IV administration. In developmental toxicity studies conducted in rabbits, the no observable effect level (NOEL) of a single IV administration of TNKase on maternal or developmental toxicity (5 mg/kg) was approximately 7 times human exposure (based on AUC) at the dose for STEMI.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Myocardial infarction is a medical emergency which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of potential concerns regarding the effects of tenecteplase on the fetus.

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of tenecteplase in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for TNKase and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the TNKase or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4	Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of TNKase in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5	Geriatric Use

In the ASSENT-2 study, 41% (3500/8458) of patients who were treated with TNKase were aged 65 years or older. In this population, rates of 30-day mortality, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage and major bleeds requiring blood transfusion or leading to hemodynamic complications were higher than in those aged less than 65 years.

Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

3.1 Reduced‐dose fibrinolysis inpatients

The STREAM trial (Strategic Reperfusion Early After Myocardial Infarction) showed that a pharmacoinvasive strategy could be a reasonable alternative to PPCI in STEMI patients presenting ≤ 3 hours of symptom onset and with an expected time delay from FMC to PPCI > 1 hour. The only downside of the pharmacoinvasive arm was that its rate of intracranial hemorrhage with full‐dose Tenecteplase was 5 times higher than that of the PPCI group. However, the difference was not significant after a trial protocol amendment reducing Tenecteplase dose by 50% in the elderly. 23 The ongoing STREAM‐2 study 24 (NCT02777580) will further compare the efficacy and safety of pharmacoinvasive strategy with half‐dose Tenecteplase as compared to routine PPCI in STEMI patients ≥ 60 years presenting within 3 hours from symptom onset. Additionally, in an observational registry study in the United States in patients with STEMI with long PCI‐related delays, a pharmacoinvasive strategy utilizing half‐dose fibrinolysis (97% tenecteplase, 3% reteplase) combined with transfer for PCI achieved similar efficacy outcomes as PPCI without increased bleeding risk. 25 More recently, EARLY‐MYO trial (Early Routine Catheterization After Alteplase Fibrinolysis Versus Primary PCI in Acute STEMI) demonstrated that a pharmacoinvasive strategy with half‐dose alteplase and timely PCI offered more complete epicardial and myocardial reperfusion when compared with PPCI for patients with STEMI at low risk presenting ≤ 6 hours after symptom onset and for whom the expected PCI‐related delay was ≥ 60 minutes and no significant differences in rates of major bleeding events or intracranial hemorrhage. 8 Thus, reduced‐dose fibrinolytic regimen might be a safe and effective option for pharmacoinvasive treatment in eligible patients with STEMI.

### Tenecteplase: expanding horizons in thrombolytic therapy across various clinical indications [^112eE52F]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Intravenous thrombolytics remain the mainstay of treatment for ischaemic stroke and retain importance for selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Pharmacological and practical advantages of the fibrinolytic tenecteplase have recently led to a widespread shift in ischaemic stroke management. Meta-analysis of randomised trials demonstrated superiority of tenecteplase over alteplase in achieving excellent functional outcome after stroke (no disability). Trials have also extended the time window for thrombolytics in stroke to 24hours, provided imaging demonstrates salvageable brain tissue. Although endovascular therapy is the most effective treatment for large vessel occlusion stroke, access remains limited to major metropolitan centres in developed nations. Trials suggest that thrombolytics add value, even in patients receiving endovascular therapy, and for many patients globally, intravenous thrombolytics are the only accessible reperfusion treatment. Tenecteplase is established as the preferred thrombolytic for selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, generally reserved for patients who cannot rapidly access percutaneous intervention following first medical contact. Notably, the dose used is twice that for stroke. Pre-hospital delivery of tenecteplase by paramedics is an important strategy in rural and remote areas. While patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism benefit from systemic thrombolysis, adjunctive tenecteplase in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism has been associated with increased risk of major bleeding and haemorrhagic stroke. The practical advantages of bolus administration and having a single thrombolytic on formulary for all relevant indications have positioned tenecteplase as the leading thrombolytic agent in current practice. This review discusses the current evidence and treatment guidelines in this rapidly evolving field.

### The second strategic reperfusion early after myocardial infarction (STREAM-2) study optimizing pharmacoinvasive reperfusion strategy in older ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients [^116393fy]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The STREAM study demonstrated that a pharmaco-invasive strategy was at least as effective as primary PCI (pPCI) in patients presenting early with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The current trial is a response to the finding that reduced intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients ≥ 75 years occurred after halving the dose of tenecteplase. Additionally, a subsequent analysis of full dose tenecteplase or alteplase in the Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic (ASSENT) trials demonstrated a steep increase in bleeding events beginning around the age of 60 years.

Methods

STREAM-2 will compare the efficacy and safety of a novel pharmaco-invasive strategy as compared to routine pPCI in STEMI patients ≥ 60 years presenting within 3 hours from symptom onset. In the pharmaco-invasive arm patients will receive half-dose tenecteplase, as soon as possible before transport to a PCI center. In the pPCI arm, patients will be treated according to optimal standard of care defined by local practice. The key criteria for efficacy will be the number of patients achieving ≥ 50% ST-segment resolution before and after PCI in lead with maximal ST elevation at baseline and the clinical endpoints of death, congestive heart failure, shock or re-infarction, rescue PCI and aborted myocardial infarction, both singularly and as a composite at 30 days. Key safety criteria are total stroke, ICH and major non-intracranial bleeds. Approximately 600 patients will be randomized (400 to pharmaco-invasive treatment and 200 to pPCI). An interim analysis is planned after 300 patients are enrolled to consider adapting the trial to include a larger sample size aimed at undertaking a formal confirmatory trial.

Discussion

The study will provide new insights aimed at establishing an effective and safer pharmaco-invasive treatment for the growing population of older STEMI patients who cannot undergo timely pPCI.

### Relationship of incorrect dosing of fibrinolytic therapy and clinical outcomes [^111eAinU]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Incorrect dosing of alteplase has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients. However, patients at high risk of adverse events are more prone to dosing errors, thus confounding this relationship.

Objective

To determine if the association between incorrect dosing of alteplase and adverse outcomes is related to cause and effect or to confounding.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Observational analysis in May 2004 of a double-blind, double-dummy trial of 16,949 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction who were enrolled in the Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic (ASSENT-2) trial and were assigned to either a bolus of tenecteplase (with alteplase placebo bolus plus infusion) or a bolus of alteplase (with tenecteplase placebo plus infusion).

Main Outcome Measures

Thirty-day mortality, in-hospital stroke, and major bleeding associated with incorrect dosing of active alteplase compared with placebo alteplase.

Results

Incorrect dosing occurred in 4.9% of patients who received active alteplase and in 4.6% of patients who received alteplase placebo. Patients receiving incorrect doses of alteplase or alteplase placebo were more likely to be older, female, black, shorter, have lower body weight and systolic blood pressure, and have a higher Killip class at presentation. Thirty-day mortality was higher in patients who received an overdose (9.8%) or underdose (19.5%) of alteplase compared with those who received a correct dose (5.4%). The same pattern was present in patients who received an alteplase placebo (10.0% for overdose, 23.5% for underdose, and 5.4% for correct dose). Similar patterns were seen for in-hospital intracranial hemorrhage and major bleeding. The higher rates of adverse outcomes with incorrect dosing were largely accounted for by adjusting for baseline characteristics.

Conclusions

The relationship between incorrect dosing and patient outcome in ASSENT-2 is primarily due to confounding factors rather than incorrect dosing itself. These data highlight the need for caution when ascribing a causal relationship to associations between incorrect dosing and adverse outcomes.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Patient Population

The STREAM trial protocol and primary results have been published previously. 16, 17 The study protocol was approved by national regulatory authorities and by the local ethics committee at each study center. All patients provided written informed consent. In brief, acute STEMI patients presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset and unable to undergo pPCI within 1 hour of first medical contact were randomized to either fibrinolysis with a protocol‐defined PI strategy or pPCI. In the PI strategy, bolus weight‐based tenecteplase (TNK), aspirin, clopidogrel, and enoxaparin were administered according to guideline recommendations and followed by either rescue PCI or scheduled angiography (within 6–24 hours). After 21% of the ultimate population had been enrolled, the executive committee amended the protocol on August 24, 2009, to reduce the dose of TNK by 50% in patients 75 years of age or older because of an excess of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in that age group. The need for rescue PCI was determined by site investigators according to < 50% ST segment resolution in the electrocardiogram (ECG) lead with the maximal ST‐elevation 90 minutes after TNK bolus, hemodynamic instability, or refractory ventricular arrhythmias as mandated by the study protocol. Primary PCI was conducted after expeditious transfer from the point of randomization, and early initiation of aspirin, clopidogrel, and antithrombotic therapy, including discretionary glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP 2b/3a) antagonists based on best standard practice.

### Is tenecteplase ready to replace alteplase to treat acute ischaemic stroke? The knowns and unknowns [^112WnDgH]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

With limited evidence, the 2019 AIS guideline of the American Heart/Stroke Association recommended TNK 0.4 mg/kg as an alternative to tPA in selected patients with AIS of minor neurological impairments and no major intracranial occlusion, while TNK 0.25 mg/kg for LVO patients prior to thrombectomy (both with level of evidence (LOE): B-R, and class of recommendation (COR): IIb).

Current limited evidence supports no superiority of either dose over the other (0.25 mg/kg vs 0.4 mg/kg). Yet, dosage of 0.25 mg/kg is most frequently used in ongoing trials of TNK in AIS (table 1), with a support of its efficacy based on a recent network meta-analysis. In addition, TNK's efficacy when used in patient with LVO was only seen with imaging-based endpoints, while its safety is comparable to tPA. Therefore, its solid effects in treating AIS remain to be studied. TNK is likely to have its role to treat AIS, but more data are needed for it to completely replace tPA.

Table 1
Ongoing and planned clinical trials examining the efficacy and safety of TNK

A series of ongoing phase III trials will further address the efficacy and safety of TNK either within early or late time windows, with or without LVO (table 1). Particularly in China, the ongoing TRACE II trial is testing the efficacy of TNK 0.25 mg/kg (single bolus, max 25 mg) as opposed to standard dose of tPA.TRACE III will study TNK in AIS due to LVO with perfusion mismatch up to 24 hours of symptom onset.

### Incidence and predictors of bleeding events after fibrinolytic therapy with fibrin-specific agents: a comparison of TNK-tPA and rt-PA [^114Stmgj]. European Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Fibrinolytic therapy increases the risk of bleeding events. TNK-tPA (tenecteplase) is a variant of rt-PA with greater fibrin specificity and reduced plasma clearance that can be given as a single bolus. We compared the incidence and predictors of bleeding events after treatment with TNK-tPA and rt-PA.

Methods and Results

In the Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic (ASSENT)-2 trial, 16 949 patients with acute myocardial infarction were randomly assigned a single weight-adjusted bolus of TNK-tPA or a 90-min infusion of rt-PA. A total of 4.66% of patients in the TNK-tPA group experienced major non-cerebral bleeding, in comparison with 5.94% in the rt-PA group (P = 0.0002). This lower rate was associated with a significant reduction in the need for blood transfusion (4.25% vs 5.49%, P = 0.0003) and was consistent across subgroups. Independent risk factors for major bleeding were older age, female gender, lower body weight, enrolment in the U.S. A. and a diastolic blood pressure < 70 mmHg. Females at high risk (age > 75 years and body weight < 67 kg) were less likely to have major bleeding when treated with TNK-tPA even after other risk factors were taken into account. A total of 0.93% of patients in the TNK-tPA and 0.94% of patients in the rt-PA group experienced an intracranial haemorrhage. Female patients > 75 years of age who weighed < 67 kg tended to have lower rates of intracranial haemorrhage when treated with TNK-tPA (3/264, 1.14% vs 8/265, 3.02%).

Conclusions

The increased fibrin specificity and single bolus administration of TNK-tPA do not increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage but are associated with less non-cerebral bleeding, especially amongst high-risk patients.

Among 9280 patients for whom dose per kilogram could be calculated, tenecteplase doses were between 0.20 and 0.30 mg/kg in 8934 patients (96.3%) after capping weight at 100 kg, and 127 of 9347 patients (1.4%) with dose information had documented total doses greater than 25 mg. Compared with patients receiving alteplase, patients receiving tenecteplase were more often Asian, Hispanic (any race), and non-Hispanic White and were less often non-Hispanic Black. Patients receiving tenecteplase had slightly more severe presenting deficits exhibited by higher NIHSS scores, more often had cardioembolism, and less often had a cryptogenic stroke mechanism. In addition, patients receiving tenecteplase more often had an LVO (2837 of 9465 [30.0%] vs 17 845 of 70 085 [25.5%]) and more often underwent EVT (1674 of 9465 [17.7%] vs 9641 of 70 085 [13.8%]). In contrast, age, sex, vascular risk factors, and time to treatment were similar between the tenecteplase and alteplase groups.

### Facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: results from the prematurely terminated ADdressing the value of facilitated ANgioplasty after combination therapy or eptifibatide monotherapy in acute myocardial infarction (ADVANCE MI) trial [^111mbUf5]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — simultaneous administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and reduced-dose fibrinolytics before primary PCI for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) — may be a promising reperfusion strategy.

Methods

The ADVANCE MI trial was intended to evaluate facilitated PCI in 5640 STEMI patients but was prematurely terminated as a result of slow recruitment over 12 months at 30 centers in the United States. Patients with STEMI with planned primary PCI were randomly assigned to receive eptifibatide + 50% of standard-dose tenecteplase (which equated to 0.25 mg/kg intravenous bolus) or eptifibatide + placebo before PCI and randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial design to unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin.

Results

A total of 148 patients were randomized (74 patients in each treatment arm) and formed the "as-randomized" intention-to-treat population. However, only 69 patients actually received eptifibatide + tenecteplase, and 77 actually received eptifibatide + placebo (2 patients did not receive eptifibatide and 4 patients randomized to tenecteplase did not receive this therapy) — these 146 patients formed the "as-treated" population. Among both populations, epicardial infarct artery patency and myocardial tissue perfusion on pre-PCI angiography were improved in the tenecteplase group, but ST-segment resolution at 60 minutes was similar. The frequency of the primary end point of death or new/worsening severe heart failure at 30 days was higher among patients treated with eptifibatide + tenecteplase in the "as-treated" (10% vs 3%, P = 0.09) and the "as-randomized" (11% vs 1%, P = 0.02) populations. Bleeding complications were 2-fold higher with eptifibatide + tenecteplase. Analysis of the results by treatment with unfractionated heparin versus enoxaparin demonstrated similar findings.

Conclusions

Although definitive conclusions cannot be made as a result of the small sample size and premature study termination, facilitated PCI with eptifibatide + reduced-dose tenecteplase was associated with improved angiographic flow patterns, increases in adverse clinical outcomes, and higher bleeding rates compared with eptifibatide + placebo administered before primary PCI for STEMI.

### Ticagrelor or clopidogrel dual antiplatelet therapy following a pharmacoinvasive strategy in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^115WSvBc]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Vital heart response

The vital heart response (VHR) program is a regional reperfusion network of care, developed in 2005 (involving all admitting hospitals with a referral population of approximately 2 000 000 inhabitants), to implement timely, and evidence‐based reperfusion therapies to maximize the outcomes of STEMI patients in Central and Northern Alberta. In brief, a 24‐h on call VHR cardiologist co‐ordinates care between the pre‐hospital emergency medical services or physicians in non‐PCI capable hospital emergency rooms, and based on the clinical scenario, an electronically transmitted ECG, and estimated timings of transfer, decides on 1 of the 2 reperfusion options (pharmacoinvasive or primary PCI). In the pharmacoinvasive (PI) strategy which has been consistently applied since VHR inception, bolus weight‐based tenecteplase (TNK), aspirin, clopidogrel and enoxaparin is administered according to guideline recommendations and followed by either rescue PCI or scheduled angiography (within 6–24 h) consistent with the STrategic Reperfusion Early after Myocardial infarction study. This includes ½ dose TNK for patient > 75 years of age. The need for rescue PCI is determined according to reperfusion success measured by < 50% ST segment resolution in the ECG lead with the maximal ST‐elevation 60–90 min after TNK bolus, hemodynamic instability or refractory ventricular arrhythmias. In successfully reperfused STEMI, scheduled catheterization is performed 6–24 h after the administration of TNK. The choice of P2Y12 receptor antagonist at hospital discharge in pharmaco‐invasively treated patients is left to the discretion of the managing cardiologist. Those patients converted to ticagrelor received a 180 mg oral loading dose at the time of switch. Prasugrel is not utilized within our STEMI network.

### Low-dose alteplase during primary percutaneous coronary intervention according to ischemic time [^115rpPGi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The overall clinical relevance of our findings is highlighted by a trend on ischemic time toward reduced ejection fraction in patients receiving alteplase versus placebo. We provide evidence that increased myocardial hemorrhage is causally related to a reduction in left ventricular function and adverse left ventricular remodeling.

The T-TIME study has several strengths. The primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed using core laboratory methods. The study intervention and source data analyses were conducted in a double-blind manner, minimizing the risk of bias. The design specified multimodality testing including a time-course AUC analysis of the circulating concentrations of troponin T. The coagulation results have been useful to inform the safety of intracoronary alteplase as an adjunct during PPCI.

MVO presents an unmet therapeutic need and there is widespread interest in the potential efficacy of intra-coronary fibrinolytic therapy during PPCI. Two multicenter, international trials are scheduled to investigate the efficacy of reduced doses of either alteplase (STRIVE [Adjunctive, Low-dose tPA in Primary PCI for STEMI]) or tenecteplase (RESTORE-MI [Restoring Microcirculatory Perfusion in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)]) (Supplemental Appendix). Considering eligibility criteria in these trials, the ischemic time limit is 12 h. Furthermore, RESTORE-MI selects patients with evidence of microvascular dysfunction (index of microcirculatory resistance > 32) in the infarct-related artery at the end of PCI. Our results suggest this risk-based selection strategy may enroll patients at risk of myocardial hemorrhage that, based on our findings, may be exacerbated by intracoronary lytic therapy. The new knowledge from the T-TIME study seems relevant to the design of these trials and to clinicians in practice when considering the use of intracoronary alteplase as a bail-out option in patients with massive thrombosis. Finally, PPCI is not available for many patients due to both geographical and socioeconomic factors. As a result, intravenous thrombolysis is the primary reperfusion strategy for many STEMI patients worldwide. Our findings are potentially relevant for these patients. The GUSTO-1 (Global Utilization of t-Pa and Streptokinase for Occluded Coronary Arteries) trial evaluated the effects of intravenous thrombolysis in over 40,000 STEMI patients and those with a symptom onset to treatment time of 4 to 6 h had a > 40% relative increase in mortality at 30 days when compared with patients with shorter treatment times. Increases in MVO and myocardial hemorrhage in patients with a prolonged ischemic time treated with thrombolysis may be a contributing factor for this increase in mortality. This could be considered by clinicians when a choice is available between prompt thrombolysis and delayed PCI beyond the guideline-directed 120-min target in patients with prolonged ischemic times.

### Is tenecteplase ready to replace alteplase to treat acute ischaemic stroke? The knowns and unknowns [^115cKZ2o]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Tenecteplase (TNKase, TNK-tPA or TNK) is a thrombolytic agent derived from the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). It is a 527-amino acid glycoprotein developed by replacing three amino acids at the T, N and K positions of the glycoprotein structure of tPA under genetic recombinant technology. After replacing threonine 103 with asparagine, asparagine 117 with glutamine and a tetra-alanine at amino acids 296–299, TNK is about eightfold more potent in dissolving clot, 80-fold higher resistance to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and 14-fold enhanced relative fibrin specificity, and with a longer half-life (20 min). Hence, TNK is administered as a single intravenous bolus.

TNK 0.5 mg/kg intravenous bolus is the choice in treating acute myocardial infarction (MI), and was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2000. In comparison, the optimal dosages of TNK used alone or as a part of the bridging therapy remain to be further defined. For Caucasians patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), TNK was tested at doses of 0.1, 0.25, 0.4 or 0.5 mg/kg.

In the current issue of the journal, Tenecteplase Reperfusion Therapy in Acute Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events (TRACE) trial tested three different doses of TNK versus standard dose of tPA in Chinese patients with AIS within 3 hours of onset. The trial is a dose selection phase II trial with a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) controlled design recruiting AIS patients with severity of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 4–25. No difference in safety was revealed between different dose groups compared with tPA in terms of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH) events (5.0% in 0.1 mg/kg, 0.0% in 0.25 mg/kg, 3.3% in 0.32 mg/kg TNK and 1.7% in 0.9 mg/kg tPA; p = 0.52). Also, no significant difference in any efficacy outcomes was observed. The study may be statistically underpowered due to a small sample size.

### Infarct size, shock, and heart failure: does reperfusion strategy matter in early presenting patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction? [^116XYuzJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

The STREAM trial was an open-label, prospective, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter trial, the design of which has been published previously. In brief, acute STEMI patients who presented within 3 hours of symptom onset and who were unable to undergo PPCI within 1 hour of first medical contact were randomized to either fibrinolysis with a protocol-defined PI strategy or PPCI. In the PI strategy, bolus weight-based tenecteplase, aspirin, clopidogrel, and enoxaparin were administered according to guideline recommendations and followed by either rescue PCI or scheduled angiography (within 6 to 24 hours). The need for rescue PCI was determined by site investigators according to < 50% ST-segment resolution in the ECG lead, with the maximal ST-segment elevation 90 minutes after tenecteplase bolus, hemodynamic instability, or refractory ventricular arrhythmias, as mandated by the study protocol. PPCI was conducted after expeditious transfer from the point of randomization and early initiation of aspirin, clopidogrel, and antithrombotic therapy including discretionary glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists based on best standard practice. The study protocol was approved by national regulatory authorities and by the local ethics committee at each study center. All patients provided written informed consent.

We analyzed data available on IS and 30-day shock/CHF (primary endpoint for the current study) in 1701 of 1892 (89.9%) patients enrolled in STREAM. Shock and CHF were defined by protocol and assessed by participating investigators.

The following time delays were defined for analysis: (1) presentation delay (symptom onset to randomization; prespecified cut point at 2 hours) and (2) total ischemic time (symptom onset to assigned treatment delivery).

### Effects of intracoronary alteplase on microvascular function in acute myocardial infarction [^112mJTU5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

A plausible explanation for the lack of interaction between ischemic time and alteplase with IMR could be because IMR measures microvascular resistance during maximal hyperemia, which might be less modifiable by intracoronary alteplase than microvascular vasodilator function (measured by RRR and CFR).

Two other ongoing trials of low‐dose intracoronary fibrinolysis are using IMR as an eligibility criterion and to measure acute microvascular function after intervention. The RESTORE‐MI (Restoring Microcirculatory Perfusion in STEMI) trial (ACTRN12618000778280) will randomize STEMI patients with IMR > 32 (n = 800) to intracoronary tenecteplase (one‐third of weight‐based systemic dose) or placebo, in a double‐blind design, and those with IMR ≤ 32 will continue in a followup registry. Recently, a pilot trial in 36 patients with acute STEMI with symptoms ≤ 6 hours and TIMI 0/1 flow in the culprit artery demonstrated adjunctive low‐dose (4 mg) of intracoronary tenecteplase given twice (post‐reperfusion and at the end of PCI, 8 mg total) compared with placebo (saline) as an adjunct to primary PCI was feasible and safe but did not improve percent stenosis of the culprit lesion (primary outcome). 35 The smaller OPTIMAL (Optimal Coronary Flow After PCI for Myocardial Infarction) trial (NCT02894138) will randomize 80 STEMI patients with a poststenting IMR > 30 to intracoronary alteplase (20mg), or placebo, in an open‐label design. Both studies are including patients with ischemic times up to 12 hours. However, our findings suggest that therapeutic benefit with alteplase might be restricted to patients with a shorter ischemic time.

Limitations and Strengths

Because of the potential for type 1 error in the subgroup analyses, these should be interpreted as exploratory. Although we observed a higher TIMI myocardial perfusion grade post‐PCI in the alteplase 20 mg group compared with the placebo group, this difference was not observed in the main trial, 9 and the significant P value may have occurred because of chance (type 1 statistical error).

Strengths of our study include the randomized, double‐blind design, blinding of IMR, CFR, and RRR measurements to minimize bias, and their excellent inter‐ and intrarater reliability. Retention with CMR was high (94% at 3 months).

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^116LsntC]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Sample Size Calculation

For dose escalation (phase 1b), according to the Chinese Acute Anterior Circulatory Ischemic Stroke Endovascular Treatment Registry Study, 13.8% of patients experienced sICH within 24 hours of receiving EVT. Using sample sizes typical for dose-escalation phase 1 clinical trials, we used a 14 + 8 design scheme with the occurrence of sICH within 24 hours after EVT as the dose-limiting toxic effect. At each tier, 14 patients were enrolled, beginning with the lowest prespecified dose. If fewer than 2 of 14 patients developed sICH, the trial advanced to the next tier dose. If 2 of the 14 patients developed sICH, 8 more patients were enrolled at that dose. If 0 to 1 of the additional 8 patients developed sICH, the trial advanced to the next tier dose. If 2 of the additional 8 patients developed sICH or 3 of the first 14 developed sICH, that dose was deemed not tolerated and the immediately preceding dose was the estimated maximum tolerated dose.

For dose expansion (phase 2a), patients enrolled were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: the dose A group, the dose B group, and the control group.

### Age, outcomes, and treatment effects of fibrinolytic and antithrombotic combinations: findings from assessment of the safety and efficacy of a new thrombolytic (ASSENT)-3 and ASSENT-3 PLUS [^116CcKot]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction are at particularly high risk for death and bleeding complications. The efficacy and safety of antithrombotic strategies in these patients remain unclear.

Methods

To provide more insight into the risk and benefit of antithrombotic strategies in the elderly, we examined patients from the ASSENT-3 and ASSENT-3 PLUS trials with STEMI who were treated with tenecteplase (TNK) and unfractionated heparin (UFH) or enoxaparin, or half-dose TNK with abciximab and reduced-dose UFH.

Results

Older patients had a higher risk profile, and lower use of concomitant therapies and revascularization procedures. We found an interaction between age and treatment effect for the efficacy end point (P = 0.0007) and the efficacy plus safety end point (P < .0001). Younger patients (< 65 years) had a lower risk of the composite efficacy plus safety end point with enoxaparin (relative risk [RR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.94) or abciximab (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69–0.90) compared with UFH. In patients > 65 years of age, the benefit of enoxaparin appeared to be offset by an increased risk of bleeding complications. The risk of the efficacy plus safety end point tended to be higher in elderly patients receiving abciximab and half-dose TNK (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.91–1.51 for 76–85 years of age and RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.88–2.49 for > 85 years of age).

Conclusions

Although TNK with either enoxaparin or abciximab appeared to be more effective than with standard UHF in younger patients, these combinations tended to be less effective and even may be unsafe in the elderly. Development of new combination strategies and dosing schemes of fibrinolytics and antithrombotics with improved efficacy and safety in the elderly remains a high priority.

### Does a single bolus thrombolytic reduce door to needle time in a district general hospital? [^112DkEd8]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To answer the question "In patients presenting with ST elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) and no contraindication to thrombolysis, does the introduction of Tenecteplase reduce door to needle times?"

Methods

Firstly, an observational study was performed to compare the time taken to prepare standard thrombolytic therapy with Tenecteplase. Secondly, door to needle times were compared before and after the introduction of Tenecteplase. The study was powered to be 80% sure of finding a change of 10% in the number of patients meeting the national service framework standard of a 30 minute door to needle time.

Results

Tenecteplase takes 10.5 minutes less time to prepare than standard treatment (p value < 0.001). After the introduction of Tenecteplase the percentage of patients receiving thrombolysis in 30 minutes increased from 58% to 76% (p value < 0.01)

Conclusion

Tenecteplase is quicker to prepare than standard therapy, resulting in a significant improvement in performance against the national service framework target.

### Improved speed and stability of ST-segment recovery with reduced-dose tenecteplase and eptifibatide compared with full-dose tenecteplase for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^111dxbw2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

This sub-study of the Integrilin and Tenecteplase in Acute Myocardial Infarction (INTEGRITI) trial evaluated of the impact of combination reperfusion therapy with reduced-dose tenecteplase plus eptifibatide on continuous ST-segment recovery and angiographic results.

Background

Combination therapy with reduced-dose fibrinolytics and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction improves biomarkers of reperfusion success but has not reduced mortality when compared with full-dose fibrinolytics.

Methods

We evaluated 140 patients enrolled in the INTEGRITI trial with 24-h continuous 12-lead ST-segment monitoring and angiography at 60 min. The dose-combination regimen of 50% of standard-dose tenecteplase (0.27 microg/kg) plus high-dose eptifibatide (2 boluses of 180 microg/kg separated by 10 min, 2.0 microg/kg/min infusion) was compared with full-dose tenecteplase (0.53 microg/kg).

Results

The dose-confirmation regimen of reduced-dose tenecteplase plus high-dose eptifibatide was associated with a faster median time to stable ST-segment recovery (55 vs. 98 min, p = 0.06), improved stable ST-segment recovery by 2 h (89.6% vs. 67.7%, p = 0.02), and less recurrent ischemia (34.0% vs. 57.1%, p = 0.05) when compared with full-dose tenecteplase. Continuously updated ST-segment recovery analyses demonstrated a modest trend toward greater ST-segment recovery at 30 min (57.7% vs. 40.6%, p = 0.13) and 60 min (82.7% vs. 65.6%, p = 0.08) with this regimen. These findings correlated with improved angiographic results at 60 min.

Conclusions

Combination therapy with reduced-dose tenecteplase and eptifibatide leads to faster, more stable ST-segment recovery and improved angiographic flow patterns, compared with full-dose tenecteplase. These findings question the relationship between biomarkers of reperfusion success and clinical outcomes.

Myocardial infarction (MI) secondary to thrombolytic therapy in the setting of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) is a rare but severe complication. This phenomenon has been well documented in the past with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, also known as Alteplase. However, there are no documented reports of MI secondary to Tenecteplase (TNKase), an alternative thrombolytic agent rapidly gaining favour in managing AIS. We report a male patient in his 50s who received TNKase for an AIS and subsequently developed an inferolateral ST elevation MI.

### Prospective observational cohort study of tenecteplase: results from the Indian registry in ischemic stroke-tenecteplase [^115wSLBL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Tenecteplase has been evaluated at different doses, ranging from 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, and 0.4 mg/kg in patients with ischemic stroke. It is now established that using the high dose of 0.4 mg/kg of tenecteplase does not confer any advantage in terms of efficacy over a low dose in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke. In fact, administration of the 0.4 mg/kg dose of tenecteplase led to premature termination of the phase‐3 clinical study, as it was associated with higher rates of mortality and symptomatic hemorrhages compared with alteplase. In India, tenecteplase is routinely being administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. One might argue that there is minimal difference between 0.2 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg but our data suggest that perhaps the lower dose may be safer without compromising efficacy. We suggest that a trial directly comparing the 2 doses is needed.

This chapter about fibrinolytic, antiplatelet, and antithrombin treatment for acute ST-segment elevation (STE) myocardial infarction (MI) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see the chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133[suppl]:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with ischemic symptoms characteristic of acute MI of ≤ 12 h in duration and persistent STE, we recommend that all undergo rapid evaluation for reperfusion (primary percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or fibrinolytic) therapy and have a reperfusion strategy implemented promptly after contact with the health-care system (Grade 1A). For patients with ischemic symptoms characteristic of acute MI of ≤ 12 h in duration and persistent STE, we recommend administration of streptokinase, anistreplase, alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase over no fibrinolytic therapy (all Grade 1A). For patients with symptom duration ≤ 6 h, we recommend the administration of alteplase or tenecteplase over streptokinase (both Grade 1A). We recommend aspirin over no aspirin therapy followed by indefinite therapy (Grade 1A); we also recommend clopidogrel in addition to aspirin for up to 28 days (Grade 1A). In addition to aspirin and other antiplatelet therapies, we recommend the use of antithrombin therapy (eg, unfractionated heparin (UFH), enoxaparin, or fondaparinux) over no antithrombin therapy (Grade 1A), including for those patients receiving fibrinolysis (and regardless of which lytic agent is administered), primary PCI, or patients not receiving reperfusion therapy.

### Thrombolysis and adjunctive therapy in acute myocardial infarction: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^115aJBgP]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for acute myocardial infarction (MI) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients with ischemic symptoms characteristic of acute MI of < 12 h in duration, and ST-segment elevation or left bundle-branch block (of unknown duration) on the ECG, we recommend administration of any approved fibrinolytic agent (Grade 1A). We recommend the use of streptokinase, anistreplase, alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase over placebo (all Grade 1A). For patients with symptom duration < 6 h, we recommend the administration of alteplase over streptokinase (Grade 1A). For patients with known allergy or sensitivity to streptokinase, we recommend alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase (Grade 1A). For patients with acute posterior MI of < 12 h duration, we suggest fibrinolytic therapy (Grade 2C). In patients with any history of intracranial hemorrhage, closed head trauma, or ischemic stroke within past 3 months, we recommend against administration of fibrinolytic therapy (Grade 1C+). For patients with acute ST-segment elevation MI whether or not they receive fibrinolytic therapy, we recommend aspirin, 160 to 325 mg p.o., at initial evaluation by health-care personnel followed by indefinite therapy, 75 to 162 mg/d p.o. (both Grade 1A). In patients allergic to aspirin, we suggest use of clopidogrel as an alternative therapy to aspirin (Grade 2C). For patients receiving streptokinase, we suggest administration of either i.v. unfractionated heparin (UFH) [Grade 2C] or subcutaneous UFH (Grade 2A). For all patients at high risk of systemic or venous thromboembolism (anterior MI, pump failure, previous embolus, atrial fibrillation, or left ventricular thrombus), we recommend administration of IV UFH while receiving streptokinase (Grade 1C+).

### Reteplase versus alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke within 4.5 hours (RAISE): rationale and design of a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint, controlled phase 3 non-inferiority trial [^1139KPC9]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction and rationale

Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase (a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA) represents the primary reperfusion therapy for early recanalisation of acute ischaemic stroke, preserving the cerebral ischaemic penumbra and enhancing clinical outcomes. The widespread utilisation of thrombolytics continues to be in high clinical demand. Reteplase (r-PA) and tenecteplase are third generation of alternative thrombolytic agents for acute myocardial infarction. Tenecteplase was non-inferior to rt-PA in patients with acute ischaemic stroke within 4.5 hours of onset. To date, there is a lack of definitive clinical trials comparing r-PA with rt-PA in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

Reteplase is a non-glycosylated variant of rt-PA, characterised by a longer half-life that facilitates double-bolus administration with a fixed dosage instead of infusion based on body weight in kilogram. Theoretically, the reduction in fibrin specificity can enhance thrombolysis, meanwhile, it may also increase the risk of bleeding. Thus, it is crucial to determine the appropriate dosage of r-PA for patients with acute ischaemic stroke in order to achieve an optimal benefit-risk ratio.

A multi-centre, prospective, randomised controlled, open-label, blinded-endpoint, dose-finding, phase 2 clinical trial of r-PA has suggested that the rate of death and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) among 12 mg+12 mg of r-PA, 18 mg+18 mg of r-PA and 0.9 mg/kg of rt-PA were similar in patients with acute ischaemic stroke within 4.5 hours of onset in China. Although there was a slightly higher incidence of extracranial bleeding (without statistically significant differences) in patients treated with 18 mg+18 mg of r-PA compared to those treated with 12 mg+12 mg of r-PA and 0.9 mg/kg of rt-PA, the group receiving 18 mg+18 mg of r-PA had a numerically superior proportion of excellent functional outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale 0–1) when compared with the groups receiving 12 mg+ 12 mg of r-PA and 0.9 mg/kg of rt-PA. The recommended dosage of r-PA for patients with acute myocardial infarction is 18mg+18 mg.

### Evidence that tenecteplase is noninferior to alteplase for acute ischemic stroke: meta-analysis of 5 randomized trials [^1145VUx3]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- TNK (tenecteplase), a newer fibrinolytic agent, has practical delivery advantages over ALT (alteplase) that would make it a useful agent if noninferior in acute ischemic stroke treatment outcome. Accordingly, the most recent US American Heart Association/American Stroke Association acute ischemic stroke guideline recognized TNK as an alternative to ALT, but only based on informal consideration, rather than formal meta-analysis, of completed randomized control trials. Methods- Systematic literature search and formal meta-analysis were conducted per PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), adapted to noninferiority analysis. The primary outcome of freedom from disability (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–1) outcome at 3 m, and additional efficacy and safety outcomes, were analyzed. Results- Systematic search identified 5 trials enrolling 1585 patients (828 TNK, 757 ALT). Across all trials, mean age was 70.8, 58.5% male, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale mean 7.0, and time from last known well to treatment start mean 148 minutes. All ALT patients received standard 0.9 mg/kg dosing, while TNK dosing was 0.1 mg/kg in 6.8%, 0.25 mg/kg in 24.6%, and 0.4 mg/kg in 68.6%. For the primary end point, crude cumulative rates of disability-free (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–1) 3 m outcome were TNK 57.9% versus ALT 55.4%. Informal, random-effects meta-analysis, the risk difference was 4% (95% CI, -1% to 8%). The lower 95% CI bound fell well within the prespecified noninferiority margin. Similar results were seen for the additional efficacy end points: functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–2): crude TNK 71.9% versus ALT 70.5%, risk difference 2% (95% CI, -3% to 6%); and modified Rankin Scale shift analysis, common odds ratio 1.21 (95% CI, 0.93–1.57). For safety end points, lower event rates reduced power, but point estimates were also consistent with noninferiority Conclusions- Accumulated clinical trial data provides strong evidence that TNK is noninferior to ALT in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. These findings provide formal support for the recent guideline recommendation to consider TNK an alternative to ALT.

### Early administration of thrombolysis can prevent myocardial necrosis: time is myocardium [^115zsfy4]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

A case is presented in which a 66-year-old man received thrombolysis for an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) within 6 minutes of developing chest pain. An ECG performed 10 minutes after thrombolysis showed complete resolution of the ST segment elevation and showed no other abnormality. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function and there was no detectable myocardial necrosis, as evidenced by two negative troponin assays. The case clearly reinforces the benefits of the rapid delivery of thrombolysis when appropriate for patients with STEMI. Clinicians need to be aware of the benefits of early thrombolysis as laid out in the national service framework. Evidence for the early administration of thrombolysis, data from the Myocardial Infarction National Audit Project and the future with regard to improving thrombolysis times are discussed.

### Off-label use of tenecteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112dP7cW]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. First, included studies were nonrandomized; thus, imbalances in patient characteristics are expected between the intravenous tenecteplase and intravenous alteplase groups. For this reason, we also report the adjusted treatment associations with the outcomes of interest. Most of the studies provided adjusted associations for the outcomes of interest using multivariable regression models, with confounders selected either a priori, or from univariable associations. In one study, the process for the selection of covariates included in the multivariable analysis was not provided. Another study used propensity score matching to address imbalances in baseline characteristics, using a priori confounders to estimate the propensity score for each patient (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Despite the differences in the methods used for adjustment and the selection process for confounders between included studies, no evidence of heterogeneity was evident in the adjusted analyses for the efficacy end points (Table 2). However, the number of studies included in the adjusted analyses is low because some of the eligible studies provided only crude associations for the outcomes of interest. Second, as highlighted in our bias assessment, the selection of the overall population and alteplase control groups in some of the studies raises concerns about unmeasured confounding owing to the different time periods and institutions in which patients in the case and control groups were treated. Third, although in all studies the standard intravenous alteplase dose (0.9 mg/kg) was used, the intravenous tenecteplase dose varied both within and between studies, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg, with most studies using the 0.25-mg/kg dose (Table 1). In patients with AIS due to a large-vessel occlusion, no significant differences in clinical and radiologic end points were documented between the 0.40- and 0.25-mg/kg doses, with the exception of a numerically higher intracranial bleeding risk with the 0.4-mg/kg dose. Fourth, there was no central adjudication of the symptomatic intracranial bleeding and successful recanalization events or blinding of the clinical outcome assessors for the majority of included studies.

New fibrinolytic agents — Existing agents are plasminogen activators that convert plasminogen to plasmin; t-PA and u-PA do this directly, whereas streptokinase, which is not an enzyme, binds plasminogen and the complex serves as the activator; more recently licensed agents are t-PA variants, including reteplase with a longer half-life and tenecteplase with a longer half-life, enhanced fibrin specificity, and resistance to inhibition by PAI-1; because of longer half-lives, reteplase and tenecteplase can be given by bolus injection; agents under development include alfimeprase, V10153, plasmin, and desmoteplase.

### Ticagrelor or clopidogrel dual antiplatelet therapy following a pharmacoinvasive strategy in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^113RnLA8]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have demonstrated that following an evidenced based fibrinolysis strategy with clopidogrel that approximately two thirds of patients have high platelet reactivity. Further, these small studies with platelet reactivity endpoints demonstrate that ticagrelor is superior even to high‐dose clopidogrel. Accordingly, the strategy of early switching from clopidogrel to ticagrelor at the time of PCI following fibrinolysis could be associated with lower risk of recurrent MI which is consistent with the findings in this analysis.

The ticagrelor in patients With ST‐elevation myocardial infarction treated with Pharmacological Thrombolysis (TREAT) trial was a multicentered international trial with STEMI patients < 75 years of age randomized to sustained clopidogrel or ticagrelor following fibrinolysis. Approximately 40% of patients received fibrinolysis with tenectaplase with nearly 20% receiving non‐fibrin specific agents. There was variable application of contemporary pharmacoinvasive approach with only 56% of patient in TREAT received PCI during their index hospitalization. The current analysis was conducted in an integrated STEMI system of care that has applied a dedicated evidence based pharmacoinvasive approach utilizing tenecteplase since its inception. Indeed, in the current analysis, all patients underwent coronary angiography during the index hospitalization with 89% undergoing PCI with implantation of drug eluting stents. Furthermore, 32% of patients had rescue PCI following unsuccessful fibrinolysis with the need for rescue appearing to influence clinician's decision to switch to ticagrelor.

Tenecteplase

Given the rapid clearance and increasing bleeding complication caused by alteplase, tenecteplase (a triple combination mutant variant) was generated in 1994. This variant, also known as TNK, involves substitutions: Thr103 to Asn (T mutation), Asn117 to Gln (N mutation) and the sequence Lys296-His-Arg-Arg to Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala (K mutation) (table 1, figure 2). These changes aim to reduce the clearance rate of the plasminogen activator (mutations T and N), enhance its resistance to PAI-1 and improve its fibrin specificity (mutation K), however, without improvement in fibrinolytic potency in vitro. In animal study, TNK sites mutagenesis showed 80-fold resistance to inhibition by PAI-1, a 14-fold increase in fibrin specificity and decreased plasma clearance rate.

In 1999, a subset of patients with acute myocardial infarction received treatment with Tenecteplase, demonstrating early opening of infract-related coronary arteries compared with alteplase. Clinical trials proved the basic properties in human that tenecteplase has higher fibrin-specificity (10% reduction of fibrinogen and plasminogen vs 50% reduction in alteplase) and longer plasma half-life of approximately 22 min (alteplase about 5 min). It is interesting to note that the decreased rate of systemic clearance observed in animal and clinical trials enables the administration of tenecteplase as a rapid single bolus, offering an easier administration compared with alteplase. Subsequently, tenecteplase was approved by FDA and European Medical Agency in 2000 for weight-based treatment in ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase for thrombolysis in patients selected by use of perfusion imaging within 4. 5 h of onset of ischaemic stroke (TASTE): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 non-inferiority trial [^115Ghmzj]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The study TASTE was published by Mark W Parsons and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Lancet Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the TASTE study, the trial question was: is tenecteplase noninferior to alteplase in patients with AIS within 4.5 hours of onset? In the TASTE study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the TASTE study, the population was: 680 patients (260 female, 420 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with AIS within 4.5 hours of onset or last known well who were selected by perfusion imaging. The key exclusion criteria were ICH; pre-stroke mRS score ≥ 2; previous stroke within last 3 months; clinically significant hypoglycemia; uncontrolled hypertension; known hypersensitivity to alteplase/tenecteplase. In the TASTE study, the interventions were: n = 339 tenecteplase (at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg) n = 341 alteplase (at a dose of 0.90 mg/kg). In the TASTE study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in mRS score of 0–1 at 3 months, per-protocol analysis (59% vs. 56%; SRD 0.05, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.12). In the TASTE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in mRS score of 0–1 at 3 months, intention-to-treat analysis (57% vs. 55%; SRD 0.03, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.1) Significant decrease in symptomatic ICH (3% vs. 2%; RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03) Significant decrease in death at day 90 (7% vs. 4%; SRD 0.02, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.05). In the TASTE study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with AIS within 4.5 hours of onset or last known well who were selected by perfusion imaging, tenecteplase was noninferior to alteplase with respect to mRS score of 0–1 at 3 months, per-protocol analysis.

### Tenecteplase, 0.4 mg / kg, in moderate and severe acute ischemic stroke: a pooled analysis of NOR-TEST and NOR-TEST 2A [^112BoyBQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

In the pooled analysis of patients with moderate or severe stroke, the ITT population contained 597 patients, of whom 287 (48.1%) were assigned to tenecteplase and 310 (51.9%) were assigned to alteplase. The exclusion scheme for the PP analysis followed the criteria of the original trials. The following patients were excluded for the PP analysis: 60 (10%) patients diagnosed as having stroke mimic, 36 (6%) patients with prestroke mRS score ≥ 3, 17 (3%) patients with missing end point data at 3 months, and 1 patient having NIHSS score < 6. The final PP population included 483 patients, of whom 235 (48.7%) were assigned to tenecteplase and 248 (51.3%) were assigned to alteplase (Figure S1). The demographics between the 2 treatment arms in the PP analysis were similar, except for a higher occurrence of prestroke myocardial infarction in the alteplase arm (Table 1). Similar pattern applies for the demographics in the ITT analysis (Table S1).

Table 1
Demographics and Characteristics in the Per‐Protocol Analysis

The PP analysis showed in the alteplase arm a better functional outcome at 3 months expressed by ordinal shift analysis (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.17–2.28]; P = 0.004) and by mRS cutoff 0 to 2 (OR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.33–0.80]; P = 0.003). There was a higher rate of any ICH (OR, 1.66 [95% CI, 0.97–2.82]; P = 0.06) and sICH (OR, 2.39 [95% CI, 0.79–7.24]; P = 0.12) in the tenecteplase arm, but none of these reached statistical significance. Mortality was significantly higher in the tenecteplase arm (OR, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.20–5.10]; P = 0.01) (Table 2 and Figure 1).

### Alteplase (Activase) [^112SuuDc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Acute Ischemic Stroke

Administer Activase as soon as possible but within 3 hours after onset of symptoms.

The recommended dose is 0.9 mg/kg (not to exceed 90 mg total dose), with 10% of the total dose administered as an initial intravenous bolus over 1 minute and the remainder infused over 60 minutes.

During and following Activase administration for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, frequently monitor and control blood pressure.

In patients without recent use of oral anticoagulants or heparin, Activase treatment can be initiated prior to the availability of coagulation study results. Discontinue Activase if the pretreatment International Normalized Ratio (INR) is greater than 1.7 or the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is elevated [see Contraindications (4.1)].

2.2 Acute Myocardial Infarction

Administer Activase as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms.

The recommended total doses for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is based on patient weight, not to exceed 100 mg, regardless of the selected administration regimen (accelerated or 3 hour, described below).

There are two Activase dose regimens (accelerated and 3-hour) for use in the management of AMI; there are no controlled studies to compare clinical outcomes with these regimens [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Accelerated Infusion

The recommended accelerated infusion dose consists of an IV bolus [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5)] followed by an IV infusion as set forth in Table 1.

The safety and efficacy of accelerated infusion of Activase have only been investigated with concomitant administration of heparin and aspirin [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

3-Hour Infusion

For patients weighing ≥ 65 kg, the recommended dose is 100 mg administered as 60 mg in the first hour (6–10 mg administered as a bolus), 20 mg over the second hour, and 20 mg over the third hour. For smaller patients (< 65 kg), a dose of 1.25 mg/kg administered over 3 hours may be used. Weight-based doses are shown in Table 2.

2.3 Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

The recommended dose is 100 mg administered by IV infusion over 2 hours.

Institute parenteral anticoagulation near the end of or immediately following the Activase infusion when the partial thromboplastin time or thrombin time returns to twice normal or less.

### Fibrinolysis or primary PCI in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^116QjjFu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

It is not known whether prehospital fibrinolysis, coupled with timely coronary angiography, provides a clinical outcome similar to that with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) early after acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Methods

Among 1892 patients with STEMI who presented within 3 hours after symptom onset and who were unable to undergo primary PCI within 1 hour, patients were randomly assigned to undergo either primary PCI or fibrinolytic therapy with bolus tenecteplase (amended to half dose in patients ≥ 75 years of age), clopidogrel, and enoxaparin before transport to a PCI-capable hospital. Emergency coronary angiography was performed if fibrinolysis failed; otherwise, angiography was performed 6 to 24 hours after randomization. The primary end point was a composite of death, shock, congestive heart failure, or reinfarction up to 30 days.

Results

The primary end point occurred in 116 of 939 patients (12.4%) in the fibrinolysis group and in 135 of 943 patients (14.3%) in the primary PCI group (relative risk in the fibrinolysis group, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.09; P = 0.21). Emergency angiography was required in 36.3% of patients in the fibrinolysis group, whereas the remainder of patients underwent angiography at a median of 17 hours after randomization. More intracranial hemorrhages occurred in the fibrinolysis group than in the primary PCI group (1.0% vs. 0.2%, P = 0.04; after protocol amendment, 0.5% vs. 0.3%, P = 0.45). The rates of nonintracranial bleeding were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Prehospital fibrinolysis with timely coronary angiography resulted in effective reperfusion in patients with early STEMI who could not undergo primary PCI within 1 hour after the first medical contact. However, fibrinolysis was associated with a slightly increased risk of intracranial bleeding. (Funded by Boehringer Ingelheim; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00623623.).

### Role of fibrinolytic therapy in the current era of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction management [^112hDA5J]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

In patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, early, effective reperfusion of the culprit artery is needed to salvage myocardium, maintain left ventricular function, and reduce mortality. According to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the treatment of these patients, the time from medical contact (i.e., firm ST-elevation myocardial infarction diagnosis) to initiation of fibrinolytic therapy (door-to-needle time) should be 30 minutes, and the time from medical contact to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (door-to-balloon time) should be 90 minutes. Because many patients present to hospitals that are not equipped to administer PCI, door-to-balloon time often falls far short of the ideal. When PCI is not readily available, efficient prehospital treatment with t-PA-based fibrinolytic agent formulations that can be delivered in a bolus and do not require weight-based adjustment may reduce mortality rates and result in outcomes similar to PCI when administered promptly.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of reperfusion therapy with fibrinolytic agents in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115hX5qh]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Fibrinolytic therapy offers an alternative to mechanical reperfusion for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in settings where health-care resources are scarce. Comprehensive evidence comparing different agents is still unavailable. In this study, we examined the effects of various fibrinolytic drugs on clinical outcomes.

Methods

We did a network meta-analysis based on a systematic review of randomised controlled trials comparing fibrinolytic drugs in patients with STEMI. Several databases were searched from inception up to Feb 28, 2017. We included only randomised controlled trials that compared fibrinolytic agents as a reperfusion therapy in adult patients with STEMI, whether given alone or in combination with adjunctive antithrombotic therapy, against other fibrinolytic agents, a placebo, or no treatment. Only trials investigating agents with an approved indication of reperfusion therapy in STEMI (streptokinase, tenecteplase, alteplase, and reteplase) were included. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality within 30–35 days and the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016042131).

Findings

A total of 40 eligible studies involving 128071 patients treated with 12 different fibrinolytic regimens were assessed. Compared with accelerated infusion of alteplase with parenteral anticoagulants as background therapy, streptokinase and non-accelerated infusion of alteplase were significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 1.14 [95% CI 1.05–1.24] for streptokinase plus parenteral anticoagulants; RR 1.26 [1.10–1.45] for non-accelerated alteplase plus parenteral anticoagulants). No significant difference in mortality risk was recorded between accelerated infusion of alteplase, tenecteplase, and reteplase with parenteral anticoagulants as background therapy. For major bleeding, a tenecteplase-based regimen tended to be associated with lower risk of bleeding compared with other regimens (RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.63–1.00]). The addition of glycoprotein IIb or IIIa inhibitors to fibrinolytic therapy increased the risk of major bleeding by 1.27–8.82-times compared with accelerated infusion alteplase plus parenteral anticoagulants (RR 1.47 [95% CI 1.10–1.98] for tenecteplase plus parenteral anticoagulants plus glycoprotein inhibitors; RR 1.88 [1.24–2.86] for reteplase plus parenteral anticoagulants plus glycoprotein inhibitors).

Interpretation

Significant differences exist among various fibrinolytic regimens as reperfusion therapy in STEMI and alteplase (accelerated infusion), tenecteplase, and reteplase should be considered over streptokinase and non-accelerated infusion of alteplase. The addition of glycoprotein IIb or IIIa inhibitors to fibrinolytic therapy should be discouraged.

### Effect of time delay on reperfusion after tenecteplase in an extended time window: analysis from the CHABLIS-T trials [^117EYde2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Of the 310 patients enrolled in the CHABLIS‐T trials, a number of 199 patients received tenecteplase treatment per protocol (CHABLIS‐T: 86 patients, CHABLIS‐T II: 113 patients; 0.25 mg/kg:156 patients [78.4%], 0.32 mg/kg: 43 patients [21.6%]). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 68.0 (59.0–76.0) years old and the median (IQR) of baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 10.0 (6.0–14.0). A proportion of 33.7% (67) patients achieved major reperfusion after thrombolytic treatment. The clinical and imaging characteristics were listed in Table 1. One patient receiving tenecteplase treatment could not report the accurate time of symptom onset. Therefore, a number of 198 patients were included in the analysis of time from symptom onset and major reperfusion.

### Prasugrel hydrochloride (prasugrel) [^112KhfTP]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The clinical evidence for the effectiveness of prasugrel is derived from the TRITON-TIMI 38 (TR ial to Assess I mprovement in T herapeutic Outcomes by O ptimizing Platelet Inhibitio N with Prasugrel) study, a 13,608 patient, multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study comparing prasugrel to a regimen of clopidogrel, each added to aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with ACS (UA, NSTEMI, or STEMI) who were to be managed with PCI. Randomization was stratified for UA/NSTEMI and STEMI.

Patients with UA/NSTEMI presenting within 72 hours of symptom onset were to be randomized after undergoing coronary angiography. Patients with STEMI presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset could be randomized prior to coronary angiography. Patients with STEMI presenting between 12 hours and 14 days of symptom onset were to be randomized after undergoing coronary angiography. Patients underwent PCI, and for both UA/NSTEMI and STEMI patients, the loading dose was to be administered anytime between randomization and 1 hour after the patient left the catheterization lab. If patients with STEMI were treated with thrombolytic therapy, randomization could not occur until at least 24 hours (for tenecteplase, reteplase, or alteplase) or 48 hours (for streptokinase) after the thrombolytic was given.
