## Question

6.31 Team A and Team B each send out 7 players to participate in a Go relay match according to a pre-arranged order. Both sides start with the No. 1 player competing, the loser is eliminated, and the winner then competes with the No. 2 player from the losing side, $\cdots$, until all players from one side are eliminated, and the other side wins, forming a match process. How many different possible match processes are there?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many different possible match processes there are in a Go relay match where Team A and Team B each have 7 players, the loser is eliminated, and the winner stays on until one team is eliminated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the structure of a single match process as a sequence of wins and losses. Then, I should verify the constraints that determine when a process ends. Next, I will map valid sequences to a combinatorial model and check whether it reduces to a known counting problem. Finally, I will compute the exact number and confirm it with a small example before stating the general formula.

> Let me first confirm the mechanics of a match process. Each game pits the current survivor from one team against the next player from the other team, the loser is eliminated, and the winner remains to face the next opponent, continuing until all 7 players on one team are eliminated, at which point the other team wins and the process ends [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I capture the ending condition correctly. A match process ends when either Team A loses 7 players or Team B loses 7 players, so the total number of games is always 7 plus the number of games won by the losing team, which means the total number of games ranges from 7 to 13, and the last game must be a win by the ultimate victor that eliminates the final player of the losing team [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about modeling. At first glance, I thought of modeling this as a path on a grid where I move right for an A win and up for a B win, but wait, that would imply the process ends when we reach 7 wins for either team, which is not quite right because the process actually ends when one team accumulates 7 losses, not 7 wins, so I should correct that and model losses instead of wins to reflect elimination [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider and reframe. A match process can be represented as a sequence of A-losses and B-losses, where the process ends when either there are 7 A-losses or 7 B-losses, and the last element in the sequence is the 7th loss of the losing team. This means the total length of the sequence is 7 plus the number of losses by the winning team, which ranges from 7 to 13, and the final element is fixed as the 7th loss of the loser, so I need to count the number of ways to arrange the preceding losses before that final, decisive loss [^notfound].

> I should double-check the combinatorial translation. For a process that ends with Team A losing, I need exactly 6 A-losses and k B-losses in some order, followed by a final A-loss, where k ranges from 0 to 6, and similarly for Team B losing, I need exactly 6 B-losses and k A-losses followed by a final B-loss. Thus, the total number of distinct processes is the sum over k from 0 to 6 of the ways to arrange 6 A-losses and k B-losses, plus the same sum with 6 B-losses and k A-losses, which equals 2 times the sum of binomial coefficients C(6 + k, 6) for k from 0 to 6 [^notfound].

> Let me verify the calculation. The sum of C(6 + k, 6) for k from 0 to 6 is C(6,6) + C(7,6) + C(8,6) + C(9,6) + C(10,6) + C(11,6) + C(12,6), which equals 1 + 7 + 28 + 84 + 210 + 462 + 924 = 1716, so the total number of distinct match processes is 2 × 1716 = 3432 [^notfound].

> But wait, what if I misapplied the hockey-stick identity? I should confirm that the sum of C(6 + k, 6) from k = 0 to 6 equals C(13,7). Indeed, by the hockey-stick identity, the sum of C(r + k, r) from k = 0 to n is C(r + n + 1, r + 1), so here r = 6 and n = 6, giving C(13,7) = 1716, which matches my manual sum, so the total is 2 × C(13,7) = 3432 [^notfound].

> Let me sanity-check with a smaller case to ensure the logic holds. If each team has 1 player, the only possible processes are A loses or B loses, so there should be 2 distinct processes. Using the same formula, 2 × C(1 + 0, 1) = 2 × 1 = 2, which checks out, and for 2 players per team, the formula gives 2 × C(3,2) = 2 × 3 = 6, which also matches enumeration of the six possible loss sequences ending in the second loss of the loser, so the pattern is consistent [^notfound].

> Therefore, I can conclude with confidence that the number of different possible match processes for 7 players per team is 3432, which equals 2 × C(13,7), or equivalently, the sum over k from 0 to 6 of [C(6 + k, 6) + C(6 + k, 6)] reflecting the two symmetric cases where Team A or Team B is the loser [^notfound].

---

The number of different possible match processes is **3432**. This is calculated by recognizing that each match process corresponds to a sequence of 7 wins for one team and 0–6 wins for the other, ending when one team reaches 7 wins. The total number of such sequences is the sum of binomial coefficients (\\binom{13}{7}) (for Team A winning) plus (\\binom{13}{7}) (for Team B winning), which equals (2 \\times \\binom{13}{7} = 3432).

---

## Modeling the match process

Let us model the match process as a sequence of wins for Team A and Team B, where the match ends when one team reaches 7 wins. Each sequence must contain exactly 7 wins for the winning team and between 0 and 6 wins for the losing team. The total number of games in a sequence is therefore between 7 and 13.

---

## Counting the sequences

We can count the sequences by considering the number of ways to arrange the wins for each team. For a given number of wins for the losing team (say, (k)), the number of ways to arrange the sequence is given by the binomial coefficient (\\binom{7 + k - 1}{k}), which represents the number of ways to choose (k) positions for the losing team's wins out of (7 + k - 1) total positions (since the last game must be a win for the winning team).

---

## Total number of sequences

The total number of different match processes is the sum of the number of sequences for each possible number of wins for the losing team, multiplied by 2 (since either Team A or Team B can be the winning team):

[
\\text{Total sequences} = 2 \\times \\sum_{k = 0}^{6} \\binom{7 + k - 1}{k}
]

This simplifies to:

[
\\text{Total sequences} = 2 \\times \\sum_{k = 0}^{6} \\binom{6 + k}{k}
]

Using the identity (\\sum_{k = 0}^{n} \\binom{r + k}{k} = \\binom{r + n + 1}{n}), we have:

[
\\sum_{k = 0}^{6} \\binom{6 + k}{k} = \\binom{13}{6} = 1716
]

Therefore, the total number of different match processes is:

[
\\text{Total sequences} = 2 \\times 1716 = 3432
]

---

## Conclusion

The number of different possible match processes in a Go relay match between two teams of 7 players each is **3432**.

Conclusion

This novel study found that PHCT processes during varying match frequencies were associated with PA. PHCT structure, as defined by ITEM, further informed an understanding of the relationship between team processes and PA during periods where the organisational context and resources (structural inputs) altered PHCT processes. This suggests that the PHCT structure can only be translated into optimised PA if team processes are effective and resources are sufficient during fluctuating match frequencies. During match congestion, efficient information flow between staff and an interprofessional teamwork approach within meetings is associated with improved PA.

Materials and methods

This sequential explanatory mixed-method case study was conducted throughout the 2017–2018 English Championship football season.

The processes adopted by a PHCT, their structure and outcomes of their work were investigated using the ITEM to establish their teamwork effectiveness. The ITEM, a flexible framework adaptable to specific teams and settings, was used (box 1) to investigate a PHCT in a single club. Teamwork was considered a linked process: inputs (team composition, characteristics, ie, structure), translated through mediators (ie, team member interactions and processes), to outputs (ie, outcomes of team activities). It is implicit that a team's processes can be investigated by considering the interactions of its members, given the potential for complex team dynamics.

Box 1
The adapted Integrated Team Effectiveness Model framework that was used to guide this study

Team structure (inputs)

Task type: management and delivery of performance and health

Task features: interdependence/autonomy, specialised knowledge/expertise

Team composition: disciplines, size, diversity, tenure, team premise

Organisational context: external support

Team processes (mediators)

Team meetings: communication, collaboration, coordination, decision-making, participation, conflict, evaluation, goals/objectives

Teamwork effectiveness (output)

Objective: player availability

Subjective: perceived effectiveness

PHCT and data collection

10 practitioners delivering performance/health support to professional first team players within a club were recruited, comprising sports science and medicine staff (ie, the PHCT) (table 1). Each practitioner completed the team process questionnaire every 2 weeks (14 times in-season, from October to May) and a team structure questionnaire 7 days post season. 1 week later, they participated in a focus group discussion.

One important element for forming and cultivating a high performing team in any sport is player selection. For most professional sports, this is an intense period whereby coaching, performance, and administrative staff must work together and use collective wisdom to identify players who have the best probability of consistent high performance. The stakes of a draft are high: the wrong choice can be incredibly costly and impact a team's performance and culture for many years. This article identifies and details common features of the drafting procedure, followed by a discussion of best practices for structuring and executing a draft protocol.

Team Process Questionnaire

Two times per month during the competitive season, all PHCT staff completed a validated team process questionnaire(online supplemental content). Part 1 assessed practitioner participation, interaction and satisfaction with meeting discussions and results, using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 'not at all' (score = 1) to 'a very great extent' (score = 5). It also identified the PHCT 'teamwork approach' (ie, interprofessional or multidisciplinary).

Part 2 of this questionnaire assessed PHCT evaluations (work audits/reviews), the frequency of staff informal interactions (outside of meetings), team goals and objectives, individual influence on decisions, the match frequency's impact on work performed and the frequency of team meetings, in line with the processes identified within the adapted ITEM. Questionnaires were returned within 10 days of receipt to minimise recall error.

Team Structure Questionnaire

Each PHCT completed a bespoke team structure questionnaire 7 days post season, to capture organisational context, task types/features and staffing composition (online supplemental content). Guided by the adapted ITEM, the questionnaire included open and closed Likert scale questions ('not at all' (score = 1) to 'a very great extent' (score = 5)) to describe the PHCT structure. Triangulation through a focus group discussion was used to enhance the content validity of this questionnaire and increase confidence in the findings. The 7-day gap post season allowed practitioners to reflect before completing the questionnaire.

Focus group discussion

PHCT members participated in an audiorecorded, in-person focus group discussion to explore collective understanding of their work and the environment in which it was conducted. Moderated by the lead researcher and supported by a facilitator (research assistant) who observed and took notes, the discussion followed a semistructured guide based on the adapted ITEM and questionnaire results, aligning with an explanatory mixed-method design. The lead researcher transcribed the audio recording verbatim, and the research assistant verified accuracy. Observational notes were added to support analysis.

Team structure

PHCT areas of practice included training load monitoring, recovery activities and injury treatment, all of which were reported most frequently during congested periods. Practitioners reported that specialist knowledge accounted for 82 ± 8% of their total work. Injury treatment and rehabilitation were primarily managed by sports medicine staff, while sports science staff focused on training load and recovery monitoring. All members of the PHCT conducted data management and exercise prescription. 80% of the PHCT perceived their work approach as predominantly interprofessional rather than multidisciplinary.

Match frequency, injuries and PHCT structure

Table 4 illustrates the primary themes from the Team Structure Questionnaire. Altered working arrangements during match-congested periods, driven by increased injuries, were cited by 70% of the PHCT. Furthermore, resource issues, including staffing and equipment, were considered to impact engagement with other staff, as well as a need to prioritise decisions based on data during busy periods. These results converge with the fluctuations in the teamwork approach reported in the quantitative data across varying match frequencies.

Table 3
Thematic analysis of open-ended questions in the Team Structure Questionnaire

Focus group discussion

10 themes and 7 core concepts emerged relating to PHCT structure and processes (table 4). Match congestion was associated with more injuries, necessitating specific skills ('contextual competencies') when working with limited resources. The PHCT perceived that these resources had to be spread thinly between injured players and those available to train and compete. Despite the evolving refinement of 'teamwork practices', resource constraints reduced time for meetings and collaboration, despite these being considered pivotal for reviewing prior work and planning future activities. These challenges were perceived to negatively impact PA, aligning with the quantitative findings (ie, the association between match frequency, number of meetings and PA).

Table 4
Coding index and core concept development from the focus group discussion

Pressure to 'win the next match', particularly when matches were congested and results were not favourable, was also reported. This coincided with PHCT staff citing instances where the head coach overrode their 'return to play' decision-making, highlighting the challenges in their work.

Match frequency

Match congestion was operationalised based on match frequency. Based on the team schedule and using both the number of hours between consecutive matches and the number of matches played (eg, over 6.9 days/3 matches played = match frequency of 2.3), match frequency illustrated the time frames within which the PHCT could conduct their work for given stages of the season. 'Match congestion' for any given period was identified when there was a match frequency of ≤ 3 days.

Player availability (PA)

PA data, provided monthly throughout the study by the head of sports medicine, were correlated with team process questionnaire responses collected within the same month. These data only included players deemed eligible to compete in each match as determined by the PHCT and included players omitted for technical or rule violations who were not considered ill or injured.

Data analysis

Quantitative and qualitative data were first analysed separately and subsequently merged to draw inferences across both, including how PHCT structure might further inform an understanding of relationships between processes and outcomes. This approach explored convergence or contradictions in findings, consistent with an explanatory mixed-method design.

Quantitative analysis

Descriptive statistics are presented as the mean ± SD for the team process questionnaire. Data were checked for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and linearity and homoscedasticity were evaluated using box plots and scatterplots. Questionnaire domain scores were averaged per biweekly 'stage' to calculate overall scores. Bivariate Pearson correlation assessed relationships between PHCT process scores, PA, match frequency and congestion for the 14 biweekly stages. A separate Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between the PHCT's 'teamwork approach' and PA across the season. Due to the small sample size (n = 14), all correlations used the bootstrap method to generate bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap CI (BCa). SPSS Statistics for Windows V.23.0 was used for analysis.

Descriptive statistics extracted from the team structure questionnaire highlighted PHCT characteristics, including organisational support for innovation, practitioner specialist roles and their integration with the team (0–100% scale).

### 'Good communication and good team building, it's half of the work in managing a player': how team doctors perceive communication in the European professional men's football context [^9cc98e31]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

More resources: money, technology, structure

Many doctors with long experience in the field described the changes over their careers. The growth of professional football, with more financial resources, a more extensive staff structure and technological inputs, was perceived to influence communication. The innovations in Global Positioning System technology and diagnostics tools were examples of improvements in communication by providing more objective data and giving more credibility to the information being shared.

Match importance and results

Team doctors also mentioned how the context of competition and team standing can influence communication. For an important match, if a player could potentially return earlier to the pitch, communication intensifies, and the doctors, head coaches, players and other professionals need to be well-informed and agree with the decision. There is constant monitoring of players' recovery process and regular communication to discuss potential risks. The team's success or standings were also described as influencing communication. When the team is winning and leading the standings, communication is smoother and more manageable, but communication becomes more challenging when the team 'is not doing well' (D05). For example, a head coach might be less open to dialogue regarding the decision of player participation in a match, which requires the team doctors to adapt their communication strategies.

Different cultures, perspectives and interests need to be aligned in one plan

Different stakeholders in the team were linked to different interests, which was mentioned as a challenge by the interviewees. The different cultural and professional backgrounds add to this challenge, which requires the team doctors to manage the communication process differently. The multiplicity of views was perceived as an inherent part of professional football. Still, the doctors perceive the need to adapt communication strategies when such views, interests or agendas diverge.

Interventions or exposures (I)

The interventions or exposures are related to team match performance (ie, match statistics) and success as dependent variables (ie, match outcomes, team ranking and the number of points). Only the interventions defined at the beginning of this review are included. They can be prematch, in-match and postmatch and from various domains, including but not limited to:

Fitness or medical conditioning programmes, for example, FIFA 11+programme.
Nutritional, medication and hydration administration, for example, supplements and medication.
Psychological techniques: team communication and cohesion.
Strategical and tactical decisions, for example, game styles and patterns.
Travel and equipment-related interventions, for example, protective equipment.
Training periodisation, for example, weekly and competitive load.

Comparisons (C)

The comparators will be optional but include the interventions' groups, allowing for direct comparison of their impact on team performance and success between different or within the same domain.

Outcomes (O)

The primary outcomes are the following according to the following premises: the competition is determined by a three-point rule, in which the winning team consists of the team with the greater number of goals and points, there is uncertainty in short outcomes or match-level, and medium-term outcomes or the season's results, and football is a zero-sum game. Based on these premises, the following outcomes were included: goals scored, goals conceded, goals difference, the number of winnings, the number of losses, the difference between winning and losses, categorical and dichotomous match outcomes, team final ranking, number of points and difference of number of points. In addition, the secondary outcomes will be related to team match performance, including but not limited to the physical, for example, accelerations and total distance; technical, for example, dribbles, shots on goal; tactical, for example, transition-state attack/defence, defence subphase; and medical, for example, injury incidence.

Study designs (S)

The systematic review includes case–control, cross-sectional and longitudinal or cohort observational studies.

Others (date, language, source and statistical reporting)

Articles in any language or date are considered. However, non-English papers will be translated using machine translation. Only studies published in peer-reviewed journals with quantitative statistical models or machine learning techniques will be included.

### Basis functions for complex social decisions in dorsomedial frontal cortex [^04c24821]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

We used several measures to streamline the pre-experiment and the subsequent fMRI decision-making experiment in terms of the participants' subjective experience. First, participants performed a few practice trials of the pre-experiment, in which they were given explicit performance feedback, and this feedback was cued using the same cues that also indicated successful and erroneous performance in the main fMRI experiment (a yellow coin for successful performance and a red X for erroneous performance). For participants, this measure underscored the fact that performance indices presented during fMRI scanning related to the participants' own performances in the pre-experiment period. Second, during the pre-experiment, participants performed sequences of six RDK trials in a sequence, followed by an intertrial interval of 1 s. This blocking of trials corresponded to the fact that in the fMRI experiment, participants observed rapid performance sequences of six performance cues in a row for each participant on each trial. So, again, this measure was taken to align the participants' experience of the pre-experiment with the main fMRI experiment. Third, during the entire pre-experiment, the layout of the screen was similar to the screen of the main fMRI experiment in the following way. Cues referring to self, partner and the two opponents were distributed over the screen, with each player occupying either a top-left, top-right, bottom-left or bottom-right position. These cue positions were the same in the pre-experiment and the main fMRI experiment. They remained fixed throughout the entire experimental procedures for each participant, but they were randomized and balanced across participants, with the restriction that the partner position would always be adjacent to the self position (self and partner could occupy the two upper positions, for example, or the two left-sided positions). The cue for self was not shown most of the time during the pre-experiment; instead, participants saw the RDK stimuli that they were asked to respond to in this location. However, the cues indicating the other three players were shown throughout the pre-experiment, despite being irrelevant for the task performed during the pre-experiment. This measure was used to indicate during the pre-experiment that participants' performances would be paired with the performance of three other players in the main fMRI experiment, and to demonstrate the team pairings (self and partner versus two opponents). Hence, again, this measure served to ensure that the participants' experiences in the pre-experiment and main fMRI experiment were similar.

### Performance and healthcare team processes and structure impact player availability in professional men's football [^9ef5f40b]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether the structures and processes of an English Championship football club's performance and healthcare team (PHCT) were associated with player availability (PA) during periods of match congestion (≤ 3days between matches).

Methods

This sequential explanatory mixed-method case study included 10 practitioners from the PHCT. Participants completed team process/structure questionnaires two times per month during the 2017–2018 season. PA and match frequency data were provided by the PHCT, who also participated in a postseason focus group. Associations between PA and team structures/processes were assessed using Pearson correlations. Framework analysis was used to explore PHCT perceptions of teamwork effectiveness. Results synthesis was guided by the Integrated Team Effectiveness Model.

Results

Mean PA during match congestion was 78.1% (95% bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap CI (BCa): 76.2%, 80.4%) compared with 84.2% (95% BCa: 80.6%, 87.3%) during uncongested periods. There were significant associations between match frequency and PA (r = -0.68; 95% BCa: 0.32, 0.93; p = 0.008) and PHCT processes and PA (r = 0.53; 95% BCa: 0.09, 0.89; p = 0.035). Having more PHCT meetings (r = 0.46; BCa 95%: 0.22, 0.82; p = 0.048) and greater satisfaction with those meetings (r = 0.41; BCa 95%: 0.04, 0.07; p = 0.043) were associated with higher PA, irrespective of match frequency. During match congestion, the PHCT reported that resource and task coordination issues negatively impacted their processes.

Conclusions

Match congestion was associated with disruptions to PHCT processes and structure, with negative implications for PA.

### Performance and healthcare team processes and structure impact player availability in professional men's football [^c8c163eb]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Elite men's football presents significant performance and health challenges due to the high risk of injuryand frequency of competition. Football squads with fewer injuries and consistent, uninterrupted training are likely to finish in higher league positions. Consequently, an increasing range of practitioners are employed within multidisciplinary performance and healthcare teams (PHCTs). While PHCTs have benefited from considerable scientific advances informing preparation, participation and recovery from training and competition, limited evidence is available on the effectiveness of PHCT work and their teamwork approach. Although the importance of collaboration and interprofessional education to patient outcomes and team function is increasingly recognised within sports science and medicine, their structured implementation in sport and exercise medicine remains limited.

'Teamwork' within multidisciplinary teams refers to the degree to which behavioural processes (eg, communication, collaboration, expertise sharing) or non-technical skills are used to accomplish interdependent work and/or the affective, cognitive and motivational states (eg, cohesion or conflict) that emerge during that work. Organisational research outside of sport that includes healthcare, aviation and manufacturing, as well as teamwork studies employing theoretically guided framework models, highlights that multidisciplinary teams working in highly pressured environments often have suboptimal and sometimes catastrophic outcomes without due consideration of their processes and structure. Organisational studies suggest that multidisciplinary teams that interact collaboratively and participate in shared decision-making (defined as an interprofessional teamwork approach) have favourable outcomes when compared with teams whose individuals work towards independent goals with limited interaction or shared decision-making (ie, a multidisciplinary teamwork approach).

The relevance of teamwork effectiveness, reflecting relationships between a PHCT's structure and processes in elite football, remains largely unknown. UEFA's ongoing elite club injury researchindicates that PHCTs with higher communication quality experience lower injury burden and higher player availability (PA). UEFA's prospective studies implicate match intensity and communication as risk factors for injury, consistent with the evidence from other multidisciplinary teams working under time constraints and pressure. Furthermore, research focused on interprofessional collaboration between sport science and medical professionals has indicated potential relationships with care quality. Research on PHCTs and outcomes of their teamwork effectiveness is therefore warranted due to potential implications for professional football players' performance and health. This study investigated whether the structures and processes adopted by a PHCT were associated with PA during periods of match congestion, using the Integrated Team Effectiveness Model (ITEM).

### Improving predictor selection for injury modelling methods in male footballers [^be912cc5]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Data pre-processing, predictor selection and model development

A summary of processes and results for the model and predictor selection stages have been outlined in figure 1. The dataset was structured to reflect the way in which the model would be used in clinical practice, that is, each time a player trained or played a match, it was established as a separate episode (sample) in which injury could occur. The dataset therefore contained a total of 2784 episodes for potential injury. All analysis was conducted in the software package R V.3.5.1using the associated packages listed in online supplementary file 1. Missing data were handled using a multi-imputation method. The multi-imputation method was undertaken based on the predictive mean matching for continuous predictors and multinomial logistic regression for categorical predictors. A single database was used for the predictor selection and model development processes as outlined below.

Figure 1
Summary of results for the predictor selection and modelling processes.

Characteristics of the dependent variable (injury severity) were evaluated in order to identify the most appropriate modelling method. Sports and exercise medicine practitioners looking to reduce the risk of injury for individual players need to decide whether a team member's condition means they are safe to train and play in the squad on a sessional basis. Given that practitioners are concerned with the likelihood of injury over time and the number of days missed through injury, the dependent variable was considered as count data which follows a Poisson distribution. On further analysis, it was identified that the count outcome of the dependent variable suffered from overdispersion and excess zeros (table 3). Therefore, the ZIP regression model for prediction in the second stage was selected.

### Postmatch recovery of physical performance and biochemical markers in team ball sports: a systematic review [^f889aa1c]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Elite team sports players are exposed to busy schedules of training and matches. During the competitive season, players have a match every week and sometimes even twice a week due to international competitions and domestic Cup league matches. In elite soccer, players participate in approximately 60 matches during a season, which equates 5.5 matches per month. These highly congested match schedules put a lot of strain on these players. In addition, studies reveal the high intensity and variable character of intermittent team ball sports of which the time course of match recovery is unknown. To be able to prevent health problems and to perform at the highest possible level, sufficient recovery is crucial in this matter.

In order to plan subsequent training sessions or prepare for upcoming matches, knowledge is needed about time courses of recovery. Although match performance is highly variable and depends on several contextual factors, it is assumed that the intensity during matches is maximal and most strain is placed on players. Profiles of physical performance and biochemical markers after a match in team ball sports (eg, soccer, rugby, handball, basketball, Australian rules football) are needed in order to get a realistic view of recovery and underlying mechanisms. These different types of sport have likely unique recovery profiles caused by the diversity of game demands such as number of jumps, sprints and collisions. By comparing profiles within and between different team ball sports, all of which are characterised by high-intensity and intermittent activities, the recovery process will be better understood.

Discussion

Meetings were pivotal for integrating knowledge across disciplines, aligning well with practitioners' perception of satisfaction regarding discussions, solutions that emerged and their individual participation in meetings over the season. This may underpin the strong association between the number of meetings and PA in this study, as illustrated by the positive correlation between practitioners' ratings of their confidence in and responsibility for plans that emerged from meetings ('results satisfaction') and PA. However, match congestion led to a reduction in meeting frequency, resulting in a shift toward autonomous work and associated lower productivity. Similar trends have been observed in other high-pressure healthcare settings.

Consistent with the findings from match congestion research, match frequency was strongly associated with PA. During congested periods, the PHCT faced challenges (ie, more injuries, less preparation time, limited resources), leading to prioritisation of practices, including recovery and risk assessments. PHCT practitioner interactions in meetings were strongly associated with PA. While teamwork scores could not definitively distinguish interprofessional from multidisciplinary approaches at specific time points, seasonal variations indicated that the PHCT meetings were conducted on a continuum between the two.

An interprofessional approach involved greater collaboration and shared decision-making between practitioners, evident when matches were not congested; however, when matches were congested and results were not favourable, practitioners cited higher levels of stress resulting from the need to 'win the next game' and coaching staff interventions. This resulted in deviations from collective decisions and alterations to processes, which practitioners believed contributed to additional injuries. This echoes findings from sport science and medical team research where interprofessional collaboration has been considered important to care delivery, suggesting that these benefits may be diminished during fixture congestion, when collaborative practices are most constrained. The need to win is inherently the driving force behind PHCT work, though this may conflict with their need to protect the long-term health of players. Relationships between the PHCT and coaching staff (the 'organisational context' in ITEM) are an important consideration and may have contributed to PA in this study.

### The science of teamwork: progress, reflections, and the road ahead [^3f143a4e]. The American Psychologist (2018). Low credibility.

We need teams in nearly every aspect of our lives (e.g., hospitals, schools, flight decks, nuclear power plants, oil rigs, the military, and corporate offices). Nearly a century of psychological science has uncovered extensive knowledge about team-related processes and outcomes. In this article, we draw from the reviews and articles of this special issue to identify 10 key reflections that have arisen in the team literature, briefly summarized here. Team researchers have developed many theories surrounding the multilayered aspects of teams, such that now we have a solid theoretical basis for teams. We have recognized that the collective is often stronger than the individual, initiating the shift from individual tasks to team tasks. All teams are not created equal, so it is important to consider the context to understand relevant team dynamics and outcomes, but sometimes teams performing in different contexts are more similar than not. It is critical to have teamwork-supportive organizational conditions and environments where psychological safety can flourish and be a mechanism to resolve conflicts, ensure safety, mitigate errors, learn, and improve performance. There are also helpful teamwork competencies that can increase effectiveness across teams or tasks that have been identified (e.g., coordination, communication, and adaptability). Even if a team is made up of experts, it can still fail if they do not know how to cooperate, coordinate, and communicate well together. To ensure the improvement and maintenance of effective team functioning, the organization must implement team development interventions and evaluate relevant team outcomes with robust diagnostic measurement. We conclude with 3 main directions for scientists to expand upon in the future: (a) address issues with technology to make further improvements in team assessment, (b) learn more about multiteam systems, and (c) bridge the gap between theory and practice. In summary, the science of teams has made substantial progress but still has plenty of room for advancement. (PsycINFO Database Record

### Yin and yang, or peas in a pod? Individual-sport versus team-sport athletes and altitude training [^48469f4b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Structure of competition

Analysis of the competition schedule differences between cyclists and soccer athletes is essential in deciding if altitude training is even feasible. The training and competition year of cyclists and soccer athletes are very different. Professional road cyclists can have up to approximately 100 racing days per season, sometimes starting in Januaryand continuing through to October for competition at World Championships. Within this period, and depending on the type of rider, cyclists compete in 1-day races, ∼1–2-week tours with consecutive days of racing, or even 'Grand Tours' of 21 days duration with only 1–2 days of rest and approximately 3500–4000 km of racing, interspersed with rest and training. Tour races typically include a time-trial, and varying amounts of flat or climbing stages, possibly including mountain-top finishes at moderate altitude. The activity profile of cyclists varies considerably according to the type of stage and terrain encountered in these stages.

Each stage of a multiday race is effectively its own race, with some cyclists attempting to win individual stages, others wanting the fastest overall time for the race to become the 'General Classification', or overall winner. Each rider is part of a team, and has a defined role, as leader, helper (domestiqué), or even opportunist to attempt individual stage victories. The activity profile of the cyclists therefore changes dramatically depending on the role of the cyclist in each stage or race.

Contrast the cycling season to that of elite soccer players, where the European season starts in August and continues through to May, or longer, depending on National team commitments of individual players. All official soccer matches are played over approximately 90 minon a grass surface, with similar field dimensions. While there are players with specific roles, playing in specific positions, excluding the goal-keeper, the differences in activity profile between positions may not be as large, and importantly not as meaningful, as between discrete stages or roles in cycling tour races. An obvious difference between the two sports is that cycling races are held over a certain distance, where the time to complete the task varies, where soccer matches are played over a fixed time and the distance covered by individuals varies.

### Position statement – altitude training for improving team-sport players' performance: current knowledge and unresolved issues [^adbd6a5a]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Preamble

Team sports are activities that enjoy worldwide participation with large numbers of players training and competing at all levels. As skill proficiency increases, it is clear that overall technical and tactical effectiveness — rather than (competitive) physical performance per se — have a greater impact on winning. Over the last two decades, however, it is indisputable that team sports have experienced a tremendous increase in the tempo of play and energy demands imposed on players during matches. In this context, coaches and their staff are continuously looking for innovative ways to improve match outcomes, and moderate altitude training (∼2000–3000 m)has emerged as a popular ergogenic aid. Precompetition acclimatisation while residing at altitude (eg, training for 1–2 weeks at the competition venue elevation) versus using altitude training to improve players' 'trainability' and competition performance in the days and weeks following return to sea level (eg, 2–3 weeks of living high and training low during the preseason) are two distinct forms of altitude interventions that were debated by the expert panel. Despite altitude training being an area of interest for many sporting organisations — for example, Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), symposium on playing football at altitudeand the International Olympic Committee (IOC), consensus statement on thermoregulatory and altitude challenges for all high-level athletes — research on the impact of altitude training for team sports is still in its infancy.

### Dynamics of cooperation in concurrent games [^11490833]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We iterate this elementary updating procedure for many time steps. For any finite selection strength β, this generates an ergodic stochastic process. In particular, the players' average cooperation rates (over the course of the learning process) converge in time, and they are independent of the players' initial strategies. For our study, we use simulations to numerically estimate these average rates for all three treatments.

We note that according to our implementation of the evolutionary process, individuals update their strategy either in the high-benefit or in the low-benefit game (but not in both). This implies that once all players adopt a mutually cooperative strategy, any mutant strategy would only deviate in one of the two games. This observation might explain why the strategies depicted in Fig. 2 e are slightly more cooperative after a 'DD' outcome, compared to a 'CD' or 'DC' outcome. Because 'DD' outcomes occur less often, they are under weaker selection. However, we note that overall, our results are independent of the exact evolutionary process we use. In particular, for the same-partner treatment, similar results have been reported by Donahue et al. based on a pairwise comparison process.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^6c7579c1]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Brief overview of physiological demands and energy system interactions in intermittent sports — demands vary from brief (∼ 2 to 6 s) explosive efforts to more prolonged intermittent exercise sequences that challenge peak cardiovascular capacity, with interactions between aerobic and anaerobic energy systems and fatigue resistance mechanisms as prime determinants of exercise tolerance. Intense match scenarios, including repeated maximal actions or longer-lasting intermittent sequences, may induce in-game "transient fatigue" that is short lasting and reversible if proceeded by a break or low-intense period, and the repeated nature and duration of some intermittent codes additionally result in accumulated "end-game" fatigue with heterogeneous origins that typically requires more prolonged recovery. In this context, the concept of "durability" — the ability to sustain performance following prolonged/demanding prior exercise — has attracted significant recent interest in endurance sports and may similarly apply as an important asset in intermittent sports.

### To play or not to play, that is the question: an interview study with amateur football coaches on perceptions of pain during sports participation [^1fd2838e]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Abstract

Amateur football coaches play a key role in preventing, assessing and treating pain among their players, as they are often the first point of contact and may be the main source of advice and guidance. The objective of this study was to explore amateur football coaches' perceptions of pain during sports participation and their approach to pain management. We conducted a qualitative interview study with 20 amateur football coaches from a strategically selected sample of male and female, and junior and senior teams. A semistructured interview guide and conventional qualitative content analysis were used. One overall theme emerged: To play or not to play — coaches navigating difficult terrain with limited resources. The theme included four main categories: How can pain be understood?; Can pain be avoided?; How to manage players with pain?; What resources do we need? Different ways of understanding pain emerged, and coaches described that players have different pain thresholds. Pain was seen as a part of the game that cannot be completely avoided. In general, there was a restrictive attitude regarding pain medication, though actual consumption was not known. Coaches emphasised shared responsibility with players to achieve adequate training loads, a positive communication climate surrounding pain, and a need for education and competence. In conclusion, coaches expressed various interpretations of pain during sports participation and pain management, where they need to take on great responsibility despite limited medical competence. Coaches believed that adequate pain management is important, and their keys to reducing the risk of pain included structured and customised training, a well-balanced training load and recovery, and a positive communication climate in the team. Coaches often decide whether players experiencing pain can participate in team training and match play, emphasising the need for education support and access to medical competence.

### Extended match time exacerbates fatigue and impacts physiological responses in male soccer players [^18c39bd0]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). Medium credibility.

Experimental design

This study is part of the 120-min project funded by the UEFA to investigate the physiological, performance, recovery, and psychological effects of extra time in competitive soccer using a randomized, repeated-measures, crossover, double-blind design. The research design of the 120-min project is shown in Figure 1. In this study, we report the physiological, metabolic, and performance effects of a 30-min extra-time period based on the analysis of the pooled data obtained from the first two games of each trial (n = 40 observations, i.e. two trials with 20 observations (players) per trial), because the diet intervention was not initiated at this point (supplementation took place after game 1), thereby allowing us to study only the net effect of extra time. Therefore, the first two games of the placebo and carbohydrate trial were performed under identical conditions (data following the subsequent diet interventions will be presented in a companion paper). This project was preregistered at(ID: NCT04159194). Participants (n = 20) underwent a thorough baseline screening including assessment of body composition, technical skills and physical performance, resting metabolic rate, daily dietary intake, and physical activity level, followed by a familiarization period during which they were accustomed to the experimental procedures and participated in light training to develop team cohesion over a 7-d period. Subsequently, they completed two trials (placebo vs increased carbohydrate intake during the postgame recovery period) separated by a 10-d wash-out period. Each trial included two 120-min official games (two teams played against each other) performed 3 d apart according to UEFA official schedules for national team tournaments. Field activity (using global positioning system instrumentation), heart rate, technical performance, and water consumption were monitored continuously during matches, as previously done in 90-min games. Body mass measurements (to estimate sweat loss), performance testing, and blood sampling were performed before each game, at baseline, and after 90 and 120 min of play according to procedures used multiple times by our research group. Muscle biopsies were collected before games 1 and 2 of each trial and at 90 and 120 min of game 1 of each trial. There were multiple biopsy stations and performance testing stations to be able to perform the biopsies and testing as fast as possible. Players were taken out of the game in groups of five to approximately comply with the 5-min interval time allowed in official games after the game and before the initiation of extra time. Players were taken out of the game in the interval 87–94 and 117–124 min after the 90 and 120 min, respectively. During the testing, they were replaced by substitute players and then entered the game immediately after testing. The rationale for applying broad-spectrum testing enables us to link game performance, fatigue development, and both physiological alterations at both systemic and muscular levels. Participants were asked to follow a standardized meal plan during the entire experimental period.

### Self-other mergence in the frontal cortex during cooperation and competition [^af5433b7]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Experiment Structure

On each trial, subjects performed a reaction-time minigame. They were told that two other players independently performed the minigame at the same time (Figures S1–S3). We explain the nature of the minigames in detail in Figure S3. The minigames' precise nature is less critical than the fact that they provided a vehicle to investigate how subjects developed an estimate of their ability that was based on their performance and how this changed depending on interactions with two other players whose performances they also saw. On each trial in the experiment, subjects performed a short trial of a minigame and parametric feedback about their own performance and the performance of the other players was provided at the end of each trial (Figure 1 A). Subjects could use the performance feedback to form ability estimates for self and the two others over the course of the experiment.

We used pre-determined performance feedback schedules to carefully match observed performance for self and others and to keep them stable across subjects. This ensured that performance learning for self and others were comparable and that individual differences in task behavior were interpretable. Subjects were told that the performance feedback reflected their objective performance mapped on a 15-point performance scale and that the previously established mapping was the same for all players. Therefore, subjects received explicit and independent performance feedback for all players. Using not only one but two minigames ("time task" and "color task") in pseudorandom trial order made it possible to have, on the one hand, slowly drifting performance shifts within a minigame (as abilities are thought to be relatively stable features) but, on the other hand, reduced sequential correlations across trials (by switching between minigames that were performed at different levels; Figure 1 E) and ensured a full parametric range of performance feedback, thereby making it possible to perform event-related fMRI analysis. Finally, having two minigames allowed us to establish the generality of our findings.

### Neural implementation of computational mechanisms underlying the continuous trade-off between cooperation and competition [^a2d8ad39]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In the cooperative context, players were behaving cooperatively — positioning themselves towards the middle of one of the hemifields and sticking to one side, with a mild but significant shift towards the optimal location as time progressed (β = 0.00086, P = 0.03, fixed effect of trial number in a linear mixed model predicting the distance between players based on dyads and trial number, Fig. 1b, c left column, supplementary Fig. 1a, b, c). Conversely, in the competitive context, participants exhibited more competitive behaviours by positioning themselves closer to the middle of the space (Fig. 1b right) and maintaining the position during the course of the block of trials (Fig. 1c right, supplementary figure 1c). In the intermediate context, participants exhibited a range of cooperative and competitive behaviours (Fig. 1) with a significant shift from the former to the latter and convergence towards the centre as the interaction progressed (β = −0.01, P < 0.005, fixed effect of trial number in a linear mixed model predicting the distance between players based on dyads and trial number, see methods and Fig. 1e mid column).

Having confirmed that players' behaviours were contextually-driven, we moved on to test whether they were also driven by the co-players' behaviour. We hypothesized that participants' behavioural variability in each context could be partly explained by their co-player's behavioural variability, i.e. by deviations from their expected locations. We first looked at how players responded, on average, to changes in positions of their co-player. We grouped all changes in position from one trial to the next into 4 bins, i.e. small and large increases in cooperation or in competition. These were defined with respect to the relative position of the players: if they were converging towards the centre, this was an increase in competition. If they were instead moving away from the centre, this was an increase in cooperation (see Methods).

Injuries

In total, during 3 years of follow-up, 45 players (23.7%) suffered a primary lateral ankle sprain. Ten players experienced at least 1 second sprain. The mean ± SD number of days that a player was unfit to participate in training or matches was 17.7 ± 11.9 days (range, 3–54 days). A detailed overview is presented in Table 5.

Table 5
Overview of the Occurrence of Ankle Sprains, Severity, and Reinjuries, Arranged per Team Category

Since 20 to 50 injury cases are needed to detect moderate to strong associations, this sample size suffices for an analysis of the primary sprains. In contrast, the number of second sprains was too low to permit further analysis. We regarded an injury duration of more than a week as a severe ankle sprain, resulting in 34 sprains available for further analysis on severe injuries.

Fig. 1
Schematic representation of the Space Dilemma.

a Participants first positioned themselves in the space, hidden from the other player. They were then presented with a bar moving across the space (representing their location) and were required to commit to a certain location by pressing a button while the bar was moving through it. The bar would take 4 s to reach the end of the space. Once they responded, the bar stopped at the chosen location and was shown for the remainder of the 4 s. After both counterparts positioned themselves, their respective positions were shown to each other for 1–1.5 s before the target appeared (left panel). The player closer to the target won the trial (three examples in right panel) as identified by the colour of the target. The reward obtained is inversely proportional to the distance to the target, and reflected by the size of the target square. b The average reward for each player depends on the position in the territory. In each panel, the colour intensity represent the average reward obtained playing that position over many trials. In individual settings (top panel), the best strategy — to minimize distance to the target and maximize rewards - is to target the middle of the space. However, in the two-player space dilemma, as deployed here, multiple configurations exist. Fully cooperative behaviour involves both players positioning themselves in the midpoint of each hemifield, which minimizes the average proximity to any possible location of the target, thus maximising gains (second panel from the top). As this strategy is not a Nash equilibrium, players may have the incentive to deviate from their half side and thus cover more territory (third panel from the top). As such, any positioning closer to the midpoint can be defined as more competitive behaviour. When both players are highly competitive they both target the midpoint, winning less on average (bottom panel).

Game structure and behavioural results.

a An α parameter determines the social context and thus the amount that each player receives on each trial. The experimental design contained three social contexts that were hypothesised to shift people's competitiveness. In all contexts, the position of the closest participant to the target determined the total reward won. In the first context (cooperation), this reward would be equally shared among both players. In the second - intermediate - context, in every trial the winner takes all the reward available. In the third context, the closest player to the target wins twice the reward while the loser loses the reward from its endowment. b, c The strategy adopted by most participants in the cooperative context was to cooperate, and in the competitive context, to compete. In the intermediate context, participants exhibited variable responses. Responses are presented as their joint position on the x -axis (b) or over time (c). Kernel densities are presented on the right of each plot. Mean (bold line) and standard error (shaded area) are displayed across participants. d Average deviation Δ P (change from previous position) in a trial as a function of the co-player deviation in the previous trial. Each dot represents a participant. The co-player deviations are binned into large and small increases in cooperation/competition. In all contexts there is a tendency to reciprocate the co-player changes of behaviour in the next trial (tit-for-tat). This is particularly evident in the intermediate context, where participants were sensitive also to small increases in competition.

### Continuous dynamics of cooperation and competition in social decision-making [^0ad4fe6e]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Trajectory classification

To characterize the ongoing decision processes during the acquisition period, we classified spatiotemporal movement trajectories based on their shape relative to the targets, into six categories — "invitation", "failed invitation", "strongly curved", "different targets", "one ahead" and "concurrent" — using a set of heuristic rules for each category applied in that specific order. If the trajectory followed the rule, the trajectory was classified as such, if not, the next rule was tried. For precise definitions, see Supplementary Methods 1.3.

Disentangling spatiotemporal factors shaping the payoff

To understand how trajectory efficiency, speed, and positioning influence agents' payoffs, we disentangled these different factors. We expressed the payoff as an addition/subtraction of the different factors that determine the trajectory length, divided by the mean speed, to obtain the contribution of each factor to the total joint payoff for each dyad. This decomposition is not exact: estimating the average payoff per cycle using the average trajectory length and mean speed introduces a small error, since the average of a ratio is not strictly equal to the ratio of averages. However, in this case, the correlation is nearly perfect (r = 0.99, see also Supplementary Methods 1.4).

Competitive skill difference estimation

The skill difference between participants influences how successfully an agent competes for single targets. To estimate this competitive skill difference, we measured the proportion of contested single targets each agent managed to collect, focusing specifically on cycles where both agents attempted to reach the single target ("one ahead to the same target" and "concurrent to the same target" classes; see Supplementary Methods 1.5 and 1.6). Thus, we could not estimate the skill difference if the agents always played cooperatively using only the joint targets.

### Injuries and illnesses of football players during the 2010 FIFA world cup [^968cdb55]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The 64 matches of the 2010 FIFA World Cup were played from 11 June to 11 July in 10 different venues in South Africa. The 32 participating finalist teams with 23 players each comprised a total of 736 players. The number of matches per team varied between three and seven, and thus the duration of the competition for teams varied between 12 and 31 days. In total, the study period included 13 179 player days.

Response rate, exposure time and incidences were calculated in accordance with the consensus statement and previous studies. Match exposure was calculated by multiplying 1.5 h by 11 players by the number of returned forms. Training exposure was calculated by multiplying the sum of the daily training times of all teams by 23 players. The number of player days was calculated by adding the number of days each team participated (starting on 11 June to the last match of the team) multiplying by 23 players. For incidence rates, 95% CI were calculated as the incidence ± 1.96 times the incidence divided by the square root of the number of injuries. Data were processed using Excel and SPSS. The statistical methods applied were frequencies, cross-tabulations and χ 2 test. Significance was accepted at the 5% level.

### Label: METRONIDAZOLE solution… [^1a716faf]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

MICROBIOLOGY: Mechanism of Action Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole, exerts antibacterial effects in an anaerobic environment against most obligate anaerobes. Once metronidazole enters the organism by passive diffusion and activated in the cytoplasm of susceptible anaerobic bacteria, it is reduced; this process includes intra-cellular electron transport donors such as ferredoxin and transfer of an electron to the nitro group of the metronidazole leading to formation of a short-lived nitroso free radical. Because of this alteration of the metronidazole molecule, a concentration gradient is created and maintained which promotes the drug's intracellular transport. The reduced form of metronidazole and free radicals may interact with DNA leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis, DNA degradation, and death of bacteria. The precise mechanism of action of metronidazole is unclear.

### Is injury associated with team performance in elite Australian football? 20 years of player injury and team performance data that include measures of individual player value [^331b53b6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether specific injury measures were associated with team performance in the Australian Football League (AFL).

Methods

15289 injuries caused players from 18 teams to miss 51331 matches between 1997 and 2016. Data were aggregated to the team level. We analysed the associations among injury measures and team performance (reaching finals/playoffs and specific ladder/table position). Injury measures per team included: injury incidence, injury severity, injury burden, player match availability and percentage of the full player roster injured. We also weighted injury measures by five measures of player value.

Results

AFL teams' injury burden and player match availability were associated with final table position (r 2 = 0.03, p < 0.05). Player value weighted injury burden was different between finalists and non-finalists (mean difference = -8, p < 0.001) and explained 12% of the variation in the table position of teams (p < 0.001). For a team, nine missed matches due to injury (burden weighted by a best and fairest player rating system) was associated with one lower table position. Player match availability weighted by player value was higher for finalists than non-finalists (mean difference = 1.7, p < 0.01) and explained 7% of the variation in the table position of teams (p < 0.001).

Discussion and Potential Implications

The impact of injury (burden weighted by best and fairest) explained up to 12% of the variation in final table position-this is particularly relevant to making/not making playoffs as well as home ground/travel advantages for those teams that make the one-game format of AFL playoffs (not home-away or best of seven format).

### The relationships between rugby players' tackle training attitudes and behaviour and their match tackle attitudes and behaviour [^e7bba22f]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Methods

The data collection of the broader study, of which this study forms a part, is described in more detail elsewhere.

Participants

The questionnaire was administered at the Cape School's Week Rugby Festival. The Cape School's Week Rugby Festival comprises of 10 traditionally rugby playing schools from the Western, Northern and Eastern Cape regions in South Africa. Only the under 19 A (1st team) sides of each school participated in the rugby festival. Twenty-two questionnaires were administered to 10 schools, and 164 questionnaires (9 out of the 10 schools participated) were returned, representing a 75% response rate. Three teams completed the questionnaire in examination-like conditions with the principle investigator present, two teams completed the questionnaire after a team meeting in a room with the principle investigator present and the remaining four teams' coaches or managers were handed the questionnaires, which they completed on their own and returned at a later stage. Where the researchers were not present, coaches and managers were asked to monitor the players filling out the questionnaire. In the cases where the researchers were present, players completed the questionnaire in approximately 10–15 min. Informed consent was obtained from the coaches or managers of each team, and informed assent was obtained from each player. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee.

Questionnaire developmental process

The developmental process of the questionnaire began with a list of possible general and specific tackle training open-ended questions. Some questions were guided by previous research on the tackle. The list of questions was then presented to a panel of coaches, sport scientists and rugby administrators to further discuss the efficacy, reasoning and validity of the questions. This process of refinement was conducted 2–3 times before a list of questions was finalised. The next step in the developmental process was to design the questionnaire itself with regard to structure, order, flow and answerability. To effectively achieve the best design for the questionnaire, guidelines for designing surveys and social science research methods were used.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^a675584a]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Consensus recommendations for testing in intermittent sports state the following directives: Prioritize test specificity and compose a test battery with tests of a high ecological validity to maximize the transfer/reflection of actual match demands including repeated and appropriate work–rest transitions, inclusion of specialized movement patterns, and an individual emphasis (positional/tactical role). Supply with more targeted energy system tests when needed for further strength/weakness profiling. Ensure test feasibility by choosing only a limited number of tests reflecting the most important match performance indicators representing different aspects of the intermittent performance continuum (from peak power to intermittent endurance) of relevance for the given sporting code and use an integrated approach to incorporate testing procedures as a part of the training process. Integrate test and match analyses and adopt a holistic approach to obtain the most complete overview of the athlete' exercise capacity/performance and the need for training alterations, while being aware of the variability in match performance due to contextual factors and the ability of formal testing to provide a true estimate of maximal exercise capacity. Standardize test conditions to obtain valid and reliable test results, including appropriate prior diet, rest, sleep, and standardized timing, and adopt a "test as you compete" approach using similar ergonomic aids and standardized warm-up procedures. Utilize the above points to optimize the training process, and set/evaluate training intensity targets/relative load using benchmarking of true maximal capacity during formal testing while increasing athlete awareness and "buy-in" through individual feedback and athlete inclusion in the training process.

### Basis functions for complex social decisions in dorsomedial frontal cortex [^90dbc480]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

The four experimental schedules were organized in a 2 (training) × 2 (test) design. All schedules comprised 64 initial training trials and 32 subsequent test trials. The difference between the training and test trials was exclusively related to the sequential order of the players in the observation phase in each trial. All decisions and performance scores were identical across schedules for each trial. However, there were two different training schedules: pre3 and pre4. For pre3, in all training trials, when a dyadic decision was cued, the dyadic decision took place between the second and the third player of the sequence. For pre4, all dyadic decisions took place between the second and the fourth player. As a result, for all four schedules, during the training phase, a dyadic decision would always concern the second player of the four-player sequence. However, in pre3, the second player would always be compared with the third player, and in pre4, the second player would always be compared with the fourth player of the sequence. In other words, we changed the order in which players were presented in a systematic way between schedules, but we kept the assignment of performance scores to players constant. This also meant that, for a given schedule, the dyadic decision that would follow was entirely determined by the sequence in which the players were shown in the observation phase. After the 64 trials of the training phase, the test phase followed, comprising 32 trials. There were also two schedules for the test phase: post3 and post4, and they followed the same logic as before. In all test schedules, the first element of the sequence became relevant for dyadic decisions. Critically, the second relevant player was either the player in the third position (post3) or the player in the fourth position (post4). These schedule designs meant that the same player positions always remained relevant for dyadic decisions for long phases of the experiment. However, this was not easy for participants to notice because it was obscured by the fact that only half of the decisions were dyadic decisions, and the other half were group decisions. In group decisions, all four players were always relevant. As noted above, participants reported no awareness of this manipulation. We collected a similar number of participants for each of the four conditions: pre3/post3 had 270 participants; pre3/post4 had 252 participants; pre4/post3 had 250 participants; and pre4/post4 had 250 participants.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^0bfb237a]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Testing and training in intermittent sports — testing should account for sport-specific exercise patterns and physiological demands; appropriate work-to-rest periods and exercise intensity should be considered, and training and testing should include movement patterns specific for the competitive settings. The expert consensus statement provides an overview of test categories for short strength/speed/power and sport-specific intermittent endurance, ranging from repeated sprint tests to intermittent exercise capacity tests that mimic the nature of the sport, positioned relative to generic performance tests and factors important for athlete durability in intermittent sports. Examples from Olympic and major intermittent team and individual disciplines will be used to combine sport-specific tests with match tracking analysis to explore physiological demands and benchmark performance for a given sport. The scope focuses on adult elite athletes across both sexes, notes that a vast majority of studies have been performed in male subgroups in certain cultural settings, and includes considerations on the applicability of specific test procedures for various target populations whenever appropriate.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^c595fca3]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Formal fitness testing in intermittent sports — role in training and competition evaluation is positioned as complementary to athlete tracking, with the necessity of formal testing questioned when competition/training monitoring is robust, yet variability and complexity in match/training performance limit detection of small but meaningful changes; integrating formal testing with player tracking is proposed to deepen understanding, while testing remains a supportive element, not the center of optimization, and a comprehensive but not excessive panel with recurrent evaluation is advocated, selecting an appropriate test battery that is not too overwhelming and applicable both in-season and off-season.

### Leadership in conflict: part 2 [^2c429842]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Don't start stupid fights, and don't make enemies (except on purpose!). Fight for a reason or a goal. Have a plan for ending the conflict that includes the details when, where, why, how, and who. Within the fight, see it as a complex negotiation. Although you may get emotional, try to stay cerebral and understand what you and your opponent are doing and when it is time to stop. When the fighting stops, repair the damage and start preparing for the next conflict.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^ae40b855]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Intermittent sport testing — assessing durability is more complex than applying a single specific test, and an evaluation of durability may start with evaluation of pre- to postmatch loss of power or fatigue resistance in combination with match analyses; a workflow progresses from match observations to sport-specific tests and can be followed by targeted energy-system isolation tests. Intermittent exercise capacity (e.g. Yo-Yo IR1 performance) has been associated with the ability to sustain performance during the final 15 min of soccer games and with a high capacity limiting reductions in neuromuscular function and increases in markers of muscle damage following rugby match play, pointing to the importance of intermittent endurance for durability in some intermittent team sports. Also, lower body strength seems important for protection against postgame markers of muscle damage, and adequate prior exposure to high-intensity actions has been highlighted as a potentially important factor, suggesting that durability in intermittent sports includes a broad range of physiological factors and capacity requirements. Accordingly, the authors propose a holistic approach to determine durability in intermittent sport athletes through a combination of match analyses and potential postgame assessments, while in some sports or positions the loss of peak power/speed from pre- to postmatch may be negligible and a focus on peak capacity should be prioritized above "durability".

### Crosstalk in concurrent repeated games impedes direct reciprocity and requires stronger levels of forgiveness [^a4ffc000]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Crosstalk impedes the evolution of cooperation

These results raise the question to which extent subjects themselves would learn to apply cooperative strategies with a sustainable degree of generosity. To explore that question, we implemented a simple model of cultural evolution where players are allowed to adopt new strategies over time, based on their current strategy's success ("Methods" section). According to this process, strategies that yield a comparably high payoff are more likely to be imitated by other players. In addition, players may occasionally also experiment with new stochastic strategies, which introduces novel behaviors into the population. These two events, imitation and exploration, take the role of selection and mutation in models of biological evolution. We show that a birth-death process as used in many biological applications yields the same results (Supplementary Note 1). We simulated the evolutionary dynamics for various population structures and crosstalk rates, assuming that experimentation events are relatively rare. In the plane of reactive strategies, we observe that for most of the time, players either apply defective strategies with p ≈ q ≈ 0, or cooperative strategies with p ≈ 1 and 0 < q < q M (Fig. 4a–c). None of these strategies are evolutionarily stable. Instead, when residents apply one of these strategies, neutral or nearly neutral mutants can often invade and pave the way for mutants of another strategy class. The relative weight of these two strategy classes depends on the crosstalk rate and on the population structure (Fig. 4d). While cooperative strategies readily evolve on the cycle even for substantial crosstalk rates, they become less abundant as the population structure changes to a square lattice, or to a complete graph.

### Football injuries during the 2014 FIFA world cup [^6277a001]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

The injury definition and data collection procedure were in accordance with the respective consensus statement for football injuries, and have been described before in detail. An injury was defined as "any musculoskeletal complaint (including concussion) incurred during a match that received medical attention from the team physician regardless of the consequences with respect to absence from the match or training". As in previous FIFA World Cups, chief physicians of the 32 finalist teams were asked to report all injuries after each match on a specially designed injury report form. The injury report form was identical to the form used in 2002and 2006but slightly different to the one used in 2010(which in addition included training injuries and illnesses) and in 1998(which did not include information on time loss). Results of the FIFA World Cup 1998,2002,2006and 2010have been published previously.

The 64 matches of the 2014 FIFA World Cup were played from 12 June to 13 July 2014 at 12 different venues of Brazil. At each of the five FIFA World Cups, the participating 32 finalist teams (each with 23 players) comprised a total of 736 players. The number of matches per team varied between 3 and 7.

Response rate, exposure time and incidences were calculated in accordance with the consensus statement and previous studies. Match exposure was calculated by multiplying 1.5 h by 11 players and by the number of returned forms. For incidence rates, 95% CIs were calculated as the incidence ± 1.96 times the incidence divided by the square root of the number of injuries. Data were processed using Excel (Microsoft 2008, V.12.3.6) and SPSS (PASW Statistics, V.18.0.3). Statistical methods applied were frequencies, cross-tabulations and χ 2 test. Significance was accepted at the 5% level.

### Return to match running performance after a hamstring injury in elite football: a single-centre retrospective cohort study [^c83909c1]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Methodological limitations

The use of the lower bound of the 95% CI as a cut-off value for reaching pre-injury performance may not be sensitive enough to detect smaller running performance deficits after a hamstring injury. However, we decided to use this CI to compensate for the considerable variance in running performance between the five matches before the injury due to differences in opponents, playing positions and playing duration. In general, more research on finding robust measures of defining performance in soccer is necessary. Possibly relating an individual's performance to the team average would reduce the match-to-match variability in performance measures, and performance deficits can be detected more accurately. The validity of the GPS and LPS systems has mostly been studied during small-sided games instead of actual gameplay. Therefore, the measurement error of these systems during an actual football match remains unclear. Additionally, the two tracking systems are used interchangeably in this study. At the same time, research shows that a correction factor of the specific setting is necessary to directly compare measurements of the different systems for accurate use of the two systems. Still, the individual 95% CI used in our study has a broader range than the measurement error reported in validity studies.

We have included match play longer than 45 min. This is a potential confounder because a return to performance may occur in earlier matches in which less than 45 min is played. However, our results report that most of our cohort did not participate in any matches for less than 45 min before the first analysed match. Another potential confounding factor is that a coach may decide not to line up a player after medical clearance (return to play). This would increase the length of the return to play–return to performance interval in days but does not imply that a performance deficit is present. That data was collected at a single football club limits the generalisability to other clubs or sports settings. Because this was a retrospective study, the rehabilitation protocol and progression criteria were not standardised. Bias may occur due to the inclusion of multiple injuries of similar players, and our sample was not completely independent.

Clinical application and future research

Our study implies that elite football players can return to match play from a hamstring injury at their pre-injury running performance level within their first or second match after injury. Future studies might evaluate these performance parameters during the final stages of rehabilitation and the team training sessions before first match participation. This could detect potential factors associated with return running performance after injury to guide the return to performance process.

### Neural implementation of computational mechanisms underlying the continuous trade-off between cooperation and competition [^59ad7f0a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

For all contexts, we saw that players on average reciprocated the changes of the co-player in the previous trial: if the co-player became more cooperative by moving away from the midpoint, so did the players in the next trial, whereas if the co-player became more competitive, players converged to the midpoint in the next trial (Fig. 2d). This effect was further modulated by the size of the co-player change in position: on average, larger changes of position of one player resulted in larger reciprocal changes from the co-player in the next trial (β = 0.03, P < 0.001, fixed effect of bin number in a linear mixed model predicting the change of position of player 2 based on bin number, condition and pairs identity, see methods and Fig. 2d). Furthermore, it was modulated by the context, being less pronounced in the competitive context (β = −0.015, P < 0.001, fixed effect of the interaction between bin number and condition in a linear mixed model predicting the change of position of player 2 based on bin number, condition and pairs identity, see methods and Fig. 2d). This finding suggests that players' behaviour followed a tit-for-tat strategy: they were inferring the intention of the other player, and predicting where the other player would position themselves, retaliating against co-players' increases in competition, and reciprocating co-players increases in cooperation. These effects were further modulated by the social context.

### Physical preparation and return to sport of the football player with a tibia-fibula fracture: applying the 'control-chaos continuum' [^ed94a490]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Contact in elite football can result in severe injury such as traumatic fracture. Limited information exists regarding the rehabilitation and return to sport (RTS) of these injuries especially in elite football. We outline the RTS of an elite English Premier League footballer following a tibia-fibula fracture including gym-based physical preparation and the use of 'control-chaos continuum' as a framework for on-pitch sport-specific conditioning, development of technical skills while returning the player to pre-injury chronic running loads considering the qualitative nature of movement in competition. Strength and power diagnostics were used to back up clinical reasoning and decision-making throughout rehabilitation and the RTS process. The player returned to full team training after 7.5 months, completed 90min match-play after 9 months and remains injury-free 11 months post-RTS.

### Update in the understanding of altitude-induced limitations to performance in team-sport athletes [^77b74d0d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

It is also worth considering that findings from controlled lab studies do not translate directly to match performance of players at altitude. TS are complex and chaotic, whereas laboratory studies are well controlled, with known work and rest durations. Participants in those studies can plan their physical output with some certainty. TS athletes, however, may preserve their capacity to perform the hardest actions, such as CAC, in matches by modulating the amount of low-intensity activity undertaken, especially in the face of environmental challenges like altitude. Therefore, laboratory studies cannot accurately predict the changes in match activity that actually occur in TS situations. Keeping this in mind, it is therefore critical when considering the effects of, for example, altitude on match running that the running profile of players is measured during competition. Sporting regulatory bodies should allow these data to be collected in all matches to assist in our understanding.

Collectively, these first data collected on TS athletes competing at altitude are in good agreement with the scarce evidence available on simulated TS athlete performances at natural altitude. For example, compared with sea-level activity, the performance of rugby athletes during a 20 m shuttle run (−4%) and a rugby-specific repetitive power test (−16%) is decreased at 1550and 1700 m, respectively.

### Neural implementation of computational mechanisms underlying the continuous trade-off between cooperation and competition [^67368c42]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

As the target location is uniformly distributed across the space, if only one player would play the game, the optimal location to minimise the distance from the target and therefore maximise the average reward is the midpoint (Fig. 1b top panel, supplementary Fig. 1). With two players, the average total reward is maximised when the players cooperate, by occupying the mid points of the two hemifields (Fig. 1b second panel, supplementary Fig. 1). However, one player might be tempted to occupy the midpoint, as this would maximise their own personal expected reward, at the expense of the other. As such, the closer a player gets to the midpoint, the more competitive his or her behaviour (i.e. less reciprocity towards the co-player's cooperation, Fig. 1b third panel). Crucially, this competitive behaviour would lower the total reward over all trials because when the target falls within that player's hemifield he/she has a higher probability of being further from it, thereby earning a smaller reward. Similarly, if both players choose to compete by trying to maximise their individual chance of winning going for the midpoint, they would expect to obtain the same reward, albeit reduced compared to the optimal locations when cooperating (Fig. 1b fourth panel).

We manipulated the social context by controlling the reward distributions (as determined by the α parameter, see Methods and Fig. 2a). We defined a cooperative context as one where participants shared the reward irrespective of the winner (α = 0.5, Fig. 2a), and a competitive context in which losing a trial is associated with an economic loss whilst the winner sees its reward boosted by the same amount (α = 2; Fig. 2a). An intermediate context was defined as one where the winner takes all the reward, while the loser in each trial did not receive neither a benefit nor a loss (α = 1; Fig. 2a). To behave adaptively in the task, participants had to change their strategy according to both the co-player response and the social context.

### Recommendations for hamstring injury prevention in elite football: translating research into practice [^a031b71f]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Graphical representation of the progressive increase of a player's chronic high-speed running over the course of an 8-week intervention. The player begins with a chronic load of 2000 m representing a two-match load and is trained with the goal of progressively increasing his chronic training load, adopting a structured periodisation model to fluctuate the weekly training demands to achieve a chronic high-speed running of three matches equivalent per week. The current programme used a 2-week overload and 1-week deload maintaining the acute:chronic workload ratio below 1.4 (peak 1.35) and deload week remaining above 0.8 (lowest 0.82) to prevent acute heightened risk of injury. A, acute; C, chronic; HSR, high-speed running.

Football training typically mimics the physical intensity and movement patterns of match play, but can often result in limited exposure to HSR/vHSR due to the use of smaller areas. Match play represents the largest stimulus in terms of HSR and thus balancing training to reflect match play HSR load is important. Anecdotally, those players often at risk of HSI are regular non-starters or players returning from injury, who are suddenly required for a period of congested match play. In these players, there is a need to individualise their training, closely monitoring their HSR and peak running speeds in training and providing top-ups to maintain sufficient acute and chronic workloads in the absence of first team match play. These top-ups may take the form of additional running during or after training, use of additional training sessions (eg, match day+1, or additional sessions in the afternoon, for example) and/or organised matches (eg, training/development team matches). Additionally, substitutes who play little or no minutes complete HSR or speed exposure sessions (specific to the individual needs) immediately after game, to allow them to maintain the same schedule as the playing squad. Although this is an area which we need to gain a better understanding of, greater knowledge of an individual's typical demands in training/match play may help us keep them appropriately conditioned. Individualised speed zones based off maximum speed can help ensure the player is monitored relative to their own physical capabilities/energy systems, and thus their outputs are not over/underestimated relative to them. During periods of congested match play, it is essential to have optimal strategies in place to accelerate recovery (eg, hydrotherapy, nutrition, rest/sleep, cryotherapy, cold water immersion and soft tissue massage), and limit possible residual strength loss into the next match.

### Algorithmic matching of personal protective equipment donations with healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic [^583c86fd]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Impact of the algorithm on speed of matching

The authors of the manuscript attempted to identify the volunteer hours early in the process to quantify the efficiency of the match, but due to the rapid turnover of the volunteers as well as the heterogeneity in how long each match took, we determined it was not feasible. However, in order to better illustrate the process time and the difficulty, we have created Fig. 2 to better demonstrate how difficult this task was. Prior to the initiation of the algorithm between the dates of April 1, 2020 and April 14, 2020, we initiated 249 emails that were sent to donors in order to inquire about the availability of their stated supply and facilitate a match. Of those 249, only 23 initiated contacts resulted in a confirmed, executed match. The median number of emails exchanged with a single donor in order to facilitate a successful match in this period was 6 — the number of emails in a chain that one volunteer would be managing in order to carry through a match.

Fig. 2
Manual matching process description.

A manual match process was limited by volunteer hours.

After implementation of the algorithm from April 14, 2020 to April 27, 2020, our study period, we sent out 62 emails to donors. The algorithm could match multiple recipients with a single donor, thus one donor email could initiate multiple matches. 14 potential donors stated they had no supply left, resulting in 138 successful matches during the period. The median number of emails exchanged with a single donor to facilitate a successful match was 7. This is slightly higher than the pre-algorithm phase but is a justifiable increase in light of the higher quality of matches. Each donor's supply may be split across multiple recipients to better match supply and demand, a key benefit of the algorithm. Table 3 summarizes these details.

### The dynamics of leadership and success in software development teams [^feaa858e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Matching procedure

To investigate the performance of repositories after the change of their lead developer ("lead-change repositories"), we compared their success trajectory with that of similar ones whose lead developer did not change ("lead-remain repositories"). Specifically, we implemented a matching procedure that, for each lead-change repository, identifies a set of lead-remain repositories that are similar to the lead-change repository in terms of temporal patterns of activity, team composition and success before the change of lead developer happened. Then, we selected the matched repository among those candidates as the one with the most similar success trajectory during the year preceding the change of lead developer.

The details of the matching are as follows. Initially, for each lead-change repository, we identified lead-remain repositories whose first commit date differs by at most six months from that of the lead-change repository. In addition, we required the lead-remain repositories to have lifetime as long as the age at which the lead-change repository changed the lead developer. This ensures that the lead-change repository and its candidates developed within a comparable timeframe. Such a requirement contributes to controlling for the average status of Rust's ecosystem, thus avoiding potential biases due to the rapid growth of the programming language. In this setting, t = 0 designates the time in which the new lead developer takes over. Then, we refined our set of candidates to select repositories that closely matched the lead-change repository in terms of team composition and prior success for t < 0. The selected set of candidates met the following criteria: (1) similar team size at t = − 1 (see Supplementary Fig. S12), (2) absolute difference in relative effective team size, averaged across, smaller than 0.20, and (3) absolute relative difference of (log) number of stars and downloads at t = − 1 smaller than 0.50.

### Neural implementation of computational mechanisms underlying the continuous trade-off between cooperation and competition [^0b7f11c8]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In order to enforce different social contexts we introduced a reward distribution rule whereby each trial reward would be shared between the winner and the loser according to the ruleWhere α is a trade-off factor controlling the redistribution between winners and losers in each trial. By redistributing the reward between winner and loser the latter would also benefit from the co-player minimising their distance to the target. Increasing the amount of redistribution (decreasing α below 1) constitutes an incentive to work out a cooperative strategy to decrease the average distance of the winner from the target (that is, irrespective of who the winner is) and therefore increase the reward available in each trial which would be redistributed. Decreasing the amount of redistribution can instead lead to punishment for the losers (increasing alpha above 1) adding an incentive to compete to win the trial.

All participants first participated in a behavioural session where they were randomly coupled with one another and played three sessions of the game in three different conditions specified by the value of the trade-off factor α. In the first condition (α = 0.5, cooperative condition), the reward was shared equally between the two players, irrespective of the winner. In the second condition, the winner gets twice the amount of the reward (α = 2, competitive condition), while the other player will lose from their initial stock an amount equivalent to the reward. In the third condition, the winner will get the full amount of the reward and the other will get nothing (α = 1, intermediate condition). The participants were instructed about the different reward distribution (through a panel similar to Fig. 2c). In total, participants played 60 trials in each of the three conditions for a total of 180 trials.

### Limitations of athlete-exposures as a construct for comparisons of injury rates by gender / sex: a narrative review [^c9f1a4d5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Ultimately, understanding gender/sex disparities in injury risk requires considering a number of gendered environmental factors that athlete exposures do not and cannot capture. When comparing injury risk across groups sampled from different contexts and from different underlying populations, researchers must consider whether the AEs that comprise the rate denominator for each group are not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively comparable, in terms of type and level of training, facilities and equipment, among other factors. As such, in addition to understanding and quantifying exposure, we urge researchers to layer or triangulate understandings of AEs with a gendered environmental approach using qualitative methods.

Qualitative approaches can help illuminate important gender differences in the quality of training or match exposure. Girls' and women's sport suffers from systematic underinvestment, resulting in the environments in which they participate and compete being sub-par when compared with those of boys and men. Further, the quantity and quality of the training itself — key factors for preventing ACL injury — are known to be lower, too. In this way, historically rooted systemic inequities between women's and men's sports continue to shape sport practices and cultures, including the resources available to teams, compensation structures for athletes, and — consequently — not only the amount of time that athletes can devote to training in preparation for competitions, but the calibre of that training, too. This is further compounded by lower quality facilities (eg, competitions occurring on artificial rather than natural turf; lack of access to high-quality gyms and training equipment) and training load potentially being much higher in a shorter time period (eg, smaller team roster sizes and congested tournament schedules). These considerations are particularly important in the context of researching gender/sex disparities in ACL injury. In addition, male practice players are sometimes used in high-level women's sports, which may further complicate comparisons of injury rates by gender/sex using AEs. While this practice can help reduce fatigue by allowing women athletes greater opportunity to rest, it may also differentially increase training load for starting players by making training more intense.

### On-field rehabilitation part 2: a 5-stage program for the soccer player focused on linear movements, multidirectional movements, soccer-specific skills, soccer-specific movements, and modified practice [^61eb4c32]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Synopsis

This paper is part 2 of a 2-part series aimed at discussing the key elements of on-field rehabilitation training. In part 1, we described 4 pillars underpinning high-quality on-field rehabilitation: (1) restoring movement quality, (2) physical conditioning, (3) restoring sport-specific skills, and (4) progressively developing chronic training load. In part 2, we describe how the pillars contribute to a 5-stage on-field rehabilitation program to help injured players transition to team practice and match play. We use the example of a soccer player with ambitions to return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The program moves through 5 field-based training stages: (1) linear movement, (2) multidirectional movement, (3) soccer-specific technical skills, (4) soccer-specific movement, and (5) practice simulation. The staged program is research based and facilitates communication, planning, control, and safety in return to sport following long-term injury.

### Neural implementation of computational mechanisms underlying the continuous trade-off between cooperation and competition [^18b6fcd0]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Whilst the best long-term strategy to increase the total reward for the dyad in each context, unknown to the participants, was to always cooperate (supplementary material and Supplementary Fig. 1), this was not always the optimal strategy for individual players (which also depends on the co-player choices and is susceptible to end-game effects as the number of trials is finite) and the reward distribution favoured different level of competition in different contexts. This is because while in the cooperative context there is no benefit in competing, as the reward is equally shared between players, in the competitive and intermediate contexts players have a temptation to win the trial, to avoid a loss and to boost their reward. The manipulation of the reward distribution increases the risk associated with losing by increasing the difference in reward by winner and loser (increasing α; Supplementary Fig. 1c). It is worth noticing that in the competitive and intermediate contexts, the space dilemma is a probabilistic form of the Prisoner's Dilemma (see Supplementary Fig. 1 and methods). Each pair of participants played three block of 60 trials for each of the three contexts (cooperative, intermediate and competitive social contexts). Beyond the reward distribution shown at the start of each block of trials and the variability in players' behaviour, the three blocks of trials were visually identical, differing only in the underlying social contexts. This setup therefore allows to compare a range of cooperative and competitive behaviours across different social contexts while controlling for the sensory-motor aspects of the decision.

### Injury rates decreased in men's professional football: an 18-year prospective cohort study of almost 12 000 injuries sustained during 1.8 million hours of play [^77f81fe6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study population

To increase homogeneity in this substudy, we only included teams during seasons that they participated in the UCL group stage in the analyses. This selection was made since the number of teams that failed to qualify for the UCL group stage has increased during the course of the study and since there could be some important differences between teams that qualified for the UCL group stage and teams that did not (eg, match schedules, financial conditions, and so on). During 18 seasons, a total of 49 participating teams from 19 European countries participated in the UCL group stage and were included in the present study.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

All players with a first team contract were invited to participate in the study on a voluntary basis, adding up to a total of 3302 included players. Players who left or joined the team during the season (eg, due to transfer) were included during their time on the team.

Exposure

Individual football exposure was registered on an attendance record. The attendance record included information about the duration in minutes for each exposure (including training and match play), as well as whether players were absent due to injury, illness, national team duty or for other reasons.

Injury

An injury was defined using a time-loss definition (table 1). For each injury that occurred, the contact person was asked to complete an injury card. The injury card included information about the injury diagnosis, injury occasion and the mechanisms causing the injury. Based on the information on the injury card, members of the study group classified the injury using the Orchard Sports Injury Classification System. Injuries that did not occur during a specific identifiable event (eg, overuse injuries) were assigned to the last activity (training or match) that the injured player was able to complete before being removed from full participation in team activities. Reinjury was defined as an 'injury of the same type and at the same site as an index injury' irrespective of injury occasion, injury mechanism and the time between the injury and a potential index injury.

Players were considered injured until the medical team cleared the player for full participation in all team activities, including both training and match play. Lay-off following an injury was defined as the number of days from the date of injury until the date when the medical team declared the player as ready for full participation.

### Does long-distance air travel associated with the sevens world series increase players' risk of injury? [^a7a6f368]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether players who cross ≥ 6 time zones and/or undertake ≥ 10h air travel prior to competition experience a higher risk of injury during the Sevens World Series than players not required to undertake this level of travel.

Design

Five-year, prospective, cohort study.

Participants

All players from nine core teams competing in the Sevens World Series from 2008/2009 to 2013/2014.

Results

A total of 436 match injuries and 3363 player-match-hours of exposure were recorded in the study, which corresponds to an overall incidence of 129.6 injuries/1000 player-match-hours, irrespective of the nature of pretournament travel. The incidence of injury for those players crossing ≥ 6 time zones and undertaking ≥ 10h air travel prior to competition (99.3 injuries/1000 player-match-hours) was significantly lower than that of players undertaking ≥ 10h air travel but crossing ≤ 2 time zones prior to competition (148.8 injuries/1000 player-match-hours; p = 0.003) and of those undertaking ≤ 3h air travel and crossing ≤ 2 time zones prior to competition (146.4 injuries/1000 player-match-hours; p = 0.004). There was no significant difference in the incidence of injury for players crossing ≤ 2 time zones in the week prior to competition, irrespective of whether the length of air travel was ≤ 3h or ≥ 10h (p = 0.904). Precompetition air travel had no significant effect (p = 0.879) on the performance of teams in terms of their final Tournament ranking positions.

Conclusions

There was no evidence to suggest that players were exposed to a greater risk of injury following extensive air travel and crossing multiple time zones prior to Tournaments in the Sevens World Series.

### Match and training injury epidemiology in elite UK netball: a prospective cohort study over one season [^4548fbf7]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Results

Study participants

Ninety players from seven English teams agreed to participate in the study (mean age 24.4 years; 95% CI 23.4 to 25.4, mean height 179.3 cm; 95% CI 177. 6 to 181.1). The participants represented 65.7% of the total English team population (n = 137) and 83.3% of the seven consenting teams (n = 108).

Data quality

Seven of the nine English teams provided study consent (77.8%), with a 100% injury-reporting response rate and 97.8% data completeness. Four teams provided training exposure data (57.1%), with low between-team variability (11.9% CV percentage). However, match (80.8%) and training (93.6%) incidence rates showed high variability, ranging from 8.2 to 106.9 injuries/1000 hours in matches and 0.2 to 3.1 injuries/1000 hours in training.

Epidemiology of injury in the Vitality Netball Superleague (VNSL 2021

Seventy injuries (matches n = 35; training n = 35) occurred in 39 players, representing a period prevalence of 43.3%. Match player hours were 851.18, resulting in an incidence rate of 41.12 injuries/1000 hours (95% CI 29.22 to 57.32), while training hours were 31 888, resulting in an incidence of 1.10 injuries/1000 hours (95% CI 0.76 to 1.54). Consequently, match injuries were 37.4 times more frequent than training injuries (95% CI 23.45 to 59.85).

### A blood biomarker and clinical correlation cohort study protocol to diagnose sports-related concussion and monitor recovery in elite rugby [^fb8658e8]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Time frames

The study has been designed to span a minimum of 3 years to capture three playing seasons (1 playing season per year). Each year, during the preseason period, a baseline blood sample is acquired following exercise and a HIA and neuropsychometric assessment is completed. The exercise routine is part of the pre-season training programme within the first week of training. All participants carry out the same cardio training routine prior to the blood draw. Subsequently, over the course of the season, if any participant is suspected of suffering a SRC during a professional match or training session, that participant enters the HIA process, in line with current regulations. As part of this study, any participant that enters the standard HIA process will undergo a HIA, a neuropsychometric assessment, and blood sampling at the following time points:

Within 72 hours of injury,
6 days post-injury (± 1 day); this aligns with the minimum GRTP protocol for a professional rugby player, no player will return to play before 6 days,
13 days post-injury (± 1 day) to examine if biomarkers are still present despite the results of the HIA and the neuropsychometric assessment. This time point is to capture if the blood biomarkers are still present after a period of recovery of SRC which has been suggested to be approximately 10–13 days.

The final time point for sample collection at 13 days post-injury was chosen as it was most common timepoint for players to have returned to play after the initial 7-day GRTP, based on clinical assessment. This allows for the clinical and biochemical assessment of players who returned prior to 14 days and to compare any alterations in blood biomarkers or if biochemical recovery had occurred in conjunction with clinical recovery. Further, the players that enter HIA process in year 1 are followed up in the baseline blood sample in year 2 (similar in year 3). Furthermore, the majority of players who do not enter the HIA process will have baseline blood samples taken over the course of the 3 pre-season blood draws that can be measured and compared over the three seasons.

Serial head injury assessment

Participants that suffer a suspected SRC will complete the HIA protocol (see online supplemental material) at the time points outlined above. This is a form of the SCAT5 which has been modified for professional rugby and GRTP. This assessment will be carried out by the medical officer of the professional rugby club.

### Evolving cooperation in multichannel games [^ea1cd8a8]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Humans routinely engage in many distinct interactions in parallel. Team members collaborate on several concurrent projects, and even whole nations interact with each other across a variety of issues, including trade, climate change and security. Yet the existing theory of direct reciprocity studies isolated repeated games. Such models cannot account for strategic attempts to use the vested interests in one game as a leverage to enforce cooperation in another. Here we introduce a general framework of multichannel games. Individuals interact with each other over multiple channels; each channel is a repeated game. Strategic choices in one channel can affect decisions in another. With analytical equilibrium calculations for the donation game and evolutionary simulations for several other games we show that such linkage facilitates cooperation. Our results suggest that previous studies tend to underestimate the human potential for reciprocity. When several interactions occur in parallel, people often learn to coordinate their behavior across games to maximize cooperation in each of them.

### Self-other mergence in the frontal cortex during cooperation and competition [^9b682672]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

For all three players, including the subjects themselves, performance feedback on every trial was predefined (Figure S1 A). In other words, the feedback about performance was independent from subjects' actual performance in the minigames (see, however, "false-start trials" for a case of veridical performance feedback in the "Feedback" section of the Experimental Procedures and Figure S2 C). This was necessary to control and match performance feedback between subjects as well as between subjects and the two other players. Subjects were told that the minigames had been tested on a larger sample of subjects and that performance feedback in the minigame reflected individual performance relative to that sample.

In the phases before and after the minigames, three scales ranging from 1 to 15 points were shown with the initials of the three players below. Performance feedback was displayed on these scales in the feedback phase. While the initials of the confederates were the same for all experimental sessions, the subjects' own initials were adjusted to be appropriate for each individual subject. The initials created a social frame for the experiment without using explicitly social cues such as faces.

The experimental schedule contained 136 minigame trials. The design was a 2(social context) × 2(partner) × 2(minigame) fully crossed design (17 trials per cell). This meant that a trial could be either cooperative or competitive (social context: cooperation or competition), the O could be either "player" 1 or 2 (O: Other1 or Other2), and, in each trial, subjects played one of two minigames (minigame: time task or color task). The trial type order was pseudorandom and the same for all subjects. Three subjects performed a marginally shortened version of the schedule. They did the first 116 trials of the schedule; however, the design was still fully crossed (14 trials per cell).

### Injury incidence and injury patterns in professional football: the UEFA injury study [^28c51224]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the injury characteristics in professional football and to follow the variation of injury incidence during a match, during a season and over consecutive seasons.

Design

Prospective cohort study where teams were followed for seven consecutive seasons. Team medical staff recorded individual player exposure and time-loss injuries from 2001 to 2008.

Setting

European professional men's football.

Participants

The first team squads of 23 teams selected by the Union of European Football Associations as belonging to the 50 best European teams.

Main Outcome Measurement

Injury incidence.

Results

4483 injuries occurred during 566 000 h of exposure, giving an injury incidence of 8.0 injuries/1000 h. The injury incidence during matches was higher than in training (27.5 vs 4.1, p < 0.0001). A player sustained on average 2.0 injuries per season, and a team with typically 25 players can thus expect about 50 injuries each season. The single most common injury subtype was thigh strain, representing 17% of all injuries. Re-injuries constituted 12% of all injuries, and they caused longer absences than non re-injuries (24 vs 18 days, p < 0.0001). The incidence of match injuries showed an increasing injury tendency over time in both the first and second halves (p < 0.0001). Traumatic injuries and hamstring strains were more frequent during the competitive season, while overuse injuries were common during the preseason. Training and match injury incidences were stable over the period with no significant differences between seasons.

Conclusions

The training and match injury incidences were stable over seven seasons. The risk of injury increased with time in each half of matches.

### Cooperating with machines [^a7e72d04]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Responding to its partner: In addition to voicing cheap talk, the ability to respond to a partner's signals can substantially enhance one's ability to quickly coordinating on cooperative solutions (see Supplementary Note 4, including Supplementary Table 12). When its partner signals a desire to play a particular solution, S# uses proficiency assessment to determine whether it should consider playing it. If this assessment indicates that the proposed solution could be a desirable outcome to S#, it determines which of its experts play strategies consistent (or congruent) with the proposed solution to further reduce the set of experts that it considers following in that round (step 3 in Fig. 3a). Formally, let E cong (t) denote the set of experts in round t that are congruent with the last joint plan proposed by S#'s partner. Then, S# considers selecting experts from the set defined as:

If this set is empty (i.e. no desirable options are congruent with the partner's proposal), E (t) is calculated as with S++ (Eq. 1).

The congruence of the partner's proposed plan with an expert is determined by comparing the strategy proposed by the partner with the solution espoused by the expert. In the case of trigger strategies and expectant followers, we compare the strategy proposed by the partner with the strategies' offer. This is done rather easily in normal-form games, as the partner can easily and naturally express its strategy as a sequence of joint actions, which is then compared to the sequence of joint actions of the expert's offer. For general RSGs, however, this is more difficult because a joint action is viewed as a sequence of joint strategies over many stages. In this case, S# must rely on high-level descriptions of the solution. For example, solutions described as "fair" and "cooperative" can be assumed to be congruent with solutions that have payoff profiles similar to those of the Nash bargaining solution.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^6a26d3b3]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Durability in intermittent sports — fatigue mechanisms and conceptual framing: Accumulated fatigue over a match or series with inadequate recovery may arise from "mechanical and/or metabolic origin dependent on the specific sport setting", with examples including "exercise-induced muscle damage and impaired neuromuscular function" and "critical reductions in muscle glycogen concentrations". Additional factors such as "hyperthermia and dehydration… have been associated with end-game fatigue development in intermittent sports". The ability to withstand such accumulation, termed athlete "durability", "has been introduced in the context of endurance sports", and is proposed as a framework relevant to intermittent sports.

### Effectiveness of an injury prevention programme for adult male amateur soccer players: a cluster-randomised controlled trial [^88c5f1da]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Results

The initial study population consisted of 24 soccer teams; one team declined to participate. The two clusters with 23 teams were randomised, resulting in 11 teams in the intervention group and 12 teams in the control group. Shortly after randomisation, the coach of one team from the intervention group refused to use The11 during the practice sessions. Data of 456 players were analysed, 223 in the intervention group and 233 in the control group (figure 1). During the intervention season, 29 players (6.4%) were lost to follow-up, mainly because they ended their soccer career or because they changed the team or club. All their available data were included in the analysis of the effects of the intervention programme. No significant difference in dropout rate was found between the intervention group (n = 11, 4.9%) and the control group (n = 18, 7.7%). Baseline characteristics of the players in the two study groups were similar, except for height and weight (table 2). Baseline data from dropouts and players with complete follow-up were not significantly different.

Table 2
Baseline characteristics of the soccer players (n = 456)

Figure 1
Flow diagram of the study population.

Exposure and injury characteristics

During the season, the players were involved in a total of 31 518 h of practice time and 12 734 h of match time, resulting in a total exposure time of 44 252 h. The mean practice and match times per player were 69.1 and 27.9 h, respectively, during the 33 weeks of the competition season.

In all, 427 injuries were recorded, affecting 274 of the 456 players (60.1%). The most commonly injured body parts (n = 408) were ankle (19.1%), posterior upper leg (15.9%), knee (15.7%), anterior upper leg (10.5%) and groin (10.5%). The overall injury incidence for both groups was 9.6 (8.8–10.6) injuries per 1000 player hours; 3.4 (2.8–4.1) in practice sessions and 21.9 (19.5–24.6) in matches.

### Energy expenditure, dietary intake and energy availability in female professional football players [^a862e764]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Material and methods

Participants

Fifty-one players from the Norwegian premier (two teams) and first division (one team) were included (table 1). Eight players were currently representing their national team, while seven players represented their designated youth national team. Using the recently published participant classification framework, players were classified at tier 3 (national) or 4 (international) level. All players agreed to and signed a written consent form before partaking in the study. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) above 16 years of age, (2) no injury or illness affecting normal activity level and (3) being eligible for first-team competition matches. Seven players were excluded due to reported injury or illness during the study period (see online supplemental material for participant information).

Table 1
Participant characteristics

Study design

Using a prospective observational study design, data collection occurred in three phases during the 2021 and 2022 Norwegian season (October–May). During the 14-day study period, players continued their regular living patterns, including training and match obligations.

Body composition

Body composition was measured using whole body fan beam dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurement (Prodigy, Encore, SP 4.1, V.18, GE medical systems, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) by a certified technician, following recommended guidelines. All participants received a personal scale (Logic, London, UK) to which they were able to measure their body mass (BM) at home. BM was measured in the morning after the first voiding on days 1, 7 and 15 to the nearest ± 0.1 Kg. Before the data collection, participants were instructed to complete the measurement and send the results to a research team member following each weigh-in.

Training and match load

Training sessions and match performance were monitored using a GPS placed between the player's scapulae in a custom vest (Statsports, Newry, Ireland). Predetermined variables were recorded to quantify the total distance covered and metres in speed zones to determine the external physiological load. Standardised thresholds to determine workload intensity were used (table 2 specifies the various speed zones ranging from 1 to 5, coinciding with the measurement of EE by DLW). The coaching staff were familiar with the usage of the GPS; however, it was not applied to recovery sessions related to matchdays. Goalkeepers were excluded from the training and match load analysis.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Uptake of core outcome sets in paediatric clinical trials: a protocol [^add57965]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Matching of COS and clinical trials

We will include COS-trial pairs that fulfil all of the following conditions:

The pair is judged as either 'very likely relevant' (white cells) and 'may be relevant' (light grey cells) as shown in table 1;
The number of relevant clinical trials on the topic is at least 40. If the number is too small, the comparison of the COS and the outcomes of the trials is not meaningful. According to the results of a preliminary search on Clinicaltrials.gov, we found that the number of potentially relevant clinical trials for most conditions was small, with only 7 eligible COS having at least 50 corresponding trials. By decreasing the limit to 40, we were able to find 3 additional COS with sufficiently many trials; if we decreased it to 30, there were no more COS compared with 40. Therefore, we selected 40 as the minimum number of trial; and
If two or more COS developed for same condition meet above two criteria, we will selected the COS according to the following criteria applied hierarchically: (1) both Delphi and consensus meeting were used in the consensus process; (2) higher ratio of children/parents to healthcare professionals in the consensus process; (3) children themselves (instead of their parents only) participated in the process, if applicable; and (4) children/parents from multiple regions were involved.

Matching of outcomes between the COS and clinical trials

In the comparison of the COS and the outcomes of the trial, we will include all primary, secondary and exploratory outcomes mentioned in the trial registry. Three situations are possible:

Exact match: the outcomes match exactly including the use of the same or synonymous/equivalent terms (eg, 'overall survival' and 'all-cause mortality');
General match: the outcomes match on a general level, including one outcome being part of another (eg, 'functioning' and 'emotional functioning'; 'disease activity' and 'joint damage') or outcomes being to large extent overlapping (eg, 'drug adherence' and 'intake of any treatment');
Non-matches. For each pair of outcomes that is a general match, we will also assess which of the two outcomes, the core outcome or the trial outcome, is broader. When this cannot be determined, we will not make an assessment about the comparative breadth of the outcomes.

### Extendedprogramme lowers weekly hamstring, knee and ankle injury prevalence compared with an adductor strength programme or self-selected injury prevention exercises in adolescent and adult amateur football players: a two-armed cluster-randomised trial with an additional comparison arm [^50c3a745]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Nineteen clusters with 29 teams were allocated to the randomised groups and received their intervention, 13 clusters with 17 teams were included in the comparison group. In total, 780 players in these 46 teams were eligible, and 502 players (14–46 years) completed the study (table 2). Another 30 teams first accepted participation but withdrew before study commencement without contributing any data. In total, participation rate was 18% of potentially eligible teams.

Table 2
Baseline characteristics for included players (n = 502)

In total, 6601 weekly player reports were collected. The average weekly response rate was 64.8% (men 55.7%, women 68.1%), 68.0% in extended Knee Control (men: 56.1%, women 73.8%), 60.4% in the adductor (men 53.8%, women 61.5%) and 64.4% in the comparison group (men 55.9%, women 67.8%).

Exposure and injury characteristics

Exposure to training and matches is presented in online supplemental table 1. In total, 458 unique injury events were reported (514 injury locations) in 279 players (online supplemental tables 1,2). Of these 458 injury events, 412 (90%) affected one body location, 39 (8.5%) two and 7 (1.5%) ≥ three locations. Of all injuries, 261 (57%) resulted in time loss.

Compliance

Team compliance during pre-season was 2.3, 1.7 and 1.9 sessions per week for the extended Knee Control, adductor and comparison groups (online supplemental table 1). Corresponding figures for the competitive season (summer break excluded) were 2.1, 0.7 and 2.1 sessions per week. Players in extended Knee Control used the IPEP 1.6 times/week on average, the adductor group 1.0 and the comparison group 1.4.

### The effects of contemporaneous peer punishment on cooperation with the future [^c0626dd4]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Design

Figure 1 illustrates the game structure and procedures. Exactly 12 participants take part in each session and they are randomly divided into four groups consisting of three participants each. In the baseline condition, participants are informed that they will make (at most) one decision and that there are a total of four sequential groups. Moreover, they are informed about the position of their group in the succession of groups and learn that the allocation of participants to the groups is random. After reading a printout of the instructions (reproduced in Supplementary Note 3) and being given an opportunity to ask clarifying questions, the experiment starts. In the baseline condition, each member of Group 1 is endowed with €10. The three members of this group simultaneously face the same decision: they are required to divide their endowment between a private account and a group account. More precisely, they are required to decide how much money to allocate to the group account while the rest of the endowment automatically remains in their private account. If individual contributions to the group account sum to less than €15, the experiment ends instantly and all participants of later groups are informed that the experiment has ended and that their earning from the experimental task are zero. However, if the sum of contributions to the group account amounts to €15 or more (i.e. at least 50% of the total group endowment), the game continues and moves to the next group (Group 2). Independent from the sum of total contributions in the group account, members of Group 1 earn the respective amounts in their private accounts (i.e. the initial endowment of €10 minus their individual contribution to the group account). If the game is sustained, the same procedure applies for members of Groups 2 and 3. The experiment ends with the decision of the members of Group 3. If the contributions of Group 3's members to the group account sum to €15 or more, then the members of Group 4 each earn €5. Otherwise, members of Group 4 earn nothing. Reaching the threshold exactly costs €15 to the current generation but provides an endowment of €30 to the subsequent generation(s). There is hence a gain in total earnings (across multiple generations) from reaching the threshold. These potential gains from contributing are largest for members of the first generation, but smaller for participants in subsequent generations (with no such gains from Group 3). Choosing €15 as a threshold value has the advantage of facilitating coordination between group members by allowing for individual contributions of €5 (i.e. 50% of the endowment) to be sufficient for reaching the threshold. Hence, it is a symmetric focal point for coordination. At the same time, individual endowments are smaller than the threshold. Hence, no single group member can unilaterally provide the public good and successful provision requires the cooperation of at least two group members.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: concussion in sport [^1c473b28]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

PURPOSE OF THE STATEMENT: ▸ To provide an evidence-based, best practises summary to assist physicians with the evaluation and management of sports concussion. ▸ To establish the level of evidence, knowledge gaps and areas requiring additional research.

Importance Of An Amssm Statement

▸ Sports medicine physicians are frequently involved in the care of patients with sports concussion. ▸ Sports medicine physicians are specifically trained to provide care along the continuum of sports concussion from the acute injury to return-to-play (RTP) decisions. ▸ The care of athletes with sports concussion is ideally performed by healthcare professionals with specific training and experience in the assessment and management of concussion. Competence should be determined by training and experience, not dictated by specialty. ▸ While this statement is directed towards sports medicine physicians, it may also assist other physicians and healthcare professionals in the care of patients with sports concussion.

Definition

▸ Concussion is defined as a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function and involves a complex pathophysiological process. Concussion is a subset of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) which is generally self-limited and at the less-severe end of the brain injury spectrum.

Pathophysiology

▸ Animal and human studies support the concept of postconcussive vulnerability, showing that a second blow before the brain has recovered results in worsening metabolic changes within the cell. ▸ Experimental evidence suggests the concussed brain is less responsive to usual neural activation and when premature cognitive or physical activity occurs before complete recovery the brain may be vulnerable to prolonged dysfunction.

Incidence

▸ It is estimated that as many as 3.8 million concussions occur in the USA per year during competitive sports and recreational activities; however, as many as 50% of the concussions may go unreported. ▸ Concussions occur in all sports with the highest incidence in football, hockey, rugby, soccer and basketball. RISK FACTORS FOR SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION: ▸ A history of concussion is associated with a higher risk of sustaining another concussion. ▸ A greater number, severity and duration of symptoms after a concussion are predictors of a prolonged recovery. ▸ In sports with similar playing rules, the reported incidence of concussion is higher in female athletes than in male athletes. ▸ Certain sports, positions and individual playing styles have a greater risk of concussion. ▸ Youth athletes may have a more prolonged recovery and are more susceptible to a concussion accompanied by a catastrophic injury. ▸ Preinjury mood disorders, learning disorders, attention-deficit disorders (ADD/ADHD) and migraine headaches complicate diagnosis and management of a concussion.

Diagnosis Of Concussion

▸ Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis ideally made by a healthcare provider familiar with the athlete and knowledgeable in the recognition and evaluation of concussion. ▸ Graded symptom checklists provide an objective tool for assessing a variety of symptoms related to concussions, while also tracking the severity of those symptoms over serial evaluations. ▸ Standardised assessment tools provide a helpful structure for the evaluation of concussion, although limited validation of these assessment tools is available.

Sideline Evaluation and Management

▸ Any athlete suspected of having a concussion should be stopped from playing and assessed by a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. ▸ Recognition and initial assessment of a concussion should be guided by a symptoms checklist, cognitive evaluation (including orientation, past and immediate memory, new learning and concentration), balance tests and further neurological physical examination. ▸ While standardised sideline tests are a useful framework for examination, the sensitivity, specificity, validity and reliability of these tests among different age groups, cultural groups and settings is largely undefined. Their practical usefulness with or without an individual baseline test is also largely unknown. ▸ Balance disturbance is a specific indicator of a concussion, but not very sensitive. Balance testing on the sideline may be substantially different than baseline tests because of differences in shoe/cleat-type or surface, use of ankle tape or braces, or the presence of other lower extremity injury. ▸ Imaging is reserved for athletes where intracerebral bleeding is suspected. ▸ There is no same day RTP for an athlete diagnosed with a concussion. ▸ Athletes suspected or diagnosed with a concussion should be monitored for deteriorating physical or mental status.

Neuropsychological Testing

▸ Neuropsychological (NP) tests are an objective measure of brain-behaviour relationships and are more sensitive for subtle cognitive impairment than clinical exam. ▸ Most concussions can be managed appropriately without the use of NP testing. ▸ Computerised neuropsychological (CNP) testing should be interpreted by healthcare professionals trained and familiar with the type of test and the individual test limitations, including a knowledgeable assessment of the reliable change index, baseline variability and false-positive and false-negative rates. ▸ Paper and pencil NP tests can be more comprehensive, test different domains and assess for other conditions which may masquerade as or complicate assessment of concussion. ▸ NP testing should be used only as part of a comprehensive concussion management strategy and should not be used in isolation. ▸ The ideal timing, frequency and type of NP testing have not been determined. ▸ In some cases, properly administered and interpreted NP testing provides an added value to assess cognitive function and recovery in the management of sports concussions. ▸ It is unknown if use of NP testing in the management of sports concussion helps prevent recurrent concussion, catastrophic injury or long-term complications. ▸ Comprehensive NP evaluation is helpful in the post-concussion management of athletes with persistent symptoms or complicated courses.

Return To Class

▸ Students will require cognitive rest and may require academic accommodations such as reduced workload and extended time for tests while recovering from a concussion.

Return To Play

▸ Concussion symptoms should be resolved before returning to exercise. ▸ A RTP progression involves a gradual, step-wise increase in physical demands, sports-specific activities and the risk for contact. ▸ If symptoms occur with activity, the progression should be halted and restarted at the preceding symptom-free step. ▸ RTP after concussion should occur only with medical clearance from a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. SHORT-TERM RISKS OF PREMATURE RTP: ▸ The primary concern with early RTP is decreased reaction time leading to an increased risk of a repeat concussion or other injury and prolongation of symptoms. LONG-TERM EFFECTS: ▸ There is an increasing concern that head impact exposure and recurrent concussions contribute to long-term neurological sequelae. ▸ Some studies have suggested an association between prior concussions and chronic cognitive dysfunction. Large-scale epidemiological studies are needed to more clearly define risk factors and causation of any long-term neurological impairment.

Disqualification From Sport

▸ There are no evidence-based guidelines for disqualifying/retiring an athlete from a sport after a concussion. Each case should be carefully deliberated and an individualised approach to determining disqualification taken.

Education

▸ Greater efforts are needed to educate involved parties, including athletes, parents, coaches, officials, school administrators and healthcare providers to improve concussion recognition, management and prevention. ▸ Physicians should be prepared to provide counselling regarding potential long-term consequences of a concussion and recurrent concussions.

Prevention

▸ Primary prevention of some injuries may be possible with modification and enforcement of the rules and fair play. ▸ Helmets, both hard (football, lacrosse and hockey) and soft (soccer, rugby) are best suited to prevent impact injuries (fracture, bleeding, laceration, etc.) but have not been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of concussions. ▸ There is no current evidence that mouth guards can reduce the severity of or prevent concussions. ▸ Secondary prevention may be possible by appropriate RTP management.

Legislation

▸ Legislative efforts provide a uniform standard for scholastic and non-scholastic sports organisations regarding concussion safety and management.

Future Directions

▸ Additional research is needed to validate current assessment tools, delineate the role of NP testing and improve identification of those at risk of prolonged post-concussive symptoms or other long-term complications. ▸ Evolving technologies for the diagnosis of concussion, such as newer neuroimaging techniques or biological markers, may provide new insights into the evaluation and management of sports concussion.

### Spontaneous emergence of leaders and followers in foraging pairs [^bde47b71]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

Animals that forage socially often stand to gain from coordination of their behaviour. Yet it is not known how group members reach a consensus on the timing of foraging bouts. Here we demonstrate a simple process by which this may occur. We develop a state-dependent, dynamic game model of foraging by a pair of animals, in which each individual chooses between resting or foraging during a series of consecutive periods, so as to maximize its own individual chances of survival. We find that, if there is an advantage to foraging together, the equilibrium behaviour of both individuals becomes highly synchronized. As a result of this synchronization, differences in the energetic reserves of the two players spontaneously develop, leading them to adopt different behavioural roles. The individual with lower reserves emerges as the 'pace-maker' who determines when the pair should forage, providing a straightforward resolution to the problem of group coordination. Moreover, the strategy that gives rise to this behaviour can be implemented by a simple 'rule of thumb' that requires no detailed knowledge of the state of other individuals.

### Process mining to investigate the relationship between clinical antecedents and injury risk, severity and return to play in professional sports [^6289e423]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Objective

This paper presents an exploratory case study focusing on the applicability and value of process mining in a professional sports healthcare setting. We explore whether process mining can be retrospectively applied to readily available data at a professional sports club (Football Club Barcelona) and whether it can be used to obtain insights related to care flows.

Design

Our study used discovery process mining to detect patterns and trends in athletes' Post-Pre-Participation Medical Evaluation injury route, encompassing five phases for analysis and interpretation.

Results

We examined preprocessed data in event log format to determine the injury status of athletes in respective baseline groups (healthy or pathological). Our analysis found a link between thigh muscle injuries and later ankle joint problems. The process model found three loops with recurring injuries, the most common of which were thigh muscle injuries. There were no differences in injury rates or the median number of days to return to play between the healthy and pathological groups.

Conclusions

This study explored the applicability and value of process mining in a professional sports healthcare setting. We established that process mining can be retrospectively applied to readily available data at a professional sports club and that this approach can be used to obtain insights related to sports healthcare flows.

### Biceps femoris and semitendinosus – teammates or competitors? New insights into hamstring injury mechanisms in male football players: a muscle functional MRI study [^c8322354]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The hamstring injury mechanism was assessed by investigating the exercise-related metabolic activity characteristics of the hamstring muscles using a muscle functional MRI (mfMRI) protocol.

Methods

27 healthy male football players and 27 football players with a history of hamstring injuries (recovered and playing fully) underwent standardised mfMR Imaging. The mfMRI protocol consisted of a resting scan, a strenuous bilateral eccentric hamstring exercise and a postexercise scan. The exercise-related T2 increase or the signal intensity shift between both scans was used to detect differences in metabolic activation characteristics (1) between the different hamstring muscle bellies and (2) between the injury group and the control group.

Results

A more symmetrical muscle recruitment pattern corresponding to a less economic hamstring muscle activation was demonstrated in the formerly injured group (p < 0.05). The injured group also demonstrated a significantly lower strength endurance capacity during the eccentric hamstring exercise.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that the vulnerability of the hamstring muscles to football-related injury is related to the complexity and close coherence in the synergistic muscle recruitment of the biceps femoris and the semitendinosus. Discrete differences in neuromuscular coordination and activity distribution, with the biceps femoris partly having to compensate for the lack of endurance capacity of the semitendinosus, probably increase the hamstring injury risk.

### Implementation of the 2017 Berlin concussion in sport group consensus statement in contact and collision sports: a joint position statement from 11 national and international sports organisations [^7611c878]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Important considerations for return to sport

A multidisciplinary, collaborative concussion management approach is encouraged, but the final return to sport decision should be made by the team clinician or an appropriately licensed healthcare professional.

Although evidence is limited, return to sport in child athletes, whose brains are still developing, should follow a more conservative approach than adults. A more conservative approach to return to sport should be taken with the paediatric population: children should not be permitted to return to unrestricted sport in fewer than 7 days, with several organisations mandating longer periods of time for this group.

On-line symptom and cognitive self-evaluation for readiness to return to sport by athletes is strongly discouraged. Athletes should not be taking medication to treat concussion-related symptoms when performing cognitive tests or returning to sport. Computerised neurocognitive test batteries (eg, CogState Sport, ImPACT) have cost implications, especially at community level, and should not take precedence over programmes to provide clinical care. Computerised batteries should not be used as the sole criterion for return to sport decision-making. Neurocognitive test batteries need to be interpreted as part of a comprehensive clinical evaluation — preferably by a neuropsychologist, when available.

Independence in the concussion management process

Many factors can complicate presentation, diagnosis and recovery from concussion, making additional medical opinions valuable in concussion management. In addition, television coverage and commentary of injuries in collision sport and the high profile of concussion as a public health issue, has placed medical management and return to sport decisions under increased scrutiny. Because of this, auditing of concussion diagnoses and management may be useful for quality assurance, training and medicolegal purposes.

Auditing strategies currently used in different collision sports include:
Independent, unaffiliated neurological consultants who may assist with recognition of mechanisms of injury associated with potential concussion (live or on video), assist sideline concussion evaluation and follow-up on confirmed cases. The independent, unaffiliated consultant is often a neurosurgeon, neurologist, emergency medicine physician or rehabilitation medicine physician with expertise in managing traumatic brain injury.
Peer review of team doctor decisions, case-by-case follow-up and referral to an expert panel for difficult cases.
An independent concussion consultant to evaluate players in the days following injury.
Using match officials in the community g ame who, when suspecting a possible concussion, may indicate removal from sport and direct the injured athlete to enter a process of formal medical evaluation and stand-down (eg, Blue Card system in rugby union).

### Managing player load in professional rugby union: a review of current knowledge and practices [^16413616]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The loads to which professional rugby players are subjected has been identified as a concern by coaches, players and administrators. In November 2014, World Rugby commissioned an expert group to identify the physical demands and non-physical load issues associated with participation in professional rugby.

Objective

To describe the current state of knowledge about the loads encountered by professional rugby players and the implications for their physical and mental health.

Findings

The group defined 'load' as it relates to professional rugby players as the total stressors and demands applied to the players. In the 2013–2014 seasons, 40% of professional players appeared in 20 matches or more, and 5% of players appeared in 30 matches or more. Matches account for ∼5–11% of exposure to rugby-related activities (matches, team and individual training sessions) during professional competitions. The match injury rate is about 27 times higher than that in training. The working group surmised that players entering a new level of play, players with unresolved previous injuries, players who are relatively older and players who are subjected to rapid increases in load are probably at increased risk of injury. A mix of 'objective' and 'subjective' measures in conjunction with effective communication among team staff and between staff and players was held to be the best approach to monitoring and managing player loads. While comprehensive monitoring holds promise for individually addressing player loads, it brings with it ethical and legal responsibilities that rugby organisations need to address to ensure that players' personal information is adequately protected.

Conclusions

Administrators, broadcasters, team owners, team staff and the players themselves have important roles in balancing the desire to have the 'best players' on the field with the ongoing health of players. In contrast, the coaching, fitness and medical staff exert significant control over the activities, duration and intensity of training sessions. If load is a major risk factor for injury, then managing training loads should be an important element in enabling players to perform in a fit state as often as possible.

### Scheduling concurrent training 48 versus 72 h after simulated match play: effects on neuromuscular function and fatigue [^e1bf4c82]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Scheduling concurrent training (CT) during the in-season microcycle in field-based team sport is driven by prematch and postmatch recovery. This study examined the neuromuscular function, fatigue, and soreness responses to CT administered 48 h (match day (MD) + 2) versus 72 h (MD + 3) after match.

Methods

Ten male recreational-level team sport athletes were monitored daily during two 5-d microcycles, which began with a simulated match (Soccer-specific Aerobic Field Test (SAFT90)) and CT performed either 48 or 72 h after match. Maximal voluntary force, quadriceps maximum EMG, voluntary activation, muscle contractile function (evoked twitch responses), muscle soreness, and fatigue were assessed immediately before and after the SAFT90, and every 24 up to 96 h after match. Outcome measures were also assessed immediately after CT. The CT consisted of an intermittent sprint protocol and a lower limb resistance training session separated by 1 h.

Results

Immediately after the SAFT90 in both conditions, maximal voluntary force was below baseline (mean change (Δ), -14.6% ± 10.0%; P = 0.03), recovering 48 h post. Quadriceps contractile function (Δ, -31.5% ± 11.4%; P = 0.003) and voluntary activation (Δ, -8.9 ± 6.2%; P = 0.003) were also hampered after the SAFT90, recovering 24 h post in both conditions. In addition, the SAFT90 elicited elevated levels of fatigue and muscle soreness that recovered 24 h after the SAFT90 before increasing at 72 and 96 h post in the MD + 2 and MD + 3 conditions, respectively.

Conclusions

Recovery of fatigue was only observed at the end of the microcycle when CT was prescribed on MD + 2. Therefore, CT scheduled early (MD + 2) in the microcycle might avoid compromising forthcoming match preparation.

### Can clinicians and scientists explain and prevent unexplained underperformance syndrome in elite athletes: an interdisciplinary perspective and 2016 update [^f283811b]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The coach and interdisciplinary team strive to continually progress the athlete's performance year on year. In structuring the annual training programme, coaches and scientists are planning distinct periods of progressive overload coupled with recovery for anticipated performances to be delivered on fixed dates of competition in the calendar year, for example, World Championships and Olympic Games. Should the devised period of overload training be too great for a given athlete leading into a precompetition taper, or tapering insufficient for super compensation, then the window of opportunity to perform optimally has passed, or worse, a period of UUPS ensues. Peaking at major championships is a challenge, and training capacity is highly individual, with fine margins between the training dose necessary for adaptation and that which elicits maladaptation at the elite level. Thus, monitoring of the athlete's progression through periods of physical preparation (ie, microcycles and macrocycles) is crucial to understanding whether s/he is on plan (ie, performing and fatigued states managed). Ensuring that training and environmental stresses are appropriate is also crucial, recognising these will change year on year. Indeed, across the training cycle, there will be periods when the athletes training load, nutritional and psychological support require necessary adjustment (ie, optimisation) to stay on track. Such an approach requires a multidisciplinary structured monitoring programme providing knowledge of which variables to monitor (biochemical, psychological, physiological and non-exhausting physical tests, eg, five-bound test), and when to test the athlete and capture data (eg, point in the training cycle; at rest; during or after controlled exercise; in the field or laboratory), thus directing the scientist and practitioner as to when to intervene to stay on plan. An additional benefit to regular monitoring is an increase in communications between the athlete, coach and sports science team, with the data driving purposeful conversations. That said, although a proactive and preventative approach is clearly favoured and feasible with monitoring and collection of athlete data, a retrospective analysis can still inform future athlete management and refinement of the monitoring programme can be used to explain episodes of underperformance. Furthermore, obtaining a well-controlled baseline for all monitoring variables is recommended, supporting the establishment of individual athlete reference data and quantification of intraindividual variation and meaningful changes. Finally, a spectrum of monitoring variables are necessary in the athletes programme, on the basis that no single variable has proven effective at identifying UUPS in all studies(ie, athletes and sports), with the utility of certain monitoring variables resulting from differences in (but not exclusive to) biochemical individuality, gender, sport, training age, training status, and the reliability and reproducibility of the analytical approaches.

### Technical guidelines for United States – Mexico coordination on public health events of mutual interest [^ff2199d9]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Binational public health event investigations — operational coordination and resource sharing are specified as follows: the "national public health agency of the country in which the study will take place should assume the coordinating role in accordance with its jurisdiction", and "the receiving country has the prerogative of cancelling an invitation or finalizing the joint investigation of a particular public health event", with Mexico clarifying that inviting or declining collaboration "is an attribution reserved to the federal government". Resource and timeliness expectations are explicit: "Each country should be expected to provide the technical and financial support needed for its participation", and "Sharing of resources, e.g. laboratory testing, may be necessary, is highly encouraged, and should be negotiated in a timely fashion". Speed is emphasized: "The timeliness of the investigation should be accorded a high priority by both countries", and "the deployment of a team of the country where the outbreak is occurring should not be slowed by the delayed mobilization of the corresponding team from the other country; that is, the response to the event by the affected country should not be delayed pending arrival of the team of the other country".

### Deviation from the matching law reflects an optimal strategy involving learning over multiple timescales [^9df03efe]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 10
The metaplastic model of synapses (the cascade model) can capture key aspects of experimental data. a Network model. A decision is made according to the competition between the two action selection populations (G: choosing Green target; R: choosing Red target), mediated by the inhibitory population. The competition is determined by synaptic strength between the input population and the action selection populations. These synapses are plastic, and they encode the value of Green target and Red target. b The cascade model of synapses. Each synapse makes Markov transitions between states with a different strength (depressed −, or potentiated +) and plasticity (upper states are more plastic) with given probabilities, where transition probabilities are designed to be ordered as. Note that transition probabilities are logarithmically distributed so that deeper states are harder to enter, and harder to leave. In general, the number of metaplastic states (vertical states) can be more than three. Here we show three states for an illustrative purpose. c The model captures changes in matching behavior. The model was simulated in the same conditions experienced by Monkey F, according to the learning rules that allow reward-dependent transitions during experimental sessions, and transitions that incorporate forgetting during long breaks between experimental sessions. d The model also captures the tradeoff between undermatching and the variance of choice

We showed that the harvesting performance of the monkey increases when integration of reward history over much longer time scales than traditionally thought relevant is taken into account. This improvement could be significantly larger in other situations. In a two-choice task the harvesting performance varies in a rather limited range when the behavior goes from random to optimal. This is a well-known limitation which makes it difficult to establish how close the behavior is to optimal. In more complex, but perhaps more realistic, tasks that involve multiple choices and timescales, the situation could be drastically different. Imagine, for example, a task in which there are 100 different choices and only one of them is rewarded with a probability that is significantly different from zero, using a schedule similar to the one of the two-choice task that we analyzed. The rewarding targets may change over; but within a restricted fraction of targets, say 10 targets, whose locations also change on a much slower timescale. In this case long timescales contain important information about the possible rewarding targets to consider and ignoring this information would lead to a significant decrease in the performance (see Supplementary Figure 18).

### No effect of a video-based awareness program on the rate of soccer injuries [^42abfc39]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The injury rate in soccer is high, and effective injury prevention methods are needed.

Purpose

To test the effect of a video-based awareness program on the incidence of acute injuries in soccer.

Study Design

Randomized control trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

Participants were elite male soccer players from the top 2 divisions in Iceland. Fifteen of 20 teams completed the study: 7 intervention teams (127 players) and 8 control teams (144 players) chosen by random. Just before the start of the 2000 soccer season, the intervention teams were visited with an intervention program. The program included a 15-minute presentation with information on the injury risk of playing elite soccer, typical injuries, and their mechanisms. Then the players worked together in pairs and analyzed video sequences to develop preventive strategies. The 12 video sequences were selected from the previous Icelandic soccer season, representing 3 typical injury mechanisms that accounted for more than half of all incidents recorded. During the season, team physical therapists prospectively recorded all acute injuries, and coaches recorded training exposure on a special form. Injury incidence was compared between groups and between the 1999 and 2000 seasons for teams that participated in both seasons.

Results

No difference was observed in injury incidence between the intervention (6.6 ± 0.7 injuries per 1000 player hours) and control groups (6.6 ± 0.7 injuries per 1000 player hours). Furthermore, there was no difference in injury location or type.

Conclusion

The video-based injury awareness program showed no effect on injury rate.

### Planning and conducting meetings effectively, part III: keeping meetings on track [^37993742]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The attendees at a meeting have different ways in which they get information and make decisions, different personal needs, and different ways in which they participate in groups. Some have counterproductive behaviors in committee meetings, such as attacking others, talking too long but not saying much, talking too little, deliberately trying to undermine the process, bringing up unrelated issues, engaging in private conversations with others, or silencing others. The chairperson must meet all of these challenges to have a productive meeting. This article gives some tips on how to run meetings well.

### Content analysis of food and beverage marketing in global esports: sponsorships of the premier events, leagues, teams and players [^93ad79d8]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

The underlying esports structure and potential marketing outlets are key to understanding the breadth and depth of food marketing in esports. Each layer in the esports organisational structure, such as players, teams, leagues and events, provides a unique marketing outlet for brand exposure through sponsorships specifically tailored to the respective esports audience. At the macro level, esports is structured similarly to traditional sports as esports teams play video games organised into leagues and events. An esports league involves players or teams that compete in a structured order on a regular (eg, weekly) basis, typically called a season, and the league generally crowns a champion based on a win/loss ratio, points accumulated or by wins in a structured tournament. Esports leagues are present across major regions of the world; however, they are typically regional (eg, North America, Europe), and the viewership for weekly league matches tends to be lower than larger one-off esports events or worldwide championship events. Esports events can also be incorporated within an existing league system (eg, a playoff series) or can be 'one-off' special events (eg, Dorito's Bowl). An analogous example in traditional sports is the comparison between a playoff match in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and basketball at the Olympics. The NBA playoffs is an event within the premier basketball league in North America, and the Olympics is a special event for teams and players outside of a specific league system. In traditional sports, the National Football League (NFL) represents the league structure. Teams such as the Dallas Cowboys compete regularly within the NFL, similar to esports leagues. The NFL hosts special events, such as the Pro Bowl, separate from the regular league matches.

### In-match physical demands on elite Japanese rugby union players using a global positioning system [^6e6a8801]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Design

Data were collected using GPS units with built-in accelerometers during official matches from one team belonging to the Japan Rugby top league. The team played 14 matches in 2013 (4 wins–10 losses record), 16 matches in 2014 (6 wins–10 losses) and 15 matches in 2015 (4 wins–10 losses–one draw), that is, a total of 45 matches (14 wins–30 losses–one draw) over three seasons. As the Japan Rugby top league is the pre-eminent rugby competition in Japan, the data collected for this study can be said to be that of elite rugby union. We analysed the raw data from players who played full matches over three seasons and calculated the physical demands in terms of distance travelled, accelerations and impacts. We then statistically analysed these calculations for the forward and back groups and for each individual position.

Participants

Data were obtained from one team belonging to the Japan Rugby top league. The participants were 15 starting members in each match (n = 675). However, we excluded those players who did not play the full 80 min duration (ie, those who underwent substitution for any reason). A total of 298 subjects (forwards: age 27.9 ± 3.0 years, height 183.1 ± 6.3 cm and body mass 100.3 ± 7.2 kg, backs: age 27.7 ± 2.7 years, height 173.9 ± 7.8 cm and body mass 84.2 ± 11.8 kg) were used in the sample analysis.

GPS unit data from the matches were collected from dedicated teams. The objectives and possible limitations of the study were explained to potential subjects. Written consent was obtained from all subjects prior to enrolment. This research was done without patient involvement.

For α = 2, T diverges quickly from S as

We also computed the expected payoff by simulating 10000 trials of two players competing and/or cooperating by Δ in the three conditions of the game and the results matched the analytical solutions. For the intermediate and competitive conditions, for all values of Δ it is also true that (T > R > P > S) thus demonstrating that the Space Dilemma in these conditions is a continuous probabilistic form of Prisoner's Dilemma in the strong sense. For Δ > 0.4 and in all conditions the payoff for a dyad always cooperating is always higher that for one where one player is always competing and other always cooperating or if both alternate cooperation and competition (2 R > T + S), therefore for Δ > 0.4 the space dilemma is a probabilistic form of iterated prisoner's dilemma. Furthermore, for all conditions the maximum payoff for the dyad is reached for Δ = 0.25.

### Return to match running performance after a hamstring injury in elite football: a single-centre retrospective cohort study [^afb1db6e]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Methods and procedures

Research design and participants

This is a retrospective cohort study. The players of the male first team, Under21 (U21), Under19 (U19), Under18 (U18) and Under17 (U17) team during the seasons 2017–2018, 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 of a Dutch premier league club participated in the study. All players gave written informed consent before the start of the data collection. This retrospective study on usual clinical care was not considered subject to the Dutch Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (Wet Medisch wetenschappelijk Onderzoek met mensen). The study was conducted according to the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki. During these seasons, players with hamstring injuries were identified in the standardised medical database (Smartabase 2020, Fusion Sport, Australia).

Eligibility criteria

We included time-loss injuries when they were clinically diagnosed with an acute muscle injury of the posterior thigh with an absence from training or competition of at least 7 days. To prevent the reuse of pre-injury performance data, we excluded early re-injuries of these players. Early re-injuries were defined as 'an injury of the same type and at the same site as an index injury and which occurs within 2 months after a player's return to full participation from the index injury', according to the definition of Fuller et al (pg. 84). Players were excluded when the running performance data of the player was not representable due to measurement errors or unavailable 6 months before the injury or 6 months after return to play.

Patient and public involvement

Players and the public were not involved in our study's the design, conduct or reporting plans.
