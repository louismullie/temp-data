## Question

How long from exposure you are positive to hsv?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long it takes after exposure to herpes simplex virus (HSV) before a person tests "positive" on laboratory assays. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "positive" means clinically versus virologically. Then, I should verify the incubation period and when symptoms typically appear. Next, I will examine the kinetics of antibody development and the window period for seroconversion. After that, I need to check the performance and limitations of type-specific serologic tests, including false negatives and the need for confirmatory testing. Finally, I will integrate this into practical, test-specific guidance and counseling points, making sure I distinguish HSV-1 from HSV-2 where relevant.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "positive" can mean virologic detection of HSV from a lesion (PCR or culture) or serologic detection of type-specific antibodies (IgG) indicating infection. Importantly, IgM is not type-specific and is not recommended for diagnosing HSV, so I should not rely on IgM to time acquisition or to distinguish HSV-1 from HSV-2 [^114ACYkZ] [^112n45jM].

> I will now examine the incubation period and symptom onset, because that sets the earliest window for virologic detection. The incubation period after HSV exposure is typically 2 to 12 days, with lesions often appearing within that window, which means that if lesions are present, PCR from the lesion is the preferred test and can be positive during the acute episode [^113NcyTx] [^114ACYkZ].

> Wait, let me verify the antibody kinetics before I jump to conclusions about serology. Type-specific IgG antibodies generally develop within 2 to 3 weeks after infection and persist indefinitely, but early infection can yield false-negative serology, so a negative result early does not exclude infection and repeat testing is advised if suspicion remains high [^113NcyTx] [^112n45jM].

> Hold on, I should double-check the serologic window period and testing strategy. Most authoritative guidance advises that if recent HSV-2 acquisition is suspected, repeat type-specific serologic testing at about 12 weeks after the presumed exposure improves sensitivity and reduces false negatives; this 12-week interval is commonly recommended in CDC/ASTHO guidance and is echoed in HIV OI guidance for early infection scenarios [^112n45jM] [^115Eei4R].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought serology might turn positive as early as 6 weeks, but I need to reconcile that with the evidence. The USPSTF evidence review notes that serologic tests can detect antibodies typically 6 weeks to 3 months after infection, which supports a conservative approach; given variability in individual responses and test performance, the 12-week repeat testing convention remains prudent to minimize missed seroconversions [^111ZPgMb] [^112n45jM].

> Next, I should review test performance and pitfalls so I don't overinterpret a single result. HerpeSelect HSV-2 EIA has high sensitivity but lower specificity at low index values (1.1–3.0), leading to frequent false positives; confirmatory testing with a different assay (e.g. Biokit or Western blot) is recommended when the index is low, and IgM should not be used for diagnosis or timing because it is not type-specific and may be positive during recurrences [^111bAiEW] [^112n45jM].

> Let me consider HSV-1 versus HSV-2, because this affects interpretation. HSV-2 seropositivity in adults almost always reflects anogenital infection, so a type-specific HSV-2 IgG positive result indicates infection, whereas HSV-1 serology cannot distinguish oral from genital sites and has lower utility for diagnosing genital HSV-1; thus, for suspected genital HSV-1, lesion PCR is preferred to establish the diagnosis and timing of acquisition [^115GtDpx] [^114ACYkZ].

> I should confirm practical guidance for patients. If there is a concerning exposure and early serology is negative, I would advise repeating type-specific HSV-2 serology at 12 weeks and, if lesions are present, obtaining lesion PCR now; if the 12-week serology is positive, I would confirm low-index results with a second, different assay before labeling someone as infected, and I would avoid IgM testing altogether [^112n45jM] [^114UzfPS].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the answer is precise: virologic detection from a lesion can be positive within 2 to 12 days after exposure if symptomatic, whereas serologic "positivity" with type-specific IgG typically emerges by 2 to 3 weeks but may be delayed; because early serology can be falsely negative, repeat type-specific testing at 12 weeks is recommended when recent infection is suspected, and confirmatory strategies should be used to avoid false positives at low index values [^113NcyTx] [^112n45jM] [^111ZPgMb].

It takes **2–12 days** from exposure to the appearance of symptoms (incubation period) [^113NcyTx], but **2–3 weeks** for type-specific HSV antibodies to develop and be detectable by serology [^113NcyTx] [^112n45jM]. Early testing can yield false negatives; if initial serology is negative but suspicion remains, **repeat testing at 12 weeks** is recommended [^112n45jM] [^115Eei4R]. PCR from lesions is the most sensitive test during active disease, whereas serology is for retrospective diagnosis or when lesions are absent [^114ACYkZ] [^111bAiEW].

---

## Incubation period and onset of symptoms

- **Incubation period**: 2–12 days after exposure, with a median of 4 days [^113NcyTx].
- **Symptom onset**: Lesions or prodromal symptoms typically appear within this window.
- **Asymptomatic infection**: Many infections are subclinical, so absence of symptoms does not exclude infection [^1136Bhnr].

---

## Time to seroconversion and detectable antibodies

- **Seroconversion**: Type-specific IgG antibodies develop within 2–3 weeks after infection and persist lifelong [^113NcyTx] [^112n45jM].
- **Early false negatives**: Serology can be negative in the first weeks; repeat testing at 12 weeks improves sensitivity [^112n45jM] [^114UzfPS].
- **IgM testing**: Not recommended; it is not type-specific and can be positive in recurrences [^112n45jM] [^114UzfPS].

---

## Diagnostic methods and their timelines

| **Diagnostic method** | **Earliest detection** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| PCR (lesion swab) | 2–12 days | Most sensitive during active lesions; distinguishes HSV-1/2 [^114ACYkZ] [^111bAiEW] |
| Viral culture | 2–12 days | Less sensitive than PCR; slower results [^114ACYkZ] [^11569rZ7] |
| Type-specific serology (IgG) | 2–3 weeks | Detects past infection; not for acute diagnosis [^112n45jM] [^114UzfPS] |
| IgM serology | 1–2 weeks | Not recommended; poor specificity and utility [^112n45jM] [^114UzfPS] |

---

## Factors influencing time to positivity

- **Immune response**: Individual variability affects antibody timing and levels [^111w41PD].
- **Infection type**: Primary infections may seroconvert earlier than nonprimary or recurrent episodes [^notfound].
- **Test sensitivity**: Assay performance varies; low-index serology results need confirmation [^114UzfPS] [^112n45jM].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Early testing**: PCR from lesions is preferred when symptoms are present [^114ACYkZ] [^111bAiEW].
- **Delayed serology**: If early serology is negative, repeat at 12 weeks to confirm or exclude infection [^112n45jM] [^114UzfPS].
- **Counseling**: Patients should be informed about false negatives early and the need for follow-up testing [^112n45jM] [^114UzfPS].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Symptoms**: 2–12 days after exposure [^113NcyTx].
- **Serology**: 2–3 weeks for detectable antibodies; confirm at 12 weeks if early results are negative [^112n45jM] [^114UzfPS].
- **PCR**: Most sensitive during active lesions; not for retrospective diagnosis [^114ACYkZ] [^111bAiEW].
- **IgM**: Not recommended due to poor specificity and utility [^112n45jM] [^114UzfPS].

---

In sum, symptoms can appear within 2–12 days, but **serologic confirmation** typically requires 2–3 weeks; if early serology is negative, **repeat at 12 weeks** to reduce false negatives [^113NcyTx] [^112n45jM].

Individuals were defined as HSV-2 negative (unexposed) if they remained HSV-2 seronegative throughout follow-up (preferably) or were HSV-2 seronegative at baseline (for those studies in which HSV-2 testing was not done during follow-up; repeat testing that was done but not reported was noted as a possible source of reporting bias for the subsequent assessment of study quality). For full details of the search, selection criteria, and data extraction, see the appendix.

For studies measuring incident HSV-2 infection, we classified RR estimates of HIV acquisition after exposure to incident HSV-2 infection into five subcategories for timing sequence. These subcategories reflected uncertainty in the exact timing of HSV-2 and HIV seroconversion: (1) HSV-2 seroconversion was observed in a previous time interval and thus HSV-2 infection happened before HIV (definitely before); (2) HSV-2 seroconversion was observed in the same time interval as HIV seroconversion and so HSV-2 infection might have happened before or after HIV infection (indeterminably close); (3) HSV-2 seroconversion was observed in a previous or in the same time interval as HIV seroconversion (before and indeterminably close); (4a) some HSV-2 seroconversion might have occurred after HIV infection (maybe after and indeterminably close or before); and (4b) some HSV-2 seroconversion was observed after HIV infection (after and indeterminably close or before; appendix).

Two authors (KJL and JARE) did the systematic review and meta-analysis, according to PRISMAand MOOSEguidelines. Conflicts about inclusion were resolved through discussion between reviewers.

### Herpes simplex virus type 2 serological testing and psychosocial harm: a systematic review [^114Q2dY7]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Serological testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 in persons without a history of genital herpes is not recommended, partly because of concerns that an HSV-2 diagnosis would lead to negative psychosocial sequelae. This review aimed to examine the evidence regarding the psychosocial effects of HSV-2 serological testing.

Methods

Eight electronic databases were searched for empirical studies indexed before March 2010. Abstracts from relevant conferences were reviewed and senior authors contacted to find unpublished materials. Eligible studies examined participants without a history of genital herpes who underwent HSV-2 serological testing and reported data from at least one quantitative or qualitative psychosocial assessment conducted after receiving HSV results.

Results

Of nine studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria, seven reported that HSV-2 diagnosis by serological test did not have a persistent negative impact on 309 participants' mental health or sexual attitude and satisfaction. Two studies reported a negative impact of testing; one found that five HSV-2-seropositive college students had increased distress 3 months post-testing compared with HSV-2-negative individuals, and the other found self-reports of sexual undesirability up to 1 year after diagnosis in some people. The perceived severity of a genital herpes diagnosis was moderately severe for participants before testing; however, post-testing, the reported severity of a herpes diagnosis was lower among those testing HSV-2 positive.

Conclusions

HSV-2 diagnosis by type-specific serological testing did not result in long-term psychosocial harm in most persons without an identified history of genital herpes. Concerns about sustained emotional impact should not deter clinicians from offering HSV-2 serological testing to appropriate patients.

Figure 3
Sub-pooled adjusted RR estimates of the association between HIV incidence and exposure to HSV-2 infection

Estimates for effect of both prevalent and incident HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition (timing 1; ie, HSV-2 seroconversion was observed in a previous time interval and so definitely occurred before HIV seroconversion) are shown. Estimates were added for sub-pooling if they were available by subcategories, although only independent study estimates were included within a subcategory. RR = relative risk. HSV-2 = herpes simplex virus type 2. Nₑ = number of estimates. FSWs = female sex workers. MSM = men who have sex with men.

For exposure to incident HSV-2 infection, the risk of HIV acquisition was significantly higher in younger (≤ 25 years; adjusted RR 7.6, 95% CI 4.4–13.3; Nₑ = 3; I² = 0%; figure 3) than in older (> 25 years; 2.5, 1.6–3.9; Nₑ = 4; I² = 3%) individuals; however, no study estimates were available for younger individuals in higher-risk populations, whereas two of four estimates for older individuals were from higher-risk populations. The risk of HIV acquisition after exposure to incident HSV-2 infection was also significantly higher when HIV testing was done every 6 months or less (5.0, 3.1–8.1; Nₑ = 7; I² = 38%) than when tests were done at a mixture of short and long intervals (1.1, 0.4–3.1; Nₑ = 1; I² = 0%), although this analysis was based on only one study. No other significant differences were observed, although the magnitude of the association tended to be larger for women than for men. Notably, most study estimates came from women in general populations in Africa. Our subgroup analysis showed that pooled adjusted RR estimates were increased, although not significantly, when exposure to incident HSV-2 infection was known to have or might have occurred after HIV (timing 4a and 4b vs timing 1; figure 3).

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^111ZPgMb]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF genital herpes — accuracy of serologic screening tests reports that serologic tests can detect antibodies to herpes simplex virus (HSV) typically 6 weeks to 3 months after infection, and that accuracy estimates for HSV-2 tests derived largely from higher-prevalence populations limit applicability to general primary care; in 10 studies (n = 6537) using a cutpoint of 1.1, HerpeSelect showed pooled sensitivity 99% (95% CI, 97%-100%) and pooled specificity 81% (95% CI, 68%-90%), while in 4 studies (n = 1512) Biokit showed pooled sensitivity 84% (95% CI, 73%-91%) and pooled specificity 95% (95% CI, 93%-97%); in the US population the positive predictive value may be as low as 75% for Biokit and as low as 50% for HerpeSelect, and estimated declines in HSV-2 seroprevalence since 2016 likely further limit predictive value.

Another potential threat to validity was misclassification bias of the exposure to HSV-2 infection. Misclassification bias can occur if HSV-2 exposure is defined solely according to HSV-2 antibody status at baseline and some unexposed individuals seroconvert to HSV-2 during the study. Although exposure status was defined solely on baseline HSV-2 infection status in half of the studies estimating the association between prevalent HSV-2 infection and HIV acquisition, we found only weak indication that the association between HSV-2 and HIV was lower in those studies. However, in our meta-regression analyses, estimates were significantly increased for unknown definition of the unexposed comparison group, which might be a proxy for poor study quality more generally.

To minimise the risk of reverse causation, we only included longitudinal studies and categorised estimates for effect of incident HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition according to the timing of HSV-2 infection compared with HIV seroconversion. For our principal meta-analysis and meta-regression, we restricted inclusion of estimates for incident HSV-2 infection to when incident HSV-2 infection was known with greatest certainty to have occurred before HIV seroconversion (ie, timing 1), excluding any estimates for which HSV-2 infection was known to or might have occurred after HIV infection. By erring on the side of caution, we might have inadvertently excluded estimates for when HSV-2 infection occurred before HIV in studies where testing was not done sufficiently frequently to disentangle the sequence of infection. However, those estimates that included known or possible HIV infection before HSV-2 acquisition were not significantly different to our estimate for timing 1.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase between Jan 1, 2003, and May 25, 2017, to identify studies of the relative risk (RR) of HIV acquisition after exposure to HSV-2 infection either at baseline (ie, prevalent infection) or during follow-up (ie, incident infection), published since the review by Freeman and colleagues. For PubMed, we searched for articles and abstracts using the terms ("HIV", "human immunodeficiency virus", "human immunedeficiency virus", "human immune deficiency virus", OR "human immuno deficiency virus") AND ("HSV", "herpes simplex", "herpes virus type 2", "herpes virus 2", "herpesvirus 2", "genital herpes" OR "herpes genitalis"). Articles in PubMed were also searched with the Medical Subject Headings terms ("herpes simplex" OR "simplexvirus") AND ("human immunodeficiency virus", "HIV infection", "HIV antibodies", "HIV seronegativity", OR "HIV seroprevalence"). We included studies if they were a cohort study, controlled trial, or case-control study (including case-control studies nested within a cohort or controlled trial); were designed to assess the effect of preceding HSV-2 infection, compared with HSV-2 negativity, on HIV acquisition (ie, excluding case-control studies based on samples from only one point in time and studies that only looked at the effect of pre-existing HIV infection on HSV-2 acquisition); and determined the HSV-2 infection status of study participants with an antibody-type-specific assay.

Summary

Background

HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infections cause a substantial global disease burden and are epidemiologically correlated. Two previous systematic reviews of the association between HSV-2 and HIV found evidence that HSV-2 infection increases the risk of HIV acquisition, but these reviews are now more than a decade old.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase (from Jan 1, 2003, to May 25, 2017) to identify studies investigating the risk of HIV acquisition after exposure to HSV-2 infection, either at baseline (prevalent HSV-2 infection) or during follow-up (incident HSV-2 infection). Studies were included if they were a cohort study, controlled trial, or case-control study (including case-control studies nested within a cohort study or clinical trial); if they assessed the effect of pre-existing HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition; and if they determined the HSV-2 infection status of study participants with a type-specific assay. We calculated pooled random-effect estimates of the association between prevalent or incident HSV-2 infection and HIV seroconversion. We also extended previous investigations through detailed meta-regression and subgroup analyses. In particular, we investigated the effect of sex and risk group (general population vs higher-risk populations) on the relative risk (RR) of HIV acquisition after prevalent or incident HSV-2 infection. Higher-risk populations included female sex workers and their clients, men who have sex with men, serodiscordant couples, and attendees of sexually transmitted infection clinics.

Findings

We identified 57 longitudinal studies exploring the association between HSV-2 and HIV. HIV acquisition was almost tripled in the presence of prevalent HSV-2 infection among general populations (adjusted RR 2.7, 95% CI 2.2–3.4; number of estimates [Nₑ] = 22) and was roughly doubled among higher-risk populations (1.7, 1.4–2.1; N e = 25). Incident HSV-2 infection in general populations was associated with the highest risk of acquisition of HIV (4.7, 2.2–10.1; N e = 6). Adjustment for confounders at the study level was often incomplete but did not significantly affect the results. We found moderate heterogeneity across study estimates, which was explained by risk group, world region, and HSV-2 exposure type (prevalent vs incident).

Interpretation

We found evidence that HSV-2 infection increases the risk of HIV acquisition. This finding has important implications for management of individuals diagnosed with HSV-2 infection, particularly for those who are newly infected. Interventions targeting HSV-2, such as new HSV vaccines, have the potential for additional benefit against HIV, which could be particularly powerful in regions with a high incidence of co-infection.

### Epidemiology of herpes simplex virus type 2 in sub-saharan Africa: systematic review, meta-analyses, and meta-regressions [^115TzujA]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite declining HSV-2 transmission in SSA, the incidence rate is still high (Table 1), and much higher than that found elsewhere in the world. For instance, the incidence rate in the United States (< 1 per 100 person-years)is an order of magnitude lower than in SSA. The results further demonstrate that age has a profound effect in HSV-2 epidemiology — age alone accounted for 30% of the seroprevalence variation (Table 4). HSV-2 infection in SSA is typically acquired at a young age, not long after sexual debut, especially for women, manifested in rapidly increasing seroprevalence with age before plateauing at high levels by ages 40–50 (Tables 1, 3, 4, and S8).

Population risk classification is an important determinant in HSV-2 epidemiology, accounting for 13% of seroprevalence variation (Table 4). Both incidence rate and seroprevalence were much higher in specific at-risk populations, such as female sex workers (Tables 2 and 4), with both measures displaying the "classical hierarchy" of STI exposure by sexual risk behavior, seen with other STIs. Despite its prominence amongst higher-risk populations, HSV-2 infection is also widely disseminated in SSA with high levels of infection even in the lower-risk general population, in which over 25% of men and nearly 50% of women are infected (Tables 2 and 4).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115Eei4R]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Serologic testing and counseling in people with HIV — type-specific serum and point-of-care immunoglobulin G (IgG) serologic assays can be used to diagnose HSV-2 in asymptomatic individuals or those with atypical lesions, and type-specific serologic screening for HSV-2 can be considered for people with HIV with specific risk histories; early infection can yield false negative results, so repeat testing 12 weeks following suspected exposure is warranted; false positive HSV-2 enzyme immunoassay results occur particularly at low index values (1.1–3.0), and in such situations confirmatory testing with a second serologic test using a different antigen is recommended; serologic screening for HSV-1 is not useful due to high prevalence, and HSV-1 or HSV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) is not useful because IgM testing is not type-specific; a diagnosis of genital herpes should be accompanied by counseling that discusses risk of transmission to sex partners.

Counseling

Counseling of persons with genital herpes and their sex partners is crucial for management. The goals of counseling include helping patients cope with the infection and preventing sexual and perinatal transmission. Although initial counseling can be provided at the first visit, patients often benefit from learning about the chronic aspects of the disease after the acute illness subsides. Multiple resources, including Internet sites and printed materials, are available to assist patients, their partners, and clinicians who provide counseling (and).

Although the psychological effect of a serologic diagnosis of HSV-2 infection in a person with asymptomatic or unrecognized genital herpes appears minimal and transient, certain persons with HSV infection might express anxiety concerning genital herpes that does not reflect the actual clinical severity of their disease; the psychological effect of HSV infection can be substantial. Common concerns about genital herpes include the severity of initial clinical manifestations, recurrent episodes, sexual relationships and transmission to sex partners, and ability to bear healthy children.

Symptomatic HSV-2 Genital Herpes

When counseling persons with symptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes infection, the provider should discuss the following:

The natural history of the disease, with emphasis on the potential for recurrent episodes, asymptomatic viral shedding, and the attendant risks for sexual transmission of HSV to occur during asymptomatic periods (asymptomatic viral shedding is most frequent during the first 12 months after acquiring HSV-2).
The effectiveness of daily suppressive antiviral therapy for preventing symptomatic recurrent episodes of genital herpes for persons experiencing a first episode or recurrent genital herpes.
The effectiveness of daily use of valacyclovir in reducing risk for transmission of HSV-2 among persons without HIV and use of episodic therapy to shorten the duration of recurrent episodes.
The importance of informing current sex partners about genital herpes and informing future partners before initiating a sexual relationship.
The importance of abstaining from sexual activity with uninfected partners when lesions or prodromal symptoms are present.
The effectiveness of male latex condoms, which when used consistently and correctly can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk for genital herpes transmission.
The type-specific serologic testing of partners of persons with symptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes to determine whether such partners are already HSV seropositive or whether risk for acquiring HSV exists.
The low risk for neonatal HSV except when genital herpes is acquired late in pregnancy or if prodrome or lesions are present at delivery.
The increased risk for HIV acquisition among HSV-2 seropositive persons who are exposed to HIV.
The lack of effectiveness of episodic or suppressive therapy among persons with HIV infection to reduce risk for transmission to partners who might be at risk for HSV-2 acquisition.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^115f5YQi]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Natural history — Initial infection describes transmission and asymptomatic shedding of herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is typically spread by direct contact, most often from virus shed into saliva or genital secretions, and can be acquired by contact with virus-laden saliva of asymptomatic individuals, who may be a common source of transmission. After initial acquisition of HSV-1, active replication in mucosa or skin spreads through neurons to dorsal root ganglia or, in the face, the trigeminal ganglia. Some patients have symptoms during the initial acute infection but most do not, and nearly two-thirds of primary HSV infections are either unrecognized or asymptomatic.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis provided new insight into the effect of HSV-2 infection on risk of HIV acquisition by analysis of 57 longitudinal studies of different study designs. We found good evidence that HIV incidence in general populations is roughly tripled by exposure to prevalent HSV-2 infection (adjusted RR 2.7, 95% CI 2.2–3.4), with an even larger increase in HIV risk after exposure to incident HSV-2 infection (4.7, 2.2–10.1). The greater cofactor effect for incident HSV-2 infection than for prevalent HSV-2 infection might be because newly acquired HSV-2 infection is associated with an increased frequency and severity of genital ulceration, viral shedding, and inflammation in the genital tract, symptoms and manifestations that decrease with time after infection. These biological mechanisms and gradient in risk strengthen the argument for a genuine biological effect of HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition risk.

In addition to differences by prevalent versus incident HSV-2 infection, heterogeneity in the magnitude of the association across adjusted RR estimates was also explained by population risk group. The associations remained significant but were somewhat lower among higher-risk populations than among general populations, perhaps because these populations have an increased risk of HIV independent of HSV-2 or because higher-risk individuals infected with HSV-2 might be more likely to use condoms or abstain from sex when symptomatic.

The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis were generally in line with, and strengthen results from, previous meta-analyses. The 38 studies published since the last systematic search and review, and the large body of study information extracted, allowed us to comprehensively review existing evidence on the association between HSV-2 and HIV infections and assess the effects of a wide range of factors related to participant and study characteristics, including study quality, which have not been previously explored. We also produced the first pooled estimates of the association between exposure to incident HSV-2 infection and subsequent HIV acquisition.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and HIV are both lifelong infections sharing common risk factors and widely co-occur geographically. Two meta-analytic systematic reviews of longitudinal studies have been published to date and have shown the adjusted risk of HIV acquisition among individuals with prevalent HSV-2 infection to be two to three times the risk in those without. This increased risk is thought to be caused by the recruitment of activated CD4-positive T cells to the genital area, which are target cells for HIV, and breaks in the protective epithelial layer during active HSV-2 infection. However, the most recent of these reviews is now more than a decade old and only included 19 studies, limiting the scope for assessing the effect of heterogeneity and study quality. The substantial number of new studies published on the subject since then allows for more in-depth investigation, including, for the first time, quantification of the effect of exposure to incident in addition to prevalent HSV-2 infection on pooled estimates of the association with HIV acquisition. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase between Jan 1, 2003, and May 25, 2017, for studies of the association between incident or prevalent HSV-2 infection and HIV infection. Studies were included if they were a cohort study, controlled trial, or case-control study (including case-control studies nested within a cohort or controlled trial); were designed to assess the effect of preceding HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition; and used a type-specific antibody assay to determine HSV-2 infection (serostatus). 57 longitudinal studies met our inclusion criteria, which was 38 more than the last systematic search and review (by Freeman and colleagues).

HIV infection and genital herpes — immunocompromised patients can have prolonged or severe episodes of genital, perianal, or oral herpes; lesions caused by HSV are common among persons with HIV infection and might be severe, painful, and atypical; HSV shedding is increased among persons with HIV infection; whereas ART reduces the severity and frequency of symptomatic genital herpes, frequent subclinical shedding still occurs; clinical manifestations of genital herpes might worsen during immune reconstitution early after initiation of ART; and HSV-2 type-specific serologic testing can be considered for persons with HIV infection during their initial evaluation, particularly among those with a history of genital symptoms indicative of HSV infection.

INTRODUCTION

Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are important human pathogens that cause lifelong infections characterized by latent infection with cycles of viral mucosal replication. Classically, HSV infections present with episodes of recurrent, painful lesions of the oral or genital epithelium, but many infected persons remain asymptomatic. HSV is characterized by two types: HSV-1 is near-ubiquitous and infects an estimated 67% of the world's population and ~48% of adults in the United States of America. HSV-1 is associated with oral lesions but is an increasingly recognized cause of genital herpes. Conversely, HSV-2 is classically associated with genital herpes and infects approximately 13% of adults worldwide and ~12% of adults in the United States of America.

HSV infections can be diagnosed by detecting the virus itself — typically through culture or PCR — or detecting antibodies against viral proteins. The HSV lifecycle, which includes cycles of lytic and latent infection, complicates diagnosis and limits accurate PCR testing to episodes of active mucosal infection. Not all episodes of active mucosal infection are symptomatic, and high rates of asymptomatic shedding mean symptoms alone cannot be used to guide testing to prevent transmission. High-throughput, sensitive, and specific serological diagnostics are required for both clinical care and for potential screening to diagnose the vast majority of HSV infections that currently go undetected.

Epidemiology of HSV in the United States — HSV-1 seroprevalence reaches 30% by adolescence and approaches 60% in older adults. HSV-2 seroprevalence before reported onset of sexual activity is low (approximately 2%); rises to 20% to 26% in adults 30 to 40 years. It is generally regarded that HSV-1 is transmitted primarily through contact with infected oral secretions and that HSV-2 is acquired primarily through contact with infected genital secretions.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^115ykCm8]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Prevention recommendations — preventing exposure to HSV: Exposure to HSV-1 is frequent in childhood, most infections likely result from unrecognized exposure to the frequent asymptomatic shedding of HSV by individuals with prior infection despite attempts to avoid direct contact, male condoms are effective in preventing many sexually transmitted diseases including HIV, and when used consistently and correctly, male latex condoms reduce the risk of type 2 genital herpes.

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^1178v3Qb]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) serologic screening for genital herpes infection — For asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, do not routinely screen for genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection (Grade: D). This applies to routine screening of adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, without known history, signs, or symptoms of genital HSV infection; "asymptomatic" refers to persons without known past or current history of genital herpes and includes persons who may have unrecognized infection, and persons who are known to have genital herpes and are between outbreak occurrences are not considered to be asymptomatic for this recommendation. The recommendation does not apply to persons who present to clinicians requesting testing due to a history, signs, or symptoms suggestive of genital herpes or persons with HIV infection or other immunosuppressive disorders, and it is consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation. Rationale notes that routine serologic screening is limited by the low predictive value of the widely available serologic screening tests and the expected high rate of false-positive results likely to occur with routine screening of asymptomatic persons in the US; antiviral medications may provide clinical benefits to symptomatic persons but in asymptomatic persons with serologic evidence of HSV, the rationale for antiviral treatment is unclear. Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI); infection is lifelong with currently no cure for HSV infection, and neonatal herpes infection is uncommon but can result in substantial morbidity and mortality.

### Herpes simplex virus 2 infection increases HIV acquisition in men and women: systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies [^11387stR]. AIDS (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the sex-specific effect of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) on the acquisition of HIV infection.

Background

The increased number of longitudinal studies available since the last meta-analysis was published allows for the calculation of age- and sexual behaviour-adjusted relative risks (RR) separately for men and women.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies.

Methods

PubMed, Embase and relevant conference abstracts were systematically searched to identify longitudinal studies in which the relative timing of HSV-2 infection and HIV infection could be established. Where necessary, authors were contacted for separate estimates in men and women, adjusted for age and a measure of sexual behaviour. Summary adjusted RR were calculated using random-effects meta-analyses where appropriate. Studies on recent HSV-2 incidence as a risk factor for HIV acquisition were also collated.

Results

Of 19 eligible studies identified, 18 adjusted for age and at least one measure of sexual behaviour after author contact. Among these, HSV-2 seropositivity was a statistically significant risk factor for HIV acquisition in general population studies of men [summary adjusted RR, 2.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.9–3.9] and women (RR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.7–5.6), and among men who have sex with men (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2–2.4). The effect in high-risk women showed significant heterogeneity, with no overall evidence of an association.

Conclusions

Prevalent HSV-2 infection is associated with a three-fold increased risk of HIV acquisition among both men and women in the general population, suggesting that, in areas of high HSV-2 prevalence, a high proportion of HIV is attributable to HSV-2.

### Using the evidence base on genital herpes: optimising the use of diagnostic tests and information provision [^112DxaHG]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2002). Low credibility.

There have been several important advances in the range of available diagnostic tests for genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in recent years; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is emerging in routine clinical use and the potential role of type specific serological tests is currently under debate. Several large trials of prophylactic vaccines, subsequently proved to be ineffective, have expanded knowledge of the transmission and epidemiology of HSV infection. This article discusses optimal application of recent research evidence to clinical care, structured around the key issues for patients and their partners. These include acquisition and transmission of genital HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection, the natural history of genital herpes, and the role of partner notification.

Pooled adjusted RR estimates of the association between HIV incidence and exposure to HSV-2 infection

Estimates for effect of both prevalent and incident HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition (timing 1; ie, HSV-2 seroconversion was observed in a previous time interval and so definitely occurred before HIV seroconversion) are shown. Estimates are shown for women and men combined when they could not be obtained separately by sex. Multiple estimates for the same study corresponding to different study countries or areas are shown when these could not be combined or when it was not appropriate to do so (ie, countries spanning two sub-regions); however, all estimates are independent (ie, for non-overlapping study populations) within each HSV-2 exposure subcategory. N e = number of estimates. RR = relative risk. HSV-2 = herpes simplex virus type 2. *Data from these studies were obtained from.

### Indictment by association: once is not enough [^116Y8TWz]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Temporality (ie, whether the infection precedes the disease) is addressed in longitudinal cohort studies, during which specimens and clinical data are collected at intervals from individuals who are followed over time. In such studies, each participant serves as his/her own control. Discriminatory power is enhanced if the time series begins before the initial exposure of interest and includes sampling during periods of health, as well as during periods of illness. If sampling begins during the acute phase of the disease being studied, critical information about temporality can be lost; fortunately, useful information can sometimes be gleaned from serologic responses that develop in the days and weeks that follow the initial event.

A key parameter in longitudinal studies is the sampling interval. Short intervals can be highly informative but can be expensive and logistically challenging. Home- and clinically-based daily sampling protocols were developed in Seattle for studies of genital herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infections. This work has helped to redefine our concept of HSV latency from one in which periods of virologic quiescence (organismal latency) are intermittently punctuated by relatively brief periods of overt viral activity that produce visible lesions and readily transmissible virus, to the more refined understanding that, in addition to readily visible reactivations, HSV frequently asymptomatically reactivates from neuronal latency, releasing small amounts of virus on what can be a nearly continuous basis.

Extending this home-based sampling model to human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B), Zerr et al were able to follow 277 children from birth to 2 years of age by enlisting family members to collect weekly saliva specimens and maintain daily health logs. In addition to revealing a broader range of symptoms and effects due to primary HHV-6 infection, the study further demonstrated the utility and practicality of home-based specimen and data collection. Specimens and data from this study provided the foundation for the new study by Martin et al. Keys to success for such studies include identifying the right specimen to collect, training study participants to collect and ship them properly, ensuring logistical convenience for study participants, performing batch analysis of specimens, and capturing detailed health diaries relevant to the agent being studied.

Table 1
Description of studies and RR estimates of the association between HIV incidence and exposure to HSV-2 infection by participant and study characteristics

39 studies reported 55 adjusted RR estimates for our primary outcome: HIV acquisition after exposure to prevalent or incident HSV-2 infection (timing of HSV-2 infection definitely before HIV infection) among general and higher-risk populations, by sex (figure 2). No significant differences were seen in the associations among general populations by sex. The overall pooled adjusted RR for general populations was 2.7 (95% CI 2.2–3.4; Nₑ = 22; I² = 59%) for exposure to prevalent HSV-2 infection and 4.7 (2.2–10.1; Nₑ = 6; I² = 64%) for exposure to incident HSV-2 infection. The results for higher-risk populations were similar to those for general populations, but the magnitude of the associations was lower: the overall pooled adjusted RR estimate for higher-risk populations was 1.7 (1.4–2.1; Nₑ = 25; I² = 45%) for exposure to prevalent HSV-2 infection and 2.9 (1.7–5.0; Nₑ = 2; I² = 0%) for exposure to incident HSV-2 infection.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114UzfPS]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Type-specific serologic tests — accuracy, confirmation, and interpretation: Type-common antibody tests do not distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection; therefore, type-specific serologic assays should be requested. The sensitivity of glycoprotein G type-specific tests for detecting HSV-2 antibody varies from 80% to 98%, and in suspected recent acquisition, repeat type-specific antibody testing 12 weeks after the presumed time of acquisition is indicated. The most commonly used test, HerpeSelect HSV-2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA), often is falsely positive at low index values (1.1–3.0); one study reported an overall specificity of 57.4%, with a specificity of 39.8% for index values of 1.1–2.9. Because of the poor specificity of commercially available type-specific EIAs, particularly when index values are < 3.0, a confirmatory test (Biokit or Western blot) with a second method should be performed before test interpretation, and the HerpeSelect HSV-2 immunoblot should not be used for confirmation. If confirmatory tests are unavailable, patients should be counseled about the limitations of available testing and that false-positive results occur. Immunoglobulin M testing for HSV-1 or HSV-2 is not useful; therefore, HSV IgM testing is not recommended. Because approximately all HSV-2 infections are sexually acquired, presence of type-specific HSV-2 antibody implies anogenital infection, whereas HSV-1 serologic testing does not distinguish between oral and genital infection and typically should not be performed for diagnosing genital HSV-1 infection; in this instance, education and counseling for persons with genital HSV infections should be provided.

For antibody dynamics, "A 4-fold increase in anti-HSV IgG levels may suggest recent exposure", while "anti-HSV IgM reactivity is often absent at the time of lesion development, with IgM seroconversion occurring 1–2 weeks after infection", and commercial IgM assays "are not able to reliably distinguish between infection with HSV-1 and HSV-2 and may be falsely positive". For active lesions, "NAAT is the most sensitive, specific, and rapid test… and can detect and distinguish HSV-1/-2", with collection guidance that "a viral culture transport swab should be vigorously rubbed over the base…; the vesicle should be unroofed", noting "Older, dried, and scabbed lesions are less likely to yield positive results". "Culture and direct fluorescent antibody testing are less sensitive than NAATs", and "HSV NAATs are now considered the gold standard to diagnose HSV central nervous system disease", while "CSF should not be cultured due to poor sensitivity".

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^117KfR14]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection caused by 2 related viruses, herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2). Infection is lifelong; currently, there is no cure for HSV infection. Antiviral medications may provide clinical benefits to symptomatic persons. Transmission of HSV from a pregnant person to their infant can occur, most commonly during delivery; when genital lesions or prodromal symptoms are present, cesarean delivery can reduce the risk of transmission. Neonatal herpes infection is uncommon yet can result in substantial morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To reaffirm its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update on targeted key questions to systematically evaluate the evidence on accuracy, benefits, and harms of routine serologic screening for HSV-2 infection in asymptomatic adolescents, adults, and pregnant persons.

Population

Adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, without known history, signs, or symptoms of genital HSV infection.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms outweigh the benefits for population-based screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against routine serologic screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons. (D recommendation).

### Postnatal exposure to herpes simplex virus: to treat or not to treat? [^115HRHG4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection carries significant morbidity and mortality. In contrast to perinatal exposure, there are no clear guidelines for the management of postnatal HSV exposure. This review focuses on the risk of HSV infection following postnatal exposure and suggests an approach to management. While many infants are protected by transplacentally transferred maternal anti-HSV antibodies, infants of seronegative mothers with significant postnatal HSV exposure may be at risk of severe disease. Individual risk assessment, appropriate investigations, and empiric acyclovir treatment should be considered in postnatally exposed newborns, even if asymptomatic. In all cases, close clinical follow-up is indicated, as well as education of families on the symptoms of neonatal HSV disease. Finally, measures to reduce the risk of postnatal HSV infection should be considered, such as discouraging individuals, particularly those with a history of recurrent cold sores, from kissing newborns.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^112RqpVP]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster — diagnosis and laboratory testing — notes that zoster diagnosis might not be possible in the absence of rash and that in its classical manifestation the signs and symptoms are usually distinctive enough to make an accurate clinical diagnosis once the rash has appeared; more frequently, zoster is confused with the rash of herpes simplex virus (HSV), and the accuracy of diagnosis is lower for children and younger adults. Tzanck smears detect multinucleated giant cells but do not distinguish between infections with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and HSV; culture can take several days with false negative results, direct fluorescent antibody staining is rapid and is sensitive, and polymerase chain reaction can detect VZV DNA rapidly and sensitively though not available in all settings, with modifications able to distinguish wild-type VZV from the Oka/Merck vaccine strain. In immunocompromised persons, distinguishing chickenpox from disseminated zoster might not be possible by examination or serology, and history of VZV exposure, a dermatomal rash onset, and results of VZV antibody testing at or before rash onset might help guide the diagnosis.

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^112F4S1k]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

Based on previous evidence suggesting differential susceptibility to HIV and HSV-2 by sex, after exposure to incident HSV-2 infection, and by risk behaviour, we defined a priori that our primary outcomes would be pooled RR estimates of the association between incident HIV infection and pre-existing prevalent or incident HSV-2 infection, for both women and men and by risk group (general population vs higher-risk populations), also allowing for comparisons with previous pooled estimates. Higher-risk populations included female sex workers and their clients, men who have sex with men, serodiscordant couples, and attendees of STI clinics. No other stratification was used. To minimise biases due to reverse causation, pooled RR estimates for the association between HIV infection and exposure to incident HSV-2 infection were restricted to study estimates when HSV-2 seroconversion was definitely known to have occurred before HIV seroconversion.

To assess study quality, we used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scaleto define nine criteria assessing selection of study participants, sample representativeness, exposure or outcome ascertainment, and confounding for the extracted information about participant and study characteristics. A star was awarded for each predetermined criterion that was met (appendix). This assessment was done at the estimate level, not the study level. The effect of the number of stars awarded and other measures of study quality related to study characteristics on RR estimates was subsequently explored with meta-regression and subgroup analyses.

We investigated the effect of heterogeneity across independent RR estimates using the I² statistic. Sources of heterogeneity were explored with univariate meta-regression analysis of independent adjusted RR estimates, which estimated the fraction of the between-study variance in adjusted RR estimates (ie, R²) explained by participant characteristics (eg, world region), study characteristics (eg, study design), and study quality (eg, number of Newcastle-Ottawa Scale stars). Multivariate meta-regression analysis was also done with estimates for exposure to prevalent HSV-2 infection, but not with estimates for exposure to incident HSV-2 infection because of the small number of estimates (Nₑ). Additionally, we did separate subgroup analyses of adjusted RR estimates for the incident and prevalent HSV-2 exposures (appendix).

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^112sxFs2]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Serology — diagnostic role in herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis: Serology has a limited role in diagnosis in most cases, and HSV-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels may fluctuate such that a negative result does not absolutely rule out infection; immunoglobulin M (IgM) is found in primary HSV infection and seroconversion with IgG typically occurs 2–4 weeks after infection. Serology may be useful in children and young adults when testing shows HSV-specific IgM indicating primary infection or no antibodies (making HSV less likely), and may be useful in atypical disease. When ordering HSV serology, request both IgG and IgM for HSV-1 and HSV-2, and serial titers tested one month apart can be informative. Pros include "ease, widely available", whereas cons include "low specificity, low utility".

Asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes — when counseling persons with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes infection, asymptomatic persons who receive a diagnosis of HSV-2 by type-specific serologic testing should receive education about the symptoms of genital herpes infection; episodic and suppressive antiviral therapies are used predominantly to treat recurrences, prevent recurrences, and prevent transmission to sex partners of persons with symptomatic HSV-2 infection; for patients with serologic evidence of HSV-2 without symptomatic recurrences, neither episodic nor suppressive therapy is indicated for prevention of recurrences; among persons with asymptomatic infection, the efficacy of suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to sex partners has not been studied; and because of the decreased risk for shedding among those with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, the benefit of suppressive therapy for preventing transmission is unknown among this population.

### Knowledge of partners' genital herpes protects against herpes simplex virus type 2 acquisition [^112jHJ3W]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Prospective studies of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection in discordant couples have shown a low rate of transmission. However, unlike partners with genital herpes in prospectively monitored couples, most persons who transmit genital herpes are not aware of having the infection.

Methods

Because HSV has a short incubation period and most persons who acquire genital herpes can identify the transmitting partner, a time-to-event design was used to assess risks of HSV acquisition among patients with newly acquired genital herpes.

Results

Among 199 persons with laboratory-documented newly acquired genital herpes, the median duration of the sexual relationship with the transmitting partner was 3.5 months, and the median number of sex acts before transmission was 40. The median time to HSV-2 acquisition was greater among participants whose partners disclosed that they had genital herpes, compared with participants whose partners did not disclose their status (270 vs. 60 days; P = 0.03). In multivariate models, having a partner who disclosed that he or she had genital herpes remained a strong protective factor against genital HSV-2 acquisition (hazard ratio, 0.48 [95% confidence interval, 0.25–0.91]).

Conclusion

These findings suggest that testing persons with HSV type-specific serologic assays and encouraging disclosure may result in a decreased risk of HSV-2 transmission to sex partners.

HIV-associated HSV — considerations for starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) — Orolabial and genital HSV should not influence the decision on when to start ART in persons with HIV. Transient increases in HSV-2–associated genital ulcers have been observed during the first 6 months after initiation of ART in HIV/HSV-2 coinfected persons; in such cases, suppressive anti-HSV therapy can be considered. The frequency and severity of clinical episodes of genital herpes is often reduced in individuals after immune reconstitution on ART; however, immune reconstitution does not reduce the frequency of genital HSV shedding.

### Serologic screening for genital herpes: an updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^115XWYYE]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection. Vertical transmission of HSV can lead to fetal morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To assess the evidence on serologic screening and preventive interventions for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adults and adolescents to support the US Preventive Services Task Force for an updated recommendation statement.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and trial registries through March 31, 2016. Surveillance for new evidence in targeted publications was conducted through October 31, 2016.

Study Selection

English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing screening with no screening in persons without past or current symptoms of genital herpes; studies evaluating accuracy and harms of serologic screening tests for HSV-2; RCTs assessing preventive interventions in asymptomatic persons seropositive for HSV-2.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; pooled sensitivities and specificities of screening tests using a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve analysis when at least 3 similar studies were available.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Accuracy of screening tests, benefits of screening, harms of screening, reduction in genital herpes outbreaks.

Results

A total of 17 studies (n = 9736 participants; range, 24–3290) in 19 publications were included. No RCTs compared screening with no screening. Most studies of the accuracy of screening tests were from populations with high HSV-2 prevalence (greater than 40% based on Western blot). Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the most commonly used test at the manufacturer's cutpoint were 99% (95% CI, 97%-100%) and 81% (95% CI, 68%-90%), respectively (10 studies; n = 6537). At higher cutpoints, pooled estimates were 95% (95% CI, 91%-97%) and 89% (95% CI, 82%-93%), respectively (7 studies; n = 5516). Use of this test at the manufacturer's cutpoint in a population of 100 000 with a prevalence of HSV-2 of 16% (the seroprevalence in US adults with unknown symptom status) would result in 15 840 true-positive results and 15 960 false-positive results (positive predictive value, 50%). Serologic screening for genital herpes was associated with psychosocial harms, including distress and anxiety related to positive test results. Four RCTs compared preventive medications with placebo, 2 in nonpregnant asymptomatic adults who were HSV-2 seropositive and 2 in HSV-2-serodiscordant couples. Results in both populations were heterogeneous and inconsistent.

Conclusions and Relevance

Serologic screening for genital herpes is associated with a high rate of false-positive test results and potential psychosocial harms. Evidence from RCTs does not establish whether preventive antiviral medication for asymptomatic HSV-2 infection has benefit.

### Persistent genital herpes simplex virus-2 shedding years following the first clinical episode [^1169jm4R]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with newly acquired genital herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection have virus frequently detected at the genital mucosa. Rates of genital shedding initially decrease over time after infection, but data on long-term viral shedding are lacking.

Methods

For this study, 377 healthy adults with history of symptomatic genital HSV-2 infection collected anogenital swabs for HSV-2 DNA polymerase chain reaction for at least 30 consecutive days.

Results

Time since first genital herpes episode was significantly associated with reduced genital shedding. Total HSV shedding occurred on 33.6% of days in participants < 1 year, 20.6% in those 1–9 years, and 16.7% in those ≥ 10 years from first episode. Subclinical HSV shedding occurred on 26.2% of days among participants < 1 year, 13.1% in those 1–9 years, and 9.3% in those ≥ 10 years from first episode. On days with HSV detection, mean quantity was 4.9 log₁₀ copies/mL for those < 1 year, 4.7 log₁₀ copies/mL among those 1–9 years, and 4.6 log₁₀ copies/mL among those ≥ 10 years since first episode.

Conclusions

Rates of total and subclinical HSV-2 shedding decrease after the first year following the initial clinical episode. However, viral shedding persists at high rates and copy numbers years after infection, and therefore may pose continued risk of HSV-2 transmission to sexual partners.

It is also established that there are strong correlations between exposure and the prevalence of different STIs, such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and HIV(beyond the debated biological synergy), even though these STIs could be acquired at different time frames. As such, exposure to an STI is a predictor of exposure to another STI. For instance, HSV-2 is often used as a proxy biomarker for HIV exposure and epidemic potential. Just as STI exposures acquired at different time points are correlated with each other, it is reasonable to expect that measures of gonorrhoea prevalence assessed at different times in the same population are also correlated. This is because, fundamentally, the driving factor of STI exposure is sexual risk behaviour; current gonorrhoea infection in a population/person can be seen as a proxy of the past and present sexual risk behaviour of that population/person or person's sexual partners. Studies also show that people tend to be consistent in their sexual risk behaviour over at least a few years' duration.

### Increase in HSV shedding at initiation of antiretroviral therapy and decrease in shedding over time on antiretroviral therapy in HIV and HSV-2 infected persons [^111hnt3H]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

HIV-infected persons with chronic herpesvirus infections may experience paradoxical worsening after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), but the impact of longer term ART is unclear. We evaluated the relationships between genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) shedding and ART initiation and time on therapy in HIV and HSV-2-infected persons.

Design

Prospective observational study.

Methods

Rates of HSV shedding in 45 HIV and HSV-2-infected persons on or off ART were prospectively followed over up to three, noncontiguous, 60-day periods, during which participants performed daily genital swabs for HSV detection by real-time HSV DNA PCR and reported symptoms. Initiation or discontinuation of ART was at the discretion of participants' healthcare providers.

Results

In all, 6425 daily genital swabs were obtained from 45 persons (38 men and seven women) during 105 swabbing sessions. During the three sessions, 67, 74, and 92% of persons were on ART. HSV was detected on 26.5% of days in men and 22.3% of days in women. The overall rates of genital HSV shedding were 19.4% of days in persons not on ART, 30.2% in persons within 90 days of ART initiation, and 23.3% in persons on ART for longer than 90 days. After initiation of ART, HSV shedding decreased by 2% per month, or 23% per year (RR 0.98/month on ART; P = 0.0003 in adjusted analysis). This finding was consistent after including consideration of HIV viral load and CD4 cell count.

Conclusions

HSV shedding increased significantly shortly after ART initiation, but decreased with time on prolonged ART.

### Potential effect of HIV type 1 antiretroviral and herpes simplex virus type 2 antiviral therapy on transmission and acquisition of HIV type 1 infection [^113mMUkQ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Biological strategies for interrupting transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 should be directed at reducing infectiousness of and susceptibility to HIV-1. Potential antiretroviral interventions include reducing the likelihood of transmission of HIV-1 by reducing HIV-1 load in the blood and genital tract of HIV-1 — infected person, prophylaxis after high-risk exposure, and pre-exposure prophylaxis for very high risk populations. Antiviral treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2, the most common cause of genital ulcers, should be evaluated as a strategy for HIV-1 infection prevention by reducing infectiousness of and susceptibility to HIV-1, on the basis of biological and epidemiological data indicating that HSV-2 facilitates transmission and acquisition of HIV-1. The rationale for antiretroviral and HSV-2-specific interventions and studies to test these strategies are described.

Diagnostic Considerations

Clinical diagnosis of genital herpes can be difficult because the self-limited, recurrent, painful, and vesicular or ulcerative lesions classically associated with HSV are absent in many infected persons at the time of clinical evaluation. If genital lesions are present, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes should be confirmed by type-specific virologic testing from the lesion by NAAT or culture. Recurrences and subclinical shedding are much more frequent for HSV-2 genital herpes infection than for HSV-1 genital herpes. Therefore, prognosis and counseling depend on which HSV type is present. Type-specific serologic tests can be used to aid in the diagnosis of HSV infection in the absence of genital lesions. Both type-specific virologic and type-specific serologic tests for HSV should be available in clinical settings that provide care to persons with or at risk for STIs. HSV-2 genital herpes infection increases the risk for acquiring HIV twofold to threefold; therefore, all persons with genital herpes should be tested for HIV.

### Viral shedding 1 year following first-episode genital HSV-1 infection [^114ZoUfW]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the leading cause of first-episode genital herpes in many countries.

Objective

To inform counseling messages regarding genital HSV-1 transmission, oral and genital viral shedding patterns among persons with first-episode genital HSV-1 infection were assessed. The trajectory of the development of HSV-specific antibody and T-cell responses was also characterized.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective cohort followed up for up to 2 years, with 82 participants followed up between 2013 and 2018. Participants were recruited from sexual health and primary care clinics in Seattle, Washington. Persons with laboratory-documented first-episode genital HSV-1 infection, without HIV infection or current pregnancy, were referred for enrollment.

Exposures

First-episode genital HSV-1 infection.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Genital and oral HSV-1 shedding and lesion rates at 2 months, 11 months, and up to 2 years after initial genital HSV-1 infection. Participants self-collected oral and genital swabs for HSV polymerase chain reaction testing for 30 days at 2 and 11 months and up to 2 years after diagnosis of genital HSV-1. Blood samples were collected at serial time points to assess immune responses to HSV-1. Primary HSV-1 infection was defined as absent HSV antibody at baseline or evolving antibody profile using the University of Washington HSV Western Blot. HSV-specific T-cell responses were detected using interferon γ enzyme-linked immunospot.

Results

Among the 82 participants, the median (range) age was 26 (16–64) years, 54 (65.9%) were women, and 42 (51.2%) had primary HSV-1 infection. At 2 months, HSV-1 was detected from the genital tract in 53 participants (64.6%) and in the mouth in 24 participants (29.3%). Genital HSV-1 shedding was detected on 275 of 2264 days (12.1%) at 2 months and declined significantly to 122 of 1719 days (7.1%) at 11 months (model-predicted rate, 6.2% [95% CI, 4.3%-8.9%] at 2 months vs 3.2% [95% CI, 1.8%-5.7%] at 11 months; relative risk, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.29–0.93]). Genital lesions were rare, reported on 65 of 2497 days (2.6%) at 2 months and 72 of 1872 days (3.8%) at 11 months. Oral HSV-1 shedding was detected on 88 of 2247 days (3.9%) at 2 months. Persons with primary HSV-1 infection had a higher risk of genital shedding compared with those with nonprimary infection (model-predicted rate, 7.9% [95% CI, 5.4%-11.7%] vs 2.9% [95% CI, 1.7%-5.0%]; relative risk, 2.75 [95% CI, 1.40–5.44]). Polyfunctional HSV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were maintained during the follow-up period.

Conclusions and Relevance

Genital HSV-1 shedding was frequent after first-episode genital HSV-1, particularly among those with primary infection, and declined rapidly during the first year after infection.

Management of sex partners — sex partners of persons who have symptomatic genital herpes can benefit from evaluation and counseling; symptomatic sex partners should be evaluated and treated in the same manner as patients who have symptomatic genital herpes; asymptomatic sex partners of patients who have symptomatic genital herpes should be asked about a history of genital symptoms and offered type-specific serologic testing for HSV-2; and for partners without genital herpes, no data are available on which to base a recommendation for PEP or PrEP with antiviral medications or that they would prevent acquisition, and thus they should not be offered to patients as a prevention strategy.

### Laboratory testing for B virus… [^113USTsv]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Specimens from the exposed person and, when feasible, the associated monkey, should be collected for virus culture and serologic testing.
- Direct culture of B virus is the standard for diagnosis of infection, but PCR testing provides advantages like quicker results. Types of tests Direct culture Direct culture of B virus has been the standard for diagnosis of infection, but requires a biosafety level 4 containment facility to reduce the risk of exposure for laboratory workers. The collection of samples must be delayed until symptoms appear. The specificity of B virus serologic methods has improved substantially. However, the assays rely on specimens obtained weeks after the possible exposure. They are not useful for making decisions about treatment, which must be made soon after a person is exposed.

Specimen collection Diagnostic testing resources Obtain specimens for virus culture and serologic testing from the exposed person and, when feasible, from the associated monkey. From exposed person Use B virus serology to determine whether a patient who was B virus seronegative has begun making antibodies to B virus. When to collect serum for serologic testing
- Immediately following exposure and after appropriate cleansing protocol is complete.
- Three weeks post-exposure.
- Prior to the onset of symptoms, collect sera approximately 3 weeks apart to determine whether seroconversion to B virus infection has occurred.
- Prior to the onset of symptoms, collect sera approximately 3 weeks apart to determine whether seroconversion to B virus infection has occurred. If collecting samples for PCR testing
- Should onlybe collected if symptoms consistent with B virus disease develop. Then collection of saliva or material from blisters can be tested.
- Should notbe obtained at the time of exposure, as the act of collection could push infectious virus more deeply into the wound. Not recommendedimmediately following cleansing. This is because the sample is unlikely to contain detectable levels of virus and could lead to false negative results. From associated monkey Collect a sample of saliva for B virus PCR testing to determine whether the monkey is actively shedding B virus. A sample of serum should also be collected and tested to determine whether the monkey is seropositive for B virus.

### Risk of human immunodeficiency virus infection in herpes simplex virus type 2-seropositive persons: a meta-analysis [^114Nsdbg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

To determine the contribution of herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) infection to the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition, a systematic review of literature and data synthesis were done. Thirty-one studies addressed the risk of HIV infection in HSV-2-seropositive persons. For 9 cohort and nested case-control studies that documented HSV-2 infection before HIV acquisition, the risk estimate was 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.4–3.2). Thus, the attributable risk percentage of HIV to HSV-2 was 52%, and the population attributable risk percentage was 19% in populations with 22% HSV-2 prevalence but increased to 47% in populations with 80% HSV-2 prevalence. For 22 case-control and cross-sectional studies, the risk estimate was 3.9 (95% confidence interval, 3.1–5.1), but the temporal sequence of the 2 infections cannot be documented. Control strategies for HSV-2 need to be incorporated into control of sexually transmitted infections as a strategy for HIV prevention.

USPSTF genital herpes — risk assessment and test scope notes that the USPSTF found no evidence of externally validated, reliable risk stratification tools to identify individuals more or less likely to have genital herpes; no studies have examined the screening accuracy of HSV-2 serologic tests in pregnant persons; confirmatory testing with the highly specific Western blot is not widely available, complicating population-wide screening; and because many new genital herpes cases may be caused by HSV-1, which is highly prevalent (~48%), and serologic tests cannot determine infection site in asymptomatic persons, serologic tests are not useful for routine screening for asymptomatic genital herpes from HSV-1 infection.

USPSTF genital herpes — harms of serologic screening indicates that using the widely available HSV-2 serologic test, nearly 1 out of every 2 diagnoses in the general US primary care population could be false; a previous USPSTF review estimated that in a population of 10 000 persons with a HSV-2 prevalence of 15%, screening could yield approximately 1585 true-positive and 1445 false-positive results, and at the current US estimated prevalence of 12%, true positives would likely further decrease while false positives would likely further increase; the USPSTF concluded there may be potential social and emotional harms and harms of unnecessary preventive antiviral treatment associated with false-positive diagnoses.

### Does maternal HSV-2 coinfection increase mother-to-child transmission of HIV? A systematic review [^113nhXSg]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Details of the protocol for this systematic review were registered on PROSPERO and can be accessed at.

Study eligibility criteria

Observational studies that examined the impact of HSV-2 coinfection on HIV MTCT were considered for inclusion into this study. Specific study eligibility criteria were: (1) cohort or case–control study design; (2) the study population was mother–infant pairs, where the mother was known to be HIV-1 or HIV-2 positive; (3) maternal HSV-2 status was determined using type-specific serology, virus detection (viral culture or PCR) or clinical diagnosis and (4) perinatal HIV transmission (including in utero and/or intrapartum transmission) was a study outcome.

Predictor variables

The primary predictor of interest was HSV-2 coinfection, determined using serologic testing (Western blot or enzyme immunoassay (EIA)). Because HSV-2 infection is incurable and frequently asymptomatic, determination of HSV-2 status is most accurately ascertained through HSV type-specific serology. These tests were developed in the early 1990s, but only became widely available as research tools in the last decade. As such, we recognised that earlier research may have ascertained HSV-2 status using less sensitive strategies, including clinical diagnosis and viral culture, but may still capture information about the impact of HSV-2 infection on HIV transmission; hence these studies were still considered. Individuals who are HSV-2 seronegative at baseline may acquire HSV-2 infection during the course of a study, thus attention was paid to whether studies assessed for seroconversion.

Outcomes

The primary outcome measure of interest for this review was the relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) for perinatal HIV transmission associated with maternal HSV-2. HIV antibody tests are insufficient to diagnose neonatal HIV infection due to the passive transfer of maternal antibodies during pregnancy. Instead, virologic testing such as HIV DNA PCR is recommended at 14–21 days, 1–2 months and 4–6 months of life; testing at birth may also be warranted. Two positive tests are required for a firm diagnosis, which was the preferred outcome definition used in this review. If a child is 18 months or older, it is acceptable to diagnose HIV using a standard antibody test and Western blot, since this is the length of time for passively acquired antibodies to disappear in uninfected children exposed to HIV.

Secondary outcomes of interest included maternal HIV VL and genital tract HIV shedding, and infant CD4 count percentage and HIV VL, at author-specified time points among those with documented perinatal HIV transmission.

### An evidence based approach to testing for antibody to herpes simplex virus type 2 [^114o9Cuy]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To establish whether a simple risk scoring system, based on limited information, can reflect the variation in HSV-2 prevalence in a population, and whether a common system can be used across settings. To establish whether knowledge of a patient's score can aid the interpretation of the result from one of the commercial type specific assays.

Methods

Four previous cross sectional studies are considered, with HSV-2 antibody results by western blot or type specific ELISA tests. The clinical settings were a blood donor centre (1359 participants) and STD clinic (808 participants), London, United Kingdom, an antenatal clinic, Sydney, Australia (2317 participants), and a family medical centre, Seattle, United States (478 participants). We determined the factors associated with HSV-2 prevalence, the similarity of associations across settings, and the variation in HSV-2 prevalence by risk score.

Results

A simple scoring captured much variation in HSV-2 prevalence in each population-for example, for London blood donors, scoring based on sex, age, and number of lifetime partners, prevalence varied from 0.7% (95% CI 0.1 to 2.0) to 47.3% (37.9 to 56.6) across five risk groups. For number of lifetime partners, and sex, the association with HSV-2 varied significantly across studies.

Conclusions

A scoring system can aid test interpretation-for example, in London blood donors the post-test probability of infection following a positive result varies from around 25% to 98% across risk groups for a typical type specific assay. Further work could address whether this theoretical benefit can be realised in practice. A common risk scoring probably could not be used across settings.

General counseling and prevention points for genital herpes — male latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk for genital herpes transmission; type-specific serologic testing of partners of persons with symptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes can determine whether partners are already HSV seropositive or at risk for acquiring HSV; the risk for neonatal HSV is low except when genital herpes is acquired late in pregnancy or if prodrome or lesions are present at delivery; the risk for HIV acquisition is increased among HSV-2 seropositive persons who are exposed to HIV; and episodic or suppressive therapy among persons with HIV infection lacks effectiveness to reduce risk for transmission to partners who might be at risk for HSV-2 acquisition.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^11198QMR]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease prevention strategies in people with HIV — Prophylaxis with antiviral drugs to prevent primary HSV infection is not recommended (AIII). In clinical trials, pre-exposure prophylaxis with vaginal tenofovir gel and oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or with TDF/emtricitabine has been associated with reduced risk of HSV-2 acquisition in people without HIV, but HSV-2 seronegative people with HIV on TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at similar risk of acquiring HSV-2 as those on non-TDF-containing ART, suggesting that TDF is not effective in preventing HSV-2 acquisition in people with HIV. The dose, duration, timing, and efficacy of anti-HSV prophylaxis after known or suspected exposure to HSV have not been evaluated, and no vaccine for prevention of HSV infection is available. Some studies have shown that medical male circumcision decreased the risk of HSV-2 acquisition in African men without HIV and may be associated with decreased risk of HSV-2 transmission to female partners; however, medical male circumcision to decrease risk of HSV-2 acquisition and transmission has not been studied among men with HIV and therefore is not recommended for the sole purpose of preventing HSV acquisition (AIII).

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111qAqmy]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Genital herpes is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the United States, occurring in almost 1 in 6 persons aged 14 to 49 years. Infection is caused by 2 subtypes of the herpes simplex virus (HSV), HSV-1 and HSV-2. Antiviral medications may provide symptomatic relief from outbreaks but do not cure HSV infection. Neonatal herpes infection, while uncommon, can result in substantial morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To update the 2005 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for genital herpes.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the accuracy, benefits, and harms of serologic screening for HSV-2 infection in asymptomatic persons, including those who are pregnant, as well as the effectiveness and harms of preventive medications and behavioral counseling interventions to reduce future symptomatic episodes and transmission to others.

Findings

Based on the natural history of HSV infection, its epidemiology, and the available evidence on the accuracy of serologic screening tests, the USPSTF concluded that the harms outweigh the benefits of serologic screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including those who are pregnant.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against routine serologic screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including those who are pregnant. (D recommendation).

Diagnostic considerations — genital herpes evaluation: Clinical diagnosis of genital herpes can be difficult, and if genital lesions are present, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes should be confirmed by type-specific virologic testing from the lesion by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) or culture; type-specific serologic tests can aid diagnosis in the absence of genital lesions, and both test types should be available in clinical settings that provide care to persons with or at risk for STIs. Recurrences and subclinical shedding are much more frequent for HSV-2 genital herpes infection than for HSV-1 genital herpes. HSV-2 genital herpes infection increases the risk for acquiring HIV twofold to threefold; therefore, all persons with genital herpes should be tested for HIV.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115GtDpx]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Because approximately all HSV-2 infections are sexually acquired, presence of type-specific HSV-2 antibody implies anogenital infection. In this instance, education and counseling for persons with genital HSV infections should be provided. The presence of HSV-1 antibody alone is more difficult to interpret. HSV-1 serologic testing does not distinguish between oral and genital infection and typically should not be performed for diagnosing genital HSV-1 infection. Persons with HSV-1 antibodies often have oral HSV infection acquired during childhood, which might be asymptomatic. Lack of symptoms in a person who is HSV-1 seropositive does not distinguish anogenital from orolabial or cutaneous infection, and, regardless of site of infection, these persons remain at risk for acquiring HSV-2. In addition, HSV-1 serologic testing has low sensitivity for detection of HSV-1 antibody. However, acquisition of HSV-1 genital herpes is increasing, and HSV-1 genital herpes also can be asymptomatic. Diagnosis of HSV-1 infection is confirmed by virologic tests from genital lesions.

Type-specific HSV-2 serologic assays for diagnosing HSV-2 are useful in the following scenarios: recurrent or atypical genital symptoms or lesions with a negative HSV PCR or culture result, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes without laboratory confirmation, and a patient's partner has genital herpes. HSV-2 serologic screening among the general population is not recommended. Patients who are at higher risk for infection (e.g. those presenting for an STI evaluation, especially for persons with ≥ 10 lifetime sex partners, and persons with HIV infection) might need to be assessed for a history of genital herpes symptoms, followed by type-specific HSV serologic assays to diagnose genital herpes for those with genital symptoms.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) diagnosis in pediatric HIV exposure/infection — methods and performance — notes that virus isolation in tissue culture is readily achieved within 1 to 3 days and diagnostic yield is maximized by centrifugation with fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody staining after 24 hours, but detection of HSV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is very sensitive and specific and is the gold-standard method; direct immunofluorescence for HSV staining may have sensitivity less than 75% with results usually available the same day. For suspected HSV meningoencephalitis in children, the preferred diagnostic method is detection of HSV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with sensitivity generally considered to be > 95% for CSF samples, especially if obtained more than 3 days after onset; one study reported sensitivity of 98%, and in a report of 15 patients with proven encephalitis, CSF HSV PCR remained positive for a mean of 10 days after neurologic symptom onset. In neonatal CNS HSV disease, CSF PCR has reported sensitivity of 75% to 100% and specificity of 71% to 100%; HSV PCR of blood may be used adjunctively in neonates and other at-risk populations but its sensitivity remains to be fully defined, and definitive diagnosis of HSV esophagitis requires endoscopy with biopsy with diagnosis established by staining the biopsy with HSV-specific monoclonal antibodies and/or culture or PCR of the tissue.

Diagnosis — Varicella and herpes zoster are typically distinctive in appearance and usually can be diagnosed clinically, and varicella also can be diagnosed retrospectively by documenting seroconversion (immunoglobulin G [IgG] antibody negative to positive). In immunocompromised persons, a history of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) exposure, a rash that began with a dermatomal pattern, and VZV serologic testing to assess prior VZV infection may be helpful to distinguish disseminated herpes zoster from varicella. When lesions are atypical or difficult to distinguish from other etiologies (including herpes simplex virus [HSV]), swabs of vesicular fluid from a fresh lesion or tissue biopsies can be submitted for viral culture, direct fluorescent antigen testing, or polymerase chain reaction assays; viral culture and direct fluorescent antigen testing are often useful for confirming varicella, polymerase chain reaction assays are useful for confirming varicella and herpes zoster from lesion swabs, and CSF VZV PCR can help confirm the diagnosis of central nervous system involvement.

In clinical trials, pre-exposure prophylaxis with vaginal tenofovir gel and oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or with TDF/emtricitabine has been associated with reduced risk of HSV-2 acquisition in persons without HIV, but HSV-2 seronegative persons with HIV on TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens are at similar risk of acquiring HSV-2 as those on non-TDF containing ART regimens, suggesting that TDF is not effective in preventing HSV-2 acquisition in persons with HIV infection. The dose, duration, timing, and efficacy of anti-HSV prophylaxis after known or suspected exposure to HSV has not been evaluated, and no vaccine for prevention of HSV infection is available. Some studies have shown that medical male circumcision (MMC) decreased the risk of HSV-2 acquisition in African men without HIV and may be associated with decreased risk of HSV-2 transmission to female partners; however, MMC to decrease risk of HSV-2 acquisition and transmission has not been studied among men with HIV and therefore is not recommended for the sole purpose of preventing HSV acquisition (AIII).

### Clinical correlates of index values in the focus herpeSelect ELISA for antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) [^111w41PD]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical correlates of HerpeSelect ELISA index values are poorly understood.

Objectives

This study was designed to determine the effects of time of infection, test variability, and antibody avidity on index values.

Study Design

Sera (N = 313) from 81 patients with new HSV-2 infections and 236 sera from 32 patients with long-standing (median 11.3 years) HSV-2 were tested by HerpeSelect HSV-2 ELISA. High positive, low positive and negative controls were run on 42 test plates to establish test variability.

Results

Index values tended to rise after infection, peaking a median of 9–10 weeks post-infection (range 8–323 days). Of 32 patients with established HSV-2 infections, 7 (22%) had at least one low index value (> 1.1 to ≤ 3.5), and one had a transient seroreversion event. Test variability of index values was substantially lower than inter- or intra-patient variability. Median antibody avidity was higher in sera with high versus low index values in established infections, but unrelated to index value in patients with early infections.

Conclusions

Index values or index value changes are not absolute indicators of early versus established HSV-2 infection or solely a function of test variability. Low antibody avidity may contribute to low index values once infection is established.

### Herpes simplex virus type 1 in Europe: systematic review, meta-analyses and meta-regressions [^112MKySQ]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

HSV-1 seroprevalence increased with age, reflecting cumulative exposure, with age alone explaining about 50% of the seroprevalence variation (table 3). This confirms the general global age pattern seen in other regions, where age typically explained half of the seroprevalence variation, with the notable exception of Africa where age explained 80% of the variation. There was also substantial difference in seroprevalence among those aged < 20 years and > 20 years (Tables 2 and 3), suggesting that older cohorts had higher exposure in their youth, compared with the current young cohort, and affirming the decreasing trend in seroprevalence in recent decades.

Seroprevalence also varied by geographical location, with Eastern and Southern Europe as well as Turkey exhibiting higher seroprevalence rates compared with Northern and Western Europe (tables 2 and 3), possibly mirroring the individual level association between HSV-1 infection and lower socioeconomic status. This within region variation has also been observed in other regions, with the exception of Africawhere the infection is homogenous and universal. Seroprevalence in Europe was also lower in men than women, in contrast with all other regions, a finding that remains to be explained. Remarkably, clinical condition and country's income (after adjustment for European subregion) as well as study characteristics, did not appear to affect seroprevalence (table 3), probably highlighting that HSV-1 is a truly general population infection.

HSV-1 (vs HSV-2) detection in genital herpes was high at 34% and increasing (table 4), similar to that observed in North America, but substantially higher than that observed in other regions. This affirms that Europe has progressed in its epidemiological transition towards less oral acquisition and more genital acquisition, and that HSV-1 infection plays an increasing role as a sexually transmitted disease. Our results also demonstrated that women are more affected by HSV-1 genital herpes than men, possibly reflecting the age gap in sexual mixing, with younger women partnering with older men, or possibly reflecting biological susceptibility differences by sex. Our results also demonstrated a much higher detection of HSV-1 in first episode genital herpes (at 49%) than in recurrent herpes (at only 10%) (tables 4 and 5), supporting the fact that HSV-2 reactivates (in the genital tract) for a longer duration than HSV-1.

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^113zeTqv]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale for serologic screening for genital herpes — The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found adequate evidence that currently available, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved serologic screening tests for HSV-2 have low specificity and a high false-positive rate for population-based screening, and there is also a lack of widely available confirmatory testing. Although serologic tests can detect the presence of HSV-1, seropositivity for HSV-1 does not indicate the site of infection, limiting usefulness of serologic testing to identify asymptomatic genital herpes. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the potential benefits of serologic screening for genital herpes in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, as no greater than small, and found adequate evidence to bound the potential harms as at least moderate. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms outweigh the benefits for population-based screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons.

### Longitudinal study of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection using viral dynamic modelling [^116dr2rR]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Rates of reactivation of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) change over time and these changes affect transmission and clinical management strategies. We conducted a longitudinal study of HSV-2 infection to quantify rates of change in HSV-2 reactivation, mucosal shedding and recurrences of genital lesions, using a newly available model of HSV within-host dynamics.

Methods

A cohort of 18 women was studied at two time periods spaced 2 years apart. The cohort provided daily mucosal swabs for HSV PCR analysis for 10 weeks during each time period and recorded recurrences in diaries. We fit the model of HSV dynamics to the mucosal shedding data using Bayesian methods to produce estimates of HSV reactivation, shedding and longitudinal rates of change. The model was validated using a separate group of 67 individuals.

Results

According to the viral dynamic modelling results, rates of HSV-2 reactivation from latency in the ganglia varied > 10-fold among the women, and were estimated to be ≥ 10% higher than rates of mucosal shedding episodes for many individuals. The mucosal shedding associated with each reactivation typically lasted 1–3 days. Reactivation frequency was estimated to be declining by three reactivations a year on average. The median number of recurrences, based on patient diaries, declined from 6.8 per year to 2.1 per year over the 2-year period.

Conclusions

Rates of HSV-2 reactivation, shedding and recurrence generally decline over time but remain high in some individuals 4–5 years after primary infection. Viral dynamic modelling provides quantification of HSV infection that cannot be obtained by other methods.

HSV-1 genital herpes — persons with virologic laboratory-documented symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes infection should be educated that the risk for recurrent genital herpes and genital shedding is lower with HSV-1 infection, compared with HSV-2 infection; because of the decreased risk for recurrences and shedding, suppressive therapy for HSV-1 genital herpes should be reserved for those with frequent recurrences; for patients with frequently recurring HSV-1 genital herpes, suppressive therapy might be considered; suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-1 transmission to sex partners has not been studied; for persons with symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes or asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, suppressive therapy can be considered for those who have substantial psychosocial distress caused by the diagnosis of genital herpes; and for women who have genital herpes, the providers who care for them during pregnancy and those who will care for their newborn infant should be informed of their infection.

Type-Specific Serologic Tests

Both type-specific and type-common antibodies to HSV develop during the first weeks after infection and persist indefinitely. The majority of available, accurate type-specific HSV serologic assays are based on the HSV-specific glycoprotein G2 (gG2) (HSV-2) and glycoprotein G1 (gG1) (HSV-1). Type-common antibody tests do not distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection; therefore, type-specific serologic assays should be requested.

Both laboratory-based assays and POC tests that provide results for HSV-2 antibodies from capillary blood or serum during a clinic visit are available. The sensitivity of glycoprotein G type-specific tests for detecting HSV-2 antibody varies from 80% to 98%; false-negative results might be more frequent at early stages of infection. Therefore, in cases of recent suspected HSV-2 acquisition, repeat type-specific antibody testing 12 weeks after the presumed time of acquisition is indicated. The most commonly used test, HerpeSelect HSV-2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA), often is falsely positive at low index values (1.1–3.0). One study reported an overall specificity of 57.4%, with a specificity of 39.8% for index values of 1.1–2.9. Because of the poor specificity of commercially available type-specific EIAs, particularly with low index values (< 3.0), a confirmatory test (Biokit or Western blot) with a second method should be performed before test interpretation. Use of confirmatory testing with the Biokit or the Western blot assays have been reported to improve accuracy of HSV-2 serologic testing. The HerpeSelect HSV-2 immunoblot should not be used for confirmation because it uses the same antigen as the HSV-2 EIA. If confirmatory tests are unavailable, patients should be counseled about the limitations of available testing before obtaining serologic tests, and health care providers should be aware that false-positive results occur. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) testing for HSV-1 or HSV-2 is not useful because IgM tests are not type specific and might be positive during recurrent genital or oral episodes of herpes. Therefore, HSV IgM testing is not recommended.

### Light microscopy, culture, molecular, and serologic methods for detection of herpes simplex virus [^11569rZ7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) cause a variety of human diseases, ranging from acute to chronic and mild to severe. The absence of curative therapy results in lifelong carriage marked by recurrent outbreaks and allows transmission of the virus to uninfected individuals. Nonspecific lesions, variable presentation, and chronic carriage necessitate the use of different laboratory testing methods appropriate for each presentation. A thorough understanding of the performance characteristics and limitations of available tests is critical for selection of the appropriate test and interpretation of results. Clinical sensitivity, specificity, and selection of the appropriate methodology is paramount to avoid misdiagnosis and guide therapy. In this article we review the different methods for detection and typing of HSV, including light microscopy, culture, serology, and nucleic acid-based tests. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each method for diagnosing HSV infection, cite performance characteristics, and review appropriate clinical uses.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for genital herpes, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain type-specific serologic testing for HSV-2 when there is higher clinical suspicion for HSV-2, such as recurrent episodes, atypical lesions, lesions with negative PCR or culture results, or HIV infection.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in adults and adolescents with HIV — diagnosis and serologic testing: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture are preferred methods for diagnosing mucocutaneous lesions potentially caused by HSV, with PCR the most sensitive method; HSV detected in genital lesions should be typed as HSV-1 or HSV-2, and recurrences are more frequent with HSV-2 than HSV-1. Type-specific serologic assays are commercially available and can be used to diagnose HSV-2 infection in asymptomatic individuals or those with atypical lesions, and type-specific serologic screening for HSV-2 for persons with HIV infection can be considered, but false positive enzyme immunoassay results occur particularly at low index values (1.1–3.5), for which confirmatory testing with a second serologic test is recommended in the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Disease Treatment Guidelines. A diagnosis of HSV-2 should be accompanied by counseling that includes discussion of transmission risk to sex partners, and screening for HSV-1 infection is not recommended.

Asymptomatic HSV-2 Genital Herpes

When counseling persons with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes infection, the provider should consider the following:

Asymptomatic persons who receive a diagnosis of HSV-2 by type-specific serologic testing (with confirmatory testing, if needed) should receive education about the symptoms of genital herpes infection (see Diagnostic Considerations).
Episodic and suppressive antiviral therapies are used predominantly to treat recurrences, prevent recurrences, and prevent transmission to sex partners of persons with symptomatic HSV-2 infection.
For patients with serological evidence of HSV-2 (with combination testing if needed) without symptomatic recurrences, neither episodic nor suppressive therapy is indicated for prevention of recurrences (see Diagnostic Considerations).
Among persons with asymptomatic infection, the efficacy of suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to sex partners has not been studied.
Because of the decreased risk for shedding among those with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, the benefit of suppressive therapy for preventing transmission is unknown among this population.

HSV-1 Genital Herpes

When counseling persons with HSV-1 genital herpes infection, the provider should consider the following:

Persons with virologic laboratory-documented symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes infection should be educated that the risk for recurrent genital herpes and genital shedding is lower with HSV-1 infection, compared with HSV-2 infection.
Because of the decreased risk for recurrences and shedding, suppressive therapy for HSV-1 genital herpes should be reserved for those with frequent recurrences.
For patients with frequently recurring HSV-1 genital herpes, suppressive therapy might be considered. Suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-1 transmission to sex partners has not been studied.

For persons with symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes or asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, suppressive therapy can be considered for those who have substantial psychosocial distress caused by the diagnosis of genital herpes. For women who have genital herpes, the providers who care for them during pregnancy and those who will care for their newborn infant should be informed of their infection (see Genital Herpes During Pregnancy).

Management of Sex Partners

The sex partners of persons who have symptomatic genital herpes can benefit from evaluation and counseling. Symptomatic sex partners should be evaluated and treated in the same manner as patients who have symptomatic genital herpes. Asymptomatic sex partners of patients who have symptomatic genital herpes should be asked about a history of genital symptoms and offered type-specific serologic testing for HSV-2. For partners without genital herpes, no data are available on which to base a recommendation for PEP or PrEP with antiviral medications or that they would prevent acquisition, and this should not be offered to patients as a prevention strategy.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1136Bhnr]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Genital herpes — epidemiology and management emphasis — Genital herpes is a chronic, lifelong viral infection, and two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV) can cause genital herpes: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Most cases of recurrent genital herpes are caused by HSV-2, and 11.9% of persons aged 14–49 years are estimated to be infected in the United States; however, an increasing proportion of anogenital herpetic infections have been attributed to HSV-1, which is especially prominent among young women and men who have sex with men (MSM). The majority of persons infected with HSV-2 have not had the condition diagnosed, many have mild or unrecognized infections but shed virus intermittently in the anogenital area; consequently, most genital herpes infections are transmitted by persons unaware that they have the infection or who are asymptomatic when transmission occurs, and management of genital HSV should address the chronic nature of the infection rather than focusing solely on treating acute episodes of genital lesions.

### Is HSV serology useful for the management of first episode genital herpes? [^111uSCtR]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2003). Low credibility.

Background

First episode genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections can be classified into three groups, primary genital herpes (no previous exposure to HSV), non-primary first episode (IgG antibody to HSV of the non-presenting type), and first episode with pre-existing IgG HSV antibodies. The use of IgM to classify first episode genital herpes has not been evaluated.

Objective

To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgM antibodies for the diagnosis of first episode genital herpes, when compared with clinical diagnosis.

Methods

Patients with a first clinical episode of genital herpes were recruited. Sera were tested for IgG antibodies to HSV-2 using an indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Equivocal results were resolved by western blot. HSV-1 IgG and IgM and HSV-2 IgM antibodies were detected using western blot.

Results

157 patients were recruited. 31 were excluded (missing data or no detectable antibodies and negative viral isolation). Therefore, 126 patients were included in the analysis. 23 (18.3%) had primary genital herpes, 34 (27.0%) non-primary first episode, and 69 (54.8%) had pre-existing genital herpes. The specificity and PPV of HSV IgM was 100%; the sensitivity was 79% and the NPV 85%.

Conclusion

IgM HSV serology may be useful in the management of some patients with first episode genital herpes and provide an indication of the source of infection. Drawbacks include the low sensitivity and NPV, lack of availability, IgM antibodies may occasionally be produced in response to recurrent infection and, finally, IgM antibodies may take up to 10 days to develop and last 7–10 days.

### Laboratory testing and diagnosis… [^113qySAA]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

From exposed person: Collection of acute and convalescent serum is advisable, and should be submitted for serologic testing. Samples for Polymerase chain reaction testing __should not__ be obtained at the time of exposure, as the act of collection could push infectious virus more deeply into the wound. Samples for PCR should be collected only if symptoms consistent with B virus disease appear, for example, appearance of blisters at or near the exposure site). From associated monkey: A sample of saliva should be collected for B virus PCR testing to determine whether the monkey is actively shedding B virus. A sample of serum should also be collected and tested to determine whether the monkey is seropositive for B virus.

The National B virus Resource Center at Georgia State University's Viral Immunology Center provides diagnostic testing, educational resources, and emergency information 24 hours a day, year round. Virus Detection and Diagnosis Immediately following exposure, and prior to the onset of symptoms, it is important to collect sera approximately 3 weeks apart to determine whether seroconversion to B virus infection has occurred. If symptoms consistent with B virus disease develop, collection of saliva or material from blisters can be tested by B virus PCR to determine whether the virus is present.
- Using B virus serology, determine whether a patient who was B virus seronegative has begun making antibodies to B virus.
- Samples for PCR should not be obtained at the time of exposure due to the possibility of forcing the virus more deeply into the wound.
- Samples for PCR are also not recommended immediately following cleansing, because the sample is unlikely to contain detectable levels of virus and could lead to false negative results.
- If symptoms develop, saliva and/or material from local blisters should be collected and tested by PCR for B virus. Diagnoses of B virus infections have been hampered because herpes simplex virus and B virus are closely related. As such, antibodies produced in response to either virus have substantial levels of cross-reactivity, which can increase the potential for both false-positive and false-negative results. The development of diagnostic methods that can reliably differentiate between HSV and B virus infection was an essential first step in advancing B virus detection for the National B virus Resource Center.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112166oi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Samples and demographics

To further examine automated HSV serology assay performance, we took advantage of a unique cohort of 1,017 persons with genital HSV infection confirmed by PCR or culture through genital herpes studies at the UW VRC from 1981 to 2019. For this study, we included samples from persons with genital herpes with PCR- or culture-confirmed HSV infection who had serological testing using the WB at least 6 months (median 5.8 years, range 6 months to 50 years) after the initial episode of genital herpes. Given the focus on genital herpes, 886 (87%) people in this cohort had PCR- or culture-confirmed HSV-2 infections, and 131 (13%) people had PCR- or culture-confirmed genital HSV-1 infections. WB results were 100% concordant with the PCR or culture results. Of the 886 people with confirmed HSV-2 genital infections, 320 (36%) also had HSV-1 antibodies detected on the WB, most likely from prior HSV-1 infection.

The VRC cohort was composed of 669 women (65.8%) and 348 men (34.2%) who provided samples between 1981 and 2019 (median 1989). Most people were white (86.3%), and the overall median age was 34.3 (range: 16–88 years, Table S2; Fig. S2).

### The kinetics of mucosal herpes simplex virus-2 infection in humans: evidence for rapid viral-host interactions [^111fjAp1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) reactivations in the genital tract are responsible for mucocutaneous lesions and transmission and manifest as discrete shedding episodes.

Methods

We analyzed duration, peak copy number, and expansion and decay rates of 1020 shedding episodes in 531 immunocompetent HSV-2-seropositive persons from whom daily swabs of genital secretions were collected.

Results

Viral quantity varied by as much as a multiple of 10 million in a single person over time. Peak episode copy number was distributed approximately evenly from 10³ through 10⁸ HSV DNA copies/mL. Median rate of increase was 10^(7.6) HSV DNA copies/day during the first 12 hours of an episode and 10⁵ copies/d from episode initiation to peak. These values depended only moderately on episode duration. Median decay rate was −10^(6.2) HSV DNA copies/d during the final 12 hours of an episode and −10^(3.6) copies/d from peak to termination. Episodes lasted a median of 3 days (interquartile range, 1–8 days). Prolonged (> 5 days) episodes were associated with nonmonotonic decay.

Conclusions

HSV-2 shedding episodes are notable for rapid expansion and decay and extreme heterogeneity of duration and viral production. The net effect of these dynamic episodes is frequent shedding at high copy numbers.

This study furthers understanding of HSV-2 acquisition and the complex link between HSV-2 and HIV-1 by providing clinical evidence for divergent and shared mechanisms of vulnerability to viral infection. The identified molecular predictors of HSV-2 risk provide targets and clinical safety endpoints for the development of preventive products. The discovered systemic and mucosal immunity patterns distinguishing incident from established HSV-2 infection should be studied in relationship to viral load and shedding.

Genital herpes, caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or type 2, is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI). Given that HSV is an incurable infection, there are important concerns about appropriate use of diagnostic tools, management of infection, prevention of transmission to sexual partners, and appropriate counseling. In preparation for updating the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) STI treatment guidelines, key questions for management of genital herpes infection were developed with a panel of experts. To answer these questions, a systematic literature review was performed, with tables of evidence including articles that would change guidance assembled. These data were used to inform recommendations in the 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines.

Herpes simplex virus — epidemiology and transmission: It is generally regarded that HSV-1 is transmitted primarily through contact with infected oral secretions and that HSV-2 is acquired primarily through contact with infected genital secretions, and among some populations of older adolescents and young adults, HSV-1 is the cause of a large proportion of first episodes of genital HSV infection. In the United States, HSV-1 seroprevalence reaches 30% by adolescence, and the seroprevalence of HSV-1 approaches 60% in older adults. HSV-2 seroprevalence before reported onset of sexual activity is low (approximately 2%); rises to 20% to 26% in adults 30 to 49 years, and among young adolescent girls a longer history of sexual activity and another sexually transmitted disease in the past 6 months was associated with HSV-2 seropositivity. Young children generally acquire HSV-1 from the oral secretions of caretakers or playmates, and salivary shedding of HSV detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in adults who are HSV-1-seropositive is frequent (9% to 30% of days).

Introduction

The significance of herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) as a risk factor for HIV is driven by the high HSV-2 prevalence worldwide and in the Sub-Saharan HIV epicentre (estimated 39.3%−83.3% in South African women). Women and men infected with HSV-2 have estimated 3-fold higher HIV acquisition. A 3.2-fold and 4.6-fold increased risk of HIV acquisition was associated with HSV-2 among 4500 Ugandan and Zimbabwean women, respectively. The same study found greater HIV acquisition with recent (within 3–21 months from a negative test) compared with prevalent HSV-2 infections in both Uganda (4.6-fold vs 2.8-fold) and Zimbabwe (8.6-fold vs 4.4-fold). These data are supported by findings of greater frequency and severity of clinically active herpes episodes after recent HSV-2 infections, which cause breaches in the epithelial layer and influx of activated immune cells, providing HIV with access to target cells. The possibility of HSV-2-initiated clinical or subclinical mucosal inflammation and innate immunity imbalancehas been proposed as additional mechanism linking these viral infections but needed validation in a large clinical study.

Biomarkers of innate immunity predicted HIV-1 risk in the Hormonal Contraceptive and Risk of HIV (HC-HIV) cohort — one of the largest prospective studies examining the role of HC in HIV acquisition among African women. Both mucosal and systemic immunity imbalances contributed to the HIV riskand aberrant cervical immunity preceded other sexually transmitted infections including HSV-2. It remained unknown whether the imbalance predisposing to HSV-2 is limited to the cervical compartment or extends to the systemic circulation and whether HSV-2 in turn may alter both mucosal and peripheral innate immunity to contribute to HIV-1 risk. We hypothesised that (1) aberrant systemic immunity concomitantly with altered cervical immunity precedes and predisposes to HSV-2 infection, (2) HSV-2 infection changes cervical and systemic innate immunity, and (3) these changes may depend on the duration of HSV-2 infection which may add to the biological explanation of the greater HIV acquisition risk in incident vs established HSV-2 infections. To address these gaps, we analysed longitudinal specimens collected by the HC-HIV study and designed analysis models based on (1) HSV-2 status by visit (negative, incident or established) and (2) HSV-2 status by participant (remained negative or HSV-2 seroconverted).
